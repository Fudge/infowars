[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:26.160]  alex jones welcome to the alex jones show on this thursday december 18th
[00:26.160 --> 00:30.160]  2014 i'm david night your host today alex is going to be joining us in the
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.000]  second hour paul joseph watson is going to be joining us at the bottom of this
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.560]  hour and we're hoping to talk to our reporters in the third hour who are in
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.360]  who are now in washington state and of course the issue there are the comments
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.000]  that blew up on our website about the m-wrap vehicle that they had as they
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.920]  were showing that off this last week a lady filmed her encounter with them
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.640]  asking them why they needed that and after they explained that it was bomb proof
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.080]  and bullet proof and she said what why do you need that here why do you need that
[01:00.080 --> 01:05.120]  here in this small town the question that people all over america are asking as
[01:05.120 --> 01:08.000]  thousands of these things are being deployed and he immediately came back
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.840]  with his programming what he had been trained with and he says well for
[01:11.840 --> 01:15.120]  constitutionalists you know we have a lot of people in this area constitutionalists
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.840]  who stockpile weapons and ammunition you know we have a lot of police who are
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.640]  stockpiling weapons and ammunition and there's a lot of people who want to know
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.600]  why why is this necessary why is the department of defense pushing this so
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.680]  we have our reporters out there there's going to be a rally protesting this in
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.520]  many locations the citizens have demanded that the police return this
[01:37.520 --> 01:41.760]  equipment to the department of defense which in virtually all cases owns it
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.520]  they're leasing it to these people at no cost except for the maintenance and
[01:47.520 --> 01:51.360]  these things are massive white elephants
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.240]  remember in india they used to if they wanted to punish somebody they gave
[01:54.240 --> 01:57.600]  them a sacred white elephant the emperor would
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.280]  and he would they would not be allowed to allow this elephant to die and of
[02:01.280 --> 02:04.480]  course the elephant would eat them out of house and home
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.160]  that's what an m-wrap is that's what an m-wrap is for the people who
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.080]  have to live with this who have to support it pay for the gas pay for the
[02:12.080 --> 02:15.840]  maintenance of this thing these were rushed into action
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.680]  by the military industrial complex didn't go through the usual kinds of
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.240]  long bidding and analysis and design cycles they rushed these in the theater
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.440]  to protect the troops in a foreign country that were getting a lot of
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.600]  roadside bombs and they are poorly designed
[02:31.600 --> 02:35.680]  and very very expensive to maintain they tried to give these things away to
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.800]  their allies they said anybody wants to come to
[02:38.800 --> 02:42.800]  afghanistan or rock to pick these things up we'll give them to you for free
[02:42.800 --> 02:48.000]  no-takers so they're pushing them on our police departments to be maintained
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.600]  at the expense of the citizens perhaps as a forward positioning
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.520]  for future martial law these things will already be in place they
[02:55.520 --> 02:58.960]  won't have to transport them to get them there we're also going to have
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.040]  some stories about a breaking twitter bomb
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.000]  asked a cop now of course on cnn don liman came out that'd be a good idea to
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.760]  get cops ideas as to uh you know uh just ask them some questions let's let's
[03:13.760 --> 03:16.000]  have some law enforcement on asking questions
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.920]  it turned into a trolling feast on twitter and so we've got some uh
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.840]  some interesting very poignant tweets some of them funny
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.400]  many of them just focusing unfortunately on the racism aspect about
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.080]  white versus black but a lot of them really do get it
[03:34.080 --> 03:37.840]  there's one that asks if i get a knock in the door no dog raid
[03:37.840 --> 03:40.960]  should i feel that i'm being attacked and invaded
[03:40.960 --> 03:44.640]  or should i just realize that it's a swat team attacking me
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.600]  and of course i'm paul joseph Watson joins us he's going to be talking about
[03:47.600 --> 03:50.960]  the article that's up on info wars dot com california highway patrol
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.000]  describes itself as quote a paramilitary organization and where they put this
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.280]  isn't a document that they give to new recruits asking
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.560]  is this job for you in other words do you want to join
[04:02.560 --> 04:05.840]  a paramilitary operation and of course the california
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.320]  is where this swat team stuff started uh with daryl gates
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.480]  couple of decades ago we saw how that played out in the rodney king riots they
[04:14.480 --> 04:17.840]  didn't use it to protect the citizens they used it to protect themselves in
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.480]  city hall we also have a very interesting comment
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.720]  that was made by john woo and an interview and of course john woo
[04:26.720 --> 04:30.160]  is the lawyer who tried to defend the bush administration's
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.240]  torture saying that you understand circumstances it would be okay for the
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.520]  president to order an innocent child's testicles to be crushed
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.680]  this guy is saying well if these cia reports are true
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.760]  then we have cia officers at legal risks we're going to talk about that
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.800]  when we come back stay with us alex jones is joining us in the second hour

[08:17.760 --> 08:22.000]  welcome to the alex jones show on this thursday december 18th 2014 i'm david
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.760]  night your host today alex will be joining us in the second hour
[08:25.760 --> 08:29.040]  paul joseph watson will be joining us at the bottom of this hour we have our
[08:29.040 --> 08:32.160]  reporters are in washington state in the spokane area
[08:32.160 --> 08:38.400]  they're there to talk to people about the recent events there with the mrap
[08:38.400 --> 08:42.320]  and paul has an article up at info wars dot com california highway patrol
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.320]  describes itself as a paramilitary organization this is an amazing
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.600]  document that came out this is something that they are giving to
[08:49.600 --> 08:53.840]  potential cadets that are going to be hired by the california highway patrol
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.640]  is this job for you and they describe themselves as they say the california
[08:58.640 --> 09:02.080]  highway patrol is often described as a paramilitary department and that's
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.600]  true the standing traditions resemble a military
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.680]  organization yes and the militarization of the police
[09:09.680 --> 09:13.440]  took some of its biggest steps under darrell gates and la
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.600]  first one to really use swat teams that's where that all began
[09:17.600 --> 09:21.200]  and what do we have today we were told swat teams are only going to be used for
[09:21.200 --> 09:25.520]  emergencies just like we're told m reps are only going to be used
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.440]  for emergencies and yet we see them being used
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.280]  over and over and over again many innocent people dying
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.840]  if somebody breaks into your home in the middle of the night do you know if it's
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.600]  a swat team or is it a home invasion many people have been killed thinking that
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.680]  they were being invaded by somebody doing a home invasion we just had a
[09:45.680 --> 09:49.440]  a young man 14 year old who defended his family
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.760]  with a pistol two guys broke into his house he shot one of them the other one
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.880]  got away the police apprehended him as we pointed out yesterday
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.160]  that's something that the sheriff dav clark in milwaukee
[10:00.160 --> 10:03.440]  has talked about told his citizens we can't be there to protect you when this
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.960]  type of thing happens so you need to arm yourself and train yourself on how to
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.200]  use a firearm that 14 year old boy had had his dad
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.520]  shot at his place of business when he was eight years old
[10:15.520 --> 10:18.560]  so he learned how to use a firearm and he protected his family
[10:18.560 --> 10:20.800]  but how do we know if we're protecting our family
[10:20.800 --> 10:24.960]  or if it's a swat team raid we've actually had a case just this last week
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.040]  where burglars broke into a house screamed that this was a
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.200]  police that it was a swat raid in other words you know freeze it's a police
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.960]  and then shot the people and robbed the house
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.360]  that's the liability that we're being exposed to if this is to protect us
[10:41.360 --> 10:44.800]  that's not protecting us we see babies getting
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.400]  flash grade flash grenades thrown into their cribs
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.680]  where is due process it's totally vanished and of course all of this is
[10:53.680 --> 10:57.200]  coming out of the wonderful war on drugs well you want to know
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.400]  there's been some good news in the war on drugs actually
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.480]  i've got this in my stack here we actually saw some
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.800]  drop in the use by teens of marijuana use this is reported by the washington
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.080]  post uh just uh two days ago this is an annual
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.120]  survey of 40 000 eighth graders tenth graders and 12th graders
[11:17.120 --> 11:20.880]  and they point out that marijuana use is down alcohol use is way down and
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.880]  cigarettes are way way down now how did this
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.400]  happen this is happening because we're getting rid
[11:28.400 --> 11:31.520]  of the war on drugs it's not because of the war on drugs
[11:31.520 --> 11:35.440]  it's by ending the war on drugs look the war on drugs
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.320]  has increased crime it's increased corruption it's increased consumption of
[11:40.320 --> 11:42.720]  drugs and of course it's increased
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.640]  incarceration of people exactly like the war the the alcohol
[11:48.640 --> 11:51.520]  prohibition the only difference is alcohol prohibition
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.280]  was done constitutionally this doesn't even have a constitutional basis why
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.880]  did we have to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol
[11:58.880 --> 12:01.920]  but we don't need one to prohibit all these other substances
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.000]  well the answer is we no longer have a federal government that even cares to
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.440]  pretend that it's operating under the constitution
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.920]  we have police who identify their enemies as constitutionalists
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.080]  so this is why now we still see this out of the washington post article they
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.080]  quote heritage foundation we still see this narrative being put out there
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.720]  relaxing marijuana laws can clearly lead to more teenage drug use it should be
[12:26.720 --> 12:30.320]  intuitively obvious to everyone that if you legalize marijuana for
[12:30.320 --> 12:32.800]  adults more children will use marijuana because the
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.280]  message is the message is dangerous will be
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.080]  blunted well you know what that isn't true that's a lie
[12:40.080 --> 12:43.600]  we can see that with these statistics but we know that that's
[12:43.600 --> 12:50.240]  not true because it has not changed use patterns over the 40 years we've had
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.720]  of the war on drugs as i pointed out it's actually
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.680]  consumption has gone up concentration of the drugs has gone up just as it did
[12:57.680 --> 13:01.120]  during alcohol prohibition the concentration of alcohol went up
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.400]  now if that doesn't make you angry enough think about the corruption that we
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.160]  face we have a story from a rt that says that a cop
[13:10.160 --> 13:13.840]  that was caught with four pounds of marijuana and this is california
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.240]  where the police are a paramilitary organization proud of it
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.680]  a cop caught with four pounds of marijuana at home
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.600]  will not be charged they're just going to uh they're not going to charge them
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.320]  with possession now four pounds is a lot of marijuana
[13:30.320 --> 13:33.440]  i remember one of the first interviews i had when i came here was with
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.640]  the new jersey weed man he was caught he was a medical marijuana
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.400]  had a medical marijuana permit out of california he went to new jersey where
[13:40.400 --> 13:42.800]  they didn't recognize that and he had with him
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.560]  a larger amount of marijuana than would be even be allowed with his
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.240]  permit for medical marijuana he had a pound of marijuana
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.400]  and he reasoned that most people didn't believe that he should be locked up
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.000]  for possession of marijuana they were trying to get him with distribution
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.360]  because they said the quantity is so high you're probably trying to sell this
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.440]  to people and he basically used jury nullification the first judge
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.200]  immediately silenced him but as he pointed out the jury had already heard it
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.800]  it was a hung jury seven wanted to acquit him five wanted to
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.400]  do what the judge wanted them to do and the next
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.240]  case because they came back after him again that judge was friendlier and he
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.560]  let him put up a card that essentially had
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.920]  the new jersey state constitution that said jurors have
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.840]  a right to judge not only the facts of a case but whether or not
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.280]  a law is reasonable whether or not the penalties are reasonable and of course
[14:35.280 --> 14:38.320]  the penalties for drug use are not reasonable when they're mandatory
[14:38.320 --> 14:41.680]  minimums sending nonviolent people to jail for decades
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.640]  he beat that 12 people acquitted him but of course the cop doesn't need jury
[14:46.640 --> 14:49.280]  nullification he's got i guess we could call it cop
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.360]  nullification uh just by being a cop he gets a pass
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.560]  now the other thing that's breaking today is of course this
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.880]  this big issue about the interview the movie that's being pulled by sony
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.360]  pictures because they're scared there's going to
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.960]  be some kind of terrorism event in the theaters
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.880]  really really are we that afraid of it
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.640]  buckley here had a had a great idea he said let's have a premiere somewhere
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.640]  of the interview and everybody can bring their guns we can have an open carry
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.240]  premiere i don't think anybody's really afraid
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.040]  of this threat from north korea but the question is really who did it
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.320]  you know when i looked at this i really didn't think that uh this was north
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.480]  korea they why would they have this kind of uh technical capability but then i
[15:34.480 --> 15:37.280]  thought well you know gooseifer was able to hack
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.840]  into the private secret emails of people like colin powell and george
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.920]  bush uh get very embarrassing information about
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.080]  them get some very important information about them and he's somebody who had
[15:50.080 --> 15:53.680]  no training whatsoever and breaking codes he didn't have
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.600]  equipment to do that he wasn't a computer science person
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.440]  he basically just did internet research on these people looked up
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.280]  birth dates and their families names and various things like that that people
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.200]  might use as passwords took guesses on those until he got into their private
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.720]  accounts and the people that were related to them and built that up and
[16:12.720 --> 16:16.480]  and got a lot of these emails second hand so it's possible that that happened
[16:16.480 --> 16:19.920]  with sony pictures but of course we've had a couple of people point out
[16:19.920 --> 16:24.080]  that maybe it was an inside job looking at who
[16:24.080 --> 16:27.840]  hacked sony pictures maybe it was north korea but maybe there was also some
[16:27.840 --> 16:30.960]  inside involvement we have an article up on info wars dot com
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.400]  who really hacked sony pictures they say it probably wasn't
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.880]  north korea and they point out that that wasn't until december 8th
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.680]  at least a week after sony pictures hack went public that the attackers started
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.080]  using the interview as leverage now there was an article that was up on
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.960]  TMZ yesterday and they said that sony
[16:52.960 --> 16:56.720]  executives are convinced that it's an inside job what they said was
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.160]  sony executives are now convinced that someone who worked for the studio is
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.080]  behind the massive hacking because no one from the outside
[17:04.080 --> 17:07.520]  could so precisely target the compromising information
[17:07.520 --> 17:10.240]  they say the strong prevailing view is that the north koreans are
[17:10.240 --> 17:13.360]  possibly involved but they could have used someone with intimate knowledge of
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.240]  the sony email system to focus and laser in on the most embarrassing
[17:18.240 --> 17:20.720]  information they said we're told people at sony who are
[17:20.720 --> 17:23.600]  investigating believe the hackers had intimate knowledge of mail systems and
[17:23.600 --> 17:26.080]  their configurations they believe the hackers have
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.920]  knowledge of internal media distribution systems internal it systems
[17:29.920 --> 17:33.680]  including human resources and payroll and they said we ought to look at people
[17:33.680 --> 17:37.520]  who have recently been laid off or fired who might have a grudge
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.480]  you know i think they maybe they ought to take a look at some of the people who
[17:40.480 --> 17:44.000]  are working with the CIA on their massive propaganda
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.440]  film that was put out by sony pictures remember zero dark 30
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.600]  it opens with a jack bauer type of torture interrogation where they get
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.760]  the information where they're going to go capture or kill
[17:57.760 --> 18:02.160]  osama bin laden lie upon lie upon lie pretending
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.600]  that torture is effective we know it's not effective
[18:05.600 --> 18:09.360]  pretending that osama bin laden was still alive and killed in action
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.200]  that was a lie as well if they're going to work with the CIA
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.160]  maybe this is the kind of thing that eventually comes out of it i would start
[18:16.160 --> 18:19.840]  looking with the people who the people who are working with the CIA on that
[18:19.840 --> 18:23.200]  project that would be my first suspect but the way that it's being used of
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.840]  course is by people like newt gingrich always trying to ramp up the
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.440]  police state understand that sopa syspa acta
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.160]  pipa all these different copyright internet control
[18:36.160 --> 18:39.600]  bills that have failed in our legislative system
[18:39.600 --> 18:42.800]  in european legislative systems they've all been struck down
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.480]  all of them had the pretense that this needed to be done to protect
[18:46.480 --> 18:49.920]  hollywood's copyrights primarily hollywood driving this
[18:49.920 --> 18:53.440]  so they've been partners with the federal government in trying to create a
[18:53.440 --> 18:56.560]  narrative that the government needs to take control of the
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.800]  internet to protect movie copyrights primarily
[19:00.800 --> 19:04.160]  that has been turned down in every one of these instances now they're going to
[19:04.160 --> 19:08.720]  try to force this on us in the near future in the trans-specific partnership
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.800]  in the transatlantic partnership that's where they have embedded it now because
[19:12.800 --> 19:15.520]  they can't get it through our elected representatives
[19:15.520 --> 19:18.640]  they're going to try to stuff it in these treaties that are going to be jammed
[19:18.640 --> 19:21.360]  down our throat that we're not allowed to see
[19:21.360 --> 19:24.640]  even our elected representatives are not allowed to see these they're being
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.160]  fast tracked they're being done in secret they have non-disclosure
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.600]  agreements even if a senator goes to take a look at it he
[19:31.600 --> 19:34.720]  can't talk about what's there but fortunately we've had this
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.080]  some details leaked by wiki leaks by some other negotiators
[19:38.080 --> 19:41.760]  we know that they're coming after total internet control
[19:41.760 --> 19:44.560]  they're using copyright violations to sell it
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.720]  and we've got pimps like newt gingrich telling us that we've had our first
[19:48.720 --> 19:51.680]  cyber war and lost it be afraid be very afraid
[19:51.680 --> 19:53.840]  we're going to be right back and we're going to talk about something else
[19:53.840 --> 19:56.240]  appears Morgan is telling us we need to be afraid of
[19:56.240 --> 20:01.200]  scorpion bombs and clay pots we'll be right back disaster is so powerful

[24:17.680 --> 24:20.720]  your host david night here in austin we're
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.640]  going to be joined in the next hour with alex jones who's on the road he's
[24:24.640 --> 24:28.160]  going to join us by phone and in the next segment we're going to be joined
[24:28.160 --> 24:31.680]  with paul joes of watson talking about uh several stories that he's got up on
[24:31.680 --> 24:35.120]  info wars dot com today one of them california highway patrol describes
[24:35.120 --> 24:40.320]  itself as a paramilitary organization we've known it for a long time
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.880]  the mask has come off and when are the gloves going to come off when are they
[24:44.880 --> 24:48.800]  going to start using the m reps against the american people
[24:48.800 --> 24:52.400]  that's the question many of us have why do they need this what's being done with
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.000]  this it is so incredibly over the top and of course
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.720]  the paramilitary paramilitarization of the militarization of the
[25:00.720 --> 25:03.840]  police has started a long time ago in california
[25:03.840 --> 25:07.440]  by la police chief darrell gates he was the one who really started these
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.560]  swat teams that are now plaguing america in an epidemic of violence the
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.920]  swat teams are every bit as bad if not worse
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.440]  than these encounters with the police that we see
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.720]  excessive use of police force this is something where no one is safe in their
[25:22.720 --> 25:25.360]  home even if you haven't done anything you're
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.880]  still not safe we see over and over again innocent people
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.800]  being swat teamed having a massive invasion of their home many of them get
[25:32.800 --> 25:35.360]  killed because they think it's a home invasion
[25:35.360 --> 25:38.800]  this is something that started in california now they're saying that they
[25:38.800 --> 25:42.640]  are paramilitary organization talking to people who might want to
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.840]  get a job with them saying is this job for you do you really want to do this
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.520]  kind of stuff you know there's a hashtag
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.360]  on twitter that started with a cnn interview from don lemon
[25:53.360 --> 25:58.640]  ask a cop and so they're asking some pretty amazing questions this is really
[25:58.640 --> 26:02.000]  taking a trolling to kind of an art form so we're
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  going to talk about that a little bit later as well
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.720]  but talking about the paramilitarization of the police we're going to have
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.160]  our reporters in washington state now with this
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.720]  mrap video that broke earlier in the week actually broke over the weekend
[26:16.720 --> 26:19.600]  they're going to be there there's a protest this weekend they're going to
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.040]  try to talk to some police there as well as to the state
[26:23.040 --> 26:25.440]  representative that we talked to yesterday on the show
[26:25.440 --> 26:28.240]  matt shea to try to get a context for what's going on there they're going to
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.800]  be joining us in the third hour now before i continue on with this
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.000]  north korea sony hack narrative and just how phony that is i want to let you
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.240]  know that we had the two-day special for the
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.520]  essential holiday pack alex has extended it even though
[26:43.520 --> 26:47.280]  expired yesterday he's hired additional staff they're working around the clock
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.200]  to try to get this out to you in time by christmas so just one more day
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.200]  we have secret 12 x2 nascent i9 and silver bullet all three
[26:55.200 --> 27:03.120]  for just 59 99 that's like 20 a bottle it's 57% off today is the very last day
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.520]  again that's our crucial nutraceutical formulas secret 12 that's b12
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.760]  secret shield x2 that's i9 and silver bullet
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.680]  that's colloidal silver so again that today is the very last day that is still
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.160]  up on info wars life dot com now as we were going to break it was
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.920]  talking about this sony pictures story and the article that's up on info wars
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.080]  dot com who really hacked sony pictures that probably wasn't north korea
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.920]  and there's a very interesting quote here in the article
[27:33.920 --> 27:38.240]  this is from extreme tech originally and they say there's a timeline of the
[27:38.240 --> 27:43.680]  hack to take into consideration the hackers managed to exfiltrate about 100
[27:43.680 --> 27:47.680]  terabytes of data from sony's network an arduous task
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.200]  that to avoid detection probably took months
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.080]  this is a tech magazine pointing this out okay
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.920]  given how long it would have taken to gain access to sony pictures
[27:57.920 --> 28:03.440]  data plus the time to exfiltrate the data i think the wheels started turning
[28:03.440 --> 28:09.920]  long before north korea ever heard about the movie called the interview
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.000]  now of course tmz pointed out and we we covered this in the last segment that
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.440]  they think that it's an inside job somebody knew exactly where to go to
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.280]  get this information and they say well maybe
[28:21.280 --> 28:24.640]  north korea was involved because they don't want to push back
[28:24.640 --> 28:28.640]  against this ridiculous narrative that is being sold by
[28:28.640 --> 28:31.920]  newt gingrich the guy that told us that we had to be very afraid of a
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.240]  nuclear bomb going off in every city that was how he always pushed back
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.160]  against rand paul against ron paul whenever ron paul in the debates
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.680]  criticized the non-ending military intervention all of these wars that make
[28:45.680 --> 28:49.200]  us far less safe they don't increase our safety they're not
[28:49.200 --> 28:52.400]  making us more safe they're not they're fighting for freedom
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.160]  they are endangering us because they're escalating tensions they're making
[28:56.160 --> 28:58.560]  enemies around the world but whenever that came up
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.960]  newt gingrich was always there to to hold the nuclear bomb in the
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.880]  city jack bauer scenario soon every country will be in complete chaos
[29:08.880 --> 29:12.400]  to save the world from falling apart and so you see
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.800]  the new world is inevitable and we have puppets just like that
[29:16.800 --> 29:19.760]  inevitable we're running for president one more time
[29:19.760 --> 29:23.200]  inevitable things are inevitably going to change
[29:23.200 --> 29:27.120]  there you go that's the north korean puppet we also have
[29:27.120 --> 29:30.880]  isis talking about scorpion bombs this is where pierce morgan went to hide out
[29:30.880 --> 29:33.520]  you know he came to america he wanted to edit our constitution
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.960]  he wanted to edit the bible all he gets to edit is a tabloid
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.960]  a tabloid selling the silly idea that we should be very afraid
[29:40.960 --> 29:44.640]  of isis's scorpion bombs where they shoot scorpions of people
[29:44.640 --> 29:48.080]  with enclave pods i think we need to come up with a new sport we could call it
[29:48.080 --> 29:52.320]  scorpion we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:29.600 --> 33:34.960]  is paul joseph watson from the uk paul hi david good to be back
[33:34.960 --> 33:38.160]  thanks for coming back now you've got an article up today we're just talking
[33:38.160 --> 33:41.040]  about one of them that we're going to cover in a few minutes here california
[33:41.040 --> 33:44.720]  highway patrol describes itself as a paramilitary organization but another
[33:44.720 --> 33:47.520]  one of the articles that you've got up let's talk about this one first you
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.520]  won't believe michelle obama's definition of racism tell us what her
[33:51.520 --> 33:55.680]  definition of racism is well david how many times have you been
[33:55.680 --> 33:59.760]  walking through a department store and you're mistaken for a member of staff
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.200]  or you mistake somebody else to be a member of staff
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.280]  yeah yeah that's happened all the time it happened to me three weeks ago
[34:07.280 --> 34:10.720]  i was looking at levi genes sorting through the different
[34:10.720 --> 34:13.840]  genes and somebody came up and said do you have this size
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.000]  you know i said i don't i don't work here we both laughed no big deal
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.120]  according to michelle obama that's racist if you're black and that happens to you
[34:23.120 --> 34:28.640]  it's racist and it basically stems from this 2011
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.640]  photo op where michelle obama went to a target store to buy lysol disinfectant
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.720]  product as if you believe that michelle obama cleans the white house
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.560]  there just there just happened to be a an ap photographer there just by
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.680]  coincidence the secret service swept the store 30 minutes beforehand
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.520]  but it was all it was all one big coincidence it wasn't a staged photo
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.920]  up at all because we the obama's never engaging that kind of behavior
[34:55.920 --> 35:01.200]  and basically she told this story subsequently about how
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.200]  a target shopper had asked michelle obama who was
[35:05.200 --> 35:10.560]  incognito she was wearing ordinary clothes trying to look like an ordinary
[35:10.560 --> 35:15.360]  person in this incident that wasn't a photo op so this target shopper asks
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.960]  michelle obama to reach for a product detergent
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.320]  to hand her the product not recognizing who michelle obama was like that would
[35:24.320 --> 35:28.160]  even matter so the first question is
[35:28.160 --> 35:31.680]  why does michelle obama think that that's even a story
[35:31.680 --> 35:35.680]  the fact that this target shopper doesn't know who she is
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.640]  well if she's going to get lysol products to clean the toilets of the
[35:38.640 --> 35:42.240]  white house i think that she's got a racism gripe with
[35:42.240 --> 35:45.200]  uh with her husband right why has he gotten her
[35:45.200 --> 35:48.640]  why has he got her cleaning the toilets of the white house i mean the whole
[35:48.640 --> 35:51.600]  narrative is absolutely absurd and of course they
[35:51.600 --> 35:55.280]  like you pointed out they're going to sweep the store they've got photographers
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.080]  there for the photo op but of course nobody recorded that incident
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.480]  well exactly and she went on letterman two years later
[36:04.480 --> 36:08.560]  and talked about this amazing story which isn't even a story
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.080]  the fact that we're even talking about it just shows how pompous she is to think
[36:12.080 --> 36:16.000]  that this is some kind of big event that somebody didn't know who she was
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.160]  so she went on letterman last year and said
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.680]  you know she quoted the person can you reach on that shelf and hand me the
[36:23.680 --> 36:27.280]  detergent and she said it was a short woman who
[36:27.280 --> 36:30.800]  couldn't reach the product so she asked michelle obama
[36:30.800 --> 36:34.560]  being tall as she is to handle the product and michelle obama said
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.120]  that was my interaction i felt so good okay that was last year
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.400]  suddenly a year later she gives an interview with people magazine
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.560]  and let's articulate the context here the headline
[36:48.560 --> 36:54.880]  of the interview is the obamas how we deal with our own racist experiences
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.040]  so it's basically michelle obama reeling off these examples of how
[36:59.040 --> 37:02.960]  herself and barack obama have been stereotyped
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.360]  and had these racist implications made against them in these different
[37:07.360 --> 37:10.000]  scenarios so one of them if you mentioned was
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.560]  obama was wearing a tuxedo somebody mistook him for a waiter at an event
[37:16.560 --> 37:21.360]  so clearly this is about racists racist experiences in their view as the
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.160]  headline tells us and then the other story was it a
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.080]  goldman sacks dinner uh that he was attending i'm sorry go ahead
[37:30.080 --> 37:34.160]  but the other story was the target story so she took this
[37:34.160 --> 37:38.480]  kind of feel-good story that she talked about on letterman just a year ago
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.800]  and turned it into this insidious undercurrent of racism basically she
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.080]  told the same story again but now the implication
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.240]  given the context of the interview was that this target shopper
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.080]  asked michelle obama for help mistaking her
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.840]  to be a target employee because she was black
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.880]  well i think she should be astonished that anybody in america would think
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.240]  that a black woman would have a job in this economy because they've really
[38:06.240 --> 38:09.840]  been hit worse than anybody else under the obama administration i think
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.920]  uh if you walk into target and you're wearing a red shirt
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.520]  somebody has kind of come up to you so don't wear a red shirt in a target
[38:17.520 --> 38:22.320]  but i don't it's just absolutely amazing uh well let's talk about this uh
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.400]  california highway patrol thing because that's very serious
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.560]  and it's just underscoring again the kind of comments that we see
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.400]  thrown in our face over and over again that they're just casually putting this
[38:34.400 --> 38:38.000]  stuff out or deliberately putting it out this way we saw in the comments earlier
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.640]  this week in washington and our reporters are there now in
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.720]  washington state and spokane uh the mrap uh
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.520]  expedition that they had going at a walmart uh showing off their toys
[38:49.520 --> 38:52.800]  they were questioned by a lady who said why you know what do you use this for
[38:52.800 --> 38:56.240]  he gave the uh told her about its capabilities and then she said why
[38:56.240 --> 38:58.640]  would you need that here and he said it's to protect us against the
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.480]  constitutionalists the people who are stockpiling weapons well
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.520]  they're the ones stockpiling weapons and they're the ones now paul who are
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.440]  bragging about the fact that they are a paramilitary organization tell us
[39:09.440 --> 39:12.240]  about that story up on info wars dot com
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.760]  yeah this is um from the official chp.gov website california highway patrol
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.120]  largest police agency in america and basically now they're using this term
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.680]  and embracing it paramilitary organization to try and recruit
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.320]  new cadets so it's actually on at least three different sections of their
[39:32.320 --> 39:35.360]  website where they say for example the california
[39:35.360 --> 39:38.960]  highway patrol is often described as a paramilitary department
[39:38.960 --> 39:42.560]  and that's true the uniform's ranks and insignia's chain of command and
[39:42.560 --> 39:47.120]  long-standing traditions resemble a military organization
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.600]  and one of their documents the all new applicants for the role of cadet have to
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.280]  fill in they say are you willing to work in a
[39:55.280 --> 39:59.680]  paramilitary organization operating under the structure chain of command
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.320]  then there's a third example recruiting america's best to be california's
[40:04.320 --> 40:07.920]  finest so this is aimed at x military personnel
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.960]  and they state quote former military personnel easily fit into chp's workforce
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.200]  and adapt well to our paramilitary work environment
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.440]  so every time rather than emphasizing you know
[40:21.440 --> 40:26.880]  upholding the oath protect and serve it's not about that it's about fitting
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.520]  into this gang culture of a paramilitary unit
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.200]  and again i don't know what's para about it i mean para means
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.480]  semi quasi whatever there's nothing that is para
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.640]  about our militarized police do we have a para
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.160]  police state i mean we can see what's going on and now
[40:46.160 --> 40:50.640]  the gloves are coming off they don't say we're a military organization because
[40:50.640 --> 40:53.120]  that would wake a few people up but they're getting
[40:53.120 --> 40:56.880]  that close to admitting that it's a police state that it's a militarized
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.120]  police state when they put this out there and of course those are the people
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.480]  that they're actively selecting out they want people
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.160]  who are going to utilize their military training
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.680]  against the american people and we know that's what they're training for as we
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.120]  talked about been talking about all week as we got a reporters who are now in
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.480]  washington state that is the narrative that has been
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.440]  fed to the police departments i know that i've been given information from a
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.040]  police uh somebody that had seen the documents where they put
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.840]  things like the bundy ranch in a timeline tying it to things like the
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.200]  oklahoma city bombing the bundy ranch and then the los
[41:35.200 --> 41:39.040]  vegas shooting just as we saw this sheriff in washington state do
[41:39.040 --> 41:41.840]  that's the narrative that they're pushing that's the kind of guilt by
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.840]  association i'm sure that uh he wouldn't want us hanging
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.400]  the uh the police brutality crimes of other police departments on him
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.720]  guilt by association and yet they do that with people who are
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.800]  constitutionalists even though these people who shot the officers in los
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.120]  vegas were ejected from the bundy ranch anybody can show up and do a photo bomb
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.600]  at a public event and of course we have the police
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.760]  putting in agent provocateurs and many public demonstrations
[42:09.760 --> 42:12.960]  so that doesn't really prove anything but they use it to demonize
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.400]  the people who are protesting at the bundy ranch with a legitimate protest
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.560]  they use it to demonize info wars as well
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.440]  yeah and i mean they were they were forced to walk that back a little bit
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.640]  when people pointed out the fact that those two
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.240]  lunatics who killed the cop and draped them with a gadston flag
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.280]  attempted to support the bundy ranch get onto the complex were turned away
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.320]  because the bundy people did a background check on them
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.120]  knew they were they had some records against them and were
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.040]  basically people they didn't want to associate with exactly why you play
[42:45.040 --> 42:48.880]  you have to be able to purge the bad guys out of your organizations frank
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.560]  serpico said the police are a cross section of society
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.840]  assuming that they're not screening specifically for militarized
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.200]  people but you know according to frank serpico for a long time it has
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.240]  been the case that they've been a cross section of society
[43:02.240 --> 43:05.040]  he said we're going to get good people and you're going to get bad people
[43:05.040 --> 43:08.800]  the question is are you going to do something about the bad people
[43:08.800 --> 43:11.840]  they did something about the bad people the bundy ranch we haven't seen
[43:11.840 --> 43:17.200]  anything done about the bad people and most of these police departments
[43:17.200 --> 43:22.000]  exactly and going back to california i mean we see this kind of militarized
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.680]  training and this military outlook with a story that we put out
[43:25.680 --> 43:29.040]  last year for example ap photo checkpoint cops
[43:29.040 --> 43:33.120]  point guns at americans heads this was a story about a
[43:33.120 --> 43:36.480]  an individual who had gotten to a firefight with police
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.240]  then hold himself up in a local suburb basically
[43:40.240 --> 43:46.720]  they set up a checkpoint fallujah style pointed guns at everybody's heads who
[43:46.720 --> 43:49.680]  went through that checkpoint you can see the photo
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.560]  they're pointing a a semi assault rifle directly at this driver's head
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.120]  looks nothing like the criminal they later caught who they were looking for
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.360]  so these these tactics are already being implemented as they were
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.360]  as this article points out after boston where you know they went house to house
[44:07.360 --> 44:10.800]  ransacking homes as ron paul pointed out
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.880]  that those scenes were in many ways more frightening than the actual boston
[44:14.880 --> 44:17.600]  marathon bombing itself the terror that was
[44:17.600 --> 44:21.360]  meted out during those house to house sieges so
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.600]  i mean as we point out in the article california highway patrol has got a lot
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.960]  of problems with corruption more than most
[44:28.960 --> 44:32.800]  so the fact that they're now not only describing themselves as a
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.120]  paramilitary unit which bizarrely a lot of people in the comment seem to be
[44:37.120 --> 44:42.400]  very comfortable with but now that openly embracing it
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.800]  enticing ex-military personnel to become police officers
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.000]  by emphasizing the fact that it's almost entirely the same as a military unit
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.080]  and if you watch for example the police training video at the bottom of this
[44:56.080 --> 45:02.080]  article i don't think people realize how police training now
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.160]  so closely resembles army basic training where they
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.560]  they frog march these officers up and down they have military instructors
[45:10.560 --> 45:13.920]  screaming in their face from two inches away
[45:13.920 --> 45:18.400]  and it really is all geared towards this us versus their mentality which is
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.440]  now what we see rolling out with this militarized police state
[45:21.440 --> 45:24.160]  yeah people can see that b-roll we've got that running
[45:24.160 --> 45:28.560]  it is really like basic training in a course uh joe biggs and i went to
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.400]  ap hill looked at the asymmetric warfare training center that was there
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.320]  it was an american city that's where they trained the military to be used as
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.480]  police that's where they trained the police to use military tactics those
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.640]  lines have blurred posse comatatus doesn't really mean anything anymore
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.240]  if the very police are the military that's the underlying assumption is that
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.080]  the civilian police are going to act differently
[45:54.080 --> 45:59.040]  than the military now they're acting and being trained by the military
[45:59.040 --> 46:02.640]  and they're acting the same way as the military and now they're even
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.720]  using the label paramilitary over and over again
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.520]  on this on the site and as you point out it was things that happened in california
[46:11.520 --> 46:16.240]  where they were doing the manhunt and pointing guns at people's heads
[46:16.240 --> 46:18.960]  it was in california that they were looking for the
[46:18.960 --> 46:22.880]  former cop who went on a shooting spree i can't remember the guy's name
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.360]  but they shot up a a car that did sorry
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.200]  chris dorner that's right they shot up a car that had a couple of white ladies
[46:31.200 --> 46:33.840]  in it i mean they're looking for a black man and they
[46:33.840 --> 46:36.800]  one black man and they shoot up a car with two white ladies in it
[46:36.800 --> 46:39.920]  i mean this is the kind of shoot from the hip
[46:39.920 --> 46:43.600]  militarization like you're talking about just like felucia as if they are in a
[46:43.600 --> 46:49.200]  foreign country as occupiers and looking for terrorists everywhere
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.200]  the story that you covered earlier this week about the beware program where
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.280]  they're assigning a threat level to individuals based on their social
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.840]  media activity and comments and purchasing history it's just amazing
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.360]  to see all of this coming together the police state the surveillance state
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.880]  the militarization of the police yeah i mean i mean bigz talks about it
[47:10.880 --> 47:14.240]  you know when when they're out in afghanistan or iraq they're part of a
[47:14.240 --> 47:17.920]  unit they don't really have much sympathy for the people they're shooting at
[47:17.920 --> 47:20.960]  because these people are trying to kill their friends
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.160]  that's i completely understand that but i don't think the same
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.960]  rule should be applied for domestic law enforcement in america
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.680]  where as he said during the dawn of manhunt they had you know joggers
[47:33.680 --> 47:38.080]  being targeted being fired upon women in cars that looked obviously nothing
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.880]  like christopher dawner so again it's it's what alex has talked about many
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.480]  times those those veterans come back from war zones
[47:46.480 --> 47:50.800]  and then they're not being told or trained properly that there's a difference
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.160]  between felucia and california so it's not so surprising that we see
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.840]  similar tactics being employed i mean in the article i talked about earlier
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.680]  with the the situation in sacramento where they were pointing assault
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.760]  rifles at people's heads at checkpoints there's actually a photo
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.200]  in that same article from iraq at a checkpoint where somebody has to show
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.800]  their papers and the the posture the manner of the
[48:16.800 --> 48:20.720]  u.s soldier in that situation he's not even holding his weapon it's just around
[48:20.720 --> 48:23.600]  his shoulder yeah he's markedly different
[48:23.600 --> 48:28.560]  from what you see in sacramento so in some cases it's it's even more intense
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.720]  than occupying forces in iraq you know there's
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.440]  the issue of divide and conquer using racism we've seen that but i think paul
[48:37.440 --> 48:41.040]  there's also the issue and i think they're really ramping this up now
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.520]  the idea that over and over again they're going to allow the cops to get away
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.080]  with over the top brutality and we see that they're never punished for this
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.600]  this really erupted in just the last day
[48:53.600 --> 48:57.520]  uh cnn's don leming had lemon had a uh
[48:57.520 --> 49:02.240]  should call him leming he had a uh some police on and he put up a twitter
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.640]  hashtag called ask a cop and it turned into this massive
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.320]  trolling fest and what it is doing is it's pitting
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.560]  the police against the public this is the ultimate divide and conquer and it's
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.320]  being done because they're not purging the bad cops
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.440]  or punishing the bad cops that are in their midst just as
[49:21.440 --> 49:26.320]  frank serpico said and it's really kind of an in-your-face attitude but it's
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.160]  very dangerous because you see this massive polarization a
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.680]  self-fulfilling prophecy even as the system is telling the police that
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.800]  everyone on the street is their enemy that they're not going to come home
[49:36.800 --> 49:41.680]  tonight if uh they don't shoot first then you have a cop who believes
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.320]  that shoots first they exonerate him and then the people get angry and that
[49:46.320 --> 49:52.240]  only verifies that propaganda in the minds of many of the cops
[49:52.240 --> 49:56.560]  exactly it's the fact that it's such a tight-knit group that they always cover
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.240]  for each other the tamia rise shooting there was a police chief
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.280]  the day before yesterday who went on mainstream media and
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.280]  said it was completely justified when it obviously wasn't that
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.160]  the kid was shot the kid with a toy pistol was shot
[50:10.160 --> 50:14.160]  within two seconds of police arriving on the scene they gave him no chance
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.640]  whatsoever to drop the weapon yeah it's this it's this justification and
[50:18.640 --> 50:22.720]  these corrupt cops being absolved every time that they're only encourages more
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.600]  corruption more criminal behavior yeah and then the tamir case
[50:27.600 --> 50:30.400]  that you're talking about that was the 12 year old and we can see the video of
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.880]  him he's playing with a BB gun just like the kid from
[50:34.880 --> 50:40.000]  christmas story and one of these ask a cop thing he says did you play with guns
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.280]  when you were a child did the cops shoot at you if not why not
[50:45.280 --> 50:49.200]  why has that changed and of course we have a story up on info wars dot com
[50:49.200 --> 50:52.160]  about the other person who was shot down holding a BB gun inside of a
[50:52.160 --> 50:55.760]  walmart where they were selling the BB gun and the cops are coming after the
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.200]  girlfriend you can see that video up on info wars dot com we'll be right back

[53:57.640 --> 54:04.640]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the U.S.
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.640]  I want to get back to Paul and ask him about this third article that's up on infowars.com.
[54:33.640 --> 54:36.640]  Help Baby Olivia survive her first Christmas.
[54:36.640 --> 54:41.640]  But before I do real quickly, Alex has extended this two-day sale now to a three-day sale.
[54:41.640 --> 54:45.640]  December the 17th was our cutoff date for getting things to people before Christmas,
[54:45.640 --> 54:50.640]  but he's added extra staff and having them work extra hours so that we can get this out.
[54:50.640 --> 54:58.640]  So we've extended this one more day. That's Secret 12, X2 nascent iodine, and Silver Bullet, all three for only $59.99.
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.640]  That's nearly $80 off of the retail price, a 57% reduction.
[55:03.640 --> 55:10.640]  That's just available today is absolutely the last day. Again, that's Secret 12, the B12 supplement, Survival Shield X2.
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.640]  That's the nascent iodine and Silver Bullet.
[55:13.640 --> 55:16.640]  Paul, let's talk about this other story that you've got up.
[55:16.640 --> 55:20.640]  Help Baby Olivia survive her first Christmas.
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.640]  This is a baby in the UK. Tell us a little bit about her story.
[55:24.640 --> 55:33.640]  Yeah, this is a baby who was born with cancer, beat cancer, and now she's been in intensive care in London for 10 months.
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.640]  She's never been in a vegetative state. She's never had a terminal or incurable disease.
[55:38.640 --> 55:46.640]  But because of the fact that this treatment is expensive, the NHS, which is government-run healthcare in England,
[55:46.640 --> 55:55.640]  is now debating withdrawing that treatment and basically allowing this baby to die within a matter of weeks.
[55:55.640 --> 56:01.640]  They're also, according to the parents, threatening to remove their access to the baby.
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.640]  They've been in intensive care with the baby. They've seen it every day for 10 months,
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.640]  but now the health authorities are saying that their access could be removed.
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.640]  The baby could be put under the custodianship of social services
[56:15.640 --> 56:21.640]  because they complained about other aspects of the health treatment taking place in the hospital.
[56:21.640 --> 56:30.640]  So it's basically a heartbreaking case. I've tried not to delve too deeply into the debate about death panels and government-run healthcare
[56:30.640 --> 56:37.640]  because in Britain, the NHS is worshiped by some kind of religious institution, merely to question it is sacrilege.
[56:37.640 --> 56:44.640]  But this is another example of how sometimes, not to say that a lot of people who work for the NHS don't do good work,
[56:44.640 --> 56:52.640]  but sometimes it just lets people down. So I'm encouraging people to support this family via their fundraiser,
[56:52.640 --> 56:57.640]  which is, you can find it on the article, Help Baby Olivia Survive Her First Christmas.
[56:57.640 --> 57:03.640]  Basically, they want to move her to a different hospital in Europe where they can continue this treatment
[57:03.640 --> 57:10.640]  because they're confident that she will recover and go on to be healthy having already beaten cancer.
[57:10.640 --> 57:16.640]  So it's an example. A lot of people are donating to charities at around this time of year,
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.640]  but most of the big establishment charities basically are corrupt. We know that.
[57:20.640 --> 57:25.640]  They steal your money. We've seen a number of stories about that Red Cross example.
[57:25.640 --> 57:29.640]  They go on forever and ever, but this is a case where you know directly where your money is going.
[57:29.640 --> 57:33.640]  It's going to the parents and it's a worthy cause.
[57:33.640 --> 57:35.640]  Yes, I would much rather give money.
[57:35.640 --> 57:36.640]  It goes deeper as well.
[57:36.640 --> 57:44.640]  Yes, I would much rather give money to an individual that I know really has a need rather than to a large institution or organization.
[57:44.640 --> 57:53.640]  And of course, it's beyond the death panels. Paul, it's really the giant bureaucracy that gets created when the government runs healthcare.
[57:53.640 --> 57:59.640]  I remember when I first started working here, you had a very bad cold that lasted for a long time.
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.640]  And Alex said, just go to the doctor. And you said, I can't go to a doctor.
[58:03.640 --> 58:10.640]  Legally cannot get medical help until I go to somebody with the National Health Service that says that I'm allowed to go to a doctor.
[58:10.640 --> 58:12.640]  That's the problem with these bureaucracies.
[58:12.640 --> 58:15.640]  That's the thing. You have to get a referral.
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.640]  But it's almost impossible to get an appointment with the NHS.
[58:19.640 --> 58:24.640]  Yes, it's like a lottery. That's how bad it is. It's never much fun.
[58:24.640 --> 58:27.640]  Well, thank you so much for joining us. Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[58:27.640 --> 58:29.640]  You can check out these articles on infowars.com.

[59:00.640 --> 59:04.640]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[59:04.640 --> 59:09.640]  This ultra clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years.
[59:09.640 --> 59:14.640]  And is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[59:14.640 --> 59:17.640]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[59:17.640 --> 59:19.640]  No needles, no injections.
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.640]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[59:23.640 --> 59:28.640]  And secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of vitamin B12.
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.640]  Bringing you a true nutraceutical quality vitamin B12.
[59:32.640 --> 59:35.640]  Secret 12. Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift.
[59:35.640 --> 59:39.640]  And it's tailor made to boost your New Year's resolutions.
[59:39.640 --> 59:41.640]  Supplies of secret 12 are very limited.
[59:41.640 --> 59:59.640]  Secure yours today at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[59:59.640 --> 1:00:12.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:21.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:27.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday, December 18, 2014.
[1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:33.640]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us live from the road today and be joining us in this hour in the next segment.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:38.640]  We're going to talk about probably what's going on in Washington state.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.640]  We have our reporters are going to be there joining us in the third hour.
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:49.640]  And of course, that's the MRAP controversy that erupted this last weekend when a person there in Washington said,
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:52.640]  why do you need this after they explained what it was?
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:54.640]  And they said, well, we need it for the constitutionalists.
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:57.640]  We need it for people who are stockpiling weapons.
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:03.640]  What are we supposed to do about the police departments that are stockpiling weapons and identifying themselves now?
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:09.640]  As we just heard in the last half hour, we talked to Paul Joseph Watson about his story that's up on infowars.com
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:17.640]  about the California Highway Patrol, the largest law enforcement organization in the country at the state level.
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:25.640]  Identifying themselves as a paramilitary organization saying, is this job right for you? Anybody that is going to apply for a job there?
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.640]  And they say, do you want to be a part of a paramilitary organization?
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:35.640]  Do you have a lot of military experience that you can use as a highway patrol in California?
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:37.640]  Is this really where it's gone?
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.640]  Do we have a paramilitary police force?
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:41.640]  They say they are in California.
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:45.640]  And of course, I guess that means we've got a para police state.
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.640]  And we also got some news from the banks.
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.640]  The banks are now urging clients to take their cash elsewhere.
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:55.640]  This is a story that came out about 10 days ago from the Wall Street Journal,
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:01.640]  saying that banks are now urging their largest customers in the U.S. to take their cash elsewhere or be slapped with fees,
[1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:05.640]  citing new regulations that make it onerous for them to hold certain deposits.
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:12.640]  And of course, it's the usual suspects, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, Bank of America, what they're going to do.
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:16.640]  And this is the amount of money they're going to charge customers,
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:23.640]  $500 monthly account maintenance fee for demand deposits and a $25 charge per paper statement.
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  Do you see how this is starting to lay the groundwork for a bail-in,
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:31.640]  tapping people's bank accounts, preparing people for this?
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:34.640]  This is something that was reported on this last summer.
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:39.640]  We reported that some people who had brokerage accounts were getting a leveraged fee.
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:43.640]  This individual here, Michael Lombardi, pointed out on Profit Confidential,
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:48.640]  he said that he got a letter from his dad in June from his stock brokerage account saying that
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:53.640]  if his retirement account, and this is his dad who is 87 years old,
[1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:58.640]  they sent him a letter saying, if your retirement account gets below $125,000,
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.640]  you're going to get a yearly fee of $500.
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:08.640]  Now they're looking at charging big customers $500 a month just for having cash in the bank.
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:14.640]  And he pointed out one of the reasons that they're doing this is because the banks have too much money on hand.
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  And of course, they're getting these regulations from Washington that were supposed to control the banks.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:21.640]  How's that working out for us?
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.640]  I don't think that's working out too well.
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  They just gave the banks FDIC insurance,
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.640]  and we see that even when they come after them with some regulations,
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:33.640]  of course that money is just simply going to get passed on to,
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:39.640]  those fines are going to get passed on to their customers and then that's going to get passed on through the marketplace.
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:41.640]  You can't stop it from that standpoint.
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  The problem is there's too much money and power in Washington.
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:51.640]  And the banks are the ones who are best positioned to leverage that to their advantage.
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:55.640]  The banks and the multinational corporations, they can easily buy these politicians
[1:03:55.640 --> 1:04:04.640]  as we just saw with this repeal of the Dodd-Frank bill which tried to separate the FDIC insurance from their more speculative investments.
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:09.640]  But he's pointing out that through the quantitative easing, they have a lot of money on hand.
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:10.640]  They don't need that.
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:14.640]  And they're also going to get fined with these new regulations coming online.
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:15.640]  So that's what's happening.
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:21.640]  The banks are going to start charging people for keeping money in the bank.
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:25.640]  Now another absurd story, I guess it's coming up, is we've got this fight.
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:29.640]  As we were talking about earlier this week, we were talking about Vladimir Putin.
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  We now see that there's a fight on as to who owns the North Pole.
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:35.640]  And I think this is very appropriate just one week from Christmas.
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  This is something that Sony may want to do for their next movie,
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.640]  since they're having, struggling with concepts.
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.640]  Maybe they could have a Santa Claus meets Beverly Hill Belize.
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:48.640]  You know, he discovers black gold and it's a real fish out of water.
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:52.640]  And who's he going to pay his taxes to? Is it going to be Denmark? Is it going to be Russia?
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:54.640]  Maybe the UN. We don't know.
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.640]  They're all fighting over the resources in the Arctic.
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:25.640]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:55.640]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:25.640]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:32.640]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:36.640]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:38.640]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:43.640]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds,
[1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:46.640]  is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:53.640]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:58.640]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:27.640]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:29.640]  No needles, no ejections.
[1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:33.640]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.640]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12,
[1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:42.640]  bringing you a true, nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:45.640]  Secret 12. Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift,
[1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:49.640]  and is tailor-made to boost your New Year's resolutions.
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:51.640]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  Secure yours today at infowarslife.com, or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:27.640]  Before we do, of course, we have a lot of news about Obama's move towards Cuba.
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:29.640]  Kurt Nemo has an interesting take on it.
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:33.640]  He says Obama's Cuba move is more Democrat voters.
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:38.640]  A wave of new impoverished immigrants may soon arrive in America.
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:40.640]  There's also an article up by Steve Watson.
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:47.640]  Castro urges Obama to embrace his inner dictator by lifting the embargo via executive action.
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:51.640]  Here's that clip from Castro Jr., Castro's brother.
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:09:01.640]  The president of the United States can change the enforcement thereof under his executive branch powers.
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:10.640]  We propose to the United States government to take neutral measures
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:23.640]  for the improvement of our bilateral climate and move forward towards normalization of ties between our countries.
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:27.640]  That's right. From one dictator to another, this is what you can do.
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:31.640]  You can take executive action. You can call it a memoranda if you want.
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:35.640]  You don't even have to write anything up or sign it, as Jerome Corsi pointed out.
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:39.640]  You can just speak it, and it becomes the law.
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:41.640]  That's what a dictator does.
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:45.640]  Now, we had a story up that was on InfoWars.com yesterday.
[1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:48.640]  A federal judge said Obama's amnesty is unconstitutional.
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:54.640]  He was swatted down by federal judge Arthur J. Schwab, issued a scathing memo.
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  According to the Washington Times, he's said to have accused Obama of, quote,
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:01.640]  usurping and dismantling Congress's power.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:03.640]  And it's not just Congress's power.
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.640]  He's usurping and dismantling the Constitution.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:13.640]  He's not only said that he's going to act alone with amnesty and open borders.
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:19.640]  He's also said that we're going to see this in the New Year, even with the increased majority of the Republicans.
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:25.640]  He said there's nothing that they can or will do to stop him as he shuts down energy production.
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.640]  And of course, he said before he even got elected, he was going to shut down the coal industry
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:35.640]  and much of our other power generation in this country in the name of global warming.
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:37.640]  And of course, we're not going to go into that right now.
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:43.640]  Let's go back to this immigration, this judge calling his immigration move unconstitutional.
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:50.640]  This is a decision that came in a criminal case against a Honduran immigrant named Juarez Escobar.
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:51.640]  That's his last name.
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:53.640]  He'd been deported before.
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:59.640]  He returned to the U.S. and was facing charges of unlawful re-entry after a drunk driving arrest.
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.640]  So it's a revolving door where they send people out.
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:09.640]  And the judge was saying that, no, he really did need to be deported, not given some kind of executive clemency.
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:16.640]  He says this goes beyond prosecutorial discretion because, A, it provides for a systematic and rigid process
[1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:23.640]  by which a broad group of individuals will be treated differently than others based upon an arbitrary classification
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:25.640]  rather than case-by-case examination.
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:33.640]  And B, it allows undocumented immigrants who fall within these broad categories to obtain substantive rights.
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:40.640]  Yes, things like access to social security that the Republican Congress just signed on to.
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.640]  Where do we stop this?
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:45.640]  Cloward and Piven destruction of America.
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:50.640]  And it also speaks to the kind of corruption that we see in the Obama administration.
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:54.640]  There was a New York Times article that came out two days ago as well.
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.640]  An Ecuador family wins favors after donating to the Democrats.
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  They point out the Obama administration overturned a ban preventing a wealthy politically connected Ecuadorian woman
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:10.640]  from entering the U.S. after her family gave tens of thousands of dollars to Democrat campaigns.
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:14.640]  She'd been fraudulently obtaining visas for her maids.
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:23.640]  And it was set up and approved at the request of the State Department under, guess who, Hillary Clinton, of course.
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  Now, this is a family. These people have been investigated by federal law enforcement agencies
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:31.640]  on suspicion of money laundering and immigration fraud.
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.640]  Kind of like the big banks, HSBC, UBS, they investigate them.
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:41.640]  They say it really wouldn't be in our interest to put these people in jail.
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  So let's just give them a slap on the wrist and do nothing.
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:45.640]  And so here's a lady.
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  Their family has been doing money laundering like our big banks.
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:55.640]  Immigration fraud has made hundreds of thousands of dollars, however, to American political campaigns in recent years.
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:13:01.640]  And the Obama administration has allowed the heads of the family, the patriarchs, to remain in the U.S.
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:04.640]  refusing to extradite them to Ecuador.
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:12.640]  Ecuador, that's interesting because there's a back and forth between Ecuador and the United States over Julian Assange as well.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:19.640]  They say the two brothers were sentenced in absentia in Ecuador in 2012 to eight years in prison, accused of running their bank.
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:21.640]  Oh, they're bankers. What a surprise.
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:29.640]  Running their bank into the ground and then presenting false balance sheets of profit in order to get bailout funds.
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:31.640]  The usual MO, isn't it?
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:35.640]  Ecuador says that the fraud cost the country $400 million.
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:38.640]  Ecuador is a very small country.
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:41.640]  $400 million is huge there.
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:49.640]  And, of course, they point out that this is something that is also part of the back and forth between the standoff in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.640]  that is giving sanction to Julian Assange.
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:57.640]  They say that for more than a year, and this goes beyond Obama, it goes beyond Hillary Clinton,
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:03.640]  whose State Department tried to waive the rules for this lady, for more than a year, Senator Robert Menendez,
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:14.640]  a Democrat of New Jersey, has had his staff engaged in a relentless effort to help this fraudulent Bankster family, their daughter, to get into the country.
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:23.640]  Now, I mentioned Julian Assange, and earlier this week we were looking to see if the Senate seeing hearing for U.S. journalist Barrett Brown was going to happen this week.
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:26.640]  They said it was going to be released yesterday or today.
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:30.640]  They've now moved that into some time in January 2015.
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:38.640]  But there was an interesting statement on WikiLeaks from Julian Assange, and he kind of lays out what's going on with Barrett Brown.
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:48.640]  Of course, one of the aspects that I thought was completely outrageous about this was they came after him because he linked to some leaked data on WikiLeaks,
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:54.640]  and because of the link they came after him and tried to prosecute him, they subsequently dropped that.
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:59.640]  That would set an unbelievable precedent to attack freedom of speech.
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:01.640]  But here's what Julian Assange points out.
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:04.640]  He says he's been jailed without trial for over two years.
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:07.640]  He faces eight and a half more years in jail.
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:10.640]  His next Senate seeing hearing now has been moved to January.
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:11.640]  It was supposed to happen this week.
[1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:16.640]  And he says he wanted to comment on this because it involved him personally and WikiLeaks.
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:22.640]  He said the two charges against him occur as a direct result of his journalistic work on our strat for materials,
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:27.640]  anonymizing his sources and talking with others about the material that they provided to him.
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:35.640]  He says these charges are at odds with national and international protections for the freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:44.640]  He said the third charge concerns his speech acts after the FBI threatened to charge his mother unless he handed over his source materials and there's no other charges.
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:47.640]  So now let's talk about this third charge.
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:51.640]  The FBI goes to his mother's home in March of 2012.
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:57.640]  His mother is hiding his journalistic notebooks they say in her pots and pans. They find it.
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:59.640]  And they put her on six months probation.
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:06.640]  She goes before the judge and says my better judgment was clouded by my maternal instinct.
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:10.640]  Then he says that he got very, Barrett reacted to this in an angry way.
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  And like any kid from America in generation Y, his anger was expressed on social media.
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:22.640]  Listen to what Julian Assange says about social media. This is the takeaway quote. I think that is really impressive.
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:26.640]  He says Twitter is a police interview that never ends.
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:30.640]  Facebook has all of your friends wearing a wire.
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:35.640]  YouTube has you in the dock talking to the judge. You got that?
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:37.640]  Twitter is a police interview that never ends.
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:44.640]  Facebook has all of your friends wearing a wire and YouTube has you in the dock talking to the judge.
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.640]  Now, what did he put up on social media that was so outrageous?
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:51.640]  And this is the thing that I think is really outrageous.
[1:16:51.640 --> 1:17:00.640]  They say six months after they raided his mother's address, he tweeted, quote, illegally shoot the son of a bee, the SOB.
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:03.640]  Okay, and he says that sounds like incitement to murder, doesn't it?
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  Clearly does.
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:11.640]  The FBI claims that the SOB that Barrett was referring to was one of their agents, but he says that's false.
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:15.640]  The SOB is me, Julian Assange.
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:18.640]  He said the person who called for my assassination was not Barrett Brown.
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:25.640]  Barrett's full retweet was, quote, dead men can't leak stuff, illegally shoot the SOB.
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:33.640]  And that was a quote from Fox News host Bob Beckel, who had called for the assassination of Julian Assange.
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.640]  Do you get how twisted this is?
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:43.640]  He points out in kind of a piece of irony that Bob Beckel has called for the assassination of Julian Assange.
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  And the FBI twists that and says, well, we think that's a threat against one of our agents.
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:18:01.640]  He points out that the FBI never took any action against Bob Beckel or any of the other senior officials who've been calling for his assassination, including politicians.
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:08.640]  But two days after Barrett retweeted the Bob Beckel statement, they arrested him.
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:11.640]  They arrested Barrett Brown, not the person who had made the statement.
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  And he says he's been in jail ever since.
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  See, that's the kind of police state we have to fear.
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:26.640]  That's why we need to be concerned about this article that I talked to Paul Joseph Watson about earlier in the week about the Beware program that goes in
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:38.640]  and assigns a threat level to people based on their social media comments, based on their purchasing history, based on whatever our police state government wants to make up about people.
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:42.640]  And of course, they can make up anything they want about anybody and make it stick.
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:45.640]  That's the essence of a police state.
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:47.640]  We've had William Benion numerous times.
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:49.640]  It's not just us making this claim.
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:19:01.640]  That's the guy who was the global technical head of the NSA who became a whistleblower who said that they were acting like the East German police, the Stasi, as well as the KGB people.
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:08.640]  He had been following for decades, trying to prevent them from doing the types of things that dictators do in our country.
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.640]  But he knows how they operated in their country because he observed them for decades.
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:20.640]  He first said, we're this close to a police state and now he is saying, many months ago, we're already there.
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:23.640]  We're operating exactly like the Stasi.
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.640]  How do we stop this?
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:33.640]  How do we stop it when the California Highway Patrol comes out and says that they are a paramilitary organization?
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:39.640]  And before you apply for a job, you need to ask yourself, are you comfortable working for a paramilitary organization?
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:45.640]  Do you have military experience that you can bring to the civilian police force?
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:50.640]  It doesn't mean anything to have Posse Comitatas if our police are military.
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:52.640]  We already have a standing army.
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:58.640]  Stay with us when we write back with Alex Jones as soon as we establish contact with him on the road, we'll be right back.

[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:24.640]  But then I started hearing government media types talking about making guns illegal,
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:28.640]  about the president signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:34.640]  You know, it really bugged me. So I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.

[1:23:57.640 --> 1:24:18.640]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. David Knight in Austin. We're going to be joining Alex Jones.
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:27.640]  We're talking in the last segment about Julian Assange's comments about Baird Brown, who was supposed to be sentenced this week.
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:37.640]  They've now moved it to January. An amazing admission as to how the FBI twisted a tweet to try to put this guy in prison for years.
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:42.640]  And of course he has served in prison for years, waiting trial, waiting sentencing.
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:50.640]  He's going to play the quote from the Fox News commentator who says, we need to assassinate the SOB.
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:56.640]  And he basically reposted that as a tweet. The FBI said he was threatening FBI agents.
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:08.640]  Rather, he was putting out a quote from Fox News commentator Bob Beckel, who was never approached by the FBI for threatening to kill Julian Assange
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:15.640]  suggesting that he should be assassinated. And instead, they twist that to say that that was about an FBI agent, perhaps an unnamed FBI agent,
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:19.640]  and are still trying to charge him with that. We're going to play that report before we do.
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:26.640]  I want to let you know that the Essential Holiday Health Pack Special, which ended yesterday, has been extended by Alex Jones for one day.
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:34.640]  We had it just a two-day special. Our December 17th was our cutoff date because we wanted to guarantee that we could get it to you by Christmas.
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:39.640]  But Alex has added additional staff. He's going to be working around the clock, so we've added one more day to that special.
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:47.640]  It's Secret 12, X2, nascent iodine, and silver bullet, all three for only $59.99.
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:52.640]  That's nearly $80 off the retail price, a 57% savings.
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:26:00.640]  That's Secret 12, our B12 nutraceutical, survival shield, X2, iodine, and silver bullet for one more day.
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.640]  That's all three of those for just $59.99. Let's go to that quote from Fox News.
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:14.640]  Let's go to the play that clip, and this is what wound up being used against Barrett Brown. Let's play that clip.
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:18.640]  In the National Security of the United States, the way to deal with this is pretty simple.
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:22.640]  We've got special ops forces. I mean, a dead man can't leak stuff.
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.640]  This guy's a traitor, a treasonous, and he has broken every law of the United States.
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.640]  The guy ought to be, and I'm not for the death penalty, so if I'm not for the death penalty, I don't want to do it.
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:33.640]  Illegally shoot the son of a b***h.
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:34.640]  Well, what about it?
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:36.640]  I can't believe I believe it. I'm along with Barrett.
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:39.640]  You know what? When he comes out and says that he's holding everyone hostage,
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:42.640]  that he's going to release the names of people put in the home country.
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.640]  It's not just Bob Beckel. It's the entire Fox News staff, and they're seriously,
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:52.640]  they're not just throwing this thing out there. Reminds me of when Alex Jones was on CNN.
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:57.640]  They just said, you know, shoot the guy and do it in uniform. Yeah, ha, ha, ha.
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:01.640]  These guys, you can't even say that they're joking about it. They're very serious about it.
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:04.640]  And what he said was dead men can't leak stuff.
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:11.640]  And so Barrett Browning puts out dead men can't leak stuff dot, dot, dot. Illegally shoot the SOB.
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:15.640]  The FBI comes after him and says you're trying to kill FBI agents.
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:19.640]  That's what they're trying to send him up for years for.
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  That's what he's already served two years for, why he may already go another eight and a half more years.
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:29.640]  Do you see how the government is lying and twisting that?
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:35.640]  We should all be very concerned when we have a government that can lie like that and get away with it.
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:39.640]  We should be concerned regardless of what you think about any of this stuff.
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:44.640]  And I think that WikiLeaks did the world a favor when they exposed criminal actions.
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:51.640]  They're not the bad guys. The bad guys who are shooting people from a distance in the streets, civilians and cameramen
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  and laughing about it, they're the bad guys. But they don't go to jail.
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:00.640]  It's the whistleblowers that come after just as we saw with Julian Assange.
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:07.640]  Now, we have another interesting thing that's come out as this torture report, this whitewashing of what's going on.
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:15.640]  What FineSign is trying to do is absolve herself as well as the rest of the politicians from any involvement in this, saying they were deceived.
[1:28:15.640 --> 1:28:23.640]  They were lied to by the CIA, putting it all on the CIA because she knows that in a police state like we have now,
[1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:29.640]  nobody is going to lay a hand on the CIA, maybe. We'll see about that.
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:32.640]  Here's an interesting quote from John Yu.
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:37.640]  Now, he is the guy who, as he was working, he was a lawyer working for the Bush administration,
[1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:44.640]  who said that it might be legal for the president to order an innocent child's testicles to be crushed.
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:50.640]  Now he thinks what the CIA did might be illegal. This is reported by Conor Friederstor for the Atlantic.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:57.640]  And he points out that former CIA director Michael Hayden said that it needs to be said that on multiple occasions,
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:03.640]  all the techniques were determined lawful by the Department of Justice and judged appropriate for the circumstances.
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:08.640]  But there was an interview on CNN, and the interviewer asked John,
[1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:17.640]  when you read this report and you read about the techniques that were used, forced rectal feeding, agency officials threatening to rape the mothers of prisoners,
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:23.640]  people with broken limbs being forced to stand for hours and hours deprived of sleep up to a week, doesn't that strike you as torture?
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:29.640]  And he says, well, that's very troubling examples. They would never have been approved by the Justice Department.
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:37.640]  That was a partisan report. And the guy comes back and says, well, okay, yeah, but it actually was taken out of the CIA's own documents.
[1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:40.640]  We're going to be right back. We'll finish with this. We're running out of time.
[1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:46.640]  But even though it was taken out of these documents, it still makes it true even if it was cherry-picked.
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:48.640]  We'll be right back. Alex Jones will be joining us.
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:55.640]  In March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:32:49.640 --> 1:33:09.640]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:27.640]  The big-scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes, to recap those revisions.
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:42.640]  Women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets, but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:52.640]  The big-score, anyone, any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points.
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:34:02.640]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:11.640]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:19.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin. Alex Jones is going to be joining us by phone shortly just before the break.
[1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:25.640]  I was talking about this interview highlighted by Conor Friedersdorf out of the Atlantic.
[1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:34.640]  It was an interview of John Yu and he was a lawyer who worked for the Bush administration, essentially an apologist for the torture that was going on at the time.
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:48.640]  I read Zakaria at CNN was interviewing him and said, you've looked at these techniques that were used. They include forced rectal feeding, people being forced to stand on broken limbs for hours and hours, sleep deprivation up to a week.
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:58.640]  Does that strike you as torture? To which the Bush lawyer who had excused torture said, well, those are very troubling examples and they would never have been approved by the Justice Department.
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:05.640]  They were not approved by the Justice Department at the time, but I have to question whether they're true because I can't take at face value the committee's report.
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:14.640]  There were no Republicans involved. Let me tell you something. There aren't going to be any reports coming out of the Senate Intelligence Committee when the Republicans get in.
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:23.640]  Richard Burr from North Carolina, the senator who's likely to be the head of that, has said he doesn't think the public should ever know what the CIA is doing.
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:31.640]  There should never be any public examination of anything that the CIA does. That's the kind of oversight we're going to get from the Republicans.
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:37.640]  It's going to be a total rubber stamp. And of course, it's been a rubber stamp from Diane Feinstein for years and years.
[1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:46.640]  And as she's leaving, she's basically doing a partially a CYA and partially she has a personal vendetta because they spied on her.
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:53.640]  See, she's a senator. They're not supposed to spy on Diane Feinstein and her staff. That made her angry.
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:36:00.640]  So she came after them with a bit of a personal vendetta. So it's one part personal vendetta and one part covering her behind.
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:05.640]  But he goes on to say, this is what John Woo goes on to say, but I agree with you.
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:14.640]  If there were people who had to undergo what you just described, the things that have come out of that document, none of that was approved by the Justice Department.
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:20.640]  And then the interviewer says, but John, you've made a fair point that the Republican minority didn't join in.
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:26.640]  But the practices that they're describing, as I understand it, were taken from the CIA's own accounts.
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:30.640]  Are you saying you think the committee has doctored those reports?
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:33.640]  In other words, did they just make this up or did it come out of there?
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:37.640]  And he says, no, they were cherry picked out of millions of documents.
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:48.640]  Look, that's how you investigate somebody. If somebody has got a document dump of millions of documents, that might just be the way they have of hiding their crimes.
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:37:01.640]  If they've got a million pages that get leaked out and one of those pages say that they murdered somebody, that's not cherry picking when you pull that out.
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:08.640]  That's called an investigation. It's called exposing their crimes. If they did it and it's in the documents, it is a crime.
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:14.640]  And then John Woo goes on to say, after he said, well, I think that those were just cherry picked, he says, but I agree with you.
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:23.640]  If these things happened, as described in the report, as you described them, those were not authorized by the Justice Department.
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:33.640]  They were not supposed to be done and the people who did that are at risk legally because they were acting outside of their orders.
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:44.640]  Okay, so he opens the door and as Conor Friedersdorf says, he's just a step away from acknowledging that the violation of this law compels a prosecution.
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:56.640]  It really does compel a prosecution. And you know what? There aren't any orders that can be given that excuse somebody if they torture people, if they engage in those kinds of crimes.
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:03.640]  It doesn't matter if they were given an order or not. He's saying they did it on their own without an order, so they might have broken the law.
[1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:15.640]  They broke the law that we not only sent people to jail for, we executed people after World War II that engaged in water torture like this, waterboarding.
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:21.640]  We didn't just send them to jail, we executed them. Many people have pointed this out.
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:32.640]  However, our government with Operation Paperclip brought a lot of these tortures into the CIA to teach them how to do it.
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:35.640]  Joining us now is Alex Jones. We just got him on the line. Alex.
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:40.640]  Absolutely, my friend. And I may be back in the chair tomorrow. I'll finish this important work.
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:44.640]  We're doing a fabulous job this week. I wish everybody a wonderful Christmas.
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:51.640]  And remember it is about Christ, even if you're not a Christian. It's okay. We don't have to be politically correct here.
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:56.640]  It's okay to admit where the holiday comes from. I know 95% of our listeners understand that.
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:02.640]  Even if you're not a Christian, we should all, which I am of course a Christian and David is, a lot of our crew,
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:13.640]  it's that the system wants to overthrow everything that's good and wholesome and replace it with the centralized government and Hollywood type mind control system
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:24.640]  as the new God and get rid of all of our Christian values or Judeo-Christian values of don't torture, don't lie, don't bear false witness.
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:34.640]  Look at everything we see the DEA doing with NSA intercepts. They get illegally bearing false witness and creating false court cases with parallel construction.
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:40.640]  You see, the system is attacking true Christianity, not people that have used Christianity to do bad things.
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:47.640]  That certainly happened with any religion, but they don't like Christianity because it doesn't make the state God.
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:58.640]  They don't like our civil rights and constitution because our civil rights and constitution say we get our power, our liberty, our freedom, our rights from God, not from the state.
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:09.640]  So we, the people are on top and then you truly see Romans 13 in context of if you have godly rulers and then they're being just,
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:12.640]  then you should try to work with them and do what they say.
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:23.640]  But in every time in the Bible, Old Testament knew when the rulers were ungodly, then the prophets were called forth, the people were called forth and commanded unto death to not submit to those orders.
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:26.640]  But I've seen not one, not two, not three, not four, not five.
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:35.640]  I've seen online and on television the last decade hundreds of TV preachers and others because they're under faith based initiative funding that's bipartisan to control what they say.
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:50.640]  They say that the Christian, as you can just Google, preacher says Christians should have done what the Romans said had not been thrown to lions or Christians should have worshipped idols.
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:55.640]  The preachers go up there and say, no, they weren't following Romans 13.
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:01.640]  They need to get down and worship those idols so they won't be thrown to the lions.
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:06.640]  It's just simply amazing that we see this type of propaganda and evil going on.
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:16.640]  I've got a whole rant here tied into a bunch of news I want to go over based on stories on drugsreport.com and infowars.com right now.
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:19.640]  American soldiers engage with ISIS for the first time.
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:28.640]  We reported that Russia and the people of Russia rush to stores to preempt price rises, bank run fears.
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:40.640]  We told people a year ago that when they voted to not join the EU with Ukraine that this would lead to them cutting off the gas supplies, cutting gas prices to bankrupt Russia.
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:42.640]  And again, it'll hurt Europe and all the economic analysis.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:44.640]  It'll hurt the United States.
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:50.640]  It'll hurt Asia right as the new derivatives come to as they prepare a new bank or bailout worldwide.
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:52.640]  So this is hurting the people of the planet.
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:54.640]  Forget Obama.
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.640]  Forget Putin.
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:57.640]  Forget the different leaders.
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:41:59.640]  They're just basically different players in this.
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:03.640]  The globalists are worldwide carrying this out.
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:10.640]  Meanwhile, the LA is collapsing.
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:14.640]  Hollywood is in incredible deep trouble.
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:22.640]  The mayor of LA this year said that they're in a crisis situation as that dinosaur media system collapses.
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:25.640]  Sony hackers are now reporting we're working for North Korea.
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:27.640]  Well, that was pretty obvious.
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:32.640]  Continuing Gennrich says America has lost its first cyber war.
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:49.640]  Well, if they didn't build all these systems within SA and CIA backdoors in Microsoft platforms, Apple platforms, in the Xbox platforms, in the Kinect platforms, in the cable box platforms, in the smart TV platforms, in the smart dishwasher platforms.
[1:42:49.640 --> 1:43:04.640]  If they didn't build in the cloud system this architecture designed to be spied on, then you wouldn't have other country hackers being able to exploit those systems.
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:05.640]  It's just incredible.
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:22.640]  They've been for a decade embedding chips that even when computers are off or not plugged in, can be energized and hold the capacitor power, but can also be remote energized and then surveil and download what's on your computer, then transmitting it.
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:28.640]  This is the total grid, not this little RFID, and the Internet of Things being put in.
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:41.640]  This is the pre-planned worldwide global governance program, whether you're in China, whether you're in Russia, whether you're in the US, whether you're in Mexico or Australia, the cars, the computers.
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:49.640]  Everything new coming out the last five years is embedded with tracker chips, taxation chips, spot chips, control chips.
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:59.640]  We told you eight years ago, Google put out a patent and announced that they were indeed sampling in the patent and in a prospectus released to Google shareholders.
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:00.640]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:06.640]  People couldn't believe it, that Google is using cameras and microphones to sample in your home.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:09.640]  They said, don't worry, a computer listens to keywords and follows reports.
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:16.640]  Then two months ago, I'm just breaking a full spectrum down here.
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:32.640]  The Samsung Smart TVs, when you move them up, says in the more than 50 pages of corporate legalese, we are listening and videotaping them, and we are sending it to third parties.
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:34.640]  So watch what you say.
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:36.640]  They say in there.
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:39.640]  So watch what you say.
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:41.640]  I'm going to say that again.
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:46.640]  And it's not just that smart TV, every smart TV.
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.640]  See how it's a global government already, folks?
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:45:03.640]  Worldwide, whether it's produced in Mexico or India or China or Singapore or South Korea, no matter where those TVs are made by over 30 major companies, they all do the same thing.
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:06.640]  There's your evil intelligence worldwide.
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:08.640]  We're already in a global government.
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:11.640]  They're just mopping up Russia and mopping up a few Arab countries.
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:13.640]  Are those Arab countries corrupt?
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:14.640]  Do I want to live there? No.
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:15.640]  Is Russia corrupt?
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:16.640]  Do I want to live there? No.
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:17.640]  Have I ever been to Russia? No.
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:25.640]  The point is, when they're done bringing them down, they are then going to crush the entire global economy and bring all of us to our knees.
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:27.640]  That's their plan.
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:38.640]  As if these globalists, as I've said many times, were space aliens from a thousand light years away and had come here and taken control of our government and made a deal with the elite.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.640]  It might as well be the same thing.
[1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:41.640]  I'm not saying that's happened.
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:43.640]  I'm using that as an analogy or a parable.
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:45.640]  It's that bad.
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.640]  It's that planned.
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:49.640]  It's that systematic.
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:51.640]  And it's in your face.
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.640]  Trojan horses in all the tech.
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.640]  Trojan horses in all the food.
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:57.640]  All the GMO food.
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:00.640]  Trojan horses now in everything.
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:02.640]  And I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:06.640]  I'm trying to motivate you to realize this is the main focus.
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:08.640]  This is the true takeover.
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:10.640]  But let's expand on this.
[1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:14.640]  And we've got the video up on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com.
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:16.640]  It's also on Drudge Report.
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:26.640]  Drudge.com, which probably plays some of it in the background for TV viewers.
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  With actors Franco and Seth Rogen have round the clock bodyguards and have already lost $200 million.
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:39.640]  12,000 emails in latest leak.
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:45.640]  And we've got the studios saying stuff about Denzel Washington's race that I'm using.
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.640]  Julie, who we know is completely mentally ill and basically is a state worshiper.
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:51.640]  I've already told you that years ago.
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:52.640]  It's well known.
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:53.640]  Here it is leaked.
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:55.640]  Julie branded seriously out of her mind.
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:56.640]  Of course she is.
[1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:59.640]  I mean, this is a ring race demon.
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:00.640]  But let's see.
[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:02.640]  Again, people can say, well, this may be a false flag.
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:06.640]  No, no, I don't think so because they don't want to attack their big little baby Hollywood.
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:11.640]  This just shows how the global has built all these backdoors to rob us and assault us.
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:13.640]  So they built this worldwide.
[1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:16.640]  And now it could be used by any little party.
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:21.640]  They don't fully control any psycho demon group, not under their control.
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:26.640]  Like North Korea or Russia or whoever that they're busy mopping up.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:28.640]  But they will use this attack.
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:29.640]  Nevertheless, use our freedoms.
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:30.640]  But look at this headline.
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:32.640]  How it all ties together.
[1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:36.640]  U.S. government, U.S. official, okay.
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:38.640]  Interview ending.
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.640]  Think about that.
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:42.640]  Think about how.
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:49.640]  That's a little window into how the U.S. government is in control of what happens,
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:51.640]  not just with the Seth Rogen movie.
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:55.640]  It's on record that they approve almost every script.
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:56.640]  It's on record.
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:47:59.640]  They say they want those things planted in television programs.
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:00.640]  It's on record.
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:06.640]  I had the star of the X-Files come to my house, Dean Haglin, and say,
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  you're right when you say that was probably planted by the government.
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:13.640]  The CIA came six months before and said, do an episode about a hijacked jet
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:17.640]  by remote control to be blamed on Afghanistan, a jumbo jet being thrown
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:21.640]  in the World Trade Center that then is really used to bring in martial law.
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:27.640]  And he goes, but why, Alex, would the CIA tell me and tell us and tell
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:30.640]  Chris Carter right in front of me to write this?
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:31.640]  Why would they do it?
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:32.640]  And that's the whole point.
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:34.640]  It's about flaunting it in our face.
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:38.640]  Our subconscious mind is many times something more than 50 times more
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:41.640]  powerful than our conscious mind.
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:45.640]  And they know that we're more comfortable, even if something's scary,
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:48.640]  just like you'll have bad dreams of something scary as you grow up to get
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:50.640]  you over the fear, when you have anxiety about something,
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:53.640]  you'll have bad dreams about it as your brain wargames it.
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  They know our brains are more comfortable.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.640]  They know subconsciously we know 9-11's an inside job.
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:02.640]  So in that program and more than 50 others, or probably about 60 or 70,
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:04.640]  we've gone over it and chronicled it.
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:07.640]  They told us they blew up the World Trade Centers.
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:10.640]  They told us that day we're going to blow up Building 7,
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:15.640]  get back, here's the countdown, on CBS Radio, Fox News, CNN,
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:17.640]  and two channels of BBC.
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.640]  But still, we're the conspiracy theorist because we can play the clips.
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:24.640]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, that's how this works.
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:28.640]  They tell you what they're going to do before they do it,
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:32.640]  so that you are subconsciously aware of this and accept it.
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:33.640]  But I'll go further.
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:36.640]  I've been told by more sophisticated people than I.
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:40.640]  Years ago, the one reason I've been left alive is that the elite believe you.
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:44.640]  We are so weak that I can come out here as a good actor,
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  someone trying to help people, but the bad actors,
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:49.640]  I don't mean that in the sense of actor, but you know,
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:53.640]  actors acting with good intent or acting with bad intent,
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:56.640]  they think that this is part of the revelation of the method,
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:01.640]  but also it's a metaphysical wall that you must first be warned.
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:03.640]  Just like in the Bible, people are warned over and over again,
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:06.640]  they're going to be going into captivity if they continue their evil ways.
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:10.640]  You must be warned as a metaphysical law that God has set in place.
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.640]  You can see manifest in reality every day of all these greater truths.
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:18.640]  And then you have to make the conscious or spiritual decision
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:21.640]  that you don't care and that you're going to go along with it.
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:24.640]  And so I really realized the reason Info Wars is here,
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:26.640]  the reason David Knight's here, everything else,
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:29.640]  is that devil thinks you're weak, the new order thinks you're weak.
[1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:31.640]  They think you're going to hear this and do nothing,
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  but God thinks you're strong.
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:36.640]  And so God has risen up people, millions of them around the world,
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:40.640]  whether you're a shopkeeper or a police officer or in the military
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:45.640]  or a farmer or a factory worker or a corporate person, it doesn't matter.
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:49.640]  You know in your heart that God's speaking to you to warn others
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:51.640]  and you know what you've got to do.
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:53.640]  So make the choice right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:51:13.640]  because world government is now out in the open.
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:28.640]  That's 800-686-2237.

[1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:40.640]  a family owned American business.

[1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:00.640]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:04.640]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:08.640]  That's right, all of us men may suffer from a prostate problem
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:13.640]  like urinating more often, waking at night to urinate, or problems with intimacy.
[1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:18.640]  That's why every man needs to call for a free bottle of Super Beta Prostate,

[1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:35.640]  They can be an issue of when.
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:41.640]  Super Beta Prostate's ingredient is clinically shown to reduce urges to urinate,
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:45.640]  reduce waking at night to go, and help improve intimacy.
[1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:47.640]  Call for your free bottle.
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:50.640]  Just call 1-800-964-7470.

[1:53:53.640 --> 1:54:19.640]  Call 1-800-964-7470.
[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:45.640]  That's 1-800-964-7470.
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.640]  Let's see. I'm upset. I'm raising the alarm.
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:51.640]  Kind of like if I see a burglar breaking at my house.
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:53.640]  I'm going to get a firearm and defend my family.
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:56.640]  Not because I'm some hero, but because I'm normal.
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:54:58.640]  My head screwed on halfway straight.
[1:54:58.640 --> 1:55:01.640]  Same thing with television companies saying,
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:04.640]  we are watching and listening to you.
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:09.640]  We put it on infowars.com with a press release and a video press release from Samsung,
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.640]  and no one cares.
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  And our listeners care, but the television, the mainstream news, acts like that's normal.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:20.640]  No, no, you're supposed to start hyperventilating about that.
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.640]  You're supposed to take it personal.
[1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:26.640]  If you caught a neighbor hiding behind your couch, watching you and your wife at bed,
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:29.640]  you beat the hell out of them, and the police would charge you for it,
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:32.640]  because that's a normal response.
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:35.640]  And it's the same thing with North Korea.
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:40.640]  We now learn, already had them alter the interview and cut some of it back.
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:42.640]  And now we have the little video.
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:47.640]  It's just a few seconds of an actor with Kim Jong-un being killed in it.
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:51.640]  And now we're talking about, oh, we better not have anything provocative anymore,
[1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:57.640]  because someone might hack us and, oh, no, we might learn that somebody's racist against Denzel Washington.
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:01.640]  It's just all this mindless idiocy, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:06.640]  And we all need to just start realizing how incredibly important all this is.
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:13.640]  We're sending reporters to Spokane to focus in and show what's under the surface of this iceberg,
[1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:19.640]  the tip of this iceberg, with how our police are being converted to total war.
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.640]  Do you know what this is? It hit me last night.
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:28.640]  This is the Democratic Party who wants to say, if you don't support Obamacare, you're racist.
[1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:31.640]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, you're racist.
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:36.640]  Now, coming on, saying if you're a constitutionalist and you believe in what America was founded in,
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:42.640]  we're going to arrest you. We're going to prepare to have war with you.
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:50.640]  That is so outrageous. And they're the number one suspect whenever there's a terror attack.
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:53.640]  Blame on the Patriot movement, because I've seen several of them.
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:58.640]  And even in mainline congressional testimony, it started to come out that many of these events,
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.640]  whether it was Ruby Ridge, whether it was Waco, or whether it was Oklahoma City,
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:07.640]  were criminal organizations nesting inside the Justice Department.
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:13.640]  The same ones persecuting anybody right of Mao Zedong.
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:17.640]  The same ones with the IRS and all the persecutions and all the lies.
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:20.640]  These are authoritarian's, period.
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:24.640]  And they're not a bunch of jolly socialists that want to come take over and redistribute the wealth.
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:30.640]  That'd be bad enough. They're hardcore mega banks with a scientific, technocracy takeover plan
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:37.640]  that have the nerve to then masquerade around like a bunch of liberals when they're a hardcore criminal takeover.
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:40.640]  So all of you out there that serve the system, remember this.
[1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:47.640]  John Boehner and the Republicans could bring down Obama tomorrow for fast and furious and Benghazi
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:52.640]  and funding al-Qaeda and all the executive actions, but they won't do it because the same interests
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:55.640]  that blackmail Obama are blackmailing them.
[1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:58.640]  And it's that message of how we've been sold out.
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:03.640]  It's the truth of how hardcore the takeover is that can bring them down.
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:09.640]  Only admitting the enemy's greatest victory is that their plan is so diabolical, so off the chart,
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:15.640]  and so public that people just don't know what to do when faced with something this massive.
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:19.640]  Well, I'm here to tell you, folks, the fact that it is so big is what makes it so weak.
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:24.640]  The moment that curtain finally falls, I said yesterday, it's game over.
[1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:30.640]  So I'm going to talk about the narrative here with our reporters coming up because they're on the ground.
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:34.640]  We're going to have on air with our reporters coming up the next hour a little,
[1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:37.640]  because I haven't even had time to give them directives since I sent them out there.
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:39.640]  I give them a few directives. We're going to talk about it.
[1:58:39.640 --> 1:58:49.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:49.640 --> 1:58:54.640]  Several months back, I started taking your Nathan Ireland and your Supermail prior to this.
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:58.640]  I was barely walking. Now I'm able to function there as a human again.

[2:00:13.640 --> 2:00:22.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:28.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'll be with you till about 20 after that.
[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:33.640]  I'm going to turn it over to David Knight to cover more news and open the phones up and take your phone calls.
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:38.640]  On this Worldwide Live Transmission on Free at the InfoWarsNightly News is coming up.
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:43.640]  7 o'clock Central Standard Time this evening.
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:49.640]  Now, we also need a little bit coming up at what Yellen, the new Fed Boss, is doing.
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:58.640]  And breaking that down, we're also going to break down the wristband.
[2:00:58.640 --> 2:01:05.640]  Notice is when you fall asleep, record your TV show, see, everything surveils you to make your life more convenient.
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:12.640]  And pizza places will scan your retinas of the size you're going to buy before you buy it by measuring where your eye looks.
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:16.640]  And there are no scientists working on uploading brain to computer.
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:21.640]  This is the end of free will that they're trying to set up.
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:24.640]  That's just some of it.
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:28.640]  But before we go any further, I've been ranting the last 15-20 minutes.
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:35.640]  I wanted to get David Knight's take just on the roundabout of the news that I was getting into here today.
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:42.640]  Because it's just really hitting me how much we get comfortable with all of what's happening, David.
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:49.640]  We know Alex, you were talking about how it's just come out that Sony had approved the ending of their film, The Interview.
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:56.640]  They had approved that with the U.S. government and I thought, look at how far we've come from just not even two years ago
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:04.640]  when they delayed the release of the new version of Red Dawn because the Chinese government had a problem with it.
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:10.640]  And we thought that was outrageous at the time because the Chinese were the ones in the movie that had attacked America
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:17.640]  and they made them redo that using North Korea as the villains and delayed that picture for an entire year.
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:21.640]  And now we've got the American government presiding over the same thing.
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:26.640]  And I guess it's not a surprise that Sony pictures are the ones who release Zero Dark Thirty,
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:31.640]  which is an absolute propaganda film for the lie about the shooting of Osama bin Laden
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:39.640]  and beginning with a torture scene showing that they're getting the key intel from torturing a suspect.
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:44.640]  And at the same time, all these government people get to be part of Hollywood production and be on their own little power trips.
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:51.640]  Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. When the CIA lawyer who had defended all this enhanced interrogation torture
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:59.640]  wrote his book Company Man, the thing that came out about all of that was how he related the experience of having somebody in Hollywood
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:08.640]  that they were going to hire to work for the CIA covertly and he demanded to be paid $50,000 in cocaine.
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:16.640]  And of course, the lawyer said, I don't know where he got that idea that the CIA would have cocaine, but he wound up working for us.
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:22.640]  And then look at this headline, the massive graveyard with one million mummies on Earth in Egypt.
[2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:30.640]  Well, below that, ISIS is now running around and just killed 150 women.
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:34.640]  It's being reported to refuse to have sex with them.
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:41.640]  The very group that our government for now four and a half years has been openly funding and turning loose.
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:49.640]  This is just getting insane. And what's insane about it is, David, it's all coming out now and no one's getting in trouble for it.
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:51.640]  I wonder what's next?
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:58.640]  Well, absolutely. And one of the things that I'd covered in the last hour, Alex, I thought it was a really key quote.
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:04.640]  It was something from Julian Assange talking about Barrett Brown's hearing that was supposed to happen this week.
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:06.640]  They've now pushed back to January.
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:11.640]  He said, everybody needs to realize, and you were talking about this before, how pervasive the spying is on us.
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:17.640]  And of course, most people still haven't really accepted the fact that social media even is a massive way to spy on people,
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:22.640]  let alone all these different devices and the Internet of Things and how they're getting that intel.
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:27.640]  And of course, we were told that by David Petraeus a couple of years ago, but people still haven't even internalized that.
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:30.640]  They haven't even internalized that social media is spying on him.
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:33.640]  What he said, Alex, Twitter is a police interview that never ends.
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:35.640]  Facebook has all your friends wearing a wire.
[2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:38.640]  YouTube has you in the dock talking to the judge.
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:43.640]  They are creating a vast library of statements that will be taken out of context and used to hang you.
[2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:45.640]  And that's what they're doing to Barrett Brown.
[2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:49.640]  You're absolutely right. Just like the sheriff that spoke in because somebody commented on our website.
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:52.640]  He said that means that we want to kill the police.
[2:04:52.640 --> 2:04:53.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:57.640]  They could have put that on there. It just shows how incredible this is.
[2:04:57.640 --> 2:04:59.640]  We're going to be right back with Alex Jones. We've got to go to a break right now.
[2:04:59.640 --> 2:05:05.640]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[2:05:05.640 --> 2:05:08.640]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:11.640]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[2:05:11.640 --> 2:05:17.640]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.
[2:05:17.640 --> 2:05:25.640]  Another thing we are celebrating is you. Without the valued listeners of Alex Jones and our loyal customers, we wouldn't be here today.
[2:05:25.640 --> 2:05:28.640]  We offer a wonderful online shopping experience.
[2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:34.640]  If you receive a pair that doesn't fit, send them back and we'll exchange them at no cost to you.

[2:05:49.640 --> 2:06:15.640]  Thanks for believing in our dream, the original 100% American-made Diamond Gusset Jean.
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:20.640]  We are the ones responsible.
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:26.640]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[2:06:26.640 --> 2:06:28.640]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:30.640]  These people are assaulting us.
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:32.640]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:38.640]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:48.640]  Block free iphone at infohorses.com. Block free podcasts and video feed. Imperatives. Destroy the planet TV.
[2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:53.640]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[2:06:53.640 --> 2:06:58.640]  Electrally, it's begun. You can fail it.
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:06.640]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:11.640]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail. Make this year different.
[2:07:11.640 --> 2:07:16.640]  By equipping yourself with oxy powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:24.640]  Using super oxygenation, oxy powder, available through infohorselife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:30.640]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxy powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:36.640]  Even info wars nightly news director Rob Dew has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:42.640]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week. Seven days.
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:47.640]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important but a lot of us have already tried that.
[2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:59.640]  Oxy powder flushes it out. Secure your oxy powder at infohorselife.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:20.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank all of our listeners, all of our affiliates.
[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:24.640]  I know that I've been out a few days, a couple days this month and a few days this week.
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:28.640]  But I've been calling into the broadcasts. I handle a lot of different family and also corporate issues.
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:32.640]  Most of it's good news. Some of it's family illness type stuff.
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:38.640]  But I'm going to be working pretty much most of next week. I think the only day I'm going to take off will be Christmas.
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.640]  I was going to take off about three days next week but to make up for it, I'm going to be here live at least the first three days.
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:48.640]  The last day of the week and I'll be live this Sunday, Lord willing.
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:53.640]  Four to six p.m. Central Standard Time. We normally do the show six days a week.
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:09:00.640]  As you know, so I think a few days I miss here and there. I make up of the fact that I normally broadcast more than pretty much any other broadcaster out there.
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  They have some sports broadcasters that do it a little bit more than we do.
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:11.640]  But we've got our amazing crew, Joe Biggs and of course Darren McBrain, two reporters.
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:20.640]  And then two of our camera people, Travis Knight and of course we've got Josh Owen in Spokane, Washington.
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:23.640]  And they're going to be there today, tomorrow, Saturday.
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:28.640]  Saturday at two o'clock in Spokane. We're going to post the tales at infowars.com.
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:35.640]  There's going to be a big patriot slash biker rally kind of like rolling thunder in D.C.
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:42.640]  Coming into Spokane, that general area has some of the most awake patriotic people to the globalist battle plan.
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:48.640]  That's why the deputy association has already been criticizing the sheriff and his politics.
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:55.640]  I mean, imagine there are no, quote, libertarians or right wingers in Spokane, Washington that are planning to kill police.
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:10:01.640]  And they're running around with a bunch of Southern Prairie Law Center ADL propaganda on record.
[2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:05.640]  I mean, I'm not just saying that. That's where they're getting it. They admit it.
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.640]  You're saying, oh my gosh, we're preparing to take fire from the constitutionalists.
[2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:14.640]  Then the sheriff goes on and goes, infowars posted that they want to kill us.
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:18.640]  And then of course, it's a website visit about a million people a day.
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:21.640]  And we could even find those comments they're talking about.
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:26.640]  But it just shows how somebody who don't want to police website and threaten to kill citizens is to stay at cops at it.
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:30.640]  I mean, there's just so much of this where they try to manipulate people.
[2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:33.640]  But some people say, what's the big deal about Spokane, Washington?
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:36.640]  Here's the issue.
[2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:40.640]  This is a window just like Gruber saying Americans are dumb.
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:42.640]  And then saying he didn't mean it.
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:50.640]  And then catching him in five more statements showed to the layperson out there that won't read the bill how the system's laughing at him.
[2:10:50.640 --> 2:11:00.640]  Well, something like this at the Bundy Ranch or now in Spokane can reveal and cause a debate and flesh out nationwide.
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.640]  And you watch, if this starts building, you'll see Fox News and then Glenn Beck and everybody out there next week, just like Bundy Ranch.
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:13.640]  We go out. We put these stories on the radar as we broke this story last week.
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:21.640]  You put it on the radar as listeners by getting it out. So that's what Joe Biggs and crew, Darren McBreen, are there to do.
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:23.640]  They're there to investigate.
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:26.640]  And the reason I throw this out is so we can all get the narrative.
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:29.640]  Not just my reporters, not just me, but what is the real narrative?
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:30.640]  Why are they there?
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:34.640]  You know, when you say a narrative or a talking point doesn't mean it's bad.
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:37.640]  No, no, no, it's what is going on.
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:45.640]  The feds who've been captured by the globalist on record or have a secret program that we've been revealing at the cutting edge of not bragging just a fact.
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:58.640]  To let you know we're experts speaking on this of the secret documents leaked to us over the last 15 years, intensely the last seven of the secret project to prepare the military and police for all out war with the citizens.
[2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:16.640]  Well, we got a force of public debate about this, so we're there with our investigative report of preparations for martial law and investigative reports on preparations to wage war on the American people.
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:17.640]  Another headline.
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:30.640]  Infra Wars investigates tanks to be used in the American people. They want to change the subject and go, somebody on a message board, but he didn't say that he said, Infra Wars is posting death threats.
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:31.640]  They want to change the subject.
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:32.640]  No, no, no.
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:42.640]  The reason we're there is to investigate why your own deputy, the head of the SWAT team, said that our main mission, the main reason we have this is to fight gun owners.
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:47.640]  There's a lot of gun owners, got guns, constitutionalists, they're everywhere. What are we going to do?
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:57.640]  Well, the fact is statistically, conservative libertarian gun owners, you can look the numbers up, have the lowest crime rate, just like CHL carriers out there.
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:00.640]  So, does this group deserve to be demonized?
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:01.640]  No.
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:12.640]  The Democratic Party is the cutting edge of the globalist takeover. The Republican leadership are their placeholders. They are in an active program to criminalize dissent against what?
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:21.640]  Overriding the Constitution, which is the law of the land that those officers swear to show. Let's translate that.
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:37.640]  We're preparing for war with upstanding, super hardcore people that love freedom, who aren't going to back off and know there's a takeover, because the system is going to push so hard that when we try to arrest all these people and put them in reeducation camps,
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:46.640]  and the Democrats admit they've been setting up, we're going to call them terrorists and kill them. That's what they're really saying. They're really saying, we're going to outlaw dissent.
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:59.640]  They're really saying, our main mission, Homeland Security, as John Napolitano said, is the Patriots, is the returning veterans, is the Christians, and then they went after them with the IRS, and they went after them with the Justice Department, innocent people,
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  and then they didn't get in trouble when they got caught lying. We are faced with bona fide real criminals that are attempting a real takeover of America, and they know we're waking up to them.
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:22.640]  There's only a few thousand globalists, so now they want to start by activating race riots through the controlled media, starting a fight with the police who on average don't know what's going on.
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:31.640]  Compared to the public, they know a lot more, but they still haven't squared up. In many cases, a lot of them are. Just how hardcore this is.
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:45.640]  We're there to investigate, and to use this as a focal point, to educate police and the public and the military about these compartmentalized programs that have gone from being compartmentalized up to operational level.
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:15:00.640]  They're now beginning to compartmentalize and prepare with their battle space propaganda the rollout of this final offensive to bring down the republic and kill the Bill of Rights Constitution, Second Amendment, family values, parents' rights.
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:09.640]  You notice they're hitting on all cylinders, announcing outrageous stuff. We will forcibly inoculate. You will eat government-run school lunches. Your children belong to us.
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:22.640]  We are coming for your gods. We'll open the borders if we want to. We'll put our troops under you in control if we want to. You notice on every front, Obamacare, all of it, launching, launching, launching, launching, launching.
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:37.640]  The enemy is launching right now, and we've got to get in there and warn people. My reporters are just reporters. They are Paul Revere's on a sacred mission. They're humble guys.
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:49.640]  You get these pompous, arrogant mainstream reporters that sit there and take themselves seriously and puff up stuff that's boring, like some Category 2 hurricane, and it's barely blowing but they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:59.640]  We need to be acting like this is a big deal when we're on the ground because it is. Have you heard about how they're preparing for war? Have you heard about how they admit it's for gun owners?
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:08.640]  Have you seen all these documents? We need reports where we go out and show people PNAC documents that say Ron Paul's bad. Gun owners are bad. Veterans are the enemy.
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:21.640]  We need to show them the training manuals. We need to ask them, did you know a private group, the Southern Provincy Law Center, is basically turning this sheriff into their own operative? Do you like the person you elected being basically an agent of this group?
[2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:35.640]  Do you like this guy trying to take internet comments and imply people that don't want tanks on their streets want to kill cops, which then legitimizes the tanks? Do you really want this? Try to talk to cops who are off to do whatever and say, you know, do you like the fact this is going on?
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:51.640]  Talk to the union head. The union has come out against the sheriff. Talk about good sheriffs. Do reports on the good sheriffs all over the country that understand what's happening or the judge, what is it, Midland, who came out three years ago and said this plan was coming.
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:17:02.640]  They've been told by Homeland Security. I mean, he said armored vehicles will be coming to take our guys. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's bold, but they're doing it. And let me tell you how they're going to do it.
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:12.640]  New Oklahoma City's shopping malls shot up, or even worse, and blaming it on us within 45 minutes of Oklahoma City. Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh.
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:23.640]  When he blamed Rush Limbaugh, he was blaming all of free speech and all of talk radio. And it's not that mainline conservative talk radio is perfect. It's the ideas it represents must be silenced and shut down.
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:38.640]  And your capacity to call in must be shut down. That's why they don't want you visiting infowars.com or prisonplanet.com. So big bold epic is what we need from listeners, from our reporters, from everybody, because it is epic.
[2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:56.640]  Whoever is out there on the beautiful Pacific Northwest should get in their car at the latest tomorrow afternoon and drive into Spokane and come to that demonstration at two o'clock. And it won't matter if mainstream media doesn't cover it because hundreds of thousands or millions will watch it online.
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:14.640]  And then it will start getting other people to protest the MRAPs and the preparation for Civil War in America. Before they deployed the MRAPs, I told you they were going to deploy them. Before this all happened, all of the police training manuals seven years ago began telling them,
[2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:30.640]  US veterans, will IED you? No, no US veterans ever IED anybody in what I've seen. Except back in the 60s or something, there were a few cases of communists doing it. How do the Democrats know magically that patriots are going to start killing local cops?
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:46.640]  Well, here's the deal. Once the Civil War stops, there are a lot of mentally ill people and folks won't be getting their pensions and things, that because the media has invoked the thing to do in protest is kill a cop just like they're doing with black folks right now, or you'll go out and burn something,
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:59.640]  you'll get real copycats once the Civil War starts that will start killing police. Do you see the master psychology program behind this? So I don't know if it's Spokane or somewhere else.
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:14.640]  But all over, by focusing on these, some of these things can really blow up in a good way, media-wise, in the Info War. We want to win the Info War instead of letting them win starting a physical war.
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:24.640]  So this is what I harp on continually, and that's why our reporters are there. I wanted to talk to that state rep. I want the reporters to split up and talk to the head of the Japanese Union.
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:32.640]  I want you guys to go on the police station, you guys have great courage, do a great job politely. Say, Sheriff, we're here to actually talk to you and hear what you have to say.
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:39.640]  Don't play tactics with us of implying we're violent when you know full well we aren't. And talk to them about the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:54.640]  Use this as a background to talk about how the Feds fund extremist right-wing groups, clan groups, and others. That's what I want. Just hit them on every front with how epic this is. And everybody get to Spokane this Saturday.
[2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:59.640]  There'll be live streams on infowars.com covering it. I'm going to go ahead and throw it back to David Knight.
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:09.640]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver. We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product.

[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:10.640]  The door's locked, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on and a home to call your own. But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:22.640]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time? Do you even have a plan B? If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:25.640]  Children left with no homes. And no one's coming to help them.
[2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:38.640]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com. There you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency water filtration devices, and so much more.

[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:05.640]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:10.640]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail. Make this year different.
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:23.640]  By equipping yourself with oxypowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally, using super oxygenation, oxypowder, available through infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:29.640]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxypowder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:35.640]  Even Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using oxypowder with incredible success.
[2:22:35.640 --> 2:22:41.640]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[2:22:41.640 --> 2:22:46.640]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[2:22:46.640 --> 2:22:51.640]  Oxypowder flushes it out. Secure your oxypowder at infowarslife.com.
[2:22:51.640 --> 2:23:06.640]  That's infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[2:23:27.640 --> 2:23:35.640]  Hey, Boomer! I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water. Good thing we have the Berkey System. It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[2:23:35.640 --> 2:23:41.640]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[2:23:41.640 --> 2:23:51.640]  I know, right? You love it too! Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some. Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.

[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:23.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Show Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin. We're going to go to our reporters who are now in Washington State.
[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:32.640]  We've got Darren McBreen and Joe Biggs who are out there to cover what's going to happen this weekend as well as to try to engage the police department.
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:38.640]  We reached out to them for comment as these articles were going up and that was on a Friday that went up on a Saturday.
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:43.640]  They did not respond directly to us. They responded on Facebook the following Monday.
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:51.640]  Why is this important? As Alex Jones pointed out in the last segment when he was with us, this is very much like the Gruber statements,
[2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:59.640]  showing the contempt of the system for citizens, showing exactly what's going on because this is not just happening in Washington,
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:05.640]  but it's a good example of what's happening in Washington. Of course, we have a couple of reports that have already been filed up on the Alex Jones channel.
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:13.640]  We've got the battle plan to target resistance revealed as well as constitutionalists expose Spokane Washington Police State.
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:16.640]  Joining us now are reporters in Washington State.
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:23.640]  Roger that. Joe Biggs here. I'm standing right outside of the Spokane Valley Police Department in Spokane, Washington.
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:28.640]  Now, what we've been trying to find out is all the different events are going to happen about the protests.
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:37.640]  Well, they just made a Facebook page, the Spokane Valley MRAP protest, and that page says that on two o'clock Saturday right here at the police station,
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:40.640]  this is the spot where they will be holding the protests.
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:46.640]  And like we said, we encourage anyone in the surrounding areas from Seattle to wherever to get in their cars, drive out here,
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:53.640]  and support this cause to stand up against the police state because we don't need MRAPs driving up and down the road.
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:58.640]  We don't need the militarized police saying that they're going to come after constitutionalists.
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:01.640]  You know, if I'm not mistaken, they sworn no to the Constitution.
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:09.640]  So why are they coming out here and attacking good, hardworking Americans who like to express their first amendment rights to go out and shoot guns?
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:11.640]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:23.640]  You know, Joe, in just the last 24 hours, CNN's Don Lemon started a hashtag Ask a Cop. They were going to have some interviews and it really backfired on them as RT pointed out.
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:25.640]  The Twitter campaign incites online fury.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:31.640]  Salon said CNN elevates trolling to an art form with a grotesque Ask a Cop hashtag.
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:36.640]  I think we need to get people to get on to that Ask a Cop hashtag.
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:40.640]  This is a chance where they can ask the cops face to face in this rally.
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:45.640]  One of the comments that they had out there was armed guys kicking your front door at midnight.
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:49.640]  Is your first thought, A, to defend yourself or B, maybe they have a no-knock warrant.
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:51.640]  That's been on Ask a Cop.
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:54.640]  There's a lot of good questions out there on that hashtag Twitter.
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:56.640]  And of course, that's the real issue.
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:01.640]  Are they totally unaware of how outraged the public is about these events as they're coming out?
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:04.640]  Because there are people who have entire websites.
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:13.640]  And that's all we wanted to do. We could fill up the entire infowars.com website with all the stories of police brutality, excessive use of force, police shootings.
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:15.640]  There's other stories that we cover as well.
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:19.640]  But this is a very important story. It shows us what's happening in our country.
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:26.640]  Well, I hope the police department and the officers here actually come out Saturday and start a dialogue with the citizens here.
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:35.640]  I hope that there's really some dialogue that we can start. So people can talk and ask these questions. Like you said, there's no Twitter hashtag Ask a Cop.
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:38.640]  Actually, get out here, come out here and ask them why they're doing that.
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:43.640]  Why are they training to take on constitutionalists, tea parties, patriots? Why is this happening?
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:51.640]  They don't need military grade equipment and they need to stop this military mentality where they go in, shoot first and ask questions later.
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.640]  And like you said, these no-knock warrants are ridiculous. They're out of control. It upsets me.
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:00.640]  Because yes, what happens when you're asleep and you hear someone banging down your door?
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:03.640]  If you have a gun, you're going to go out there thinking you need to defend yourself.
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:07.640]  And instead, it's one of these guys out here exercising these no-knock warrants.
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:10.640]  And we've seen them backfire where cops have been shot because of doing that.
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:15.640]  We've seen them happen where they go in and flashbang a child and rip open their chest.
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:25.640]  This stuff has to stop. The police brutality is rampant across our country and it's something that every American needs to get up off their couch and come out and support because it's got to stop.
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:31.640]  You know, SWAT teams began in California decades ago with Daryl Gates, the police chief out there.
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:35.640]  And we were told at the time it was just going to be used for hostage situations and emergencies.
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  The same things that we're hearing now about these MRAPs.
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:50.640]  And yet, there's an article on Infowars.com today from Paul Joseph Watson where the California Highway Patrol is self-describing themselves over and over again to people who may be going there to apply for a job.
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:58.640]  That they're a paramilitary organization. They want people who can put their military experience to use in the California Highway Patrol.
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:01.640]  This is where we're headed.
[2:29:01.640 --> 2:29:10.640]  Yeah, there's no need for military-style tactics out here on the streets. That is ridiculous. That is excessive. That is overkill.
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:19.640]  Now, you know, one of the, on this ASCII cop, and I was saying that people need to put some messages out there about this rally that's going to be on Saturday.
[2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:26.640]  One of them says, do you think a nation that's in the streets screaming is just a misunderstanding? Do you understand the outrage?
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:36.640]  That's what people need to ask as you pointed out, Joe, in person. And of course, they can get information about where and when that rally is going to be on Saturday at Infowars.com.
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:58.640]  We'll be looking for more of your reports, Joe. We've already got a couple up on Alex Jones' YouTube channel. We're going to be right back. Stay with us.

[2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:16.640]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with oxy-powder the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:24.640]  Using super oxygenation, oxy-powder, available through InfowarsLife.com gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:30.640]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using oxy-powder with incredible success.
[2:32:30.640 --> 2:32:36.640]  Took it that first day and I took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:42.640]  And I've been able to keep it off too. My wife's like, wow, you look really good. And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this oxy-powder.
[2:32:42.640 --> 2:32:47.640]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[2:32:47.640 --> 2:32:58.640]  Oxy-powder flushes it out. Secure your oxy-powder at InfowarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:33:17.640 --> 2:33:22.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:25.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin.
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:29.640]  And you know, it was just a short time ago that we went through Thanksgiving.
[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:35.640]  If you had too much of a good thing, if you didn't get it right, you got a second chance to either get it right or screw it up a lot more.
[2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:40.640]  And it goes just a week from now. We've got Christmas coming up. A week after that, we've got New Year's.
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:46.640]  It's the time of year with everybody going to parties where it's very easy to overeat, to make yourself sick.
[2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:53.640]  We've got joining us right now is Dr. Group with some holiday tips. When you get too much sugar, you get too much food, too much alcohol, you're traveling.
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:59.640]  All these different things are coming on you all at once. This is why everybody goes on a health binge the first of the year.
[2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:05.640]  Maybe what you can do is try to prevent some of these things that make you feel so sick during the holidays.
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:06.640]  Dr. Group.
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:09.640]  Hey, thanks, David, for having me on. Appreciate it.
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:19.640]  People always ask me around this time of year, what can we do to just get through the holidays without gaining weight, to get through the holidays without all the stress,
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:26.640]  because they have the in-laws and they're traveling and there's so many things that can wreak havoc on the body around the holidays.
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:32.640]  So what I like to do is just give people a few tips of things they can do to keep themselves healthy over the holidays.
[2:34:32.640 --> 2:34:43.640]  And really, this year, my main tip is to not get the flu vaccine. It's amazing how many people are sick and even the deaths that have occurred,
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:51.640]  because what they're doing now is they're using these trivalent vaccines that protect against three strains of the flu.
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:35:03.640]  And this year, the 2014-2015 vaccine contains influenza A H3N2 and it contains influenza A H1N1. That's right.
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:09.640]  They actually put the H1N1 in this year's flu vaccine and influenza B.
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:16.640]  So not only are you getting a conglomerate of three different vaccinations in the flu shot,
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:25.640]  but another thing is with this year's flu vaccine, they found that if someone, your neighbor or kids in school or anybody that you hang out with,
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:33.640]  got the flu vaccine that it can spread to other people for up to 17 to 25 days later.
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:41.640]  Which now, that's why you're seeing all these people across the United States come down with respiratory infections, chronic coughs, they're sick.
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:47.640]  There was a woman in West Virginia that actually died from H1N1 after she received the flu shot.
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:54.640]  There was a five-year-old boy that died with H1N1 in Oregon, so my healthy holiday tip number one.
[2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:59.640]  So these are live strains of the vaccine of the virus then, right? Not dead ones.
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:08.640]  They are, and that's why it's so important to protect yourself with things like silver, the iodine, keeping your immune system strong, not overeating.
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:20.640]  So make sure that you have these products available to you over the holiday season so you don't get in a situation where you're sick over the holidays.
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:27.640]  And not only that, when a lot of people overeat and gain weight, and that's one of the biggest concerns people have over the holidays too,
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:33.640]  because the holiday meals are bigger, they have a bunch of Christmas cookies and all kinds of cakes and pies around.
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:45.640]  Usually people drink excess alcohol over the holiday season, and studies have shown that people usually never lose that extra holiday weight.
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:51.640]  And most people gain just regularly 10 to 20 pounds per decade anyway.
[2:36:51.640 --> 2:36:59.640]  So you also have real high sodium-based foods, a lot of breads, a lot of baked goods over the holidays.
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:07.640]  So my recommendation is portion control. Try not to eat as much at each meal over the holidays.
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:15.640]  Try not to drink as much alcohol and just supplement with more water too, because the body becomes dehydrated.
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  It's not getting enough water during the holiday season because of the alcohol, because of the agnog, because of all the other drinks out there.
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:33.640]  And a trick that I've used over the years is if you just eat a handful of almonds before your holiday meals, it can cut your hunger in half,
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:35.640]  and you can eat more responsibly.
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:44.640]  Another thing is chia seeds. If you just soak a tablespoon of chia seeds in about 8 ounces of water and eat that about 20 minutes before your meal,
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:57.640]  that actually swells up. Chia seeds are high in fiber, and that'll reduce your hunger and keep you from overeating and also keep you from taking in too many calories as well.
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:01.640]  So those are a few tips that you can...
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:10.640]  That's interesting. I know when Jesse Ventura was last on with Alex Jones, he talked about how he's gone on a diet where he's stopped drinking anything other than water.
[2:38:10.640 --> 2:38:18.640]  And that's reduced tremendously the amount of calories that he's taking in, because so many of our drinks, even if we're making the tea ourselves,
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:23.640]  especially here in the south, are loaded with sugar. But that's a great tip. I've never heard that about almonds before.
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:30.640]  Here's another tip. If you're going to be traveling anywhere, make sure that you opt out of the body scanners in the airports.
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:42.640]  We know how damaging those things are, so opt out of that. Try to reduce your stress levels. Believe it or not, most people, especially women in studies,
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:51.640]  have been shown to be under extreme stress levels during the holidays, usually because they have to plan for the cooking, they have to set up all the Christmas decorations.
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:39:05.640]  So some of the stress, anti-stress techniques actually are deep breathing exercises. At least that has one of the fastest ways that have been shown to bring you from a sympathetic state,
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:14.640]  you know, the fight-or-flight state where your body is just in an anxious, stressful state where it's actually reducing your immune system by 50%,
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:23.640]  is just get in a quiet place and it only takes a minute or two to just take nine deep breaths and close your eyes and reduce your stress levels,
[2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:35.640]  not reducing your stress levels with anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, or alcohol. Try to do it the natural way with deep breathing techniques.
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:40.640]  Yeah, we don't want anybody going on a shooting spree from their anti-depressants over the holidays, and it is really stressful,
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:48.640]  especially as you point out for women because so much of the burden is often placed on them for the cooking, for the shopping, for the decorating,
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:56.640]  they feel that pressure relatives are coming in, there's just a lot of pressure for the people who are traveling, a lot of people who are under pressure as being the hosts.
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:05.640]  Another thing that we see is B vitamin deficiency over the holidays and a lack of energy because people eat a lot of turkey,
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:11.640]  they eat a lot of meats and so the energy levels go down, they're sedentary, they're not walking, they're not exercising.
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:20.640]  A good holiday tip is to just get up every morning and go for a walk, go for, you know, get that blood moving and eat some fruit for breakfast in the morning
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:26.640]  that provides you with the oxygen your body needs, the vitamins, the minerals, the nutrient, the fiber.
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:33.640]  But what I like to do and a lot of people like to do is just take a little extra B vitamin B because that's a replacement for coffee.
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:38.640]  It boosts your energy levels, it helps your liver detoxify from all the alcohol.
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:49.640]  Another big problem over the holidays is bloating and constipation because when you mix all of the bread together with all of the alcohol and all the high fructose corn syrup
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:59.640]  and all of the drinks that are involved in the poor meals and the altered eating patterns as well, most people are severely constipated over the holidays.
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:09.640]  So one of the things I like to tell people to do is make sure you have oxy powder nearby, an oxygen intestinal cleanser that you guys provide as well,
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:18.640]  that they can keep their system clean and that also helps provide the necessary energy that they need throughout the day.
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.640]  Yeah, you're talking about secret 12, the vitamin B supplement.
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:30.640]  We've extended that special that we had, it was a two-day special that ended yesterday because that was the last day that we could guarantee shopping,
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:36.640]  but that we could guarantee delivery by Christmas, but Alice has extended that for one more day.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:39.640]  So today we have one more day of that holiday special.
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:47.640]  That's secret 12 and X2 nascent iodine and silver bullet, three supplements for only $60.
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.640]  You can get that by Christmas if you order today.
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:57.640]  We've added additional staff, we've got them working around the clock to add one more day to that special and that's something that is a great price.
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:41:58.640]  You save about 57%.
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:13.640]  And as you're pointing out, it's that type of thing trying to kind of head off the sickness that we bring upon ourselves when we just sit around and eat for a couple of weeks on the holidays and the traveling that we're doing.
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:15.640]  Yeah, it's just really stressful for most people.
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:23.640]  I mean, it's great that we have holiday seasons, a lot of people are financially under stress for financial reasons.
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:26.640]  They feel like they can't get their kids what they want.
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:31.640]  And unfortunately, the holiday season has become a stressful season.
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:40.640]  And what we try to do is just give people the tips and the tricks that they can use to not make it so stressful and to make it a little bit more peaceful.
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:45.640]  And a lot of that has to do also with just eating healthier.
[2:42:45.640 --> 2:43:06.640]  Even if you take the normal meals, let's say this year instead of shopping at your toxic grocery store where you have the hormone and antibiotic meats and you have the GMO foods and you have all of the toxic pesticides and chemicals and all that stuff and the canned foods and the microwave foods.
[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:15.640]  You just eliminate all that and just turn your Christmas dinner or your holiday meals into healthy organic substitutes.
[2:43:15.640 --> 2:43:23.640]  And instead of using table salt, use Himalayan crystal salt and instead of using the microwave, you actually cook in non-toxic cookware.
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:36.640]  Actually, that'd be a good holiday gift for somebody is to get them a couple pans of Teflon-free non-toxic cookware to where you're not going to be cooking food in toxic things.
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:41.640]  Yeah, that's a good idea. Not to be bound by the kind of traditions that we've had in the past.
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:47.640]  We've had very rich, heavy foods, but basically start a new tradition for your family.
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:55.640]  A new way, introduce some new healthy food, find some recipes out there that people are going to enjoy, start some new healthier traditions.
[2:43:55.640 --> 2:44:06.640]  Exactly. I mean, why not? We're living in a toxic world anyway and you need to start changing these things, not only for your own health, but for your family's health and your kid's health.
[2:44:06.640 --> 2:44:16.640]  Maybe if you've got relatives who are visiting, you can make a point or try to educate them about how to eat healthy and get some exercise instead of just sitting around and eating for a couple of weeks.
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:22.640]  Right. Spread the word. That's what it's all about and teach people how to live a healthier lifestyle.
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:28.640]  Another thing that people have a tendency to do during the holidays is not get enough sleep.
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:36.640]  So it's real important. They stay up late. They drink a lot of red wine as well and there are options out there.
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:47.640]  So there's always a good biodynamic organic red wines that are actually sulfide free as well. So there's always a good organic replacement for the toxic things that are out there.
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  It's just about spending a little bit more money and a little bit more time and taking that extra effort so you can have a healthy holiday season because bombarding your body with all those chemicals from the food and from the beverages
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:11.640]  and all the other stuff out there and all the heavy metals and aluminum and all of those toxins over the holidays really cause the liver to have a hard time processing all those toxins.
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:21.640]  And then on top of that, people aren't drinking enough water like we talked about. So they're dehydrated and ultimately it leads to constipation.
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:29.640]  Most people have maybe one to two bowel movements a week during the holidays. Those are the reports that I get in.
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:35.640]  Well, that happens anytime you travel, anytime you change up your eating habits. That tends to happen.
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:46.640]  Well, just flying on an airplane causes constipation. That's why most of the airline stewardesses and the airline workers are chronically ill and they're sick.
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:51.640]  And that's why the health insurance policies are skyrocketing for different airlines.
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:46:05.640]  And I know that because I was contacted by a major airline that wanted help figuring out why all the airline people that were flying including the captains and everything else were getting sick and I was filing claims.
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:16.640]  It's a very unhealthy environment. Think about the fact that you're enclosed in a small area with a lot of people and that air is being very tightly recirculated there.
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:23.640]  And as you pointed out earlier, many people are getting exposed to radiation as they go through airport security. All those things are factors.
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:36.640]  And as you pointed out, a lot of people getting the flu vaccine, a live version of the flu vaccine, that can make them contagious with the various strains of flu that even if they don't come down with it, they can possibly transmit that onto you.
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:55.640]  That's why it's important to always keep a good supply of silver and a good supply of iodine because iodine is also going to help the thyroid from going berserk, especially during the holiday season when you have all these contaminants coming in and you need to regulate your system and regulate your metabolism
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:09.640]  and try to prevent yourself from gaining all those extra pounds. And that's another reason why you have to get all that stuff out of your system on a regular basis and really pay closer attention to what you're doing during the holidays
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:20.640]  and what you're eating and just not try not to overindulge. You can use smaller plates. There's a lot of different things you can do to especially chewing your food.
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:30.640]  That's another tip that I like to tell people to do, especially during the holiday season, but not only during the holiday season, all the time. You'd be amazed at what happens.
[2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:39.640]  I wrote a book called The 10 Super Secrets to Weight Loss and it's one of those secrets in there is that chew your food until it's a liquid before you swallow it.
[2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:56.640]  A lot of people run out of enzymes and enzymes are what we use to break down the food in our stomach, but we are a society that likes to eat fast, likes to eat a lot of things, likes to mix our foods, our proteins and our starches together
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:04.640]  with acids and sugars, high fructose corn syrup, which is another thing that I recommend people try to avoid as much as possible over the holidays.
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:15.640]  MSG is another thing because that can also put the obesity on and a lot of holiday foods, especially canned foods, contain hidden MSG.
[2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:31.640]  Artificial sweeteners as well. Get off the artificial sweeteners and you can go and use natural honey in your baked goods or you can use a gavi nectar or you can use coconut nectar as replacements in whatever you're baking over the holiday season.
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:47.640]  And there's so many people online that have good recipes. You can just type in usually organic dressing or organic pies and you can always replace certain ingredients with organic ingredients.
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:56.640]  So it's really more or less just about paying attention to what you're doing and creating that environment, that healthy environment in your home.
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:04.640]  One of my favorite recipes that we found at one point we were on a macrobotic diet and one of my favorite recipes is a very simple recipe.
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:12.640]  It was just stewed apples and raisins and it was incredibly sweet. You didn't need to add any sugar at all.
[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:15.640]  It was a great dessert that we found in that particular diet.
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:25.640]  So yeah, googling and looking for natural organic recipes like that, maybe even macrobotic recipes, experiment a little bit with things before people get there for Christmas
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:27.640]  and I think you'll be surprised at what you can find.
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:31.640]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's so many things out there.
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:39.640]  But the main component, of course, is to make sure that you're getting enough sleep, make sure that you're eating healthy, make sure that you're cleansing,
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:45.640]  make sure that you're protecting yourself from the flu virus because nobody likes to be sick over the holidays,
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:53.640]  especially having to deal with sick children, which can be stressful in itself, avoiding any type of GMO foods over the holidays
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:50:00.640]  because what we don't want to happen is when everybody starts their New Year's resolution and starts trying to lose weight in January,
[2:50:00.640 --> 2:50:07.640]  is that they have micro holes burned into their intestinal lining from all the GMOs that they ate over the holidays.
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:14.640]  So avoiding that, also another thing that I like to tell people to do is try to avoid gluten as much as possible
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:21.640]  because I know it sounds like a lot of things here, but even if you do one, two, three, four, five of these things,
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:28.640]  you're still going to be making a difference. Gluten is just extremely toxic to the body and that's going to be your wheat products.
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:33.640]  I really like your tips. We're out of time. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Group.
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:41.640]  I really like your tips about heading off the overeating. A few ounces of prevention will prevent pounds of dieting in the New Year.
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:48.640]  I like the tip about chia seeds and water. And of course, you can get that special extended one more day at InfoWars.

[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:05.640]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[2:51:05.640 --> 2:51:09.640]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:14.640]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[2:51:14.640 --> 2:51:19.640]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien. I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing-type situation.
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:22.640]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[2:51:22.640 --> 2:51:28.640]  After consuming one-world weight today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[2:51:28.640 --> 2:51:35.640]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pittery markable because I rarely get that feeling.
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:43.640]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice. The only thing I've actually added to my routine is one-world weight. Wow!

[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:29.640]  InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using oxy-powder with incredible success.
[2:52:29.640 --> 2:52:35.640]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[2:52:35.640 --> 2:52:42.640]  And I've been able to keep it off too. My wife is like, wow, you look really good. And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this oxy-powder.
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:47.640]  In 2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[2:52:47.640 --> 2:52:58.640]  Oxy-powder flushes it out. Secure your oxy-powder at InfoWarsLife.com. That's InfoWarsLife.com or 888-2533139.

[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:12.640]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:20.640]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:37.640]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005. This is Alice from New Jersey. I still get angina even with four stints.
[2:53:37.640 --> 2:53:45.640]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week. The very first day after taking heart and body extract, the chest pain was gone.
[2:53:45.640 --> 2:53:47.640]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[2:53:57.640 --> 2:54:20.640]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. This is our last segment. I'm David Knight, your host today.
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:30.640]  Now, of course, as we had at the bottom of the hour, we talked to our reporters who have gone to Washington State. There's a story up on Raw Story saying that the Washington sheriff is backing his deputy,
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:45.640]  who says they need military hardware to fight right-wing extremists. Yes, that's us. You are audience. They say constitutionalist is how many on the far right, including the majority of InfoWars audience, describe themselves.
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:55:04.640]  You know, I'm proud to wear the label constitutionalist. And I don't understand why the Southern Poverty Law Center, why the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI use that term to demonize people who follow the Constitution, except for the fact that we have seen over and over and over again.
[2:55:04.640 --> 2:55:19.640]  Their videos, their training documents, their scenarios or wargaming scenarios, where they portray people who want limited government, who want government that is constrained by the Constitution to be a dangerous threat to them.
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:31.640]  That we're stockpiling weapons. Well, we see that they're stockpiling military weapons. We see that in California, the California Highway Patrol, the story that we've got up on InfoWars.com today, is bragging about the fact, not bragging about it.
[2:55:31.640 --> 2:55:43.640]  We're talking to people saying, hey, you want a job working here? Well, here's what we're about. We're a paramilitary organization. And if you have military skills, we might be interested in talking to you.
[2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:55.640]  We don't have to worry about Posse Comitatus being violated when the police themselves are being turned into the domestic military to subdue the population.
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:07.640]  I think emblematic of this was the ask a cop hashtag that went viral in the last couple of days. People saying, do you understand that people are in the streets screaming? Do you understand why they're doing that? Do you think we need to talk?
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:22.640]  I think we do need to have a discussion. I hope that the reporters and the demonstrators, our reporters who are there today, tomorrow and Saturday, and the demonstrators who are going to show up on Saturday, I hope that the police department there does engage them, does explain why they need to have this.
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:32.640]  We've seen this movie played out before in the past as they ratcheted up the police with the SWAT teams in California a couple of decades ago. They told everybody at the time it was just for emergencies.
[2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:48.640]  And that's what they're telling us now about the MRAPs, except we saw earlier this summer that the federal government, the Department of Defense, removed equipment, surplus equipment that was coming from the Department of Defense and being given for 60 years to firefighters.
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:57:00.640]  And they were using that to put out genuine emergencies, real fires in the wilderness. They stopped that program. They restarted it after a couple of weeks because of the massive outcry against that.
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:10.640]  But they stopped that, a program that could really help people, that was putting out fires instead. What they're doing is they're lighting fires in this country with our police.
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:25.640]  Fortunately, there were police in that area, in the Washington area that blew the whistle on this sheriff who brought in the Southern Poverty Law Center. And we know where these terms, constitutionalists and gun toaters, that's all coming straight out of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:39.640]  They're the people who've been pushing this, as Alex pointed out, the people in that area know very well that they've had Southern Poverty Law Center and FBI running these types of places like Elohim City that was tied to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:50.640]  I hope that people in that area, in the Idaho and Eastern Washington area, will show up and show the police that we're not happy with the way that this is happening.
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:58:00.640]  This is what you can see on Askacop.com. Most of us are hammering Askacop and we aren't anti-cop per se. We're pro-freedom. We just want you to stop the killing.
[2:58:00.640 --> 2:58:16.640]  They ask, why are murders by cops not recorded in a nationwide database? They say Kelly Thomas was beat to death by six Fullerton cops. Three were indicted, all walked. Murder by cop is always justified. Why is that? Why is that?
[2:58:16.640 --> 2:58:37.640]  Well, stay with us. We're going to have our reporters for the next couple of days. Come back tonight. We have the Infowars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern. Join us then.
[2:58:47.640 --> 2:58:58.640]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and two together?
