[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:32.840]  we're going to have a big in-depth look on this July 5th 2012 transmission at
[00:32.840 --> 00:39.040]  government run amok government Bankster run world government Bankster run
[00:39.040 --> 00:45.040]  healthcare somebody I've wanted to get on for a long time Joe Farrah very
[00:45.040 --> 00:49.600]  interesting journalist trailblazer and constitutional libertarian alternative
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.880]  media that rivals you know the biggest to mainline news sites Joe Farrah will be
[00:55.880 --> 01:01.840]  joining us to get his take on the health care situation on this big Intel
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.240]  they're gonna be releasing in about a week and a half on Obama with Sheriff
[01:06.240 --> 01:12.360]  Orpio and a lot more and then Russell Blalock MD a retired top brain surgeon
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.840]  will be joining us to give his expert view on and take on what Obamacare will
[01:17.840 --> 01:24.400]  do and we'll also open the phones up and yes if you're watching on television on
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.560]  the prison planet dot TV about 98% of people are probably listening on the
[01:28.560 --> 01:33.840]  radio but if you are watching before I get a bunch of comments and emails and
[01:33.840 --> 01:40.600]  phone calls I had a firework accident yesterday and no I don't think they
[01:40.600 --> 01:43.240]  should restrict fireworks because I had a fireworks accident even though it was
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.120]  faulty because that's what freedom is all about I know fireworks are dangerous
[01:48.120 --> 01:53.040]  but I have my children back you know a hundred yards and I bought a bunch of
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.960]  these in Tennessee driving back from Bilderberg because they've banned the
[01:56.960 --> 02:00.600]  ones that have sticks in Texas they've they've banned selling them here you
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.800]  can still have them and I had a bunch of the old-fashioned rockets what was
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.800]  little ones weren't going off or they would they would fire but not take off
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.680]  you know the sticks on them show about 30 seconds after the third or fourth one
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.680]  was either sputtering and not taking off or not going off I walked over and
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.880]  picked it up and it fired in my hand and I don't know how it burned the outside
[02:22.880 --> 02:26.280]  because it was in my hand it fired I guess I let go and I think some of the
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.960]  molten stuff came out the back that's why they were misfiring they were just
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.040]  kind of shooting their wad instantly instead of you know a controlled
[02:34.040 --> 02:38.120]  propulsion that's my best guess because I look at my hand there was just molten
[02:38.120 --> 02:45.200]  molten phosphorus goo on it and let me tell you it was quite the experience and
[02:45.200 --> 02:51.320]  it just reminded me of war because you see the famous footage in Vietnam a
[02:51.320 --> 02:55.400]  little girl has been napalm running and she's just got skin hanging off of her
[02:55.400 --> 03:03.240]  this is probably one two hundredth of the burns she had and there she is just
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.640]  with this look of why why and why is this happening and I I see that look at
[03:07.640 --> 03:10.440]  children all over the Middle East that get killed you know whole villages blown
[03:10.440 --> 03:14.240]  up to kill quote one terrorist as the globalist fund al-qaeda to take over
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.560]  the world they're just killing whoever they want to take the land take the
[03:17.560 --> 03:21.240]  poppies take whatever goodies you know the oil they want and then doing it in
[03:21.240 --> 03:25.880]  our name I just thought wow and then I just had that fear every parent has of
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.040]  my children the car wrecks knock on wood I hope they never have the compound
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.960]  fractures I hope they never have the concussions the pain but you're not
[03:34.960 --> 03:43.040]  gonna escape pain in life you know that's the issue and this is some of the
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.760]  worst pain I've ever felt in an extremity you can kind of cut it off and
[03:47.760 --> 03:51.400]  ignore it oh it's just pain in my hand what's really bad is occasionally when
[03:51.400 --> 03:54.480]  I have a migraine I know you've experienced them some of you out there
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.600]  and it's like explosions in your head I've never been somebody who likes pain
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.440]  I'm not a I'm a you're a masochist I don't like to give pain I don't like to
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.800]  feel pain particularly you know there's good kinds of pain like when you're
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.960]  jogging and all of a sudden go in the second wind but I had this migraine one
[04:11.960 --> 04:16.880]  time that was so bad that it started actually feeling good like these
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.800]  explosions of pain rolling around on the ground it's like at a certain point I
[04:21.800 --> 04:24.800]  was like wait a minute this is kind of cool actually it was probably my brain
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.680]  releasing heavy endorphins because but it was very nice and I finally get to
[04:30.680 --> 04:37.480]  sleep and to be up yeah that's the little devils they just put them on
[04:37.480 --> 04:44.800]  screen that's the little devil right there I actually got photos and video of
[04:44.800 --> 04:48.680]  the culprits I don't know if I'm gonna put it out but whatever we'll just give
[04:48.680 --> 04:51.560]  regulators an excuse to go harass people look you know we're dealing with
[04:51.560 --> 04:54.840]  fireworks I mean look at the factories that blow up killing all those kids just
[04:54.840 --> 05:03.320]  to make them I mean these are some dangerous things if you want an

[08:47.360 --> 08:52.240]  communist or socialist because that's only one level of it calling it banker
[08:52.240 --> 08:56.800]  care scam care because people won't know what you're talking about yet to say
[08:56.800 --> 09:03.200]  Obama's banker bailout care Obama's banking takeover of health care care
[09:03.200 --> 09:07.960]  and then you've got to add that oh the bankers to a man you don't get in the
[09:07.960 --> 09:14.600]  club of the mega six banks unless you're what world government promoters and why

[09:29.800 --> 09:35.400]  local area with the nanny state getting you ready for them to have you line up
[09:35.400 --> 09:41.000]  and get fresh and home inspections and drones spying on you what's their goal
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.680]  what's their end game what do they want hmm what did most other empires do in
[09:46.680 --> 09:51.240]  ancient times not because it was a real expression of humankind it was an
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.320]  expression of aberrant people as many philosophers have pointed out scum that
[09:56.320 --> 10:03.840]  rise to the top they're ugly vicious hateful cancerous people who the women
[10:03.840 --> 10:11.320]  don't want who nobody wants to hang around with who were unpopular and they
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.960]  go and they seek power and they get power and what is their ultimate
[10:15.960 --> 10:21.720]  expression what do they always do from Genghis Khan to Attila the Hun to Adolf
[10:21.720 --> 10:30.000]  Hitler to Lenin and Stalin and Mao and every other one every Mayans Aztecs
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.520]  Druids they all demand what's what's the what's the most wicked horrible thing
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.220]  they can demand what do they always demand any you guys know what they
[10:42.220 --> 10:49.600]  always demand sacrifice that's right they demand your children and they first
[10:49.600 --> 10:53.040]  got to get you used to them putting their hands on your children and oh we're
[10:53.040 --> 10:56.480]  gonna give them a shot and oh because we care about him even though all the
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.440]  statistics show it's killing them by the way I covered this Tuesday it felt like
[11:00.440 --> 11:07.200]  a Friday and all the big merc documents and that breaking news will you ask
[11:07.200 --> 11:13.520]  Rob do to give me all that from the nightly news Tuesday because I've got
[11:13.520 --> 11:17.480]  Blalock coming on who is a retired brain surgeon to talk about social
[11:17.480 --> 11:21.960]  health care but also want to bring up that big caveat with them that one of
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.000]  the big pharma companies oh in a lawsuit documents have been released in a
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.560]  lawsuit by their own scientists that wouldn't be part of it that they they
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.440]  fraudulently said these vaccines were protecting people and it was actually
[11:34.440 --> 11:42.160]  giving them the disease really really like the all over the world from
[11:42.160 --> 11:48.440]  Pakistan to India to Brazil the UN funded by Bill and Melinda Gates give
[11:48.440 --> 11:54.200]  kids a polio vaccine and it gives what 46 excuse me I keep saying 46 for a reason
[11:54.200 --> 12:03.000]  47,000 guys type that in please 47,500 children got paralyzed or died last year
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.360]  in India from the vaccine and by the way that's a footnote in the article just a
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.760]  footnote just a footnote by the way that wasn't some radio flourish where I say
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.920]  46 then I go oh wait it's 47 my brain is a computer just like yours is sometimes
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.200]  little ghosts and the machines get in there because the guys last week were
[12:24.200 --> 12:30.200]  researching that article we can't find it 46,000 and they go here it is 47,000 so
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.200]  I don't know why I say 46 so my brain automatically downgrades how bad things
[12:34.200 --> 12:38.960]  aren't people think I'm upgrading how bad things they are no no my mind downgrades
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.720]  things and yours does too in every psychological warfare study that's been
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.960]  published and declassified they know you downgrade things British Intel
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.680]  document from the 1950s declassified in the 1980s republishing of psychology
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.000]  publication I forget which one I bought at Barnes and Noble a decade ago or so
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.960]  talked about if we massacre say 2000 in Africa if we massacre yeah there it is
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.440]  Bill Gates and 47,500 cases of paralysis that's a natural news story at info
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.000]  wars.com but you can actually link through to the mainstream media articles
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.080]  in there where they just admit it as a minor footnote probably to go down to
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.960]  find some of the original links yeah there's Aaron Dyches article go down
[13:20.960 --> 13:23.600]  he'll have links to it all the point because you don't just believe our
[13:23.600 --> 13:30.040]  site show all of this is taking place and it's just a footnote you know one
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.320]  child gets kidnapped a grandstand and say we want to be able to hack all your
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.320]  communications and take over radio and TV because it might save a child one
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.600]  child dies it's a tragedy 10,000 died it's just a statistic but the British
[13:41.600 --> 13:44.600]  Intel said let's say we kill after I think it was like I think they said
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.200]  4,000 I and they use an example of a British operation to take over some
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.000]  mineral rich areas and it's a you know let's say we kill thousands of children
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.600]  like in this case and in any whole villages and people what we do is we
[13:59.600 --> 14:01.960]  know that's going to come out because we don't control all the press even though
[14:01.960 --> 14:05.640]  it's Africa there's not a lot of press that gets out so what we do is we
[14:05.640 --> 14:10.520]  announce seven people were killed and then later months later when the number
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.440]  comes out that it was thousands the brain will automatically calculate to a
[14:15.440 --> 14:18.200]  lower number
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.360]  again I already could tell they were doing that just watching them I mean it's
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.880]  like watching hunting you know a particular type of bird you learn
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.440]  little tricks and things it has I mean I'm watching the globalist I'm watching
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.920]  what they do they watch us they study us they are a predator class that see us as
[14:37.920 --> 14:43.400]  suboid animals they feed on and you guys are so stupid in the global elite
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.960]  you're smart enough to dominate and take control of society because you're like
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.880]  cancer I mean is cancer really superior no you end up killing killing the
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.520]  entire body but I mean if you were so smart you'd know everything you do comes
[14:57.520 --> 15:04.080]  back on you and I don't even mean in some spiritual way when you poop in the
[15:04.080 --> 15:10.880]  pool aka a caddy shack I mean does that make it nice for you to because you
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.160]  that's the attitude that the globalist of solar general public so that we don't
[15:14.160 --> 15:17.600]  stick together that it's cool not to stick together that it's cool to fight
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.880]  that it's cool to be petty to be vain to be mindless to not see the beauty all
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.400]  around you to not feel fulfilled all of this and they're experts at making you
[15:27.400 --> 15:32.520]  feel like crud so that you treat others like crud and they say to you know what
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.240]  this is the new old radiology go ahead and pee in the pool fact go ahead and
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.120]  poop in it I mean I hate to use a gross analogy but that's what it is and people
[15:39.120 --> 15:47.360]  are just kind of like alright hey that was kind of fun and pretty soon pretty
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.880]  soon everybody's doing it and pretty soon they're saying hey the pool's supposed
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.280]  to be black and brown and things floating around in it we're like no the
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.640]  pool's supposed to be clean they're like that's a conspiracy theory this this
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.600]  is good and of course that's an extreme sophomore example but but it will
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.920]  certainly get the point across because you got TSA all over the highways now
[16:09.920 --> 16:12.920]  you've got them sticking their hands down people's pants putting people in
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.800]  microwave ovens pulling colostomy bags off back to the scatological stuff
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.680]  Carl Rove these listings probably excited and you see all this happening you
[16:21.680 --> 16:32.960]  see all this unfolding and they tell you you're the bad one I mean take this new
[16:32.960 --> 16:36.840]  federal document that Watson discovered a few days ago that was on drudge
[16:36.840 --> 16:44.800]  report the last two days where homeland security report lists liberty lovers
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.120]  that's a quote as terrorists world that daily also had a similar article in the
[16:48.120 --> 16:54.040]  same document and it goes and now imagine it says if you're nationalistic or if
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.160]  you say you love liberty or if you are reverent of individual rights you're
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.560]  probably a terrorist you're a bad man of course we have all these other documents
[17:03.560 --> 17:06.960]  saying basically the same thing got to get out of the UN sticker don't like the
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.400]  federal government think it's too big you know basically if you believe in what
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.880]  America was founded on common sense small government you're a terrorist I
[17:14.880 --> 17:19.960]  mean we could have had the headline DHS says home says for that you lie as
[17:19.960 --> 17:24.600]  terrorists because that's in essence and again that's in essence what this is
[17:24.600 --> 17:30.600]  and this this is so ridiculous it's like a pool that everyone has been
[17:30.600 --> 17:35.200]  defecating in and I'm here saying I don't want to be in this pool this is not
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.600]  a good idea this is dangerous hey this healthcare thing is a tax to banks the
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.600]  insurance company consortium admits and brags they wrote it and it's telling
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.760]  business groups don't fight it because it's gonna pump up their stock value
[17:48.760 --> 17:52.640]  people are like well that's your opinion mr. conspiracy terrorist I'm like
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.360]  listen it smells real bad it's floating by I'm not getting in that water look
[17:56.360 --> 17:59.320]  there's another one right there they're like that's not that's a baby Ruth they
[17:59.320 --> 18:03.440]  just reach right and start gobbling it and I'm like hey listen this isn't
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.920]  caddy shack that does not smell like milk chocolate okay I mean I'm gonna tell
[18:08.920 --> 18:13.600]  you right now ladies and gentlemen that we're in a lot of trouble and and see
[18:13.600 --> 18:17.400]  here's the key to it all in every society and I studied history big time
[18:17.400 --> 18:20.440]  because it's so interesting that's where you get real knowledge when you have a
[18:20.440 --> 18:23.280]  passion for it not when you're like being made to do it that's the secret of
[18:23.280 --> 18:26.200]  learning I know you know that but other folks out there some of them don't I
[18:26.200 --> 18:33.480]  want to reach out to them the key the key the key the key the key the key to all
[18:33.480 --> 18:39.320]  of this is tyrants know human nature and they want to dominate you because no
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.040]  one likes them and they're ugly and they're stupid even though they're
[18:42.040 --> 18:48.280]  beautiful on the outside they're ugly inside and so they want you to be their
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.600]  slave and what's the ultimate form of slavery they want you dead they want to
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.800]  scorch earth kill you get rid of you they admit this is their plan but the key
[18:56.800 --> 19:00.640]  to all this is is by increment they get you to accept the tyranny and then you
[19:00.640 --> 19:03.160]  know you see the first thing float by you say oh that's not what it looks like
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.360]  it's not what it smells like you see someone doing it in the pool and there's
[19:06.360 --> 19:09.920]  propaganda going no they're not there they're putting rose petals in the pool
[19:09.920 --> 19:13.080]  you're like that a little like Rosebell like I can spares you there as he says
[19:13.080 --> 19:16.320]  we're doing this in the pool you're like but it is and like oh really the
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.960]  television says and it says nothing that it's Hershey's syrup again this is way
[19:21.960 --> 19:28.160]  and and again this is an absurdist thing I'm saying it's satire but it's real the
[19:28.160 --> 19:34.640]  key is that once they get you to go along with evil by increments and
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.880]  disinformation and corruption and once they mislabel things as evil that
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.280]  really aren't evil and once they scramble the language people get committed to
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.880]  the lie and so that's why things sink so fast because the most corrupt in the
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.080]  society automatically become the center of the cultural black hole and they
[19:54.080 --> 19:59.080]  become the norm hell is released pyramids are erected children are cut up in
[19:59.080 --> 20:05.440]  pieces a little over a year ago I began a lot of research into why even if I had
[20:05.440 --> 20:09.200]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[20:09.200 --> 20:13.240]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[20:13.240 --> 20:16.840]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[20:16.840 --> 20:21.360]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[20:21.360 --> 20:25.840]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[24:48.560 --> 24:51.240]  gonna take a few days put together Aaron that says it's too important and has
[24:51.240 --> 24:58.040]  almost spent three weeks on it so he was even up here on the fourth of July I
[24:58.040 --> 25:05.680]  discovered I didn't tell anybody up here working after he investigated these
[25:05.680 --> 25:11.840]  keys now again everything is about keys ladies and gentlemen unlocking
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.640]  information keys and we're all learning the globalists do not want you to learn
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.200]  they want to keep you stunted so they can control you this is part of the
[25:21.200 --> 25:27.560]  ultimate sin attacking our DNA wrecking our genetic code an unfathomable crime
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.720]  against God's creation against the very fabric of the universe what type of
[25:33.720 --> 25:38.920]  entity would do such things everything the globalists do devilish devil driven
[25:38.920 --> 25:47.000]  if the devil isn't real the devil is real evil pure crystalline destruction
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.800]  and hatred of all that is good is the ether in which we swim now black rivers
[25:53.800 --> 26:03.080]  of pestilent filth are being poured out upon our heads and then these fake Bible
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.440]  thumping devils that sell tyranny will sit there and tell you a piece of
[26:08.440 --> 26:17.800]  poetry like stairway to heaven is where the devil's in and I'll break it down
[26:17.800 --> 26:25.200]  I've decided to do that as well all right that's enough that's enough this next
[26:25.200 --> 26:33.680]  piece of news here ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna get into homeland security
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.480]  report list Liberty lovers as terrorists just another one and we have
[26:39.480 --> 26:43.960]  Joseph Farah coming up for his maiden voyage with us the legendary creator of
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.640]  the world that daily that wrote the book and on so many levels of alternative
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.680]  media and journalism from a constitutional perspective just as drudge
[26:51.680 --> 27:03.400]  pioneered pioneering but you know that I I can never like find the words that
[27:03.400 --> 27:09.280]  describe something drudge pioneered aggregating news and information from a
[27:09.280 --> 27:12.880]  perspective that he thought was interesting and showing the common sense
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.600]  wit of the general public that he would represent and showing that you can't
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.520]  argue with success that that that he understood zeitgeist and was so
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.800]  dedicated to always being first when something comes out and putting it up
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.360]  there that the sheer dedication of it demanded and universal law massive
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.680]  attention be focused in on it to the point of the entire establishment media
[27:40.680 --> 27:46.880]  froths in frustration and anger that they cannot set the agenda anymore unless
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.400]  they stage a terror attack or something to get all eyes on what they're doing
[27:50.400 --> 27:58.840]  they just and drudge is a is is is the bellwether symbol of the of the tolling
[27:58.840 --> 28:06.960]  bell of the death of the mainstream media when the Vikings had conquered an
[28:06.960 --> 28:11.400]  area they'd drop a stone or wood pylon in the beach and bury it with half of
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.040]  it sticking up and that's basically what drudge was no one recognized it back
[28:16.040 --> 28:22.560]  in 1995 96 it was that first big pylon being leveled into this into the sands
[28:22.560 --> 28:28.240]  in this archipelago of media systems that the death of the dinosaur media was
[28:28.240 --> 28:35.440]  being heralded and ushered in but somebody like Joe Farrah because it's
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.960]  important to recognize people that swam upstream against the juggernaut
[28:39.960 --> 28:44.800]  establishment system and were able to not be successful but were able to
[28:44.800 --> 28:51.160]  prevail and conquer and people could say well they're not hardcore on this issue
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.000]  or that issue that's your that's your view that's your opinion the point is
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.720]  people like that opened everything up for people like us sure I was around when
[28:59.720 --> 29:05.000]  drudge was starting off but I was in one area on access television that's
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.840]  different people like drudge and Joe Farrah were able to explode onto the
[29:10.840 --> 29:14.000]  scene a Farrah was an old line journalist run newspapers magazines all over
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.120]  the country previously that I don't I didn't intend to get off into these guys
[29:17.120 --> 29:22.480]  right now I just started thinking about what do I say about Joe Farrah and that's
[29:22.480 --> 29:27.600]  what came out because that's what's true no teleprompters nothing but the
[29:27.600 --> 29:34.160]  lightning bolts of liberty striking out like flame in the night at the enemy at
[29:34.160 --> 29:41.720]  the lie that there's a burst in the flame the devil doesn't have the fire
[29:41.720 --> 29:48.760]  God has the fire God has the power we'll be back stay where this big news straight

[33:42.360 --> 33:48.160]  their parents all the way back to the beginnings of our species that your very
[33:48.160 --> 33:59.240]  bones know is a very ancient species to the sea
[33:59.240 --> 34:08.200]  worldwide transmission maybe I should have fireworks blow up my hand more
[34:08.200 --> 34:12.280]  often and get no sleep because I think I'm pretty fired up today and if you just
[34:12.280 --> 34:14.280]  joined us and don't know what I'm talking about I'm gonna talk about this
[34:14.280 --> 34:16.240]  briefly and then the shut up about it because we're getting all sorts of
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.760]  Twitter's and comments and questions the video is up at the Alex Jones channel
[34:20.760 --> 34:26.520]  it's up at info wars.com and that no I'm not trying to imitate you know those
[34:26.520 --> 34:30.440]  are shows where they ride bicycles down hills and flip over people I just thought
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.040]  it was interesting after it happened and thought I would shoot a YouTube of it as
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.520]  you know I do that quite often especially when I have a day off I have the
[34:39.520 --> 34:44.320]  story up at info wars.com fireworks explode in man's hand and what
[34:44.320 --> 34:47.800]  really happened is again briefly let me get all the big news here I had a more
[34:47.800 --> 34:55.960]  guest joining us yeah it's not a joke donor happens to you I was out at the
[34:55.960 --> 34:59.320]  lake with my family my parents were up there cooking hamburgers you know all
[34:59.320 --> 35:04.520]  the evil Americana type stuff that extremists do and we even had some
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.720]  American flags with us you know just just just like feeling that when the
[35:08.720 --> 35:12.120]  nostalgia is at all circles the drain thanks to the new order takeover and the
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.840]  occupation and all the collaborators think it's so fun to you know join the
[35:15.840 --> 35:21.400]  tyranny team and I bought driving back from Builderburg a bunch of fireworks
[35:21.400 --> 35:25.840]  in Tennessee one of these big mega stores and we're like four guys in the
[35:25.840 --> 35:28.000]  store two of them were listeners they were real nice they're like are you
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.560]  really want all these fireworks how about these and I was like no no I like
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.280]  all these old-fashioned ones that are you know the little rockets on a stick
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.400]  they're like okay well and that's not a photo of what I bought that's just when
[35:39.400 --> 35:42.760]  they got off the internet if you're watching on prism planet on TV and so
[35:42.760 --> 35:47.040]  they go on for a short I stick it the sand up of the lake I'm lighting them
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.440]  and they're not going off or they explode on the ground and they're just
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.560]  little you know things that go up and pop some of them had little parachutes on
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.280]  them but it was daytime stuff they hadn't even gotten dark yet so I was I had a
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.240]  bunch of other fireworks I was like well I think I'm cured today of these I just
[36:04.240 --> 36:11.200]  watched the neighbors and people shooting them off and so so witnessing
[36:11.200 --> 36:14.200]  all of this and also watch people on their boats and again people that were
[36:14.200 --> 36:21.880]  out there at the beach and just you know all around shooting them off and the
[36:21.880 --> 36:24.320]  reason I go back to this is I'm still trying to figure out exactly what
[36:24.320 --> 36:27.400]  happened because I'm not an idiot you know I don't sit there and have a Roman
[36:27.400 --> 36:31.840]  candle and then you know just drop it on the ground right after I think the last
[36:31.840 --> 36:35.720]  shot has gone out or just because it says 10 shots I don't just drop it when
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.200]  10 shots go out the end I know to sit there and wait about another minute and
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.920]  then lay it down aiming away from people and things but these weren't these
[36:43.920 --> 36:51.480]  weren't Roman candles and so I stick it in the ground I'm light through four of
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.920]  them they either blow up or they sputter and shoot a bunch of you molten
[36:56.920 --> 37:07.360]  fireworks propellant I guess it's phosphorous or something or molten what's
[37:07.360 --> 37:12.640]  the stuff that goes on the heads of matches and sulfur and one of those
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.480]  moments where I can't I think the fatigue might kick in here soon but the
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.360]  point is I didn't get much sleep last night with this third-degree burns all
[37:20.360 --> 37:28.600]  over my hands all over this hand and I like the fuse it burns up kind of for a
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.480]  second and I walk over and I go another one this is about 35 40 seconds after I
[37:33.480 --> 37:39.360]  grab it to look at why it's not you know what's wrong with these and boy it goes
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.480]  off classic mistake and I don't know how it's shot out of my hand like I said
[37:43.480 --> 37:50.440]  and then burn the outside down to the bone in one spot and it shot out all
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.760]  this molten molten garbage on my hand so I guess that's what happened it shot out
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.600]  and then just shot its propellant onto my hand and it's not that big of an
[37:59.600 --> 38:06.040]  issue myself it just really made me think about children in warfare who have
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.040]  things hundreds of times worse than what I have where their entire bodies are
[38:10.040 --> 38:15.520]  burned like this or burned down to their ribs those famous of film shots of
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.640]  children who've been napalmed and you see their ribs and the napalm is burned
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.560]  right through their ribs and the skin is hanging off three four inches off their
[38:24.560 --> 38:30.600]  arms and they're running running down the road and I just thought about the
[38:30.600 --> 38:37.720]  incredibly bad mojo report you so whatever you want to call it that that
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.440]  brought upon us and so that's why it's a spiritual law and the globalists know
[38:42.440 --> 38:46.440]  this that for every great evil they do to other countries in our name they have
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.480]  to abort so many of us and they talk about this they talk about balance they
[38:50.480 --> 38:54.000]  have to kill so many of us and then damage so many of us with the vaccines
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.040]  and the GMO because they want to kill all these other people they want to kill
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.080]  us too and the globalists do all these weird rituals at skull and bones of
[39:02.080 --> 39:06.200]  bohemian grove I've infiltrated it I've seen it myself and I've seen the foot of
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.880]  JBC News got at bohemian grove or at I got the bohemian grove footage at
[39:11.880 --> 39:17.920]  skull and bones they take this very serious these are weird Faustian rights
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.880]  where they transmute all of the bad they've done they go we know you know the
[39:22.880 --> 39:26.040]  universe is coming after us for all the bad things we've done so we're gonna put
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.840]  it on to this child we're gonna burn and those world leaders around me in that
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.440]  crowd watching it were more religiously focused than Baptist churches I've been
[39:36.440 --> 39:43.320]  in I mean they were focused in vicious power sucking enjoyment teeth grinding
[39:43.320 --> 39:56.120]  just for like an hour and a half I mean just and again the real ritual went on
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.080]  when they brought the casket on the back of this wagon with these horses
[39:59.080 --> 40:03.480]  drawing it over to these big little wings I saw him during the day black
[40:03.480 --> 40:07.480]  curtains and for about ten minutes something went on over there then they
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.520]  bring the effigy of a child out have a have a boatman Choron bring it across
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.360]  in front of the big idol and then burn it and screams in pain all this and but
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.440]  but you know it's care it's dull care it's it's it's their conscience it's it's
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.440]  the bad they've done it's the cares of the world it's the it's all the bad
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.600]  they've done coming back on them and then by the end they have a voodoo marching
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.520]  man a New Orleans style stuff going you know they have druidic priests and all
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.920]  that earlier but at the end it's you know fireworks yeah wasn't that nice but
[40:41.920 --> 40:48.160]  early on it's from the ages of tire and the rending of the fortresses may the
[40:48.160 --> 40:55.080]  spirits now rise and join us here the old minute I mean that's that's who they
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.320]  are and they just love when they go to a mall or something it's just to see
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.840]  people with their you know spots all over their skin and they see a child with
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.800]  their hair falling out dying of cancer they get a little little enjoyment look
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.120]  on their face little little satisfaction so much satisfaction at all and the
[41:14.120 --> 41:21.920]  satisfaction just goes on on on on on the rending of everything good that the
[41:21.920 --> 41:26.200]  mutilating of everything strong the pulling down of everything healthy and
[41:26.200 --> 41:33.320]  good and just the black armies of death spreading out across the globe the
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.960]  burning villages the murdered children the skin falling off their flesh
[41:37.960 --> 41:48.080]  writhing in pain the troops dying slowly of DU poisoning sucking in the death the
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.040]  globalists love that guard their opium kill and slaughter whole villages and
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.360]  come back and die excruciating horribly painful deaths and have children with all
[41:56.360 --> 42:04.960]  sorts of birth defects from all the DU in your body they love it they absolutely
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.520]  totally and completely enjoy it
[42:09.520 --> 42:18.600]  sounds dark doesn't it now ladies and gentlemen I have seen the enemy I have
[42:18.600 --> 42:25.000]  studied them I know their heart people that are into evil think that those of
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.320]  us that are truly good doesn't mean I'm a good person doesn't mean I'm not full
[42:29.320 --> 42:34.000]  of the flesh doesn't mean I don't have my own problems and my own struggles but
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.760]  I in my heart love what is good and I am not a person who lives in fear and I
[42:39.760 --> 42:47.680]  know the creator of the universe knows me as knows the entire creation and I am
[42:47.680 --> 42:52.760]  not part of these people I make the spiritual decision to not be part of
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.440]  evil and that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse and and follow all the
[42:56.440 --> 43:04.080]  ferricycle rules again the system is very good at telling you evil is admiring
[43:04.080 --> 43:09.280]  a woman or yeah and I'm not even saying in the final equation if you're betrothed
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.360]  obviously that is bad because then it hurts children but the idea that life
[43:13.360 --> 43:20.600]  the lover of life is not the sinner it's very important to understand that it's
[43:20.600 --> 43:28.160]  the haters of life those that kill steal and destroy that's evil that's sin war
[43:28.160 --> 43:39.880]  is sin when it is started period offensive war is absolute pure distilled
[43:39.880 --> 43:49.440]  evil and this nation has this pride in in offensive war I see men that get a
[43:49.440 --> 43:53.880]  gleam in their eye like like the f-16s and the drones the predators the
[43:53.880 --> 44:01.680]  reapers and the black uniforms all the power oh you're so powerful oh see they
[44:01.680 --> 44:12.560]  worship the dark flame of evil they worship the majesty of death I say
[44:12.560 --> 44:24.520]  there's no majesty in it all the only majesty in death is when you've laid
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.040]  down your life for innocence that's the only majesty in death but death
[44:30.040 --> 44:40.400]  wantonly spilled out against life for the sake of death is pathetic in fact
[44:40.400 --> 44:47.240]  radio listeners and I'll get to the news I will draw a image of the devil I
[44:47.240 --> 44:51.160]  think I should start because images are powerful you know the government wants
[44:51.160 --> 44:55.720]  me these big marble buildings and Air Force one and secret service guys with
[44:55.720 --> 45:01.360]  aggressive James Bond stances and the president strutting and everything's a
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.600]  big act and oh the government's invincible and huge and beautiful and
[45:06.600 --> 45:14.160]  unstoppable it's all a hoax and a fraud and the culture builds up the devil is
[45:14.160 --> 45:22.960]  this incredibly powerful entity the devil is a crazed-eyed person creature
[45:22.960 --> 45:26.880]  that looks about like a concentration camp victim with with with with plus
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.840]  dripping out of its little vampiric mouth let me draw a image of the devil
[45:30.840 --> 45:42.800]  here for you that's a pus dripping out the eye this is what the devil looks
[45:42.800 --> 45:51.920]  like and that's why the devil wants to make you spiritually look like that as
[45:51.920 --> 46:01.160]  well that's why the devil wants to pull everything down and tell you that what
[46:01.160 --> 46:08.040]  is good is bad and what is bad is good that black is white that up is down that
[46:08.040 --> 46:16.040]  wrong is right all right let me just give you the news here this story is viral
[46:16.040 --> 46:25.400]  KJC KJCT passengers could be asked to give drink samples the TSA the TSA would
[46:25.400 --> 46:29.600]  not say why they're testing for or why they're doing it but travelers say they
[46:29.600 --> 46:35.360]  have a right to know okay what Watson saw this story wrote about it went viral at
[46:35.360 --> 46:41.680]  that point today but my issue here with this is that I thought long and hard when
[46:41.680 --> 46:44.080]  I saw this this morning because we've talked about this this has been going on
[46:44.080 --> 46:51.400]  at least three years I at Austin Bergstrom and other airports Atlanta also at
[46:51.400 --> 46:56.760]  Liberty they're in New Jersey I have seen them and I'm sure you've all seen
[46:56.760 --> 47:01.080]  anybody I'm sure there's footage of it out there they have carts now at the gate
[47:01.080 --> 47:06.200]  you've already gone to the checkpoint and they've got people now at the actual
[47:06.200 --> 47:09.640]  gate bugging their eyes out at you with their hands behind their back like
[47:09.640 --> 47:12.760]  they're intimidating you that's what it's all about they admit that their
[47:12.760 --> 47:18.080]  internal memos to quote be imperious imperial overlording it's to get you
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.080]  perping it's to train non-criminal classes of people that your criminals it's
[47:22.080 --> 47:26.760]  to induct you into bureaucrats putting their hands on you this is the breaking
[47:26.760 --> 47:32.960]  just like a pedophile you know touches a child to test they're just hiking their
[47:32.960 --> 47:38.640]  leg on you and marking you as their whore they are your pimp they are your
[47:38.640 --> 47:45.840]  master now they are breaking you they are bringing you on the journey to total
[47:45.840 --> 47:58.000]  serfdom slavery servitude chattel bond slaves they're teaching you to fear them
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.320]  and it's freaking everybody out because I guess they're expanding it everywhere
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.960]  but I've seen it I've seen it almost every time I fly pushing around carts
[48:05.960 --> 48:09.360]  testing for things and I've seen it Austin Berkstrom said this had to be
[48:09.360 --> 48:16.680]  like two years ago I was sitting there eating barbecue before I got on the
[48:16.680 --> 48:22.480]  plane Salt Lake barbecue and they were coming along with a cart and they came
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.840]  over to a woman they always said wolves are attracted to people that they think
[48:26.840 --> 48:30.760]  are weak a woman with children and asked for her water and she looked at him and
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.120]  she pointed she was about 30 feet away but I could watch her she was you watch
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.760]  what she was saying couldn't really hear at all and she was pointing going I
[48:36.760 --> 48:40.600]  bought it here I've already gone through the checkpoint and they blow it up and
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.920]  they said give it to me and then they decided you know what just take a drink
[48:45.920 --> 48:52.200]  and so she took a drink and I've watched other people get real apologetic I've
[48:52.200 --> 48:54.640]  watched them with two ounces of something which is they're allowed to take
[48:54.640 --> 49:00.960]  on scream at them in bellings this is their religion and so now people are
[49:00.960 --> 49:06.800]  starting to wake up to what's happening but TSA demands bizarre new power to
[49:06.800 --> 49:09.760]  test drinks purchased in airports I mean I could open the phones up right now
[49:09.760 --> 49:15.200]  taking limited calls you've all seen it business travelers you've seen it I fly
[49:15.200 --> 49:19.640]  out of Austin I fly out anywhere now there's a guy at the gate out there
[49:19.640 --> 49:25.040]  checking things as you're lined up or right at the fuselage as you go down the
[49:25.040 --> 49:30.600]  gangway out there'll be a person bugging their eyes out at you and so you can't
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.920]  bring your own drinks through so you go through you know you want to you want to
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.000]  sandwich you want a bottle of water you get it you're about to make a six-hour
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.960]  flight or whatever the case is four-hour flight
[49:44.400 --> 49:50.560]  and they come over and I've also seen them once in a food court this was a
[49:50.560 --> 49:57.120]  Atlanta and there were people that was like a Burger King and McDonald's I
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.580]  honestly don't remember which container I mean which company it was when it
[50:00.580 --> 50:04.920]  was a paper cup with the top and they walked over and we're talking to people
[50:04.920 --> 50:09.280]  and demanding a sample to test that the people were going what it's about hey
[50:09.280 --> 50:14.200]  everything you do is wrong everything you do is criminal and the more obscene
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.080]  the more ridiculous the better why do you think in the Marine Corps when you're
[50:18.080 --> 50:23.480]  going through drill camp they make you do all sorts of weird things you've seen
[50:23.480 --> 50:26.360]  in full metal jacket where they have to do weird things this is my rifle this is
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.040]  my gun this is fighting this is fun that actually at least in the past went on
[50:31.040 --> 50:37.520]  weird sexual stuff and things it's about if I say jump you say how high yes a
[50:37.520 --> 50:41.600]  boss and if you don't say it I'm gonna knock you upside your head with this
[50:41.600 --> 50:48.920]  bullwhip how does that sound you understand that and it's all cult
[50:48.920 --> 50:51.800]  programming after you've been broken down then you're told you're no longer
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.000]  worm worm garbage you're now you know you step and fetch it to TSA they're
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.440]  gonna treat you nice now we come back Liberty lovers are the main terrorist

[54:15.240 --> 54:20.000]  amongst other things but Rob do I saw Rob do down by the water cooler and he
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.560]  said oh yeah you know you have us fly a lot to interviews we see that all the
[54:23.560 --> 54:28.000]  time well next time get footage of it because all the time I saw the new
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.920]  zombie rounds they're selling like three months ago all it is a super double
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.120]  odd buck basically military type buck shot it doesn't bigger kick when you
[54:37.120 --> 54:40.480]  pull the trigger and I thought man that's a good news article I bought some
[54:40.480 --> 54:44.080]  it to have the guys do it a month later it was big national news we got to go
[54:44.080 --> 54:47.680]  with our instincts not just to get big national news but what's important right
[54:47.680 --> 54:50.000]  by why never did anything with the zombie rounds why is that really
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.640]  important well it shows how they're getting in this whole zombie culture and
[54:52.640 --> 54:56.160]  how what they program people start to behave like they're making a zombie
[54:56.160 --> 54:59.560]  theme park in Detroit right now exactly and then that was my next point I meant
[54:59.560 --> 55:05.640]  to cover that on Monday but but on this TSA front it's about mindlessly doing
[55:05.640 --> 55:09.960]  what they say they now even do searches at the gate why did I never videotape
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.520]  that because that's never been on the news what I mean they do swabbing but
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.120]  you have seen what I'm talking about but you saw something I haven't seen where
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.200]  people beg to prove their their minions right and see that's the behavior
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.120]  they're looking for Stockholm syndrome tell folks what you saw it was
[55:24.120 --> 55:27.840]  literally bizarre waiting in line to get in as a Southwest Airlines flight and
[55:27.840 --> 55:31.880]  they had the TSA I remember where it was in Austin it was in Austin we were
[55:31.880 --> 55:35.160]  taking off somewhere I think I was with Aaron probably with Aaron because we
[55:35.160 --> 55:41.640]  traveled the most together and we're I remember seeing the cart and you know
[55:41.640 --> 55:44.560]  they walk up to someone sir let me check your drink and they hold the little
[55:44.560 --> 55:49.240]  the little slip over it whatever it's got it detects for bomb residue and they
[55:49.240 --> 55:52.480]  hold that over the drink and they say okay you can cap it up and they did it to
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.440]  somebody else and then this old lady walks up she is can you test mine it's
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.920]  literally this old little old lady voice some I couldn't believe it you know
[55:59.920 --> 56:02.960]  we're actually walking to get on the plane and I didn't want to you know
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.520]  obviously I didn't want to get drugged into a surge or I would have saved it but
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.840]  next time I'll just tape it and we'll just let the chips forward I mean it's
[56:08.840 --> 56:11.520]  easy just get it up and get a good job because people because I mean this was
[56:11.520 --> 56:14.920]  now I'm quote breaking I've seen this at least for three years oh yeah yeah this
[56:14.920 --> 56:17.960]  was this was a while back because I haven't traveled in a while and it was
[56:17.960 --> 56:21.920]  in sort of in the middle of when we were traveling you know since when I was on
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.440]  that jag getting video everybody for like two films I never made exactly we
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.600]  just aired all the interviews anyways a lot of good interviews I mean and you
[56:29.600 --> 56:35.440]  know what I like about that is that we usually when we do a video our DVD you
[56:35.440 --> 56:38.200]  don't get to see the whole interview you know they get to see like parts of it
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.040]  well here you get to see the whole thing and a lot of information that people are
[56:41.040 --> 56:43.400]  putting out there that's why people that's why I haven't made a film in two
[56:43.400 --> 56:47.360]  years I mean we make films every week they're like 20 minutes long an hour
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.120]  long we're just blasting in all directions production quality is even
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.960]  higher it's just blasting blasting blasting but I do need to make a film
[56:53.960 --> 56:57.120]  just because they get seen 30 40 million times instead of a half million
[56:57.120 --> 57:01.280]  million times but you add up all the little films it's more views which is
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.360]  what I want is to get the word out right but but the films it does have this
[57:04.360 --> 57:09.040]  event feeling for whatever reason people see it as a film it's time to go watch
[57:09.040 --> 57:13.040]  it get everybody together and yeah yeah but I mean every day is a film every day
[57:13.040 --> 57:16.360]  as you know we have like some days three hour long nightly news now you know I
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.760]  watch dreams of my real father this morning I got up at seven I'm like
[57:19.760 --> 57:23.080]  well nobody's up I'm gonna watch this and I watched it I was blown away by it I
[57:23.080 --> 57:28.120]  really you've been so busy you know why I was flipping out then yeah exactly by
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.680]  the way we have in the TSA shirts not just in the Fed shirts available at
[57:32.680 --> 57:38.520]  info wars.com and info warshop.com that supports us and other reason I say
[57:38.520 --> 57:43.440]  that is we have dreams my real father it's not even on sale till July 24th we
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.640]  got contacted by the filmmaker and they've been allowed to sell it early I
[57:47.640 --> 57:50.640]  don't know why they just drop that and I never even asked the guy why are you
[57:50.640 --> 57:55.080]  letting me just sell it first I know you're the tip of the spear I guess
[57:55.080 --> 57:57.920]  that's a good good good thing for everybody because that's we got a big
[57:57.920 --> 58:03.360]  gas tank to fill around here info warshop.com or 888-35-33139 but but
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.120]  a good it's good now that this is breaking I mean I'm not like oh this is
[58:07.120 --> 58:11.640]  going on three years well it's finally local news covers it so now it's real
[58:11.640 --> 58:16.520]  right now now we're allowed to talk about it right because KJ CTA said so
[58:16.520 --> 58:20.920]  they gave us permission I mean remember TSA for years that we don't grow up I
[58:20.920 --> 58:24.920]  just go down the pants I mean that's not grumping yeah right victims start
[58:24.920 --> 58:28.000]  crying that's their problem right because you have to they have to tell you
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.440]  when something something is a problem but but but again TSA won't say why they
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.360]  do it well in the whole ashes spilling incident to where they they dump and
[58:35.360 --> 58:43.520]  then I'm gonna yell at the guy and then laugh at it because it's about power this

[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.920]  burned again this baby super burned that's when a sheepdog attacked me when
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.960]  I was a kid and I punched him in the mouth I mean this this whole hand I've
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.720]  got just cuts all over it looks like a farmer's hands you ever seen a farmer's
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.720]  hands and those Homeland Security reports they've got the new one out saying
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.800]  Liberty Lovers or Terrorists but that's just a repeat of all the other ones and
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.280]  they say if somebody comes in to the gun shop to the barber shop I mean there's
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.000]  there's hundreds of these flyers we've shown them to you they're public on the
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.360]  FBI's website people don't believe they're really mean they're on it and it
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.480]  says if a farmer comes in has got cuts on their hands go ahead and call the
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.640]  police really oh it says if they are got missing limbs go ahead and put them
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.720]  just everything suspicious we got to check the bottle water you bought after

[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.080]  go to some far farmer meeting in the town near you and I would bet one out
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.640]  of five farmers there is missing at least a finger or a toe or a foot or an
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:18.760]  arm but see it's bad it's bad bad bad bad to be missing a digit all of you are

[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.280]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:28.240]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen we are joined by the man who
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.320]  created world net daily a pioneer in alternative constitutional media
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.520]  pioneering media period and of course he worked in ran newspapers magazines for
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.920]  many years before that he is a true pioneer and I am honored to have him on
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.960]  the show it I know years ago we tried to get him on and I guess we were just
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.040]  going to the wrong place or whatever whenever able to but then when I was up
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.880]  at Bilderberg a month ago world net daily WND.com contacted my office and
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.920]  said hey we're literally three miles and they were or less from where Bilderberg
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.960]  is being held come on over and went over to their a really cool command center
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.800]  I mean my place it looks like some kind of military bunker or something not on
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.520]  purpose people would expect to look like that was just an old rehab warehouse
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:20.640]  this place was just really an awesome looking newsroom with you know activity
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.560]  buzzing and you know people all wearing suits going around doing stuff so a
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.040]  first-class operation but it's not what world in daily looks like inside that
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:36.440]  impressed me it's it's the fact that they were it back in you know 96 97 98 other
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.400]  than the drudge report which broke a lot of news but also linked to things they
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.520]  were it and so continuing to grow into publishing and radio and news reporters
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.120]  TV they do it all and it's good to not be lonely I mean it should be scary if we
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:00.200]  were it folks there's not many there's drudge there is world net daily newsmax
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.760]  a little bit but it's it's just really changed over the years into just
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.000]  absolute mainline Republican I'm not bashing them it's just not what it was
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.760]  and so that's it I mean I mean there's not really a lot out there that that can
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.680]  really get a story out there's thousands of great outlets out there doing great
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.960]  reporting but there's only a few that can punch a story punch a story out there
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.040]  and here I am interviewing myself now saying things about Joe and you know I
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.280]  don't usually wax about a guest on and on Joseph Farah keep calling him Joe I
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.320]  got an uncle named Joe's name Joseph I call him Joe Joseph Farah of world net
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:43.960]  daily Joseph tell us about yourself because a lot of people heard you on
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.280]  national TV or radio and you never really talk about yourself where does
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.720]  Joseph Farah come from what made you a trailblazer what woke you up and then
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.760]  out of all the topics the government takeover of health care the big news
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:06.000]  you're gonna be breaking with Sheriff Arpaio Joe Arpaio coming up in the next
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.480]  few weeks of all the things going on I'm gonna ask you what you think is most
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.440]  important but first off tell us about yourself well I'm glad we get an hour
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.560]  because I love talking about myself but but first of all Alex let me tell you
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.400]  what what an honor it is to be with you I feel like I finally arrived you know
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:27.360]  I've done I've done all the Fox shows and all of the you know big radio shows
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.800]  but I've never been on the Alex Jones show so I know that I I finally arrived
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:39.120]  what can I say now I've arrived with with a Joe Farah with us so again tell us
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:45.160]  about what made you I mean well here's my story and in that show grew up a kid
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.160]  in you know New York suburbs and really from the early my earliest memories was
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.320]  I knew I wanted to write I loved writing I didn't know exactly what kind of
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.680]  writing but I you know as a kid I would write short stories things like that
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.800]  just always love that and as I got a little bit older and gotten to college
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:14.000]  Watergate was taking place and of course you you probably remember no Alex you
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.520]  don't remember this I keep forgetting how young you're a kid compared to me but
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.640]  for those listeners who remember the Watergate era they will remember that
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.680]  this was but you know the big story the all-consuming story across the nation
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.800]  and you know a major role was played by two reporters for the Washington Post and
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.720]  if you if you you know you go back and look at that time period of the mid-1970s
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:50.120]  late 1970s the most attractive job in the entire world for people my age was to
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.400]  become a reporter you know an investigative reporter who could you
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.600]  know change the country for the better root out corruption and fraud and waste
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.640]  and abuse and all these terrible things that we see going on in government so
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.120]  this looks very attractive to me and when I saw the movie all the presidents men
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.600]  you know with Robert Redford and and Dustin Hoffman playing Woodward and
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:20.440]  Bernstein I envisioned myself up there on that big screen and I was off to the
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.600]  races so that's what I studied in college and when I got out I fully
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.000]  expected that the New York Times would be waiting to hire me but that wasn't the
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.880]  case and I found out I had a you know start at the bottom working at a weekly
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:41.400]  newspaper and you know which was great because you learn to do a lot of things
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.360]  that you would never get to learn to do at a big newspaper graduated to you know
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:54.520]  the dailies and and kind of got a break in 1979 when through some acquaintances I
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:02.040]  had made I got a chance to go to Los Angeles and get a job at the Herald
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.800]  Examiner which was at the time one of the biggest papers in the country with the
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:14.000]  Hurst Cup Corporation biggest paper and I very quickly rose through the ranks not
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.520]  because I was you know I'm not gonna tell you because I was the most talented
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.000]  person in the newsroom but I will tell you this Alex I think it had a large
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.560]  degree up to a large extent it had to do with my world view I had a world view
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:36.560]  that was different from anybody else in that newsroom and practically any other
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:43.200]  newsroom in the country which stemmed in large part due to the fact that I'm a
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:49.800]  Christian and you know so I you know I see the world as a Christian and a lot
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.120]  of people back then you know my colleagues well you know what you're a
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.760]  Christian well aren't you biased and I say well everybody's biased you know but
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:05.440]  my bias is to pursue the truth because the Bible tells us you know you seek the
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.000]  truth and it will set you free so that has always been my bias what's true
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  what's real and anyway that different world view positions me to see stories
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.120]  that my colleagues never saw they never saw them coming and and so this put me
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:29.440]  in good favor with my boss they didn't know why but they knew this kid you know
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.920]  this 20-something-year-old kid was always coming up with stories and nobody
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:41.760]  else could figure out and so I by the time I was 27 I was running the
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.800]  newsroom of the Los Angeles Herald examiner and so it was you know it's
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.980]  funny because a lot of people think well you were a Christian you must have
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:57.840]  faced you know terrible hostility and bias in the mainstream secular media and
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.400]  I saw no actually it was the opposite it was like an advantage because I was you
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.840]  know out of 200 people in our newsroom I think I was only one who was a Christian
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.360]  and so therefore it was like a great advantage and that that surprises a lot
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:20.040]  of folks so from there I went on to get an opportunity to actually run
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:25.960]  daily newspapers in major markets in Southern California Northern California
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:33.760]  my last stop being the Sacramento Union which was the oldest paper west of the
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.880]  Mississippi at the time and a very competitive small market actually only
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.440]  a million people in Sacramento but I had two newspapers and so we I did my best
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:52.360]  to try to turn that around but the by the 1990s early 1990s when I was in
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:58.160]  Sacramento I could see that this industry that I loved so much newspapering
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.400]  was the only thing I wanted to do Alex from the time I was a kid and I saw this
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.480]  industry industry contracting and being corrupted by all kinds of negative
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.480]  forces and it made me very sad at the one hand but it also made me desperate
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:22.480]  to try to find a solution so you saw the death of the dinosaur media way before
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.360]  the dinosaurs themselves saw it probably because of your Christian discernment
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.320]  because if people blind themselves they a lot of themselves briefly as we're
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.840]  about to go to break and I want to get into Bill Clinton and you know all that
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.440]  coverage in the beginning of world that daily then I want to shift gears and what's
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.040]  happening currently Joseph Farah the founder and the head of world that daily
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.240]  is our guest right now but what were some of the things corrupting it I mean
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.120]  the fact that real muck raking was out because you know so few companies own
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.760]  things you didn't want to make advertisers mad I mean absolutely
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.000]  investigative reporting was was hardly done because it was expensive to do it
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.760]  but yet it was signed reporters to you know for long periods of time to do
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.400]  things big corporations wanted that you know dominated the industry they were
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.120]  just a handful of big corporations that owned all newspapers they demanded to
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:18.640]  make at least 30% profits every year and it was just a bad situation
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.760]  distribution problems you know people spreading out not living in cities
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.160]  anymore but the city's expanding into suburbs event you had a truck newspapers
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.080]  hundreds of miles to get them to people wanted to have all of those things
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.000]  combined in the distribution side really opened my eyes because I said I got a
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.120]  chance living near the Silicon Valley to see the emerging technologies that
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.960]  were coming and I said to myself there's a day is coming very soon where we're
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.240]  not going to need this newsprint these big barrels of ink and all this heavy
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:59.120]  manufacturing equipment to get the news out to people so I was ready for it
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.960]  when the internet came along I want to see when we come back where you think
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.880]  it's going now because I know it makes what's left of the dinosaur media not
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.960]  arrogant anymore more like a cornered psychotic monkey or something what
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:20.120]  they're gonna do to try to defeat wnd.com info wars.com drudge report.com
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.480]  I mean they've got a really I mean I know they hate us and I know they hate you
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.560]  but they've really got a hate drudge I mean you see it they hate not being able
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.040]  to control perception they hate the fact that he's their number one tip sheet
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:40.400]  that they can't ignore them we're gonna come right back with Joseph Farrah I'm

[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.160]  here's a song radio network Joseph Farrah
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:45.680]  joseph be good
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:25:01.040]  and he can read and write very well all right we are back live we've got to the
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.520]  founder of world net daily on he's broken some in a giant national
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.480]  international stories with real investigative reporting you can
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.320]  disagree with some of their political views or whatever that isn't what
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.480]  matters the point is I'm sure Joseph disagrees with some of the things I say
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.280]  and do the point is he's a maverick and he's real and he's in charge of his
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.760]  operation that is so rare today even with the big internet out there to have
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.440]  something that's powerful and independent oh there's lots of things out
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.400]  there that you know again I don't want to get off into it all day it's just so
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.960]  interesting to actually have real independent groups out there and I
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.000]  think that's where we left it off this is your short segment Joseph Longman
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.800]  coming up to get into the you know current issues that are happening but
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.680]  since you as a trailblazer were able to see where things were going and
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.520]  positioned things show that you were able to be a major force when you've
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.040]  already been one before but even bigger where do you see things going in the
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.160]  future boy I wish I knew but I think that you're on the cutting edge Mr. Jones
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.680]  for one thing I really admire what you're doing with the television stuff
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.200]  and I think you know we all recognize that a lot of people access
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:14.040]  information in different ways and and I think you're doing a heck of a job with
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.280]  that you know kind of being in both worlds print and TV and of course on
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.920]  radio I think that's that's what it's going to take if we're gonna have to be
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.960]  more diversified in what we do when we started world met daily we were
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.240]  essentially a newspaper online and that isn't gonna make it anymore anymore
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.080]  any any more than the newspapers could make it you've got to get the
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.600]  information to the people in the way that they want to get it and that that's
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.280]  mobile devices it's all kinds of things might be you know on television on Roku
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.680]  on whatever and you're doing it all and I think you're doing a heck of a job and
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.640]  we're frankly gonna be emulating that model not to compete with you guys but
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:03.360]  it's just a reality of what we got to do oh hey listen listen Joseph I mean like
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.000]  when I was at your office I got to meet your wife and your great crew I don't
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.160]  see any of this is even competing this is about defeating the globalist because
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.720]  we don't have a future I mean the model that I've developed I don't even see it
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.200]  as a model it's any way I can get the word out to people I'm gonna use it
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.320]  because I don't want my guns being taken I don't want to be forcibly
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.280]  inoculated I don't want government-run health care with a bunch of eugenicists
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:33.120]  in control of it and now shifting gears into that how right we were Joseph you
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.400]  were again one of the first groups to really mainstream that a world
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.040]  government was coming now they're on CNBC saying we're conquered by foreign
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.720]  banks what do you make of this planetary corporate fascist system that funds
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.880]  communists at the grassroots to take over what do you make of this model what
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.840]  would you call it fascism that's what I mean that's the only name for it is not
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:02.680]  communism that's that's you know the left like to think that there's some kind
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.280]  of a distinction here but but when you've got major corporations in bed with
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.640]  government there's only one name for that look it up in the dictionary and it's
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:17.120]  fascism and we're headed you know the trend is to a worldwide fascist cabal
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.880]  and and so you and I and drudge and people like that need to stick together
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:29.000]  because I think the thing that unifies us all is we are dead set opposed to that
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.160]  we believe in free enterprise we believe in freedom of speech we believe in a
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:42.960]  healthy and lively public debate on issues and there are no sacred cows and
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.640]  we don't like to TSA groping our wives and children yeah especially our children
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:55.920]  I've seen it before my own eyes and you've done a heck of a job in championing
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.240]  that story very proud of what you've done well my children want to go on an
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.360]  airplane but I can't physically watch them do it to them so I can't I mean it's
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.360]  not like I choose not to fly with my family I can't hardly I watch children
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.160]  coming drug away separated start crying and then the TSA coming bow up in this
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:20.760]  weird perv posture and that's why and then I'm seething with anger for weeks
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.360]  Joseph so I mean you know this is really upsetting me yeah we thought we thought
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:34.320]  more than 10 years ago even but you know well before even 2009 11 with one of
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.560]  our own three teen daughters and my wife can tell you about that experience some

[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:40.440]  now before we get into the economy and before we get into all the other things
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.680]  that are happening of the health care takeover what else is front and the
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:50.200]  center that you'd like to talk about Joseph well gee that's that's a tough
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.800]  one I mean to me I think this fast and curious thing which you mentioned
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:35:00.400]  earlier is probably one of the the biggest government scandals I have ever
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.440]  witnessed in my lifetime if you think about it you know nobody died at Watergate
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.880]  you know yeah I mean we we took out the president of the United States over that
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.520]  but in this case what we've got is a situation where it seems more and more
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.200]  clear every day that this was a government operation with the the
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.760]  motivation behind it to disarm Americans and to make the case against
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.880]  individual ownership of firearms for Americans and the sneaky way they did
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.440]  that was to show how nasty these guns are because they're too available in
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.720]  America so we we let them go over the Mexican border they wind up in the hands
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.280]  of drug cartels that people get murdered and you know the scenario worked out
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:51.320]  just the way they planned it except for the fact that it blew up in their face
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:57.200]  to a certain extent because the American people found out about it and but you
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.240]  know this is you talk about impeachable offenses I mean this is beyond
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:08.800]  impeachable this is treason of the highest order and it's not doesn't stop
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.840]  at Eric Holder because we've all seen this we've all seen the you know the
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:18.920]  videos of in the White House in 2009 when the White House was saying the
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:24.360]  president directed this and he directed that and this goes right to the very top
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:32.120]  and so to me that that's one of those burning issues I get very angry when I
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.360]  read about the fast and furious scandal well I agree with you but also I get
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.080]  very concerned as you do I know this shows well we were really right I mean
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.880]  this is the same crew that was all over Oklahoma City I know Worldnet Daily's
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.320]  one of the few places that's got credibility that's had the courage to
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.840]  report on what really went on there but layer after layer of government
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:01.240]  controlled operations I mean you can't doubt that and of course now that's what
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:09.440]  lends so much credence to other false fags if you go back to Oklahoma City by the way Alex that's the first time when the media and the
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.680]  political establishment started pointing the fingers at guys like you and me and
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:20.040]  even Rush Limbaugh you know this this was the the right wing thing that was
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.160]  right wing anti-government thing now we hear that almost on a daily basis from
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.440]  the government where's the danger to Americans coming from latest DHS report
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:37.120]  once again shows it's from you know right wing people who what they they value
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.360]  their freedom I mean can you imagine or the founding fathers not turning over in
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.840]  their graves when they hear government officials saying that the problem in
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.480]  America is we got too many freedom-loving people that's like saying the
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.200]  problem is the founding fathers the Bill of Rights the Constitution they're
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.320]  saying the fourth that you lies terrorists in fact here it is Americans
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:00.440]  this is from the report who believe their way of life is under attack you have to
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.240]  be under a rock to know that Americans who are fiercely nationalistic I mean
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.480]  what's the point of having a nation as opposed to universal or international
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.840]  in orientation meaning let foreign banks run you here's another one people who
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:15.760]  consider themselves anti-global presumably those who are wary the loss of
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:20.480]  sovereignty here's the best Americans who are suspicious of centralized
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.840]  federal authority that's all the founders anyone with a common sense or
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.680]  room temperature IQ and above Americans who are reverent this is a quote of
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.000]  individual liberty oh my gosh don't be reverent of individual liberty that's
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.800]  just that's I mean this is terrible you know in previous versions of these
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  reports have also singled out people who believe in the Bible and returning
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.920]  military veterans in other words all of the people you know who we value in this
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.960]  country people like you and I value in this country people who you know
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.800]  understand that we're supposed to be a self-governing nation of responsible
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.080]  individuals who take care of themselves and are self-reliant and don't depend
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.240]  on government we're the problem we're the enemy because the enemy has taken
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.600]  over and is diametrically opposed to any basic freedom evidenced but I mean
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.640]  even though you're informed I'm informed still to see it all happening
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.000]  world government run by banks government takeover of health care attacks to the
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.400]  insurance companies with these idiots thinking they're about to get a free
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.080]  handout what is your well I mean I'm getting back to the false flags this is
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.920]  a false flag fast and furious is a staged slow burn terror attack tens of
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.680]  thousands of guns and hand grenades to Mexico to blame the second amendment they
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.160]  got caught the as you know their own memos even CBS news covers it saying
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:48.280]  we're gonna use this to get anti-gun legislation passed they're caught they're
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.440]  caught but what's what's happening I mean you know I mean I know there's
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  there's things they can this whole congressional investigation to me is
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:01.640]  taken way too long way too long we got an election coming up in November
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.800]  when are we gonna see some justice done here when are we gonna see some results
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:11.960]  from all this well we're we're seeing in the court of public opinion though
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.120]  nothing has woken up people like fast and furious in my view and now Obama
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.880]  legalizing the illegals shutting down power plants outside of law and the
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.200]  health care your view your breakdown you're boiled down on on on the flip
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.480]  flopping of the Supreme Court what you what your intel because you're right
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.520]  there right by the Supreme Court in Virginia what do you think it really
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.520]  happened well my intel wasn't very good because I didn't expect is my and I
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.640]  listen I'm telling you I never thought that John Roberts was you know he was
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.480]  never in my opinion a Scalia and a Lito or a Thomas in his view I you know I
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.280]  he's always been more of an establishment Republican and you know he
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:00.440]  got so I never had high expectations from him but I thought you know if there
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.240]  was going to be a problem in this case that it would more likely be Kennedy
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:10.840]  then Robert's who you know if you look at their previous rulings Robert
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.880]  generally was with the other three Kennedy was the one swing vote so who
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.320]  would have expected that we'd get Kennedy and we'd lose Roberts I don't think
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.800]  anybody saw that comment but now of course as people are doing the
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.840]  diagnosis on this we learned that that you know he was with the he was with
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:36.960]  the Scalia and and he somehow got seduced by the liberals to go with him
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.760]  this happens when you're in Washington too long it happens you know what
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.840]  what do they call it in the Washington Post when when somebody with the
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.160]  conservative instinct starts to go the other way they call it oh he's growing
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:57.160]  he's growing right it means he likes to be invited to the right cocktail parties
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:02.720]  and in Washington and and likes being taken seriously by the major media
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:08.800]  that's what it means but that's all coming to an end being taken serious more
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.800]  and more by the mainstream prostitutes is a death sentence with the heart of
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.400]  this country and that's accelerating what do you expect the power structure to
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:25.600]  do because in my view and my analysis their credibility is draining away I
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.480]  mean how many armored vehicles how many hollow point bullets how many
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:34.200]  helicopters how many drones how many SWAT teams I mean we know the system knows
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.240]  we don't like them as they have a 9% approval rating in Congress and their
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.040]  answer is we're gonna arm to the teeth against you and say that mom and apple
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.000]  pie and George Washington or terrorist that's right well you know I think like
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.320]  you I have a lot of optimism because I have a lot of faith not necessarily in
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:55.800]  the majority of the American people anymore but in a very very healthy
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.920]  segment of the American people who are not gonna take this stuff laying down by
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:07.200]  the way Alex remember when you were in my office in Virginia one of my crew
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.800]  asked if you had ever seen the drone and you answered no you had I get back home
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.360]  within a week or two of that conversation I'm taking my dog for a walk and
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:27.920]  guess what I see right over the tree line right above my head is a drone so if
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.480]  anybody calls you crazy Alex for talking about drones you can just send them my
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:39.080]  way and because I've seen it with my own eyes I only wish I had my cell phone
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:43.760]  camera to get a picture of it that's why I haven't said anything about it
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:48.480]  publicly before now how high was it wasn't a lot wasn't high at all and you
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.080]  know I didn't even know I at first I didn't even I couldn't even make out
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.320]  what it was because it had such a weird sound it sounded like there was a lawn
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:01.600]  mower over my head and it looked like nothing I had ever seen before so I
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.560]  immediately jump on the Internet I start looking up drones and I'm seeing
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.840]  things that resemble what I saw and one of the characteristics I saw described
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:17.360]  was it can sound like a lawn mower over your head for crying out loud so that was
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.080]  my confirmation that for some reason and then I later found out that northern
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.640]  Virginia here they had they even the police department to use a drone and
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.840]  now they want to arm them and all over the country they've been using them for
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.720]  surveillance we found the EPA documents were in 2009 they were doing it and and
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.160]  they ran a national story saying info wars ran a hoax drudge picked it up
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.680]  so did world net daily all these other evil publications hundreds of articles
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.640]  nightly news shows media matters what a joke and then they played a straw man
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.840]  because the article we wrote also linked to a local story in the Dakotas where
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.760]  they were and other states where they were complaining about calling them
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.440]  drones because they just arrested those cattle wrestlers alleged cattle wrestlers
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.080]  using a predator but then they conflated it mixed it in with the EPA
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.800]  sessons they're using to spy on farmers the point is they're spying with
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.360]  everything and they spun it with a straw man that we'd made it up when they're
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.480]  announcing 30,000 of them in the FAA budget in the next decade and they're
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.080]  launching all over the place I mean here's another example of this and I
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:29.720]  want to ask you what is this tactic I mean what type of disdain do they have
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:35.040]  for the public Joseph Farrell of worldnetdaily.com because the inspector
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:41.520]  general comes out they have the the supreme court say it it is a tax that
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.960]  the IRS takes from me but then they call it a penalty or something and then
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.000]  Obama's people say no it's not a tax it's a penalty and then they play this
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.800]  mind game I mean what is this like there's not drones there's not an IRS tax
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:00.000]  and health care that's right who are you supposed to believe me or your own eyes
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.720]  Obama tells us no no no it's not a tax then we get the Supreme Court saying it's
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:11.760]  constitutional because it's a tax it is just unbelievable as you know or well
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.120]  was just a little bit early you know ahead of the curve with 1984 because now
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:23.880]  we see this kind of news speak all the time in the 21st century I'm seeing it
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.080]  more and more I mean literally they're just offering the public join the
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:34.600]  illusion everything's okay as scores of Texas police departments and and
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.960]  sheriff's departments announced Houston did this years ago they're getting them
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:43.320]  they're weaponizing them it's in the Houston Chronicle and then they're
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.360]  running national news stories in hundreds of papers Joseph saying we made
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.720]  that story up and I'm just like what is the disconnect here right and you know
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:56.880]  the real question is what is the purpose of these things you know the one I saw
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.400]  for instance is over here I don't live in the city okay I don't live in a
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.640]  populated area I live in one of the most rural places you could possibly live
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.960]  in and in northern Virginia and there could only be one thing that this drone
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.040]  was spying on and that would be me that would be my property because there's
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.800]  just no nothing else around except wood and deer unless they were doing a deer
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:25.680]  count with that drone they were up there to look at what I was up to wow this is
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.080]  breaking news we've got to get a report out on this not only did did you see one
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.040]  of the little drones that they've had on the news they admit sound like a lawnmower
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.920]  the little feet on the bottom right but but you live in a rural area and you
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.920]  were out walking and it was obviously looking for something on your property
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:46.440]  probably harassment this is a well you are a terrorist I mean you you do love
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:54.960]  liberty right guilty is charged oh man you know we got our work head out for us
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:01.160]  and you know more and more it I recognize that the Liberty lovers out
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:05.880]  there really have to stick together like you said you know we might agree
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.320]  disagree on this topic or that topic fundamentally if you if you are a
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  Liberty lover we got to stick together or we're gonna hang together as our
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.160]  founder said and I remember and I probably told you this story when you
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:30.440]  were visiting our offices a few weeks ago that before I started WND in 1997
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.080]  I there's no question I mean we were inspired by what Drudge had been doing
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:41.960]  for a year or two at that point and I called up Drudge to tell him what I was
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.960]  about to do and I and I told him that I wasn't doing it to compete with him I
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.920]  had you know a little bit different spin on how I was going to do it I spent my
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.000]  whole career in journalism was going to try to utilize some of that experience
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.200]  and you know I told him I see the internet particularly as a cooperative
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:08.040]  medium much more than a competitive medium so you know when when Alex Jones
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:14.880]  promotes Drudge and Drudge promotes Farrah and Farrah promotes Jones it all
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.000]  works together for the benefit of all of us and it's just something to keep in
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.400]  mind and I know that that is true of all the organizations out there the Tea
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.920]  Party organization one thing I can't stand about this Tea Party thing is what
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.480]  why are all these different Tea Party groups you know why don't they get
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.520]  together why don't they get together on it you know and and and stop competing
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.640]  with one another for yeah have like a declaration of independence where they
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.240]  get together convention get it together guys we you know what are the top ten
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.040]  most important issues and and let's focus on those what what's happened since
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:57.320]  2010 when when the Tea Party really awakened this country and and seemed to
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.400]  be shaking things up Joseph Farrah is our guest we've got one little five
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.400]  minutes segment left but I got him on five minutes late so we'll take him into
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.640]  five after into the next hour before Dr. Blalock joins us so we can talk about a
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.080]  few other issues but I have hope for this country it's just that the people
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.840]  that have taken it over are so vicious they'll stage terror attacks like the
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.160]  event that we saw with fast and furious to be able to take over and I'm sure you
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.200]  saw I'm gonna come back and ask you about this even Glenn Beck before he left
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.600]  Fox showing the Democratic internal fundraising letters and and Shapiro in
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.120]  the Financial Times of London saying a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 will save
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:41.120]  Obama oh my goodness yeah remember whatever they accused you of doing
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.640]  that's what they're doing that's the important thing to remember we can't
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:49.760]  even imagine the horrible things they haven't stored for us exactly I want to
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.760]  talk about that when we come back because if they're putting out news articles
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:56.560]  saying G a terror attack to blame our enemies would help they're the prime
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.400]  suspects if it happens we'll be right back

[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.440]  we are back we have this segment one more with the head honcho over at
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:28.960]  worldnetdaily.com WND.com I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com and
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:36.160]  prisonplanet.tv we're fighting the prison planet with the info war but we
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:39.800]  do have the power structure that sees this country building up and trying to
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:43.840]  use paramilitary forces against us that's why we've got to engage the police
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.920]  and military and educate them there's a reason the globalist of hijacked this
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.200]  nation are saying we're the terrorist and we're gonna talk to Joseph Farah
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.440]  about that here in a moment but here's how rowdy piper I guess he is a terrorist
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:01.280]  there's an alien occupying group in the fiction film they live occupying earth
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:06.560]  they've brainwashed the public and a drone flies over and he resists the drone
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.400]  and so you have to ask the police I mean if that scenario happened and like a
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:15.760]  Simpsons episode and a giant green lizard was at the podium would you submit
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:19.880]  to them this is an outside globalist takeover here's what rowdy piper does to
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.200]  drones
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:49.520]  all right there you go that rowdy piper has the music under it but yeah my point
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:53.280]  here is we're designed to face a foreign enemy like a Hitler or Stalin
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:00.400]  whatever but how do we face this economic sabotage and your concerns about
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.160]  the clear frame up that that different forces of globalism are preparing for
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.920]  American patriots who they know are aware of the game plan Joseph Farah right
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.840]  well remember we have to remember is that this is a game of control for them
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.800]  there there are people to you and I Alex I think I speak for you we don't want to
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.280]  control other people you know we might want to influence them certainly want
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.240]  to influence the book and we want to educate them but we don't want to control
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:32.520]  them but there are people in this world who actually want to control all of us
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:37.080]  they that's that's how they maintain their power and that's what we have to
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.480]  remember so we have to resist all attempts to control us whether they're
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.200]  telling us that our kids have to have these mandatory vaccines or you know
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:50.800]  whatever it were they tell us you know in order to get on an airplane you've
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:55.400]  got to be groped this is where the resistance starts because this is a
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:01.160]  this is part of conditioning for what is really the end game for them which is
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:05.240]  you know we're all going to be global citizens we don't have any say in and
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.000]  in our government and so forth it's everything our founding fathers fought
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.440]  again and we got to be like our founding fathers all over again and only
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:19.800]  question in my mind is whether we have the the fearlessness the courage and the
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:26.680]  convictions that they have to do that Joseph Farah well said very eloquent and
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:33.120]  very true Veritas have ever heard it does it the system overreach when FEMA I
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.440]  have it on video demonizes the founding fathers and all these training
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:41.320]  manuals don't they really show us that they really are the bad guys no
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.320]  question I know who the bad guys are you know who the bad guys are probably
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:48.840]  everybody listening to us right now knows who the bad guys are and they are
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.400]  exposing themselves every single day and and our main job is to help them
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.920]  expose themselves when they say these things and put them down in writing we
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.640]  got to show the whole world and we got to contrast that with what made this
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:10.360]  nation great hey yesterday was the 4th of July right yesterday was the day the
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:14.600]  Declaration of Independence was signed it's time for you know it's time for us
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:22.240]  to renew those vows that our founders took and mean it it is time to decide
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.600]  who we serve like the great Bob Dylan says you got to serve somebody you got
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.600]  to serve something and as for me in my house we want to serve liberty and
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:35.760]  justice and freedom not bondage and tyranny and drones and checkpoints we'll
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:45.400]  be right back in 60 seconds you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com

[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:42.880]  come out in court their own internal documents Dr. Russell Blalock joining us
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:49.200]  coming up in the next segment Joseph Farah again here with us now in closing I
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.880]  almost forgot I guess in a week and a half you've got big news Sheriff Joe
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:58.320]  Apio Maricopa County is gonna break it at World Net Daily saying that it's the
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:04.520]  biggest news yet on the Providence of Obama tell us a sneak peek of that and
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:08.200]  also who you really think he is because what we know is we don't know who he is
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.080]  we don't know who he is we're I don't even know if we're any closer to knowing it
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:17.520]  you know you talk about false flag this guy is a walking false flag he is the
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:23.680]  personification of nobody knows anything about this guy from from where he was
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:28.560]  born when he was born who his parents were how the heck is he using a
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.440]  Connecticut Social Security number all these years why is it that when you go
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.760]  to he verify for the guy who's sitting in the White House he comes up to
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:42.760]  somebody you can't hire in America I mean it's it's crazy stuff and one guy
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.800]  you know I've said all along we're not going to get to the bottom of this
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:51.080]  because the court action no judge in America is gonna have the guts to say
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.640]  that the guy sitting in the White House is not eligible to be there I've said
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.200]  that you know all along I admire people who pursue that route but and
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.480]  nevertheless that's just not gonna practical reality what Joe Apio is
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.960]  different this is the first law enforcement investigation of Obama's
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.960]  background it goes beyond even the eligibility questions that he's got into
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:21.960]  this social security stuff the draft card business and on July 17th he's going
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.880]  to be announcing his latest findings in this independent investigation and that
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:34.720]  will be live-streaming it on WNDTV so be sure to watch for that I honestly
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:39.480]  don't know many details of what's going to be coming out there even though you
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.680]  know our jury court is working very closely with the RPO
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:47.560]  well I just I mean I know it's great to build stuff up but I Breitbart's like
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:51.480]  I'm releasing the most incredible info tomorrow and he dies and they
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:55.080]  announce in like an hour and a half oh it's natural natural nothing to see here
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.760]  nothing to see here I mean I don't know what really happened there but if
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.920]  something happens to me like that folks I want a real investigation I want an
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:08.160]  autopsy I'm on the record right now cut me up Joseph publicly Joseph Farrell
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.240]  that's another final question for you you've already got drones out at your
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:17.520]  place tell us tell us a little bit about it threats harassment I mean I know I've
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.680]  gotten it you have had to have had some hurdles yeah many many many death threats
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:28.200]  over the years but you know the most substance of stuff that I can point to
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:35.720]  that's very real and it happened during the Clinton administration very early
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.240]  on in the Clinton administration even before I started world that daily the
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:45.120]  Clinton administration started auditing me and I began investigating what that
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:48.840]  was all about we determined guess what they were investigating all their
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.520]  enemies all the women who'd made accusations against all the conservative
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.440]  organizations in America everybody was getting audited who was an adversary of
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.240]  Bill Clinton and we exposed that well guess what happens again starting in
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:09.160]  2009 the audit train is I don't know if they hate you yet Alex but they they hit
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:15.080]  me and they dinged me just like this allowing every exemption I had on my
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.800]  tax form and I'm very careful you know and they don't even call it an audit
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.520]  they just start sending me letters saying you don't get this you don't get
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:29.000]  that give us more money so this is one of the tactics they use and look this is
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.920]  the this is the first term if he's reelected it's gonna be war oh they're
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:41.120]  openly saying they will be at war we will be hunted down like dogs Alex Jones
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:47.080]  just keep that in mind that's what the stakes are oh I don't want to end the
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:51.120]  interview now look I got come back on next week I want to hear strategy what

[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:06.120]  the GCN radio network
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:21.360]  it is now breaking in the news something that we've talked about years ago
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:26.680]  that I started witnessing the TSA now if you're getting a hamburger a drink
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:33.000]  anything after the checkpoints before you get on your plane they are now
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.600]  coming over and telling you to drink your drink they make women drink their
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:42.400]  breast milk if it's in a bottle drink Coca-Cola bottle water all about making
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.280]  you think you've done something wrong it's total garbage and now they're
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:53.240]  expanding out to the highways everywhere not just to the parking lots and
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:56.000]  again terrorists can hit the parking lot so now they got to be in the parking
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.580]  lot they could hit the road down the street now they've got a this is this
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:03.280]  is the takeover of society that's happening right now and then we have
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.220]  the other big article homeland security report list liberty lovers as
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:11.520]  terrorists Americans who are suspicious of centralized federal authority
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:21.680]  revert our or our reverent of individual liberty deemed domestic threat and that
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:26.880]  was a 12 million dollar funded 2011 program funded by the folks that run
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.760]  this country and they say in the report if you believe in the global
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.640]  government you're a terrorist I mean okay so if I read the Financial Times of
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:37.000]  London or CNBC two weeks ago where they announced yes we're ruled by a global
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  government run by banks they're unelected but we're lucky to have them so if
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.080]  you say world government's good and that banks running and are good well
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.080]  that's good then you're a normal good person but if you say I don't want that
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.560]  it doesn't exist and you're insane this is the double-speak it's kind of like
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:58.880]  they announced yeah it's a tax the IRS is gonna enforce health care and people
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.080]  say well we don't want to have a tax with the IRS they go it's not a tax it
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.160]  doesn't exist you're like but you the ruling says and the solicitor general
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:12.760]  and it's all on record and they just go no it's not you're crazy and you're like
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:16.440]  but that's a mind game you're playing and and again they know just to make it
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.840]  about the debate never admit to anything what a bill Clinton say
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.720]  deny deny deny deny that matter what they've got it matter what proofs just
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:30.440]  deny deny deny deny it'd be like driving up your house and burglars I've actually
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.440]  read about this this actually works with some people they're so suggestible now
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.640]  and mindless you can be walking out with their television sets their computers
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:41.920]  their jewelry and just hey you're what are you doing you're robbing me and most
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:47.640]  people if you're just real calm criminals cat burglars and folks have
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.360]  actually written books about this if you're just real calm and go no I'm not
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:54.400]  I'm just helping I'm helping Bobby just make up an end they'll be what yeah hey
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.760]  just go in and talk to me isn't there right now and it's like you don't need
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:02.960]  to see your identification these aren't the droids you're looking for move along
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.200]  these aren't the droids we're looking for move along you know the New World Order
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:09.480]  can have a strong influence on the weak-minded and they're like I'll send

[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:42.640]  get him on last week but it took us a while because he was busy to talk about
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.320]  the health care ruling and I'm gonna try to give him the floor I'll never shut
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:50.280]  up for the next few segments to give us his view his take as a retired brain
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.000]  surgeon who developed you know many of the procedures used today expert in
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.600]  nutrition who's written all these peer reviewed you know now part of the
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:03.440]  nomenclature of excitotoxins I mean really a trailblazer that's what we have
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.880]  on here is trail blazing mavericks that have been proven right and he said three
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:10.880]  and a half years ago that this is going to increase the amount of people getting
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:13.880]  the flu it's going to lower immunity it's going to cause neurological
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:20.080]  disorders the media attacking all confirmed in in triplicate over and
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.040]  over and over again he's pointed out with the studies they're even out there
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.840]  that many of the and we're gonna cover this after he talks about health care
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.560]  vaccines are actually causing it they had to admit in California most the
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:34.640]  whooping cough cases that they call an epidemic or from the shot most of the
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:40.480]  so-called polio now even CBS News admits is from the polio vaccine so all of this
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:44.320]  is happening and now natural news has this big breaking report and we have
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.240]  the documents from the court we're gonna show this later if you're watching on
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.200]  prisonplanet.tv if not just go to infowars.com or naturalnews.com murk vaccine

[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:07.760]  documents that it was actually giving people the pathogen and making them
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:13.600]  sick incredible and I'm springing this on dr. blalox I mean during we've got his
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.000]  email folks sending this article right now so you can read it during the next
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.560]  break if he hasn't seen it but he joins us now without further ado and again

[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.480]  name you'll get it again doctor thank you for coming on with us did you feel
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.640]  like you were sucker punched I mean I physically got nauseous which really
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:41.280]  never happens with even bad news when I got that ruling knowing the IRS is now
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.680]  going to be in my medical records and running my life even more the collection
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:47.920]  agency for the Federal Reserve what did you think the minute you got the news
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:53.480]  that morning sir well in this day and age hardly anything surprised me Alex
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:59.160]  I'm kind of like you that you can think of it they'll do it and if you you know
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:04.920]  a student of this and look at the history over the last several hundred years
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:10.440]  you see these are the type of proposals and events that are staged to bring
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:16.760]  about their utopian dream I was surprised that the Supreme Court did not
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:22.980]  rule this unconstitutional it was a surprise and particularly Robert
[02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:31.040]  Stan the conservative talking heads are trying desperately to justify what he's
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:38.160]  done but I think the careful analysis indicates that he made a very bad
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:45.080]  decision why he did it will be unveiled later I'm sure but this is going to
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:50.680]  affect everybody in the United States this could be the tipping point for the
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:56.040]  United States opposed to the position of Greece the cost of this is going to be
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:02.360]  just astronomical of course the international bankers who loan the money
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:08.320]  to fund these sort of things are loving this what the public doesn't realize
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.720]  most of your taxes do not go to run programs in the United States they go
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.800]  directly to pay the interest of the national debt only a very small percentage
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:25.240]  ever ends up in the federal coffers to pay for programs so every time one of
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.320]  these mega programs is created it's not your taxes they're going to be paying it
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.200]  your taxes will pay the interest on the money they borrow to fund the program
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.440]  this is true of Social Security of Medicare Medicaid all of these mega
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:49.160]  programs are funded by deficit spending not by direct taxation and that's the
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:53.160]  illusion people always say well my taxes can go up to pay for this and the
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:57.800]  conservatives are saying this is because a massive tax increase to pay for this
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:04.360]  well it is a massive tax increase the most massive in American history but
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:08.800]  it's not paying directly for your health care it's paying for the interest of the
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:13.800]  loan that they took from the international bankers to pay for the
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:19.640]  program nothing has ever done directly about taxes but that's an illusion you
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:29.280]  read Rasmussen's book about his analysis of this you see that he has all the
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.400]  numbers and data and figures to show you that indeed it's true so we need to get
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.760]  over this illusion that you're paying taxes to run the government I have a
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.200]  lot of friends who make a lot of money and they pay big taxes and they say
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:46.200]  well I don't mind supporting the country and doing my part and I said well would
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:52.360]  you mind if you find out that your taxes were not supporting the military and
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:57.000]  supporting highway building and Social Security if you find out your taxes
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.320]  we're just paying international bankers to loan fake money to the federal
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:05.120]  government to run these programs well then it's a whole different ball game
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.080]  they're not too happy well no I don't like the fact that you're taking my
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:18.000]  hard-earned income and giving it to international bankers so they can loan
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.280]  you fake money and that's what happens and take control of your life and
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:29.120]  announced did you see the CNBC clip where they said yes we're slaves to foreign
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:33.520]  banks and basically it's a wonderful thing yeah and and of course you know
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:43.560]  this was the big argument between FA Hayek back in the the 1920s and 30s and
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:49.760]  the socialists of the London School of Economics was that the idea of deficit
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.000]  spending was a good thing and when I grew up you know when you would argue
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.960]  about the cost of government people say well what difference does it make if we
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:02.920]  have a huge national debt we only owe it to ourselves because they thought that
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:09.680]  Federal Reserve was truly a government banking system but now that we know
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:15.520]  beyond any question that it's a it's a cartel of international bankers
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  many of which are foreign and not even American banks that are making these
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:27.440]  loans to the the American government to run its government well it's a different
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:33.320]  ball game it's an illusion it's a fraud and if any of us did that in our private
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:38.280]  lives or businesses we'd be charged with fraud and serve long prison term the
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:43.520]  federal government does it repeatedly and that they have the people thinking
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:49.160]  well we only owe it to ourselves we don't you know exactly and they position us
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:54.000]  into fraudulent debt and sign us on to their debts and then grandstand and tell
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.880]  us we shouldn't take hot showers because it makes the carbon you know hurt the
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:01.920]  earth while they literally live the lives of kings flying around their
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:09.240]  private jets it is beyond ridiculous well yeah and you look at you know any
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:17.600]  socialist system it's sold on the idea well you know planning is the much more
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:25.320]  prugal than an unpranned plan like they fare society but when you look at the
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:30.600]  history of socialism you see the exact opposite when the federal government or
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:35.600]  the state government does these things it costs hundreds if not thousands of
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:41.800]  times more than any private or creates corrupt insider groups that deliver total
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:48.440]  tyranny in hell right and you look at it you go through the so-called Obama

[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:07.200]  all right I want Dr. Blalock he's been a big critic of this government takeover
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:11.360]  of health care break this down he's absolutely right it is a tax mainly to
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:15.000]  the insurance companies you have the socialist idiots and people that just
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.800]  like the Obama supporters that said oh I'm getting a free house free car now you
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:22.680]  didn't get that did you and the very same interest fund all these people
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:27.880]  definitely though it's moving in high gear right now and it's all coming true
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:32.360]  I mean folks we're not just hauling and tyrants and authoritarians because we
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:37.320]  don't like what they're doing these are horrible bad people and I know most
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.160]  solicitors know that but I mean it's every day it has to sink in deeper to
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:45.720]  even me that hey this isn't a game that none of this is a game this isn't a
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:50.200]  joke okay this is this these are seriously bad people who want a
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:55.520]  reeducation purge of this country remember two months ago we get that army
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:00.800]  document about reeducation camps the army got press calls and came out and
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:04.080]  said yes that is our document and you're not supposed to have it it's
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:12.120]  restricted so and that's why they move by increment but at a certain point the
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:16.520]  water is boiling here dr. Blalock I'm gonna try to shut up please get into
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:20.520]  what this health care is gonna do from your expert inside view of what it's
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:23.360]  gonna do to health care overall of course their plan is to fully bankrupt the
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:28.040]  old system but tell us what you think's gonna happen now well you see a lot of
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:34.840]  people talk about this as a 2500 page bill and it was difficult for the
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:40.760]  congressman and senators to read through this massive bill and understand it
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:47.240]  well actually the bill is hundreds of thousands of pages if you actually read
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:53.720]  the thing what you see is on every page are references to other bills other
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:26:02.600]  laws other bureaucratic departments and directives so you have to read those to
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:08.040]  understand that section and they'll refer to another section so actually this is
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:14.080]  several hundred thousand pages that you'd have to read truly understand it
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:19.160]  but what you get from this is several things and of course if you read the
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:25.280]  history of this what they've wanted from the beginning you see that this is
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:30.200]  just designed to give a blank check to the federal government to fill in the
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:34.160]  blanks and they'll do what they want it's sort of like that blithering idiot
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:40.720]  Pelosi said we need to pass this bill so we can find out what's in it well you
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:46.240]  look at it it's a blank check you fill in the blanks but what it we know for sure
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:52.160]  what it does it punishes positions for caring for you if the physician gives
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:59.400]  too much care he punished it gives the government great latitude in being a
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.960]  determined what specialty of position goes in and even to retrain physicians
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:10.560]  that already in a specialty you may say well we don't need any more gastroenterologists
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:15.640]  we're gonna make you a general practitioner and we don't need any more in
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:19.080]  your area the country we need some of North Dakota so you need to thank your
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.880]  family and move to North Dakota well this isn't time this guy this is something
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:28.960]  they've been dreaming about writing about for for over a century that there's a
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.200]  mild distribution of position there's too many in the wrong specialties and we
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:38.520]  need more general practitioners and so they they've written these plans
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:44.240]  repeatedly in this bill allows that a lot of talk about the death panels well
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:52.520]  what it it says in there in specific languages that will have a panel that
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:28:00.800]  will discuss with the family and the patient if they're awake end-of-life
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:07.520]  discussion and then it says only certain government approved agencies will be
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:16.720]  able to give these panel discussion which means that it'll have to conform to
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:27.200]  what Emanuel got his name now the president's advisor on medical
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.280]  matters on a manual and his brother Ezekiel Emanuel my brother has written
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:40.640]  extensively on what he calls the the worth of life and oh Tom Daschle said
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:44.800]  it they've all I mean now they admit when they couldn't pass it at first
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:48.720]  there's no death panels now Bill Gates is like killing old lady hard-tent
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.680]  teachers and the teachers are like clapping they have no idea what they're
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.440]  getting into well they don't and you see these things were also discussed
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:00.960]  extensively under national socialism under Mussolini's fascism and Soviet
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:07.720]  Russia and communist China these things are topics that are openly discussed
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:13.520]  that in fact well what we need to do is get rid of the useless eaters that was
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:18.680]  the term the Nazis use with useless eaters people with complex diseases
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:23.880]  people with chronic diseases multiple sclerosis people with rheumatoid arthritis
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:29.120]  crippling diseases the blind the agent these people are just useless
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:33.680]  eaters they contribute nothing to society dr. Blalock stay right there we got a
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:37.080]  long segment coming up and you're gonna just again have the floor to break this
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:42.000]  down with precision what's really in the health care bill and now they're
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.680]  admitting all this too they're like yeah we're gonna not give you health care
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:50.280]  yeah we're gonna do all that yeah we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:59.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network sick of the globalist eugenicist control

[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:04.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:08.600]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:12.640]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:16.520]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:20.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:24.960]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:29.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:32.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:37.160]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:40.520]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:45.400]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:50.440]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:33:06.480]  sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:11.400]  control freaks want to run your life it's what they like people that are not
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:15.560]  sick in the head want to just control their own life and want to have a secure
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:20.400]  life and raise happy children and empower humanity but history shows that the
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:26.520]  worst of us crave power and control and do horribly depraved things and if you
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:30.640]  don't know about that ladies and gentlemen of your new history or a new
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:37.080]  listener I suggest you go investigate history and take a crash course in it
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:44.000]  because it is scary and the these corrupt groups are the same thing over and
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.320]  over again everything they're setting up is what the communist and the fascist
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:51.120]  did because there's really no difference there's difference in window
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:58.400]  dressing it's like great Kool-Aid with cyanide in it versus cherry and they
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:02.560]  try to confuse you politically by giving all these different names of the same
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:07.040]  thing it's like saying you know you can buy this car but we have it in five
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:12.720]  colors it's it's all about keeping you unconscious unaware and kind of a dream
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.200]  like state while they do a lot of horrible stuff and openly talk about
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.800]  shutting off our resources with the carbon taxes in 21 but this health care
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:29.160]  thing as dr. Blalock just said is thousands of pages long hooked into code
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:33.240]  and other laws and is the same way it is in Europe it just it lets them do
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:37.680]  whatever they want and they're telling us what they're gonna do now dr. Blalock
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.920]  please continue you were getting into a population reduction which they all the
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:47.760]  top people at nauseam write books about what's so amazing is this conspiracy
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:54.360]  against humanity by the miscreant mentally ill people that tend to get into
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.400]  power like cancer it just takes over doesn't mean it's even dominant it just
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:03.320]  is it just it's it's like a virus these diseased minds that tend to get into
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:11.920]  control I don't even know what you call this but but they are waging war on
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:17.360]  everything good and they crave wrecking things please continue well I wrote a
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.520]  paper some years ago that the title told it all that the title of the paper was
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:29.480]  why the worst always get on top and he said that productive creative people are
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:34.440]  out producing creating take care of their family and and doing their jobs
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:40.520]  people who are not creative who want to rule and dominate they look for power
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:48.760]  positions they really create nothing they produce nothing but they do produce a
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:53.520]  lot of misery but they have these grandiose plans these visions these
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:36:01.320]  utopian ideas and ever since Plato we've had one dreamer after another who was
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:09.520]  going to plan society streamline it and show us the way to Nirvana but the
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:18.360]  problem is all of them end up in gulags mass death and police states when you
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:26.600]  look back in history it just even within the modern history we see that the
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:34.720]  Soviet Revolution in 1917 was just defended in glowing terms by some of
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:40.800]  the biggest most prestigious names in America we had the vice president
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:47.880]  Henry Wallace just praising the Soviet experiment we had Pulitzer Prize winning
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:53.400]  writers for the New York Times praising the Soviet experience and just to
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:56.920]  briefly interrupt I have to you just to back you up folks that don't know from
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:02.360]  the 20s right through until the late 40s our media kept it secret that they were
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.200]  killing tens of millions of people including a little children putting
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.280]  them in camps and starving them to death and they still the the the new
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.880]  vorice types go to bars called mouths and stuff and think it's cute you know
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.320]  it's like since when I was here the big swastika is offensive well so is a red
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:23.840]  star I'm sorry but you're making the point the elite here they were in love
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:28.880]  with it yeah I mean the very very powerful prestigious people university
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:35.840]  professors politicians very popular people very intellectual people were
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:42.800]  supporters of Stalin and even people like Walter Durrani who won the
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:47.920]  Pulitzer Prize for New York Times traveled with Malcolm Mugridge to the
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.400]  Ukraine during the height of the Ukrainian starvation where the Soviets
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:59.000]  purposely star 10 million people to death and Mugridge was just appalled he
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.920]  could believe things I think the body stacked up like cordwood and he turned
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:07.440]  to Walter Durrani said this is the horror I said I thought the Soviet
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:12.440]  experiment was good and the Durrani's response was well you got to break the
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:18.520]  mags to make an omelet a Romanian who had been a communist and witnessed the
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:23.080]  same thing when he was told this very same thing you got to break some eggs
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:28.760]  to make an omelet he said I see the broken eggs but where's the omelet so
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:34.800]  we we live in these utopian visions and that's what we're seeing today the
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.040]  people like Obama and Rockefellers and the CFR trilateralists they go before
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:43.600]  the public and they paint this beautiful picture where everybody's gonna get
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:47.800]  healthcare you're gonna see your own position it's just a matter of the
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:51.600]  government paying for it we're gonna redistribute income so it's more fair
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:55.840]  and there's justice they paint this beautiful picture where people don't
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:02.320]  realize that's exact same picture painted in Soviet Russia in 1970 1920 to 1930
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:08.000]  it's a very same picture it's like Groundhog Day it's like Groundhog Day it's
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.360]  the same picture painted by Mussolini and the defenders of Mussolini and
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:18.200]  fascist Italy so this is not the first time we've seen these beautiful mosaics
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.320]  painted in constructed for public consumption only to turn into the
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:28.360]  worst nightmare the world's ever known I mean Soviet Communism and Socialism has
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:35.200]  killed in the 20th century hundreds of millions of people it is put tens of
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.920]  millions in the gulags every year the worst conditions you can imagine most
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.600]  Americans not even wear that most Americans have never heard of the
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.640]  Ukrainian forced starvation of 10 million people they don't know what
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:55.280]  centralization and central planning can do to the massive man but we're gonna
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:00.240]  find out very quickly here because the as you say repeatedly this is all being
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:08.560]  put in place you know Stalin used to use the the term slice the salami he said
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:12.600]  you don't take power all at once you cut a little piece off and you take that for
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:16.560]  yourself and another little piece and another little piece pretty soon you
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:22.200]  own it all and you have so much power nobody can you resist you and what you
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.680]  learn from history is that as the government becomes more and more
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:33.080]  dictatorial and totalitarian it begins to fear the people because it's promised
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:38.320]  the people this utopia but the utopia never comes and so they're so terrified
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:43.000]  of being overthrown by the people they have to create a police state to depress
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.800]  them and they have to hunt enemies of the state that's what we're saying now
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:51.360]  we're having people that if you're a tea party member you're an enemy of the
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.520]  state you're a danger if you have a sticker on your car about the
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:59.480]  Constitution or mentioned the Constitution the police departments are
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.320]  told to keep an eye on you that you're a danger well who thought in this
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:10.320]  country you know in my lifetime that if you utter patriotic utterances that now
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:15.200]  you're a domestic terrorist you're a danger that only if you talk about
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:20.120]  increasing the power of government hailing the government for having a
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:25.000]  rule over every aspect of your life only if you're willing to give up your
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.960]  private property are you a good citizen well these are the things we heard in
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:36.120]  Nazi Germany and Mussolini Italy and now we're hearing them here and it's so
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:41.120]  alien to our system and and now it's so naked as you said the salami slicing or
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.720]  the frog in the pot first they said we're not in the pot well we're in a pot
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.360]  but it's okay but it's not hot well now it's warm but hey it's nice like a hot
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.760]  tub now it's bubbling and they're saying never mind and and openly saying the
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:57.400]  founding fathers are bad and FEMA training manuals and video I mean if I
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.800]  was a cop in a meeting and I've had the cops calling they say it actually does
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:04.080]  wake them up and they go in there and start bad-mouthing freedom and the
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:08.800]  founding fathers and private property I mean these are just outrageous criminals
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.920]  they're the enemy it's so obvious I mean how have we gone this far dr.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:18.840]  Blalock well it's because we denied education to our public our public has
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:24.480]  no idea what goes on in socialist and communist and fascist and national
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:28.800]  socialist country we teach we teach our children about Nazism we
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:33.880]  talk about the holocaust but we don't talk about the fact well there's many
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.560]  aspects of national socialism that if you remove the holocaust from it our
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:44.920]  great intellectuals in this country were or using this as examples of
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:49.920]  progressivism that we should adopt these national socialist policies they like
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:55.880]  the social insurance they like the the medical care system in in Nazi Germany
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:02.640]  they liked the eugenics programs in in Nazi Germany you know Nazi Germany had
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:07.320]  representatives come to Rockefeller to find out how to run the eugenics
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:12.120]  program we don't tell our students that we don't tell them that the Rockefeller
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:18.040]  sent in mysterious to the Nazi Germany meet with Hitler to tell him how to run
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:22.120]  a eugenics program well they funded it the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute absolutely
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:26.160]  so there's so much that we don't tell I did you know there's books written about
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:31.240]  communism the black book of communism utopian power there's all these books
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:36.960]  that tell all of these things in detail about the experience of and when you read
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:40.320]  them and then gone to the original history and find out it's true eat there
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.560]  they're following it I'm getting chills right now exactly as a total blueprint as
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:49.520]  you read it it's terrifying because it's the same wording they don't even
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:54.120]  change the wording it's the same argument it's the same utopian picture that
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:58.200]  they paint but they know it's not a utopia they know it's really about the
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:03.520]  Kilgren here's an example 68 gun control act senator Dodd you know the one that's
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.480]  dead the senior one senator Dodd was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and that
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:14.240]  was used as an example so they took the Weimar Republic law added the Nazi one
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:18.640]  only changed the name in a few things and passed it whole hog is legislation I
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:23.800]  mean they I just wanted to back up what you just said right there yeah you know
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.800]  I mean but we're not teaching our students that we teach in this silly
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:32.360]  nonsense in school so that they end up they know absolutely nothing about
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:37.040]  not to the US 99% of high school graduates what was the real name of the
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.160]  Nazi party they don't know they don't know the national German workers socialist
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:49.760]  party and you ask about what is fascism well if not one person in and a hundred
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:54.720]  thousand could define fascism because if you define it you say oh well that's
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:00.680]  what we have in the United States now fascism is here everything we we
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:05.040]  experience in modern society is fascism and it's healthcare bill it's just
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:10.760]  saturated with fascism and national socialism but our students think well
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:15.560]  if you're not rounding up a racial group or religious group it's not
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:20.720]  not to them well that wasn't the the entire essence of national socialism a
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:25.200]  lot of the oppression and killing and shooting came because people were
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:31.720]  resisting other program gun control property they were arresting the
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:37.040]  7th day Adventists they were arresting whole groups a lot of times if a Nazi
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:40.400]  wanted your wife you were taken away or one of your business I mean it was
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:45.320]  hellish but again the media only covers one area but then people don't trust the
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:49.640]  media so they say oh Hitler must have been good now we see that that's not
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:54.960]  sophisticated at all the truth is as you said Stalin admired Hitler and they
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.040]  were buddies at first and Stalin admired how the Nazis did it because their
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.000]  thugs were so good and they were able to rob and steal so well and they
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.040]  imitated each other none of this is taught but I mean I've read the writings
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:13.440]  of Hitler I've read the I mean they had the programs of killing little kids and
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.720]  killing old people and and and and you know all of the socialism and the and
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:22.760]  the checkpoints and the neighbors tattling on you and groveling to the
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:27.000]  government and and they had a TSA brown shirt group I mean it's the exact same
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.680]  thing well one of the things that's very closely parallel to this Obama bill
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:38.960]  is that in Nazi Germany in order to to turn the young people towards the idea
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.520]  of killing off the old and the sick they would give them math problems in which
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.400]  they would say how many housing units for young people in young families could
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:54.280]  you buy with X amount of dollars that we're spending to care for people with
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:59.720]  chronic illnesses that was their math problem and that was to attune their
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:05.200]  brain to the fact that I could have a house in a nice neighborhood if we
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:10.120]  weren't wasting all this money keeping these people alive they should just be
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:16.520]  willing to die for the good of the state well I read these exact same words and
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:22.440]  arguments being expressed by Zeke Emmanuel and the other people that are
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:30.600]  promoting these national health insurance program they use the very same argument
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.600]  if we just quit wasting this money on all these people with chronic illnesses
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:41.320]  so we're becoming a society that no longer has a Christian perspective of
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.120]  compassion and empathy and caring and caring about individuals we're
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:53.840]  collectivist society and by the way that's my next point about individuals anymore yes sir that's that that's the biggest biggest
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:57.520]  trick of all this is they sell it about giving people health care but as you know
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:00.560]  under charity care and how my dad was trained how you were trained you're
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:03.800]  supposed to do a large part of it as charity they have these so-called charity
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:07.200]  hospitals that are Rockefeller run that are really about profit the insurance
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:10.200]  companies help write this to cut the quality of care make you buy their
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:13.680]  product but I want you to break that down because they say oh we're gonna give
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:17.200]  everybody free health care whatever but no it's not really free health care and
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:20.720]  now they admit oh no we're gonna control what you eat and what you do and
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.920]  surveil that and inventory that because now we're all paying for it and it
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.800]  brings you into the collectivist nightmare with all these useless control
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:36.120]  freaks in the system now having a contract into your life that's why this
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:41.200]  makes me physically sick yeah it's gonna be absolute control of the
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:44.480]  individual and people don't realize that they're gonna say well I still want to
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:50.240]  eat them my barbecued ribs and I like these fried onion rings and now you're
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:53.840]  a federal patient they'll say well you can't eat that anymore you're gonna eat
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:59.000]  this here's your menu you will pick your food up at this center and this is
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  what you'll eat well people didn't know that that was in the bill well it's
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:14.960]  written in there an invisible ink it says that the director of the health and
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:18.840]  human services can decide that later that's written in the bill says she
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:23.920]  will make this decision later no no my children go and test just did a thing
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:27.160]  for homeschoolers but because it's accredited they were giving them stuff
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.600]  about how great Michelle Obama was all of gardens and places are now having a
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.120]  menu with notes from her and then they're telling look at look at a New
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:43.240]  York going after salt soft drinks and now popcorn and milk products sure it
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:47.400]  was all about control I mean it's sort of like you get some of these states at
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:53.040]  pass legislation that your toilet can only have so much water to flush because
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:57.160]  we were gonna save water well what people found out that couldn't flush the
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:00.920]  waste matter so they had to flush the toilet four or five times and ended up
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:06.000]  wasting more water than if they had a normal toilet well planners never think
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.720]  of these things that's why central planning is such a disaster and now
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.160]  they want to inspect your house to make sure you've got the right toilet that's
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:18.920]  right I mean you came by one you have to buy their low water type of toilet well
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.320]  it went to hot water heaters it's everything you know like even in our
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:27.400]  our community here to cut a tree down on your own property you got to get
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:31.760]  permission of the city so they come out and examine your tree and you have to
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.160]  pay a fee for them to evaluate whether you cut a tree in your own way and then
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:39.240]  they can decide here in Austin they're not letting them build high-rises
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.640]  because they say you have a tree but if you're the insiders then you can cut
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.480]  down any trees you want it gives them the selective enforcement power I want to
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:50.560]  come back and talk about some vaccine news with you in a short five minute

[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:14.720]  to get the ball down the field everybody else we got to beat these people we
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:18.880]  have got to drop that hammer down we have got to beat these people these are
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:24.080]  dangerous bad people they I mean I've I don't want to say I'm scared I am just
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:29.000]  filled with excited energy to try to energetically expose these people
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:35.400]  because they are coming down on us Dr. Blalock we're almost out of time you've
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:38.720]  got several websites I wanted to ask you what the best ones are for people to
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.320]  visit what you'd like them to visit I've already mentioned one of them and then
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:47.400]  where do you see things going where is the world today Dr. Blalock yeah the
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:56.200]  websites www.blalockwellnesscenter.com is the best one and ruffleblalockmd.com
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:02.640]  is my personal website well here's where we're going this the whole thing is
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:07.440]  designed to push people into total government-controlled health care but
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:12.480]  they wanted to look voluntary we're entering a period of depression like
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:18.120]  economy so what they're going to do with this mandate because when you are
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:25.080]  forced to buy this insurance these so-called 45 million people this these
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:29.800]  things have benefit mandates on them that are going to raise the price of the
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:34.920]  premium 20 to 50 percent or more so you're going to be paying for a high
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:40.920]  high-end insurance for a lot of coverage you don't need like
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:48.320]  psychiatric care OBGYN free contraceptives free abortion well you know
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:52.800]  you may be a single guy or you may be a very Christian family and you say I don't
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:57.120]  need any of that garbage well you're gonna buy it or we're gonna raise you
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:01.280]  you know penalized so it's mandated social engineering and a payoff to their
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:05.800]  friends yeah and so what's gonna happen is because the enormous expense of the
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:10.880]  policy as the economy worsens people say I can't afford it and so the guy
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:15.240]  was gonna let him opt out and say well what you can do is come into the full
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:19.080]  government system so then instead of Medicare Medicaid would just have one
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:23.280]  system which they've always wanted that's been the design but they want to
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:26.880]  make it look like it was your decision and they now said this so that's what
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:30.360]  Michael Morse he said don't worry this is the end of the system we're taking
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:35.440]  over sure and it's gonna be 100% government run now people don't have
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:41.280]  any clues in this country as to what government run injured but you know we
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:45.880]  are about Canadian system and the UK system how wonderful it is well you
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:51.440]  really look into it for instance in one city they had thousands of people that
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:57.600]  were dying waiting to be cared for recent reports there over 130,000 people
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:03.680]  are dying in British medical care system they let them die in the front room
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.360]  over four or five days Paul Watson I told you the story couldn't get rid of
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  his chest cold went in and they said here's a bag of aspirin get out of here
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:14.720]  yeah he's like well it's run like the military medical corps when I was in
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.800]  military what they did they had a little would call it cold pack and it's just
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.520]  over-the-counter garbage they put in a brown bag and everybody got the same
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:27.640]  thing the man was wrong with you when I tried to order drugs that were third
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:31.720]  generation for treatment of patients I was told you can't get those you only
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:35.240]  have to you can only get first generation I said well those destroy the
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:39.040]  kidney in the liver so well that's all we offer we're a government run
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:43.680]  operation you can't get the fancy stuff so you know people gonna have to get
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:48.240]  used to well we don't do shoulder replacements anymore what we'll do is
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:52.040]  this operation that'll tear loose in about two years and have to have it
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:57.880]  redone or we won't even do the surgery at all here's a story of what's coming
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:06.200]  I met a young woman whose husband was an ophthalmologist he operated on a 75 year
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:11.080]  old man who was almost blind from cataract conspiring to his house the
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:16.600]  guy regained full sight now he could play golf go out enjoy his life he was
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  charged by the Medicare officials with abusing a Medicare patient in court the
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:28.920]  abuse was that he gave the man his vision back which was not approved by the
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:33.640]  government unbelievable doctor for 10 years well stay there let's do five

[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:35.840]  there are some specialists in the right area because they're known for being
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:39.360]  really good that can command you know millions of dollars a year but we're
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:43.840]  we're destroying the best healthcare system ever and it's been ongoing and
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:48.760]  so now we're here but but I see these cases now where the government is
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:52.880]  controlling the type of care people get it openly saying old people get a cane
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:56.520]  instead of getting your cataracts removed people are doctors are being
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:01.640]  charged that remove cataracts tell folks about that yeah there was a case that I
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:06.960]  knew quite well had interviewed the wife of this surgeon he's an ophthalmologist
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:12.200]  and he had a 75 year old patient who had cataracts and he's near blind he's
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:18.800]  constricted to his house couldn't leave and so he saw the man and operated on
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:25.520]  him and fixed it put new lens in and the guy could see very well and they
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:31.160]  would play golf and had a nice normal life well charges were filed against him
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:39.440]  by the Medicare police saying that he had abused a Medicare patient a federal
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:47.640]  patient in court the charges were that he had abused an American patient and
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:52.080]  they said well how was the abuse carried out well he gave him back his vision and
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:58.200]  we didn't approve it he's a too old to have cataracts done and so the doctor
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:04.920]  was given ten years in prison now this is a young doctor with young children and
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:10.840]  he was put in prison for giving this man back his vision which the state said
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:15.960]  the man didn't deserve vision he could be given a white stick with a red tip on
[03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:19.800]  it and he had no reason to leave his home and again that's the socialist model
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:24.200]  that's the compassion that's what people we're not joking I watch she spent so I
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:28.440]  watch the houses of parliament and every time I watch it they admit people are
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:31.320]  waiting a year and a half for brain surgery that's almost a hundred percent
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:34.560]  operable have done within six months but it's almost completely fatal if not
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:37.880]  removed within six months and they get I'm go yes that's yes that's happening
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:41.680]  but that's just the way it is I mean people don't understand that in these
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:46.600]  actuaries they're going to decide who gets what this is so horrible well they
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:52.240]  admit that you know that there's no cover up if you read deep into that what
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:55.960]  they're writing what they're saying what they're they're saying in the lecture is
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:03:01.040]  that yes this is what we do and individuals will be sacrificed it's
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:05.480]  again breaking some eggs to make an omelet the truth is they just like to
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:10.800]  break eggs well they you know some of them are true believers they think this
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:16.080]  utopia is going to come about but as it gets worse and they realize they can't
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:21.600]  do it they get desperate and so then they start rationing severely to save
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:27.000]  them a call the more they ration the more people die the more people suffer the
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:32.320]  longer people wait for for care you know you keep hearing this nonsense there's
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:35.800]  people in this country can't get care everybody in this country I don't care
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.960]  if you don't have a dime if you can get into a merger room and they'll give you
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:44.960]  a free ride you will get all the care that anyone with millions of dollars
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:49.440]  get to get care in this country immediately and what they found it
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:55.040]  interested in England is after national health insurance you could even get it
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:59.720]  by going to the merge room because the waiting was too long listen Paul Watson
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:04.040]  turn you away because the wait was too long Watson had money you know to get a
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:08.480]  private doctor but they have to allow you the political class doesn't just let
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:12.920]  everybody who has money for the private doctor get it it's total control and I
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:16.720]  tell you these doctors are mostly aren't quitting because their incomes are
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:22.240]  falling it's because many of them can't even afford to run their offices
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:27.560]  anymore and most of them are so overwhelmed with paperwork rules
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:32.160]  regulations threats of impure imprisonment they keep sleeping night
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:38.320]  they're haggard friends of mine that are just excellent doctors they're so worn
[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:42.440]  from there they just can't take incredible daughter play along great
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:47.040]  thank you so much and my dad is a dentist says now the enforcers come in and
[03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:51.320]  are just like this is not a free country anymore thank you so much thank you
