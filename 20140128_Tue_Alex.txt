[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:34.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.360 --> 00:42.360]  I just retweeted it seconds ago at real Alex Jones a tweet by Matt Drudge I
[00:42.360 --> 00:49.600]  guess yesterday that I missed he simply said have an exit plan out of this
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.880]  country and I can't believe that we ever sit here and seriously talk about stuff
[00:54.880 --> 01:05.840]  like this but that is a very reasonable thing to say have an exit plan my
[01:05.840 --> 01:13.040]  problem is is there's really nowhere to run what northern Europe Switzerland
[01:13.040 --> 01:22.160]  Iceland drugs report founder leaves a cryptic forward tweet open to
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.480]  interpretation have an exit plan there's no open to interpretation only
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.320]  morons would understand what that means you've got the producer of Schindler's
[01:32.320 --> 01:37.720]  list coming out saying for the first time ever he's afraid to live in America
[01:39.240 --> 01:47.160]  Obama is a dictator now folks he is a dictator then preparing the ascension
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.560]  of Hillary after he goes to continue the dictatorship of the stinking
[01:51.560 --> 01:57.240]  Clintons and that's why as much as I hate him even the puppet rival Chris
[01:57.240 --> 02:01.960]  Christie's being destroyed the other viable rival Governor McDonald one of
[02:01.960 --> 02:07.600]  the front runners destroyed the next to Suza with films coming out to expose the
[02:07.600 --> 02:16.080]  Clintons because I off record happen to have been told about the next to Suza
[02:16.080 --> 02:24.120]  after my show Thursday when I talked to Bob Barr I was contacted I was told do
[02:24.120 --> 02:31.800]  not tell anybody where you got this but look up USA versus Dinesh to Suza and I
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.280]  searched it in the federal site and it didn't come up and then I called the
[02:36.280 --> 02:42.440]  person and they said I'm not gonna tell you anymore and then boom I turned the
[02:42.440 --> 02:48.000]  drudge report on on my computer and there it was it had just broken minutes
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.520]  before and I'm just gonna leave it at that
[02:58.640 --> 03:06.040]  but the issue is they were not just planning to come out with the film
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.640]  America they're planning with another one obviously up against Hillary and
[03:10.640 --> 03:16.040]  they've got Dinesh to Suza's phones tapped folks the point is again I have
[03:16.040 --> 03:26.640]  sources directly in to what's going on and what's happening and of course you
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.400]  see the famous producer in fact you guys reprint me that in Newsmax saying
[03:31.400 --> 03:39.160]  quote is the first time he's ever feared being in the United States and these are
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.160]  the real discussions that have to happen because you see all the crimes that
[03:45.160 --> 03:51.520]  have been committed by the people that are running things
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.200]  and you see how all of this is unfolding and you see how they get away with
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.120]  everything they do well historically 100% of the time that leads to an
[04:07.120 --> 04:16.880]  attempted two words one word and then a composite word total take over
[04:16.880 --> 04:23.400]  historically total take over and what happens in Soviet Russia or happen in
[04:23.400 --> 04:26.440]  the Bolshevik Revolution before that are Nazi Germany you know the cases
[04:26.440 --> 04:32.000]  people always deny it's happening because you've got courage and you're
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.040]  comfortable where you live and you think you're gonna be able to beat them and
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.600]  you just stay there fighting them and then they come and arrest you and kill
[04:39.600 --> 04:45.200]  your family in front of you or put you in a forced labor camp and that's the
[04:45.200 --> 04:52.440]  point we've gotten to here is that is that if we don't turn this around soon
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.040]  America's so done what's the point let's get out of here because we are the
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.080]  center of the storm out hi folks Alex Jones here with some important
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.160]  information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.320]  over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[05:10.320 --> 05:13.440]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.560]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.760]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.040]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.480]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find

[07:10.760 --> 07:15.120]  what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here
[07:15.120 --> 07:19.960]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[07:19.960 --> 07:25.160]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[07:25.160 --> 07:31.280]  results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had

[08:17.000 --> 08:32.440]  GCN radio network
[08:32.440 --> 08:37.880]  you watch the Grammys they have not one not two but three open satanic
[08:37.880 --> 08:44.560]  ceremonies conjuring bathomet simulating human sacrifices and public
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.440]  satanic sex orgies and then the controlled corporate dinosaur media says
[08:50.440 --> 08:56.600]  they're trolling Illuminati skeptics well I didn't know that Illuminati
[08:56.600 --> 09:07.960]  skeptics are so important and Illuminati critics are so important that the
[09:07.960 --> 09:12.720]  Grammys every year now and the Super Bowl and every other big national event
[09:12.720 --> 09:18.120]  has occultic ceremonies no folks it's because these people are in to the
[09:18.120 --> 09:24.280]  occult on record Katy Perry says she sold her soul the devil all of these
[09:24.280 --> 09:30.200]  people are on record saying they have sold their souls to the devil now
[09:30.200 --> 09:36.320]  whether you believe in the devil existing or not the archetypal
[09:36.320 --> 09:46.040]  manifestation of the devil war death corruption all of it is manifesting and
[09:46.040 --> 09:51.800]  these people are trying to bring it about what are the villains doing in
[09:51.800 --> 09:55.640]  archetypal literature from around the world they're trying to overthrow the
[09:55.640 --> 09:59.120]  world trying to destroy the life force trying to create death and destruction
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.200]  what's the Bible say the archetypal devil does kill steal and destroy what
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.720]  does the red king or the devil want to do in the dark tower series by Stephen
[10:09.720 --> 10:16.440]  King he's trying to overthrow the planet and shift its poles and throw it out of
[10:16.440 --> 10:26.160]  orbit of the Sun killing everyone on board that is the nature of the devil
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.560]  is to overthrow all that is good whether the devil is real or not is not up for
[10:31.560 --> 10:38.120]  debate atheist because those that follow the mindset of the archetypal devil
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.400]  are real and hence the devil is real
[10:45.160 --> 10:53.560]  you understand that men envisioned rockets to the moon 500 plus years ago
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.480]  and now we've sent rockets to the moon you understand that because we are
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.200]  creators made in the image of the creator of the heavens you can say oh
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.560]  well that's delusional people running around in the desert 3,000 years ago with
[11:10.560 --> 11:17.120]  Moses saying that well did it happen have you looked around we are creators we
[11:17.120 --> 11:26.040]  are builders we're master builders we're builders the devil is a destroyer okay
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.840]  so I choose to be with the builder not the destroyer I'm a builder I'm a
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.880]  creator I'm a lover not a fighter but I'm a better fighter than a fighter
[11:38.880 --> 11:46.440]  because I am a lover any real man knows that any real man doesn't have fear
[11:46.440 --> 11:50.720]  except for fear of the innocent being trodden underfoot and then you're ready
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.720]  to do what it takes that means hacking 50 people up with a meat cleaver like
[11:54.720 --> 12:02.840]  Samson it's time for good people to find their strength it's time for good
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.160]  people to decide what they stand for it's time for good people to stop giving
[12:08.160 --> 12:13.240]  the world over to evil as for me and my family we have never really developed an
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.880]  exit strategy except for total nuclear meltdown and I have looked at areas that
[12:16.880 --> 12:22.680]  are out of the main trade winds and Coriolis of the northern hemisphere and
[12:22.680 --> 12:28.040]  it's just there's not a lot of good places to go I can move to some farm
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.320]  live extremely low-key and poor and probably be left alone if I moved to
[12:33.320 --> 12:41.720]  the mountains plain areas of somewhere like Chile I've looked at Chile very
[12:41.720 --> 12:45.760]  beautiful somewhat more moral people compared to some of the other areas of
[12:45.760 --> 12:49.960]  Latin America a lot of European expatriates and American expatriates
[12:49.960 --> 12:54.760]  Costa Rica is beautiful but when the hell goes to in a handbasket it's going
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.240]  to melt down as well you go to the outback of Australia it's globalist
[12:59.240 --> 13:02.880]  run but if you ran him tried to be left alone you probably could be for at least
[13:02.880 --> 13:09.840]  a while some areas of northern Europe that are pretty good Iceland is okay
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.040]  but there's 400,000 people there and tenuous resources but at least they've
[13:14.040 --> 13:16.840]  got their head screwed on straight and that's really what matters if humans
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.120]  just work together for liberty we're unstoppable Switzerland if you've got
[13:22.120 --> 13:29.120]  the money which I really don't not long term you got to really bring stuff to
[13:29.120 --> 13:33.960]  the table to go to Switzerland and the list just goes on and on from there
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.320]  there's really nowhere to run and my gut tells me that I'm not gonna run I need
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.640]  to stay here and try to fight and beat this the problem is you look at the
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.080]  general public who even though they're awake to the fact we're going into
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.680]  tyranny they still have no respect for themselves and almost have a hopelessness
[13:51.680 --> 14:00.040]  to just turn over the world through this evil and if you look at textbook
[14:00.040 --> 14:06.560]  autocratic tyranny's systems that the tyrannous spider weaves throughout
[14:06.560 --> 14:12.320]  history this is the most thought-out premeditated scientifically prepared
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.880]  evil the world has ever seen that now has hijacked and runs America and is
[14:17.880 --> 14:23.040]  going into overdrive in the personage and the personality and the signant and
[14:23.040 --> 14:34.440]  logo and figurehead and shield and foil and chill that is the abomination
[14:34.440 --> 14:40.680]  Barack Hussein Obama and now I realize that one of the few areas where I've
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.320]  not been visionary is Obama because I began to think that I knew that all
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.920]  politicians were puppets run by the globalist which they are but then in
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.800]  Obama we're seeing like a baseball pitcher who's the closer in the eighth
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.080]  and ninth inning and I see every sign they're making the move to close and I
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.120]  try to hope and I try to pray and I try to look at how we're winning on many
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.320]  fronts but that's why they're closing but then that's why I realize I've got
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.160]  to stay and put my fat in the fire no matter what happens and double down but
[15:15.160 --> 15:23.200]  I don't blame anybody who wants to get out of here because here's the deal it is
[15:23.200 --> 15:27.040]  foreign mega banks that are running things who use socialism to control his
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.760]  general population but a really fascist crony capitalist anti-free market
[15:30.760 --> 15:37.280]  monopoly meant but their ground level and mid-level enforcers are degenerate
[15:37.280 --> 15:47.640]  Luciferians satanic Jacobin French Revolution types and they've got a score
[15:47.640 --> 15:52.480]  to settle with people like me and they don't want even money they don't even
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.240]  want the sex slaves they don't even want to be above the law they want to
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.160]  torture good men women and children they want us in dungeons they want to suck
[16:01.160 --> 16:06.920]  our life force out they want to dominate goodness and I'm telling you looking at
[16:06.920 --> 16:12.280]  these spiders licking their lips wanting to literally suck me dry it doesn't
[16:12.280 --> 16:17.800]  cause fear but I don't want to give them what they want at the same time and then
[16:17.800 --> 16:25.240]  my instinct tells me listen you've done enough get out of there you can talk to
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.960]  people from a distance but then I've built this organization and this
[16:28.960 --> 16:37.560]  operation when they start arresting members of the media folks that are I
[16:37.560 --> 16:43.240]  mean I'll just say it here I've got this from two different high-level sources
[16:43.240 --> 16:48.200]  DeSousa has this America film coming out about trying to deprogram the minorities
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.880]  that have been put on the Ku Klux Klan Kule the Democratic Party and they do
[16:52.880 --> 16:56.280]  not want people knowing the Democratic Party was the Ku Klux Klan and decided
[16:56.280 --> 17:00.080]  to go race politics the other way in 1963 when they knew they couldn't win
[17:00.080 --> 17:05.800]  anymore LBJ made that decision and I know DeSousa has been looking at that and
[17:05.800 --> 17:09.120]  that reportedly some of the things that are in his film and they're not gonna
[17:09.120 --> 17:13.000]  let that narrative be told and then they're not gonna let DeSousa make a
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.360]  film about Hillary and so they're gonna try to put him in jail and when you see
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.360]  the mainstream corporate horror media line up and call for him to be in
[17:24.360 --> 17:28.920]  prison not having any instinct for their profession or honor I mean you can say
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.880]  what you want about the cops and they're they're corrupt in many areas but
[17:32.880 --> 17:36.760]  at least they look out for each other at least they understand that the whole
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.120]  system is not looking out for them that they're the bottom of the barrel of the
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.920]  government where the rubber meets the road that are given all the dirty jobs
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.680]  and at least police know to stick up for each other where is the press sticking
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.720]  up for each other you morons if they can destroy DeNesh DeSousa they can
[17:53.720 --> 18:04.600]  destroy anybody you morons and then you won't even be needed as a minion of the
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.240]  system anymore once they get rid of the real press they're gonna get rid of the
[18:09.240 --> 18:15.880]  faux press dummies you have no basic instinct you have no common sense you
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.480]  have nothing morons and we're gonna lose due process and lose the weights and
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.440]  balances just weights and balances and then everything is gonna go into a
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.000]  tyrannical black hole you fools that I've told you this before picture our
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.600]  Republic as a gate against incredible evil look at the rest of the world you
[18:36.600 --> 18:41.960]  ought to travel it's hellish look at Western society it's falling it was
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.920]  literally godlike compared to other societies that's where everyone wanted
[18:45.920 --> 18:51.280]  to go to Western Europe and wanted to go to America and now all of its falling
[18:51.280 --> 18:56.640]  ladies and gentlemen the gates are physically financially spiritually
[18:56.640 --> 19:01.360]  culturally falling they're doing satanic ceremonies in every national
[19:01.360 --> 19:06.160]  television event just like they did in Rome just like they did in Babylon just
[19:06.160 --> 19:11.840]  like they did everywhere else before all hell breaks loose and now image image
[19:11.840 --> 19:16.600]  the walls like a force field shield that are becoming very thin and the
[19:16.600 --> 19:20.680]  enemy is able to jump through the gate now more and more the enemy is now

[24:43.480 --> 24:47.320]  denounce it don't support it here's an example I had my children over at my
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.280]  parents last night we went out and had dinner and we were jumping in their
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.600]  hot tub in their heated pool back and forth and they had water guns out there
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.080]  shooting cold water at each other they were filling up out of the water hose and
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.640]  screaming and yelling that was obviously the sound of happy children
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.320]  shrieking and I said to my parents I said you know one of your neighbors a lot
[25:08.320 --> 25:11.560]  of Democratic Party signs around here and I'm not kidding I just know the type I
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.440]  said they're going to call the police and my dad's like come on they're
[25:15.440 --> 25:18.920]  obviously kids yelling and screaming having fun and I said no the police are
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.920]  coming so they go in take showers get dressed I'm getting ready to go two
[25:23.920 --> 25:27.840]  cop cars pull up at my parents gate they've got the alarm code so they come
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.840]  in and they go yeah it sounds like somebody was being killed your
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.440]  neighbor said well no it was children playing with water guns he sees all the
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.020]  steam coming off the pool all looks fun all right so you're David you know
[25:41.020 --> 25:44.880]  saying to my dad yeah and he goes all right sorry I'll go tell your neighbor
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.120]  and one cop car screeched off the other cop car went over and talked to the
[25:49.120 --> 25:52.440]  neighbor and I told my dad I said you know that neighbor he goes no and I
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.200]  said they're gonna call the police on you from now on he goes how do you know
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.000]  all this I go I know the new spirit of America they don't like the fact that
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.320]  you weren't doing wrong or that someone wasn't in trouble they're gonna feel bad
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.720]  now watch out now they're on four acres right plus their neighbors none of them
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.120]  like that they live in South Austin with four acres an old piece of property
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.080]  everybody else is on like quarter acres or less so it's all you know in via sighs
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.000]  looking over the fence literally I just I know the spirit of this evil land
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.920]  ladies and gentlemen I know it's spirit and I think I'm gonna go over and talk
[26:26.920 --> 26:30.040]  to that neighbor and let him know anything gets made up I'm gonna sue your
[26:30.040 --> 26:37.360]  butt you understand that bug eye and here's what I'm getting at here that
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.600]  person won't get concerned about Obama operating as a tyrant he's got like 14
[26:42.600 --> 26:47.440]  Democratic Party signs in his yard at any one time she does I'm sure it's she
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.360]  both of them but the same ones we were doing firecrackers two years ago called
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.880]  the police on us I'm talking about firecrackers folks I mean black cats in
[26:55.880 --> 27:00.160]  the driveway they were going on everywhere around us here come the police
[27:00.160 --> 27:06.760]  and they're not worried about Obama becoming a dictator or GMO or fluoride
[27:06.760 --> 27:10.560]  in the water or Fukushima they're not worried about open borders wages going
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.480]  down total criminality the government legalized millions of felons aggravated
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.720]  felons they're not worried about any of that they're not worried about the
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.800]  dollar being devalued they watch Rachel Maddow at night the government's their
[27:21.800 --> 27:26.480]  friend everyone else is bad and if you're a family with kids laughing that's
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.720]  evil just like the big feminist magazine came out yesterday and said mothers
[27:30.720 --> 27:37.160]  with children that live at home with their husbands are disgusting we're
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.880]  you understand that we're disgusting children laughing and screaming with
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.400]  water guns are disgusting jumping in and out of the hot tub in the pool that's
[27:48.400 --> 27:54.400]  disgusting total world government satanic ceremonies on the Grammys gay people
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.200]  being married shoving it in everybody's face sounds like Babylon that is good
[27:59.200 --> 28:07.360]  family's bad justice bad tyranny good because they're part of the game and
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.520]  that's what I'm trying to get at here is that we all need to stand up and speak
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.800]  out against evil we all need to recognize what it is and say no to it and
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.200]  we need to do like Ted Cruz has said Obama is frightening and dangerous and
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.000]  now Matt drudge has come out and I've retweeted it at real Alex Jones please
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.600]  retweet it from there folks he says have an exit plan and he's just got away
[28:31.600 --> 28:34.880]  with words saying it's so simple to get people thinking as I would say you got
[28:34.880 --> 28:36.880]  to have an exit plan because they're looks like they're gonna implode the
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.400]  economy and go after political enemies and historically this shows that it's a
[28:40.400 --> 28:43.400]  problem I would talk for two hours trying to explain why you have to have an
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.760]  exit plan he would just say have an exit plan and everybody then has a debate
[28:46.760 --> 28:52.840]  and goes oh yeah I know why we need an exit plan as Mark Slavo reports in his
[28:52.840 --> 28:58.880]  article on it Matt drudge issues warning have an exit plan and you've got
[28:58.880 --> 29:06.240]  the former main producer Gerald Mullen of Schindler's List saying for the first
[29:06.240 --> 29:13.920]  time I fear the government and I'm scared living in America well you should
[29:13.920 --> 29:21.680]  be concerned folks and you should be concerned about what's going on because
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.640]  this is classical evil and look I'm not trying to scare people for Obama we
[29:27.640 --> 29:32.600]  just have to have a real discussion about the fact that the Republican Party
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.240]  and Boehner because they're all blackmailed and controlled are scared
[29:36.240 --> 29:41.720]  and they're all lining up to say hey Obamacare NSA open borders power
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.600]  plants guns you do whatever you want and now they're going after politicians and

[33:28.800 --> 33:35.320]  is going you like society degenerating well if you like it you're gonna get a
[33:35.320 --> 33:49.000]  lot more of it because the season of true evil is now dawning is now upon us
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.720]  get ready now the answer to this evil is the 110% up our game in the
[33:56.720 --> 34:02.200]  establishment space and call them out and evil is making its move because it
[34:02.200 --> 34:06.920]  knows that the dawn of liberty a resurrection of freedom is coming we're
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.040]  at the bottom of a decadent cycle right now and it's either gonna go into an
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.400]  even deeper cycle of evil or we're gonna come out of this evil and I personally
[34:15.400 --> 34:19.120]  want to come out of it without having to go to the living hell that other
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.600]  generations have gone through it usually happens every three generations not
[34:23.600 --> 34:27.240]  every generation has to go through something like this there's different
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.240]  cycles and many cycles but it's been followed by historians for thousands of
[34:31.240 --> 34:36.760]  years but now you add all the high-tech you add the giant population you add all
[34:36.760 --> 34:42.160]  these other ingredients more sophisticated propaganda more sophisticated
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.560]  social control the establishment being able to be cloistered and separate it
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.680]  from the general population more than ever they themselves are smoking their
[34:52.680 --> 35:00.760]  own dope and it is a recipe for doom and the instinct is as you see the doors
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.560]  closing with capital controls and to not be able to get out of the US for any
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.280]  political reason as you see the political persecution accelerate as you see
[35:08.280 --> 35:14.920]  Obama operating effectively as a dictator 2.0 making the office of the
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.840]  president dictatorial by every historical measurement there is the instinct to
[35:20.840 --> 35:25.800]  flee the country and I don't bemoan anybody that flees it believe me I am on
[35:25.800 --> 35:36.800]  the razor's edge of decision but that's that's at a conscious level at a
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.800]  subconscious level I'm never leaving and I know I'm committed to the end
[35:40.800 --> 35:44.360]  whatever happens that I will go on to the end we will defend our island
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.200]  whatever the cost may be that's the famous Churchill speech you guys print
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.400]  me the Churchill speech we will defend our island whatever the cost may be we
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.840]  shall go on to the end we shall never surrender and that's really the attitude
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.720]  you have to have is I'm dug in like the Alamo I'm going all the way but I don't
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.040]  blame anybody that tries to get out of this country immediately and everyone
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.000]  should have an emergency backup plan about where you're going to go how
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.320]  you're going to disappear because they're not going to have the forces to go
[36:14.320 --> 36:17.840]  after everybody at first they want to just intimidate everybody nuke some
[36:17.840 --> 36:21.760]  cities say we did it or release bio weapons say the patriots did it and
[36:21.760 --> 36:25.360]  then try to convince everyone to go along with it and if the corporate or
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.160]  media goes along with it when that happens your fools you're all going to
[36:29.160 --> 36:32.480]  lose everything you've got I mean that's the thing for the people that serve the
[36:32.480 --> 36:39.440]  system guaranteed you empower this system you are literally burning your own
[36:39.440 --> 36:46.440]  house down you are idiots I'm begging those of you who are part of the
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.240]  progressive socialist communist liberal system you work for foreign banks on
[36:51.240 --> 36:56.320]  record you are just the political takeover army they're going to use they'll
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.880]  use fascist they'll use right wing they'll use left wing read Carol
[36:59.880 --> 37:03.680]  quickly's book they're going to use a left-wing takeover in America that's
[37:03.680 --> 37:10.440]  their attack system that's their weapon system they're using and I you've got
[37:10.440 --> 37:13.800]  to admit you've been wrong you've got to admit you've been conned you've got to
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.160]  have an epiphany and break with the system mainline republicans are breaking
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.080]  with the mainline republicans they're becoming libertarians on record it's
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.080]  all over the news I told you years ago it was already happening because I'm on
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.280]  the ground I see what's going on the republican party is being taken over by
[37:31.280 --> 37:36.000]  patriots is being taken over by the liberty movement and it is scaring
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.440]  the daylights out of the globalist that's why you've got republican leadership
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.920]  and democratic leadership circling the wagons pooling the funding to the
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.200]  national association of manufacturers the national association of businesses the
[37:49.200 --> 37:56.040]  national all the big associations are getting together saying crush the
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.040]  tea party crush the libertarian takeover because we could save this
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.440]  republic we could save the American Empire by having soft power and exporting
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.800]  1776 our ideas we are meant to be discredited and lose our power as the
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.280]  lone superpower to transfer that to the global corporate system and we'll just
[38:17.280 --> 38:23.080]  be used as a Hessian military recruiting ground where we're so poor our fine
[38:23.080 --> 38:29.800]  warrior stock will be used to empower the last wave of human oppression with
[38:29.800 --> 38:35.560]  the last human army in the next 20 years we will be the last human army we
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.200]  will also be the first robot army they're gonna bring in the robot army as
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.320]  they phase out the human army and then they're gonna defeat the other human
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.960]  armies this has all been battle planned battle planned and they're gonna
[38:48.960 --> 38:54.360]  reeducate this whole country they are going to bring us down we're done they
[38:54.360 --> 39:00.440]  are gonna strangle us slow they're gonna take their time with us I'm telling you
[39:00.440 --> 39:05.200]  you cannot let them win ladies and gentlemen that's why I'm committed I'm
[39:05.200 --> 39:11.640]  not gonna selfishly for my own skin run and I'm not saying people that are
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.640]  talking about getting out are selfish if you're just a media person who can
[39:15.640 --> 39:20.480]  operate from anywhere in the world then it's probably strategic to leave the
[39:20.480 --> 39:26.280]  United States because this is the main battleground and if you're in the rear
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.120]  with the gear if you've got the brains you know we should probably to use the
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.880]  Starship troopers analogy stick the brain bugs off somewhere my issue is I've
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.160]  got to be on the front lines I'm meant to be out front that's what I've always
[39:42.160 --> 39:46.800]  done and that's what I'm going to do but it takes all kinds to beat this system
[39:46.800 --> 39:49.760]  but I want to say something to people that work for the system you know what
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.320]  I'm saying is true more than anybody you live it every day that's why it's
[39:53.320 --> 39:59.120]  actually easier to wake up government people than any other group because
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.360]  they're seeing the BS for themselves up front the military the police and I
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.000]  understand your compartmentalized I understand they've got you under a
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.760]  magnifying glass but if you all just start not complying and all just
[40:12.760 --> 40:17.600]  quietly start not going along with the system it's over for them before they
[40:17.600 --> 40:22.000]  get their casual society in before they get their AI total control future
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  predictive system in before they get their robot drones fully in before they
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.160]  get the end of humans end of free will system in we've got maybe five ten
[40:30.160 --> 40:36.440]  years to really dig in and commit and believe me they're taking a risk
[40:36.440 --> 40:43.040]  purging people that threatened Hillary Clinton in 2016 they're they're taking a
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.840]  real risk because they know 2014 is everything they know if we get libertarian
[40:48.840 --> 40:54.480]  constitutionalists in in the Republican machine which we're doing it's over for
[40:54.480 --> 40:58.680]  them they know they're in deep trouble that's why they're showing themselves
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.840]  right now with the political persecutions with the arrest they're trying to
[41:03.840 --> 41:06.760]  intimidate everybody and I think we point out they're trying to intimidate
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.240]  us and we point out they're a bunch of thugs and we shamefully you know expose
[41:12.240 --> 41:19.920]  we shame the corporate whore fake left and fake right but mainly the left of
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.880]  the huffings and posts and slate and salon and media matters run by the
[41:24.880 --> 41:30.880]  White House and MSNBC who are shortling at political arrest and setups when
[41:30.880 --> 41:37.000]  they should be absolutely freaking out right now I mean you should be absolutely
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  freaked out you think this evil isn't gonna eat you the first group they're
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.320]  gonna take out once they fully take over is you just by the way that's a
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.280]  historical fact you want to want to have a couple ships here that you can jump
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.840]  into in this big naval battle that's going on you want to sink every ship
[41:57.840 --> 42:05.120]  out here in this ICC of tyranny I mean your fools even even a corrupt person
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.400]  should want to process and want some type of checks and balances some type of
[42:11.400 --> 42:18.520]  diversity don't you have any sense you people know your gangsters your your
[42:18.520 --> 42:25.160]  thugs you're part of a crew that you think's taking over your idiots you know
[42:25.160 --> 42:30.840]  the biggest losers of World War two were it was the Germans 20 million Germans
[42:30.840 --> 42:36.400]  out of 70 million 21 million are estimated to have died only about six
[42:36.400 --> 42:45.000]  seven million of those are military what is that what is that 12 13 14 million
[42:45.000 --> 42:54.600]  German citizens how'd that work out for you think that worked out real good for
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.280]  you just because you you can race like a cancer through the body politic and
[42:58.280 --> 43:04.400]  nobody can stop you and by the way the Germans were set up as well with World
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.120]  War one that the British intelligence started and then Hitler was funded by
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.280]  British intelligence to get into power that's declassified didn't mean they
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.320]  ran Hitler just like they didn't run Saddam or they didn't fully run Bin
[43:15.320 --> 43:21.160]  Laden they put these guys in and then set them up later they told Hitler he was
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.680]  going to be given the whole world they almost had a fascist takeover in
[43:26.680 --> 43:31.080]  1935 here in the US read the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings
[43:31.080 --> 43:38.360]  Smedley Butler learn history the globalist had a fascist and a socialist
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.960]  model that they were using as a dialectic and the very same big megabanks the
[43:43.960 --> 43:48.200]  very same Rockefeller banks look it up this is mainline history they've got
[43:48.200 --> 43:53.520]  New York Times best-selling pull-it-surprise winning books on this
[43:55.440 --> 44:04.200]  what's that book written by black on IBM I mean go read that and they
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.680]  literally chose like they had a bunch of races they had of the Kentucky Derby
[44:08.680 --> 44:13.120]  with a bunch of different tyranny horses or horses and as they got down towards
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.560]  the end they had just two empires and they played them off against each other
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.520]  to consolidate power and then they adopted all the Nazi technologies that
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.160]  they liked into the American British Empire and that's why it's so similar
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.560]  today because these globalists sit there and play all sides off against the
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.960]  middle that is we the people and no one repeat no one should want to be part of
[44:34.960 --> 44:42.600]  this this is bad news for everybody where is your common sense IBM in the
[44:42.600 --> 44:48.720]  Holocaust yeah that's the book all of you should want to understand what the
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.520]  globalists say they're doing plan to do and have done because man it's their
[44:53.520 --> 44:58.320]  world we're living in their world they really do run about 90% of the planet
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.440]  now they're trying to get full control and when they get full control look out
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.680]  boys and girls because they plan on killing almost everybody and I just
[45:07.680 --> 45:13.080]  don't know how I can say that to you any other way that's why that's why I'm
[45:13.080 --> 45:16.720]  gonna stay and fight but then my brain goes wait a minute if you left the
[45:16.720 --> 45:22.080]  country it would send a bigger signal and it would show everybody how serious
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.600]  it was and it would with would remove you from their clutches the problem is
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.800]  they're grabbing people's money that's legal and after tax globally now I mean
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.680]  presidents of third-world countries of Latin America have their planes
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.200]  grounded by NATO flying out of Russia to see if Snowden's on board they already
[45:40.200 --> 45:43.680]  run the world they've already got it where you in police come and grab you
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.920]  on fake warrants wherever they want they already engage in illegal grabbing of
[45:48.920 --> 45:52.920]  people everywhere that that's the whole point is that leaving is almost an
[45:52.920 --> 45:59.960]  illusion unless I went to Russia the globalists do not control Russia but
[45:59.960 --> 46:03.960]  it's like one black hat against the other I go to Russia do I get shaken down
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.000]  by the Russian mafia then the media says oh Alex Jones what's a Russia no I'm
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.360]  not going to Russia ever been to Russia I'm an American nothing against Russia
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.280]  but things might get so bad someday I gotta go to Russia I mean I cannot
[46:17.280 --> 46:28.200]  believe our country is so evil that I'd have to move to Chile and then sit there
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.800]  with illegal firearms at a farm and wait for them to try to send somebody to
[46:33.800 --> 46:36.880]  interdict and put a bag over my head and put me on a state department
[46:36.880 --> 46:40.120]  aircraft and I'm not doing that you go ahead and try to come put a bag on my
[46:40.120 --> 46:48.120]  head and see what happens you sick freaks I'm not scared of you you'd understand
[46:48.120 --> 46:52.120]  that I'm figuring out what the best thing is to make sure in the end we beat
[46:52.120 --> 46:55.240]  you and you know what's gonna happen once there's trials you're gonna have
[46:55.240 --> 46:59.800]  public trials Nuremberg style and then you know I don't take any pleasure in
[46:59.800 --> 47:03.280]  that by the way you're like a roach I don't want to step on just get out of my
[47:03.280 --> 47:08.680]  house you're not gonna get stepped on you stupid roaches if you have any sense
[47:08.680 --> 47:12.240]  you wouldn't join with this evil but you're so into evil you're like a moth
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.200]  to flame you have to commit to it Matt drudge said it all I retweeted it at

[47:44.760 --> 47:47.400]  is maybe during the break they'll show me how to do that so I can actually send
[47:47.400 --> 47:52.480]  his tweets people can properly retweet it there's a great article up on info
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.800]  wars.com by Matt Slavo that gives an example of why drudge is saying this
[47:57.800 --> 48:02.000]  instead of the other news articles that made jokes about it I mean I love people
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.960]  that make jokes about the fact that we are too managed to midnight here Matt

[59:04.280 --> 59:08.920]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:08.920 --> 59:14.360]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[59:14.360 --> 59:19.720]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ

[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.480]  Alex Jones
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.360]  we got Wayne Madsen coming up in 20 minutes talk about all the tyranny the
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.720]  purges going on secret police units the NSA info he's a whistleblower we're
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.160]  gonna be taking your calls and covering other news I'm just I'm just so upset
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.720]  that I can't cover all the other crazy things that are happening because
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.360]  Obama is becoming a dictator officially they're gutting the country we're in a
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:01.000]  depression and all I hear about is the Super Bowl coming up and it literally is
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.480]  like out of a science fiction movie how crazy this is and they're persecuting and
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.880]  arresting members of the press that are exposing Obama they are getting away
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.240]  with incredible crimes publicly and when the corrupt do that they go for
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.520]  everything they're going for everything because culturally they're losing the
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:25.360]  battle culturally libertarian ideas are taking over renaissance ideas are
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.520]  taking over so they are coming after us you understand folks if we give in to
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.320]  them it's even worse the best course is fighting them the best course is
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.400]  standing against them it's the only course
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:45.560]  let's go to Steven Chicago Steve you're on the air go ahead I do it Alex
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.720]  longtime listener the issue is I think open housing started the open borders
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.320]  would start at open trade now we go back into the 1960s there was states rights
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.320]  the right-wing governor great state of Alabama George Corley Wallace was
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.720]  standing up to the federal government he stood in that doorway the University
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.600]  of Alabama now how many of the other people stood with them that's the
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.920]  question I have and and you know the issue is if you don't have the open
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.800]  housing and I never found out your position or the libertarian position on
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.720]  open housing how that was a causation factor I'd like to know how you feel
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.960]  about open housing well that's a very complex issue I think it's wrong to
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.360]  deny people housing based on their race or religion especially if it's something
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.760]  like an apartment house but at the same time I think individuals if they don't
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.320]  particularly let's say like their Satanist or something you know there's
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.560]  got to be some right to refuse service but it's an evil to deny people but it
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.200]  then it becomes an even greater evil now that they're saying under agenda 21
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.840]  you've got to live in a 250 square foot coffin apartment so so to see it shows
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.040]  how the Democratic Party couldn't win with segregation so they flipped and
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.160]  became against it but but created the government reservations and the
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.680]  government housing so it's an incredibly complex issue but I would not say if I
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.640]  had a house I mean the people's money was green if they were white black
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.480]  Hispanic Asian whatever it was I wouldn't sell them a house but if they
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.000]  were like white trash meth dealing you know people with the devil tattoos all
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.480]  of them and their wife had cigarette burns on them and they wanted to buy my
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.680]  house I would not sell it to them because I would want to be mean to my
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.040]  neighbors but if it was a nice upstanding black family I'd sell them the
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.960]  house in a minute I mean but it was a degenerate black family I'd say oh
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.080]  okay I'll meet with you later but I mean yeah obviously I wouldn't sell in the
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.360]  house does that make sense well the only issue is the rhetoric of white trash I
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.360]  never hear black trash I never hear a brown trash there's lots of black
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.240]  trash I'll say I mean yeah yeah and and and the other issue of well Randy Paul
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.800]  was talking about privacy and then he gets up there and then he accuses Bill
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.040]  Clinton who did something in private with that Monica Lewinsky and now wait a
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.600]  minute but well let's let's be consistent here if we're gonna keep the
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.760]  privacy let's keep that private and and the third issue I wanted to tell you
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.080]  these things about the Rothschilds number one Carl Coleman Rothschild he got
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.560]  for funding the Vatican Bank he got the Holy George Award from the Knights of
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.760]  Malta KC the second thing I want to tell you 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war

[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.000]  every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat

[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.440]  yesterday I've retweeted at real alex jones Matt drudge tweeted that we all
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.840]  need to have an exit plan and so I asked the question to everybody out there
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.240]  what is your exit plan should we be talking about an exit plan if America
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:05.560]  totally falls because here's the problem the establishment does it not plan on
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.480]  just taking over they plan on re-engineering and persecuting people
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.440]  and they're already doing it with the Dinesh to Suza and governors anybody
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.680]  that challenges Hillary Clinton they're making the path ready they're getting
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.080]  ready to legalize all the illegals they're giving them driver's license
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:23.400]  everywhere to vote and to block the libertarian movement that has taken over
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:29.320]  the Republican Party and I'm trying to reach out to folks you know to the
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.040]  immigrant group but they are being funded by the government with food stamps
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:39.000]  and welfare and it's a lost cause it is a lost cause and it will drive the wages
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.480]  down all the studies show it it will not help Latin America it is so sad I
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.720]  wish Mexico was some first-world country with all its resources that's three
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.600]  times the resources and major studies the US does and I wish I could move down
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.240]  there and get away from all this I wish there was some free country to go to I've
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:04.880]  had to look at Latin America chili rural areas are some of the only places to go
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.280]  where the people are halfway moral and not completely out of control with a
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:15.920]  mafia government believe me and it's so sad I mean our country is millimeters
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:22.120]  millimeters millimeters from falling and we need to get a giant wave of
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.760]  libertarians in and the Republican Party ticket which is starting to happen and
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.040]  we need to start prosecuting the Attorney General and Obama and all these
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.640]  people to turn back the precedent that the president can be a dictator and
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:41.840]  above the law I mean I called for Bush's impeachment I called for Clinton's
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.400]  impeachment because they've all been crooks but under Obama it's 10 15 20
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.160]  times worse you've got the media going well he is an imperial president but
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.480]  isn't that kind of needed that's what we need somebody that can get stuff done and
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.880]  I know lately all I've been doing is harping on this there's never been more
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:06.560]  news to cover and I'm getting to some of it but this is front and center not just
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.280]  for the US but the whole world and and I knew Obama be their puppet their front
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.600]  man I thought maybe they were so worried about revolution under Bush that
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.000]  they would have him be a unifier he's just promising to do that and that you
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.360]  know maybe they wanted to fix the economy and move forward because they
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.080]  were skimming off the top but now I realize they want to fully break the
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.040]  country now they have such a hatred of the American people and freedom and
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.040]  guns and the Bible and bitter clingers and that the Democratic Party Socialist
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.040]  and Communist operatives that the foreign banks are running have such
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.040]  enmity towards anything good that they're not gonna back off they're
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.320]  coming for all of us they're all a bunch of soft cowards themselves but they
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.400]  run the ATF the FBI the NSA the CIA the state police are federalized and
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.480]  they're coming after everybody and I look at Mary Landrieu and Chucky Schumer
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.360]  and all of them and and and and they're all a bunch of crooks they're all a
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.960]  bunch of gangsters and you've got former Secretary of Defense Gates endorsing
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.360]  Obama I mean it is disgusting you've got Boehner the Speaker of the House saying
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.480]  get ready to totally legalize all the illegals and then whoever else comes
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:22.840]  after that and knowing full well it's the Democratic Party voting block because
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.720]  you've got the big national associations a broadcasters committing
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.880]  suicide supporting the Republican leadership you've got the National
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.720]  Association manufacturers the small business groups the the Chamber of
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.520]  Commerce they're all endorsing going after the Tea Party type in Chamber of
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.800]  Commerce funds anti Tea Party movement because we're the only opposition even
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.640]  though the Tea Party wasn't perfect but it came out of Ron Paul an anti-war
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.080]  pro-liberty anti big government movement the Republicans got scared by it tried
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:00.320]  to co-opt it seven years ago that failed Carl Rowe failed now it's fully
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.920]  woken up we've won the battle for the Tea Party they are freaking out we're the
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.680]  only opposition on the field of battle and so you've got the National
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:17.040]  Associations the business leagues all of them wanting more open borders more
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:28.600]  unfair trade more garbage more fraud more everything and it's so serious they
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.000]  want a full takedown they want control of the whole empire they don't understand
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.120]  that even if they want an empire they need some free market and liberty that
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.880]  makes us strong and as a blood supply their cancer they don't even know that
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.800]  from an evil perspective they're just gobbling up every tissue every organ the
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.160]  bloodstream the whole deal America's like a huge mutated half undead
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.720]  stumbling monster right now and the heart still beating the guts are still
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.080]  working and the zombie is attacking itself because it sees what's still alive
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.920]  as an enemy even though it's what's keeping the undead creature going that's
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.400]  how screwed up these people are I would compromise with them if they could be
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.240]  compromised with they cannot be compromised with they are evil I want to
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:22.080]  go to Radon Jerry Billy Tom but Steve I promised that I'd let you finish up your
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.640]  point on open borders and stuff go ahead
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:32.480]  recapping where Franco-Prussian war Paris 1871 every palace every Salish
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.040]  et al plundered looted burned destroyed except for the Rothschilds meaning the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.520]  Rothschilds were behind as a false flag operation the Parisian Communist
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.760]  takeover that's indirect proof of that now the last point I have about the
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.920]  Rothschilds you talk about England the Lord Beaconsfield Rothschild he was so
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:58.000]  powerful that when he went out on the street in the 1800s all the carriages
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.560]  and everybody all the pedestrians had to stand at attention petrified as a game
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.880]  of statues until the Rothschild carriage passed and that shows me that these
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.720]  guys are behind the wrist and like you said it's a some kind of conspiracy
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.200]  international conspiracy behind this kind of thing to overthrow any kind of
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.880]  independent movement that's out there I appreciate it Alex well it's true the
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.240]  Rothschilds indirectly funded Hitler they funded the Bolsheviks on record they
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.520]  funded Napoleon and then helped bring him down I mean it's all in the history
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.000]  books and I have read about different Rothschilds so powerful that everyone
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.680]  would stand at attention like when the Queen of England was around and they
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:44.600]  were so powerful they inter married with the royalty I mean it's incredible who
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.960]  do you think's funding all this stuff it's unbelievable Radon in Idaho you're
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:57.040]  on the air go ahead good prank call appreciate that Jerry in Ohio you're
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.240]  on the air go ahead how you doing Alex Jones I'm a long-time listener and hey
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:10.560]  I do spread the info wars message thank you brother and I just want to make a
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.920]  couple quick comments here in northeast Ohio they're really getting the people
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:22.040]  primed to stand at attention we got these FEMA churches they're giving out
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.600]  food people got to get there like six o'clock in the morning no matter what
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.080]  the weather is like they won't open the doors to like 10 o'clock but they got
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.120]  people that walk down the line and tell people you know you got to stand here
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.840]  you know you know that's just like the Soviet Union they had plenty of food but
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.320]  it was all about making you stand at attention for five hours it is training
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.960]  you and wasting your time and teaching you that only they have it in Venezuela
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.200]  they make the children pray to Jesus when they're hungry in the morning and
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.960]  then no milk or cereal is given then you pray to Shavez the milk and cereal is
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:04.360]  given and and also Alex they're buying up these parks they're creating parks but
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.880]  the strange thing about it they have a road going through them but the road is
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.040]  always got a barrier that's closed and I believe that they're going to convert
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.800]  some of these parks and it's on record that the major sports stadiums and
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.760]  major parks are designated as emergency centers under FEMA so your gut is right
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:30.160]  and it's public intel and one of your one of your documents that you put out
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.760]  had an octopus over the globe and it said nowhere we can't reach that was the
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:43.120]  NSA put that out and they make jokes and say that we are in 1984 and laugh at
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.200]  the American people and describe us as the enemy I appreciate your call God
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:52.520]  bless you sir great points let's talk to Tom in Kansas Tom you're on the air and
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.520]  I guess that was his point about leaving the country there's no where they can't
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.920]  reach go ahead Tom hey Alex I got a few points one is the strategic relocation
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:08.240]  I bought it read it and watch the video excellent work if I if I got it right I
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.200]  haven't read it for some time but I'm right I think ABO's was the Ozarks the
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.960]  safest place on earth that that Joe Scalton came up he said it was a safer
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.920]  area the best place in Texas is the Hill Country strangely enough where I live
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:28.560]  then there's also the area in and around areas of Utah into Idaho he says
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:34.080]  that's very safe okay I wonder if that's where that Frank Caller was calling
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.160]  from well everything collapses that Frank Caller can call in and make print
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:45.760]  calls exactly how about nice that let's go to nation iodine the RDA on the
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.160]  bottle is six drops and I didn't feel like I was getting enough from that so
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.040]  do you think it's okay to like take 12 or sir you do whatever you want you need
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.760]  to consult your physician we go with the FDA recommendation I mean under agenda
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.160]  21 they're in Europe they've lowered stuff down almost nothing even lower
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.400]  than here but whatever's good for your body I'm not going to give medical
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.560]  advice here all I can say is it's been life-changing for me and as stressful as

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.480]  Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.720]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans

[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.880]  well you can address his questions to him he's as smart as I am or smarter he
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.920]  can answer all your questions he was formerly an anti-submarine warfare then
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.040]  recruited by the NSA he headed up one of their internal security operations and
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.320]  he is the consummate original NSA whistleblower testifying the
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.080]  parliaments the EU parliament you name it Congress and he basically has broken
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.440]  I'd say half of what we know along with James Bamford and others being part of
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.920]  the other half and I'm not poo-pooing Snowden it's just that he's the proto
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.080]  Snowden but he did it back when they didn't arrest every whistleblower for
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.640]  exposing crime since then I've just marveled at everything he talks about
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:16.160]  coming true I want to talk to Wayne Madson first about the purge the nest
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.960]  to Suza had movies coming out to try to unify America he had another film they
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.080]  were gonna work on later I've been told by high-level sources about Hillary he's
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.880]  now been indicted on petty stuff pled not guilty the governor of Virginia could
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:36.880]  beat Hillary he's been indicted the Veritas project or project Veritas the
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.920]  governor's preparing basically to indict them with subpoenas so they're going
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.080]  after everybody and I Bob Barr last week warned of this I talked about it
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:50.560]  before it even happened what do you know about the purge going on and this
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.600]  next phase of what Obama may try to do because he's openly behaving as a
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.960]  dictator now I thought he'd leave office and just transfer dictatorial power to
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.360]  the executive the special interest wanted why would the system gamble and
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.200]  get this naked or are the Clintons doing a power move trying to actually take
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.920]  over Wayne Madson what is your high-level inside Intel telling you well
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.120]  the more things change the more they say the same as the French always say look
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.520]  the second term is always a pitfall for a lot of presidents they get a little
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.240]  too cocky in their second term they think they're you know they can do
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.480]  anything they want look what happened to Richard Nixon look what happened to
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.400]  Ronald Reagan next with Watergate Ronald Reagan with Iran Contra there's
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:44.240]  going to be an attempt now to create a long lasting legacy for Obama and you
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.560]  know that look these these second term guys think that they're pretty
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:55.920]  invulnerable after all they do we've got a lot of history to back that up and I
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:10.200]  noticed the just yesterday the Virginia Senate went to the Democrats by a 11
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:16.720]  vote margin you know these close elections are rather I think they're to
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.760]  see so many elections within a razor's edge I just don't think that's
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:25.320]  statistically possible to see so many not just in this country but around the
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:31.120]  world I think that they're still fixing these elections so we've got that going
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.440]  on as well I agree with you that it's a power grab ahead of trying to get
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.240]  Hillary in but there's something different it's so rapacious so aggressive
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.080]  you think there's any chance they might stage domestic false flags and then try
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.560]  to keep Obama in office well it's funny you mentioned that look look at the
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:58.400]  report today of what happened with Hamid Karzai you know our puppet in
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.320]  Afghanistan but even sometimes puppets get a mind of their own
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.840]  Hamid Karzai is now accusing the United States of staging false flag terrorist
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.280]  attacks that are being blamed on the Taliban to undermine his regime so you
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.680]  know we're told that false flags don't exist that this is in the realm of
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.320]  conspiracy theories well I guess if that's true we've got a new conspiracy
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.520]  theorist in Hamid Karzai somebody who was groomed by the United States
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.680]  intelligence services placed in power and been maintained in power all these
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:38.520]  many years by the United States at a very very expensive cost and both blood
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:45.400]  and treasure if we describe this as a football game how is it going for the
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.960]  different corrupt regimes because people are waking up more than ever at the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.080]  same time they are just dissolving the basic liberties putting currency
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.960]  controls and capital controls and we see the clamps going on right now why do
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.920]  you think that's happening well I think these governments look there the
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.880]  jet set just met again in Davos at their annual glove in and of course who was
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.800]  there this year that the new president of Iran Rouhani so it looks like Iran is
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.000]  now going to be brought into the fold what's happening in Ukraine right now
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  is is really a shot at that Vladimir Putin let's talk about that when we
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.640]  come back the geopolitical rundown report with Wayne Madsen because I can't
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.240]  think of a better person to give us an analysis he's traveled the whole world
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:37.000]  as the sources yeah George Soros's people trying to overthrow the Ukraine
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  after they voted down merging with the EU we'll be back on the other side with
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Wayne Madsen your phone calls and more stay with us

[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:11.640]  for the greater good and they're trying to make it the law in places like new york first it's o for the greater good then it becomes the law so they can dial in and watch you
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:18.640]  and i heard a local talk show host yesterday in austin defending the nsa warrantlessly spying on people
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.640]  saying well i trust them they're the good guys just go ahead and spy on me it's no they're not the good guys
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:31.640]  even if they were good guys you create an omnipresent system bad guys will get control of it and it will be abused
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:38.640]  that's why free countries don't have that but really it's a sense of cowardice and that's why free countries don't have that
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.640]  but really it's a sense of cowardice out there
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:54.640]  i remember the houston police chief five years ago on local television saying we're going to put cameras in all your houses and watch you for your own good
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.640]  people said that's crazy well they were just getting you ready like msnbc saying your kids belong to the state
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.640]  the 20th time you hear it it doesn't sound as crazy
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:11.640]  they're conditioning us they're using psychological warfare so we're like well of course smart meters track everything you do in taxia
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:18.640]  ten years ago i'd tell people and i was crazy it didn't exist because they knew that was 1984 ten years ago
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:26.640]  now it's like well of course it tracks and watches you of course the camera on the laptop watches you and of course the schools watch your kids
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:34.640]  and of course the police come in your house without a warrant and of course we do force inoculations and of course all this is happening
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:41.640]  imagine living in a glass house i think i'm going to send out my reporters to do a man on the street in austin to the trendy area and say
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:47.640]  we want you to live in glass houses you know just in case something bad happens we can see it going on
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:54.640]  and i bet if we say it's for obama people will sign because they want to be trendy i mean it'd be racist if they didn't
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.640]  or maybe go out and say you know we want to make people wear clear clothing so that we can see if they have a gun on them
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:09.640]  and maybe even have a woman wearing a tiny bikini under a plastic c3 raincoat to illustrate it
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.640]  that'll get mega millions of views right there to then educate sheeple that wouldn't normally watch a video like that to say
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  this is how we're going to dress down to make sure there's no weapon and like the tsa has said and the police will show clips of the state police
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.640]  we need to have proctology exams now because there could be a bomb in anybody's butt
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.640]  this is a total overthrow of all common sense
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.640]  Wayne Madsen i want to get into your geopolitical breakdown right now
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.640]  we're getting into ukraine and more in the state of the world but before we do that because i digressed off into this
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  seeing this new article that just went up on info wars dot com by steve watson
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.640]  spy on thy neighbor as thyself as the whole of the law that is the golden rule
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:55.640]  big brother is my king my lord my helper unto you i give all please stop my face in oh i love you
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:58.640]  big brother double plus good
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.640]  Wayne Madsen i want to ask you the question here
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.640]  what do you call this total transformation and the nsa coming out of the closet
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.640]  and and and all their lives exposed but they just double down
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.640]  and now over gonna watch you in your house for your own good
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640]  what is happening here Wayne Madsen
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:20.640]  well it's a global panopticon where nobody will have any privacy a panopticon
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.640]  is a structure no matter that no matter where you are in that structure
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.640]  you're going to be seen from a central location
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:35.640]  so we would have known none of the details of the of this capability
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:39.640]  had it not been for all the technical diagrams and
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.640]  powerpoint slides and other documents released by ed snowden the latest one is this operation
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.640]  called squeaky dolphin i mean they come up with some of the strangest names for these
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.640]  these cover terms for these intelligence systems you know it makes people think of flipper
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:04.640]  instead of big brother but we've got that now evidence that nsa is spying 24 by 7
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.640]  in real time on on flicker on photo bucket on youtube on twitter on facebook
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.640]  and and it goes on and on so any anything you do with the internet is now being
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.640]  surveilled by nsa so all these nsa apologists out there including this gang
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.640]  that you and i and the rest of every american taxpayer
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.640]  pays for this gang up at the naval war college in newport road island
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:36.640]  two professors and i'll name them tom nickels and john schindler are constantly
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.640]  berating journalists for citing all this all this type of surveillance illegal
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.640]  surveillance being conducted by nsa they get away with it on our dime and i have
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:54.640]  i have protested to the superintendent at the naval war college that guy
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.640]  admiral carter needs to have his star pole he's allowing this national security staff
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  at the naval war college in newport road island to front for the nsa and what
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.640]  that's right and of course it's totally illegal to have the pentagon operating
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.640]  domestically but three months ago they announced they're going to reach out to
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.640]  us with a psi op to alternative real media because we're actually threatening
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.640]  what they're doing and it's just an incredible precedent wane when they get
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  up on tv and clapper goes we don't spy on any americans
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.640]  it's a total lie he doesn't get in trouble for perjury to congress a felony
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.640]  it's rapidly expanding and it's all admitted what they do the entire internet
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:43.640]  architecture has been built by darpa and inspect by darpa for a system to predict
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.640]  the future to the point of amazon shipping your order before you order it
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:53.640]  that's right and you know i got a simple i got a simple challenge for the naval war college
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.640]  they claim they're only doing this in the interest of academic freedom
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.640]  well the naval war college is the u.s. navy it's part of the u.s. navy it's not
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:08.640]  it's not penn state it's not it's not some private school somewhere harvard or
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.640]  yale if they're interested in academic freedom let the superintendent naval war
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.640]  college establish a group of offices for you and i up there so we can counter
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.640]  every one of those pro nsa professors and and do it on on their nickel which is
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.640]  our nickel so you know if he's interested in academic freedom i put that challenge
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.640]  forward to him well i know this is stuck in your crawl what they're doing with
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.640]  they're not having any effect they're pathetic so i mean i think they should
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:40.640]  just continue their treasonous activity openly so we can identify them i mean
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.640]  my issue is is that you know let us have it scum i mean we're here openly
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  being proven right we're rising you're falling you pick the wrong team you've
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.640]  dishonored yourself you've dishonored the country dishonored your family so
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.640]  you know go from us lick the hand that feeds you and your chain sit lightly
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.640]  upon you shifting gears into the geopolitical and i want to get back
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.640]  first off nsa you're usually telling us days or weeks before like you said get
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.640]  ready for them spying on the Vatican and three days later it comes out you know
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640]  they're spying on the Vatican i mean so you've got your ear to the ground what's
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:19.640]  the next shoes to drop with the nsa look we only have about two percent of
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  this of the documents said snowden has said to have retrieved from all those
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.640]  various nsa databases i think i think what we're going to hear if we are
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.640]  allowed to see these and these are let's face it these are only being released
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  in piecemeal fashion to many different media organizations it's really hard to
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:44.640]  see these in total but wait till we start seeing some stuff about historical
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:50.640]  documents from the nsa on from nine eleven for example i think we're going
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:55.640]  to we're going to see that the cheney and the rest of that gang rumsfeld lied as
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:59.640]  we all said they did but i think that's going to be backed up with some
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:05.640]  evidence from a system at nsa called critic calm the critic system these this
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:10.640]  is sent it used to send critical messages about hijacked airplanes so it's
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.640]  so it's kind of like nixon got hung and on his own petard whenever his own
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:23.640]  tapes burning that's right so so if these if this if this stuff i can't believe
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.640]  he doesn't have that stuff i think he knew exactly what to go after in
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.640]  addition you know squeaky clean and egotistical giraffe and all this other
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  stuff i would think that the nine eleven stuff and he's already said stones
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.640]  already said you know that he's got this doomsday thing and they go after him
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.640]  the stuff's going to be released i think i think that's probably what we're
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.640]  talking about when when it's released i don't know i just wish this stuff had
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:54.640]  just been released in full to somebody like john young at krypton who i would
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.640]  notice also now being attacked by that naval war college now let's get john
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:03.640]  young back on the show guys asap from krypton by the way if i was snowed and
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.640]  i'd never come back i mean the globalists are never going to let him get
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.640]  away with what he's done that's too big an example to other people to be a
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.640]  hero they're going to try to through back channels claim he's a double operative
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.640]  or a russian spy all this complete crud the russians tried to get rid of him
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.640]  the russians know what the nsa is doing
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  now last month alex i reported on an attempt by the british embassy in
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.640]  moscow to try to rendition snowed in out of moscow and it failed because i went
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.640]  on russian television the russian language television not rt russia won
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:40.640]  news and said look this is the plan it involves the mi6 at the british embassy
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.640]  i i named the the mi6 head at the embassy as being in charges they were going
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.640]  to try to use another american who worked at nsa in moscow as a lure for
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.640]  snowed and it failed and then we heard about the attempts to maybe try to
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.640]  kill him but putin has already given him now permanent asylum it was one year
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.640]  but he's extended that permanently i think he's best staying in russia i
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.640]  would certainly do it if i were in his shoes and by the way now i guess
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.640]  they're giving him russian security because of these threats that you broke
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.640]  just like you broke that they had tapped the undersea cables said exactly
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.640]  which ones you said the germans had tapped the Mediterranean that they were
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.640]  involved merkel then came out and claimed oh they're spying on me but
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.640]  everything you said in the guardian turned out to be true but instead of
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.640]  saying oh you're right they make fun of you on cnn and then basically deep six
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:38.640]  the article well and that's because it's not just the nsa that has this
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.640]  propaganda operation anybody who criticizes anything that obama is involved
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:48.640]  with so it was cnn and daily beast which is the daily beast might as well be an
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  obama newsletter you know i i why don't they just have him as the editor of
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.640]  it you know he you know he has some experience he's supposedly edited
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.640]  newsletters at business international corporation when he worked in the cia
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.640]  but but yeah yeah but putin is now because the sochi olympic start on
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:12.640]  february 7th look ukraine is to the west of sochi george is to the right and
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.640]  and you've also got all those muslim republics and the caucuses they are
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.640]  really and then you got prince bandar following through with his threat to
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.640]  disrupt the sochi let's stop right there this is the one thing i wish i had
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.640]  the money to do i'd have like two analysts who sit in there and record and
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.640]  write down everything you say and our other guests and when it comes true
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  cover it it was three four months ago you reported on the russian news that
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.640]  bandar had said that he was going to start activating al-qaeda ahead of the
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.640]  olympics and daring it to ruin the winter olympics if they didn't back off in
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.640]  syria they've now gone ahead with that i mean it's just tell tell us what's
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.640]  coming next then because you've been breaking all this well i think the
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.640]  russians are very concerned so now they've allowed the u.s. to station
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.640]  law enforcement officials in russia in sochi you got the u.s. navy that's going
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.640]  to be right off the coast the russians were concerned at first now they're
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.640]  more welcoming of that presence but i would be very concerned if i were the
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:17.640]  russians that this u.s. military and law enforcement presence isn't used to
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:21.640]  facilitate something in sochi rather than prevent it so i would be very
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.640]  concerned the russians are as smart as we are so let me ask this why are they
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  allowing those ships in i mean what's the point of that just i guess to just
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.640]  take the high road or what's the point now if anything happens they can say
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.640]  look at you know the blame goes around it wasn't just our security that failed
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:42.640]  look at the u.s. had their people here as well but uh well i get it they're
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.640]  hedging bets and spreading the blame exactly exactly which you might expect
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.640]  them to do but you know sochi it's such you know the whole attempt is with the
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  boycott because of russia's policies on gays and and all this other thing now
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:04.640]  we've got the soros topless prolapse the femen women protesting against
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.640]  let's talk about that i don't want russia to run ukraine and i don't want the e
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:13.640]  u that's like a new soviet empire sucking them dry ukrainian for the
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  ukrainians the russians have backed off ukraine now they've got soros when they
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.640]  voted a month ago not to join the e u literally trying to burn that place down
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.640]  he is a seditious little bastard since the days of him being a main collaborator
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.640]  with the nazis hunting down jews and if you point that out which he admitted on
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.640]  cbs 60 minutes you're called anti-semitic by the adl
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:41.640]  oh that's right i mean the soros is what soros is he's a he's a provocateur he
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.640]  makes money remember he has a hedge fund called the quantum fund when there's a
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:49.640]  when there's any kind of disruption in places like ukraine or russia or
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  anywhere else he makes money on that and he comes across as this progressive
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  he's not a progressive he's the perfect villain for the next game spawn movie as
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.640]  a matter of fact he may have already been a villain in quantum of solace i don't
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.640]  think it was a mistake that quantum was the uh the villain and then in the last
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.640]  couple of james bond right and they're trying to shut off the water to
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  quadruple the prices that's right that's right which is an actual scam he's run
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.640]  in latin america over and over again and uh the whole idea of getting ukraine in
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:23.640]  the e u is to get them to start accepting genetically modified foods from
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.640]  monsanto ukraine is the bread basket for russia and what better way to penetrate
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  russia and then china also buys wheat and soy from ukraine so what a what a better
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:40.640]  way to penetrate these two markets that right now ban genetically modify here's
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.640]  the deal of ukraine is one of the other government that's their issue but when
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.640]  it's a foreign orchestrated those protesters are on record working for
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:53.640]  foundation groups they're they're basically enemy soldiers yeah and you know the
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.640]  street the street brochures handed out to the protestors and made on square in
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:02.640]  Kiev or this are in ukrainian but they're the same leaflets that were handed out to
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.640]  those in terrier square in egypt and we know how well that one turned out yeah
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:11.640]  trying to turn those countries over to al-qaeda but look none of that's going
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.640]  well for them i would say brzezinski's operation right now i give him a c-
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.640]  minus it's almost an f absolutely i mean brzezinski is a well known
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.640]  nationalist polish nationalists who's always had a thing about bringing down
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.640]  russia and you know why people like him and all great who had a problem with the
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.640]  slobby countries in the Balkans you go slobby whites people are allowed to be
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  secretaries of state national security advisors are beyond me we can throw
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  henry kissinger in the mix they bring their baggage from their home countries
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.640]  they might as well come over on one of those tramp steamers with all the baggage
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:54.640]  and luggage that they bring into our national office and then they bring all
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:00.640]  that and it affects our foreign policy in a very adverse way absolutely i mean
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.640]  if you're new listener folks we're not left or right here it's about what's
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.640]  justice in the high ground the moral high ground we're builders not destroyers
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.640]  we want to build america build the rest of the world work together then if you
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.640]  double crosses we crush you but we're sick of being the bad guys while the
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.640]  very same programs of deindustrialization that the west is using against other
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:27.640]  people are being used against us these are anti prosperity thugs running things
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  they're gangsters and we're done with it and they're trying to cause world war
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.640]  three with the russians and you know it's time they go down when i want to take
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:38.640]  some calls the next two segments when we come back folks that are holding on

[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.640]  online comments he had made about his gun collection no god-fearing americans

[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  the ground what are they getting ready for we've seen dollar jitters we've
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.640]  seen suppression of gold prices coming out mainstream news we see a lot of
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.640]  trouble holding down inflation will they keep going queuing unlimited what's
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.640]  happening well i may want to keep this going with this printing up this
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.640]  work was currency but i i get a sense and i've been out here in the pacific
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.640]  northwest for last several weeks i am i'm getting the feeling that people are
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.640]  starting to hunker down that this i this this i almost this disease of
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.640]  massive consumerism i gotta buy this i gotta buy this i need more i need more
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.640]  it's people are starting to realize that's not the way to go they're buying
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:34.640]  only what they need i think we see more in a way of bartering going on at least
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:38.640]  i've seen it here in the northwest i think this is sending shock waves through
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:46.640]  the the business system the the moguls of finance and banking
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  and they've got to create some sort of a artificial crisis to get themselves
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:57.640]  out of this because people are getting smart they're not going to put up with
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:03.640]  this anymore and they're no longer just buying for the sake of buying and i
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.640]  they can say what they want about the last christmas shopping season sure as
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.640]  we're way off and and people now are not using as much gasoline what is that
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.640]  doing to the for the oil companies that means they can't justify the keystone
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:21.640]  pipeline anymore they can't justify fracking because people are getting
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.640]  smarter they're they're start as i say they're starting to hunker down and
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  when when they lose these compliant consumers then you're cutting into
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  their their bottom line and they hate that so that's right they want to support
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:42.640]  they want to support but in their system stay there

[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:53.640]  they don't think about people like you and i they you know there's you know a

[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.640]  billion dollars to play in their game now

[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:18.640]  any subject billy in california wants to talk about what i said i'd ask wane
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:24.640]  will ask that now exiting the u.s.a. is there anywhere to run
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.640]  well we only have to look at it snowed in to figure that one out where can he go
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:36.640]  right now and i people have asked me where what's safe for him you know he could
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:42.640]  probably get asylum in brazil bolivia ecuador one of these countries in
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:47.640]  latin america but but latin america is in the u.s. sphere of influence it's the
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:51.640]  playground for the cia and although we have very bad relations with men as well
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:55.640]  ecuador bolivia and brazil right now because of our involvement interference
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.640]  in our affairs well yeah we got all kinds of near new wells that you know
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.640]  wander around those countries i don't think you'd be all that safe there
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.640]  europe of course that's all you and nato all they would just turn him over in a
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:14.640]  minute from any country from from finland all the way down to portugal would be
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:19.640]  more than happy to turn them in for a few extra you know euros or dollars from
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:26.640]  what old uncle sam so china i you know i even china i would not china will not
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.640]  do anything well adversely affect their ability to make money and if they feel
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.640]  snow is doing that they may in fact be more than well you gotta say it as bad
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.640]  as the russians have been at many levels everybody says that putin looks so much
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:45.640]  more honorable with his pro-family stance his anti radicalism stance that's real
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:51.640]  not fake everything he's done saying he's a christian everything flies in the
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.640]  face and you know it would have been better for them to just turn snowden over
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.640]  what do you think's going on in russia well and you know putin's uh putin's
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.640]  standing his ground i mean he he did not want to see ukraine join the e you and
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:09.640]  the henset going to nato whatever happened to malin albright who said
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.640]  with nato would never extend into eastern europe this is what she said
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:18.640]  early on this is what warren christopher said this is what bill clinton said
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.640]  and no sooner had they said it they were already bringing in poland and now it's
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.640]  the ball takes and now they want to bring in ukraine and george and the russians
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.640]  watched him bomb sir b and hand a third of that over to al qaeda i mean the russians
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.640]  see what's happening absolutely so putin is standing his ground on on you know
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.640]  this femen group and then there's a group called boina and then there's another
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.640]  uh there's all these other uh soros back groups they're always staging these

[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.640]  collaborators and he runs the left
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.640]  alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:09.640]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:14.640]  is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the

[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:36.640]  make no mistake alright Wayne i said we go to calls let's go to them
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.640]  you gave us your answer there is no where to run in the world except maybe
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.640]  Russia from the globalist
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:48.640]  they basically run the whole world right now or trying to
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:52.640]  and they are gearing up for economic collapse through which they will bring in their new global
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:56.640]  cashless society they're trying to phase out cash everywhere to kill the barter
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.640]  economy they're trying to create federal squads 15 million
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.640]  dollar fines for garage sales i'm not joking that's fox
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:08.640]  news reporting that you know if they find any recalled item going back 20
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.640]  years we'll mean there's tens of thousands things have been recalled just all sorts of
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:16.640]  ways to scare everyone because they're predatory so
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.640]  the answer to their agenda 21 is to only buy local when you can
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.640]  and to support local businesses and to buy organic
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.640]  and to support alternative media it's real simple we have to
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:32.640]  absolutely put the establishment under siege
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.640]  because they're trying to put us under siege doesn't it come down to that Wayne
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.640]  oh absolutely it does and i think like i say
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.640]  i'm encouraged that what i see in here in the pacific north west
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.640]  i just hope this is going on all over the country that people are
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:52.640]  buying local businesses local organic farmers
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.640]  you know and i can't agree more buy local
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.640]  stay away and even even state banks and local banks
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:04.640]  you know leave the bank of america's oh the local banks are under attack
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.640]  the banking reform act was written to shut them down we've got to go be with local banks
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.640]  absolutely well said i mean this is a takeover folks
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:16.640]  these people don't want commerce they want controlled commerce billy
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.640]  your point on exiting the usa go ahead
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:24.640]  thanks for taking my call be quick my class just started i got a point of
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:28.640]  question so matt putting that out on the exit
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.640]  strategy it kind of to me it shows
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.640]  that he knows the trajectory of this civilization
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.640]  and he already has his own exit strategy but it's kind of a warning
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.640]  for the rest of us but to me there's almost nowhere you can run
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:48.640]  you completely exodus leave america get out of here
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:52.640]  go to chile go to switzerland wherever
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:56.640]  that means that you've kind of given up and they're just going to take full control
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.640]  of america and the rest of the globalist country
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:04.640]  said they control so that's just a point real quick but a question
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  for you and wane do you think that we have enough patriots
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.640]  to basically align everybody
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:16.640]  and take it back over because i think we do but i think the globalists are just really
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:20.640]  good at consolidating their power
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:24.640]  and actually turning that into a weapon do we have that i think we do
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.640]  but what does it look like question for you and wane real quick
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.640]  i mean i think so often
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.640]  you have to just double down even if it looks like things are pretty dark
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:40.640]  and then it's that standing and resisting
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.640]  is giving you the moral high ground i mean as bad as russia is on so many fronts
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:48.640]  our elite are so evil russia world wide looks like the good guys
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:52.640]  even in the words of people like pat bucannon and it's not that putin
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  is even that great it's that compared to these people he's a saint
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:00.640]  and so we have to be that example and i mean sure if they're trying to send a hit squad
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.640]  to kill you and wane was warned by three level three different high level people he left for a year
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:08.640]  and then when the threat was over he came back so you gotta know when to hold
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.640]  him no one to fold him no one to walk away no one to run
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:16.640]  wane madsen your answer to that i mean what do we do i mean can we beat him
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.640]  stay here and stay here and fight well i mean i'm encouraged by what i've seen
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.640]  i can use maybe this opportunity to get in a shameless plug but
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.640]  there's a director out here in the northwest eric stacey
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.640]  out of portland has just completed a film we're coming up
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:36.640]  in a few days on the one year anniversary of the horrible death of phil marshal
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:40.640]  9-11 the pilot united airlines
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.640]  67 and 57 pilot wrote two books on 9-11 was working on yet another
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.640]  was involved in iran contra with barry seal
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:52.640]  in just a few days one one year anniversary
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.640]  of his horrible death with those of his two children in murphy's california
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:00.640]  there's a docu novel coming out called unthinkable done by
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:04.640]  eric stacey who's got eight films under his belt and
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.640]  again here's a guy who has a long history in hollywood his dad
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.640]  was the assistant director to david o selznick on
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:16.640]  some movies people may have heard of gone with the wind and a star is born
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.640]  he's completed this docu novel
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.640]  or docu drama i should say you and i are in it because they've got one of
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.640]  our interviews in the movie it opens just a few
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.640]  blocks off broadway on april the 11th at the quad cinema in
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:36.640]  so anyone in that area i would really urge them to see this this shows
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.640]  that in a docu novel kind of way
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.640]  docu drama kind of way that marshal was taken out by a hit
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.640]  team because of what he was working on sure and and again it doesn't mean
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.640]  this one film will save the world or one book will save
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:56.640]  the world but all of us that have the means in one level the media or not
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:00.640]  to communicate they want to shut our speech down because it's effective
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.640]  so when they kill somebody or arrest the next to susan look if
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.640]  the republican had had somebody
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.640]  like michael moore arrested even if it looked like he might
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:16.640]  have been guilty but it was political i would stand with michael moore
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.640]  even though i did testing because folks if you don't stand for free speech
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.640]  for everybody everyone loses it it's elementary thank you very
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:28.640]  much caller great points william in new york you're on the air with
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.640]  wane madson go ahead yes uh how are you alex jones
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.640]  mr madson how are you good good go ahead i just wanted to
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.640]  make a quick point uh like a point of question like billy if you don't mind uh
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.640]  alex i'm a loyal supporter i respect you but
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:48.640]  i'm getting really irritated every time i hear of you speaking of leaving
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.640]  this country i mean talk of leaving this country you know in such a cynical
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:56.640]  fashion as our country vulcanizes um
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.640]  you know art and patriots will stay and like mr madson said
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.640]  stay in fight i just quoted you before i was saying
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.640]  what's the point of fighting if you don't fight all the way well listen i want to be clear
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  i've just had the larger discussion because i'm
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:16.640]  actually at the level of people they're going to purge they intend to
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.640]  and so i'm having a discussion with people so they can realize
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:24.640]  how serious this is and i said at the end of the discussion an hour
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:28.640]  ago or more than an hour ago that i intend to fight on to the end
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:32.640]  whatever the cost may be and basically paraphrased uh the church
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.640]  he'll speech but at the same time then i think is that the wrong
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:40.640]  strategy wouldn't be giving up on america it'd be like if i was french and the
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.640]  nazis took over and i ran to england for three years and then came back with the resistance
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.640]  it wouldn't mean you know run run run away live to fight another
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:52.640]  day i'm saying my gut tells me you're staying
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:56.640]  my cerebral cortex tells me you know run with the rebels
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.640]  you know and regroup to take on the death star later so
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.640]  that's what i'm saying sir and and so that's the larger discussion but i hear what you're saying
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.640]  not not not all people have enough
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.640]  money to flee and those are the people that are going to be the true patriots
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.640]  shedding blood for this country and that's what it's all about
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.640]  go ahead sir
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.640]  yeah we're saying that the true paid patriots are going to be the ones
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.640]  that don't have money to leave this country and those are the true patriots that are
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.640]  going to shed blood for this country that's what it's all about well listen
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:36.640]  i've been here and i wear a lot of hats and i go
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.640]  out in public without bodyguards and and the whole nine yards so i'm
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.640]  not afraid of killing people or being killed i just see
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:48.640]  all the angles they want to have a civil war
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:52.640]  if they can pull it off and blame us properly so i'm on the air trying to stop
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.640]  a civil war from starting while explaining if one begins
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  that they're the ones that are behind it and they're they're illegitimate
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.640]  so you gotta know in war it's always been mainly information or what they call propaganda
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:08.640]  so i'm in a truthful war against the propagandist
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.640]  to point out who they really are we're the most important component in this fight
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.640]  if they start trying to purge everybody it's on my big
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  thing is the average military and cops are just compartmentalized fools
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.640]  it's not going to hurt the new world order to kill them even though people are going to be forced to
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:28.640]  i just hope everybody knows who's behind it because that's who's going to be
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:32.640]  in europe sitting out of the fight while we kill each other like a bunch of morons
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.640]  i hear you and i appreciate your call wane madson in closing what do you say to that
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.640]  and the attempts to demonize the proto tea party the liberty movement the pentagon training
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  for it the governor of new york saying if you're a gun owner
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:48.640]  you know basically a christian get out of my state i mean they do want to come
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  after the real tea party they do want to have a civil war they say
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:56.640]  their main enemy is the returning veterans that why do they see the libertarians
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.640]  as the only enemy because it's divide and conquer they want to
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:04.640]  it's us versus them and them are the people of this country
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:08.640]  i've been involved out here in seattle and helping to feed homeless people you talk
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:12.640]  about a group that's organized these people survive on the street and you know their biggest
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:16.640]  threat well they always have a threat from the cold weather
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.640]  the rain but the biggest threat is from department of homeland
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.640]  security the thugs that come around and rouse them out of where they're sleeping
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:28.640]  trying to get a few hours saw that in the news they now have federal police in almost every major
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:32.640]  city and all they have to do is be mean to homeless people the department of
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.640]  home homeless security i guess is what it is now why why do people
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:40.640]  put up with this kind of thing the people who are the most defenseless being harassed
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:44.640]  by these these thugs who actually look at these people who
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.640]  they could easily be those people themselves these people
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.640]  got injured on a job in some cases i couldn't get workman's comp
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:56.640]  they exhausted their unemployment they had no other choice and a lot of times they're
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.640]  somewhat whacked out if i spent a week on the streets i'd be whacked out
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:04.640]  yeah most of the money to counter were not they were not drunk
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.640]  that maybe 15% you could say we're on drugs
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.640]  or drinking but most of them are no no most of my founder guys
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:16.640]  that their wife divorced them they went bankrupt because of child support and and now
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.640]  they've got bad credit and can't get an apartment and they're just totally freaked out and broken
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:24.640]  i talk to homeless people all the time and most of them now are broken
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  men but these are the people and veterans how to survive and
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.640]  i'll say i wouldn't i would want those homeless people on my side if
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.640]  it ever comes to where we have to challenge these authoritarian powers
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:40.640]  they've been out there they know how to survive they know what they're doing

[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.640]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.640]  are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase

[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:30.640]  I see Gunther from California once talking about nuclear fallout
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.640]  Fukushima radiation and we'll be taking your calls for the
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:38.640]  sour ends and we've got the guy
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:42.640]  on to talk about that he's been tracking it for years
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:46.640]  and I appreciate him coming on Jerry Peterman
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:50.640]  FukushimaUpdateReport.com and began his professional engineering career
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:54.640]  and TV radio in the 1960s and he left television and radio to begin a 14 year
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:58.640]  career in nuclear physics and he invented
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.640]  the first micro computer micro lead one
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:06.640]  changed the standards for lead in paint detection lead in paint
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:10.640]  detection the prevention of childhood lead poisoning he worked the craft and lead
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:14.640]  the paint health standards legislation the owner of his own nuclear
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.640]  laboratory Warrington labs located four miles north
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.640]  of I'm not going to go over the entire entire stuff that he's done
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:26.640]  he served 14 years as state Texas license radiation safety
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.640]  officer health security officer I'm not going to go over it all but he comes on
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:34.640]  with us today to this is a short
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:38.640]  segment long segment coming up to break down really how bad
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:42.640]  Fukushima is with all the wreckage now arriving on the west coast
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:46.640]  where he thinks it's all going the other leaking reactors all over the world it's like
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.640]  the government doesn't care anymore they just there's no standards I mean here's an example
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.640]  of this and we're going to him I've got two articles here
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:58.640]  Obama's ambassador to Norway knows nothing about Norway and then
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:02.640]  brags about how he knows nothing about Norway and there's a video of this
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:06.640]  nominee to be next ambassador to China quote I'm no real expert on China
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:10.640]  I mean you're supposed to hire people that have lived their whole lives
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:14.640]  living there studying it I mean this and that's what the British
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.640]  defense experts said last week he said these people basically know
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:22.640]  nothing up there they just know gangster stuff
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:26.640]  and that's what I'm saying they're in control but they do not know what they're doing
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:30.640]  and I think that's part of the problem with this elite
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:34.640]  is that just like Rome and other civilizations that became corrupt
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.640]  in 410 as the Germans in the vandals
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.640]  were approaching when they finally destroyed Rome forever they said
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:46.640]  you know the barbarians have run over our military they're 40 miles away and they said
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.640]  bring in more slave girls throw more people to the lions and they said
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:54.640]  they're going to kill everybody you've got to organize some emergency
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:58.640]  to defend the city they just couldn't do it they were too busy throwing their
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.640]  political enemies to lions and I'm telling you folks that's where we are
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.640]  three minutes till break I want to go to our guests Jerry Peterman Jerry what is the state
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.640]  of somebody who's watched it like nobody else of Fukushima what are we really
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.640]  facing denial denial denial
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.640]  let's spend more money on the Olympics than taking care of wrong people
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.640]  let's have absolutely no sense of humanity
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:26.640]  we don't care about our own kids even our own government
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.640]  change the regular the radiation level acceptability
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.640]  when it started showing up on the shores a few weeks
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:38.640]  after it happened I come back to what was
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.640]  said during the McCarthy era when they asked
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.640]  Senator McCarthy have you no shame these people have none
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:50.640]  how bad's the radiation
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.640]  I know you track all the radiation detectors in the nation that are hooked into the internet
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.640]  it's bad it's going to cause
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.640]  some deaths in the United States over a long period of time
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.640]  we have a situation where
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.640]  three out of the four for certain three out of the four
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:14.640]  have experienced the China syndrome kind of
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.640]  thing where the cores have melted down through the base
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:22.640]  concrete in the buildings
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:26.640]  the explosions were so great that some of the core material
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:30.640]  was thrown as much as two kilometers away
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.640]  that material has gotten in the ocean that material has been
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:38.640]  plowed under by bulldozers as so willy nilly kind of
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:42.640]  by effort out in the Fukushima
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:46.640]  area seem to be without this
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:50.640]  without regard to the humanity of the Japanese people
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:54.640]  and they go further by passing laws saying they can't even talk about it
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.640]  but we're going to have the Olympics
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.640]  two weeks ago they passed a martial law edict where you can't talk about the radiation levels
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.640]  in Japan and of course it's the mafia openly running Japan
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:10.640]  it's the same deal it's mafia government and these mafia people
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.640]  whether they be in the US or Japan they just think they're baloney
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:18.640]  Trump's reality
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:22.640]  I found here lately I was on another program with Ernie Gunterson
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:26.640]  and now in the last two weeks everybody
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:30.640]  is attacking Gunterson they're saying oh he has no credentials
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:34.640]  oh you gotta do this gonna do that and it began to be scared
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:38.640]  because people don't buy their baloney anymore
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:42.640]  and I'm suspecting that some of these really really outlandish claims
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:46.640]  of we're gonna fry eggs on the beach because the radiation
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.640]  are actually misinformation
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:54.640]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:32.640]  you can give us your breakdown on somebody who I know every day follows what's happening
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:36.640]  with Fukushima and other issues on the danger level
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:40.640]  and the late nuclear physicist Dr. Bob Bowman who died last year
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:44.640]  good friend of mine former head of the Star Wars program that's basically what he said he said it's like Chernobyl
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.640]  he'll just see an increase in cancers across the board unattributable to that
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:52.640]  and he said millions will probably end up dying
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.640]  of cancers down the road but we'll never know
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:00.640]  and the northern hemisphere gets more radioactive my bigger issue is that
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:04.640]  they just don't seem to care now and there's more and more of these disasters happening but
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:08.640]  you were getting into there are groups out there that put out
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.640]  sensational stuff that isn't really true that the
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.640]  media can then focus in on but then you get like 14 times
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:20.640]  what it's supposed to be in San Francisco and the media says well that's true but
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:24.640]  it's not a big deal and as you said the EPA
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:28.640]  raises the levels of what they say is safe so that's my big
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:32.640]  issue and I want to break down Fukushima with you but go ahead and make your point
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:36.640]  the break ran into the satellite you're cutting in and it was
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:40.640]  saying something like you think it might be disinfo on purpose saying
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:44.640]  people can fry eggs on the beach I think that there's just
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:48.640]  too much of the garbage and the silliness about
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:52.640]  we're all going to fry next week and then when somebody actually comes
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:56.640]  out and does an expose on this like for example your
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.640]  team goes out there and finds active levels of material on the
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:04.640]  beach then you're chunked into the
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:08.640]  category of the same lens that put out
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:12.640]  bogus garbage and I can't help but wonder
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:16.640]  if bogus garbage was put out there so that your good work
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.640]  would be a laugh that or whatever or not taken
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.640]  seriously. Now I could ask the questions
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.640]  here but I want to give you the floor to talk about your research and where you
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:32.640]  think we really are. I think we are
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:36.640]  given right now golden opportunity to see the future.
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.640]  I think Fukushima is a
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:44.640]  an example of what could happen many times over
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:48.640]  even in our own country maybe not from a tsunami but
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.640]  we have a large number of those plants that were manufactured
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.640]  they're identical the reactors are identical to the ones
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:00.640]  that were installed at Fukushima and I think by
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.640]  understanding that if we had a coronal mass
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:08.640]  ejection or something like that we'd have huge numbers
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.640]  of reactors that would begin to operate exactly like Fukushima.
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:16.640]  The only difference is in most cases in this country we have
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:20.640]  a whole lot more control rods, spit rods at each
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.640]  site than Fukushima has. That's hard to believe but that's
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:28.640]  fact and so it gets kind of scary. We also have
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:32.640]  at least six that I know of that may be as high as 20
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:36.640]  that are on thought lines in this country. Fukushima is a lesson
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.640]  and I'm afraid everybody's playing at recess and they're not listening
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.640]  to the lesson. We have a situation in Japan
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:48.640]  that the wind will change and the material
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:52.640]  will drift over the rest of the whole island
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.640]  and you can go to Tokyo and get
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:00.640]  high readings but the government is saying oh no everything's fine
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:04.640]  hey I'm going to eat some of this seafood you know
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:08.640]  Prime Minister Abe's going out and eating seafood. I'll bet he is.
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:12.640]  Amazing you've had so many of the
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.640]  TEPCO people that were there now die and you've got cover-ups going on
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:20.640]  I agree with you though for me
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:24.640]  Fukushima is a golden opportunity to try to educate myself and others
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:28.640]  but it's also an education how governments and corporations
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.640]  again are delusional now. Absolutely we're looking at
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:36.640]  a corporation that has no clue about to do anything as
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:40.640]  Gunderson said I think it was on Joyce Raleigh's show said something about
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.640]  these people are operators they're not engineers they haven't got a clue
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:48.640]  they know how to operate a system once it's designed to put in
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:52.640]  but beyond that they're only operators and now
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  we don't have enough people to operate the facilities so what do they do
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.640]  they go find homeless people on the streets of the major cities
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:04.640]  and they're considered disposable people
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:08.640]  they give them a nice hot meal a fancy white suit
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.640]  and tell them they're going to do something really important for their country
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.640]  well what Japanese person in that society wouldn't be
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.640]  honored to do something for their country they don't even understand
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:24.640]  that they're going to die. So the government
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:28.640]  that's dishonorable uses the honor of its good people
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.640]  against the people. Yes of course they do
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.640]  that's why nobody well I won't say nobody but there's very few people
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:40.640]  marching in the streets demanding why is my little
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:44.640]  daughter my son now have some kind of lesions on the
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:48.640]  thyroid you've got a huge number of children in the whole
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:52.640]  country that are showing signs of thyroid
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.640]  future thyroid cancer at least
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:00.640]  in the Chernobyl situation
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.640]  Poland for example went out and immediately handed out the
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.640]  iodine and virtually no person ever came down with thyroid cancer.
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.640]  I had the navy lieutenant on yesterday and they filed as soon as you know against TEPCO
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.640]  with his lawyer who's in a wheelchair and on a catheter now
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.640]  a whole bunch of people it's happening to well you heard it good
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.640]  they didn't even give the people except the pilots that were flying over
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:28.640]  or if you were on the deck they didn't give them iodine even though
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.640]  they had it on the Ronald Reagan. That's correct
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:36.640]  absolutely again the attitude of
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.640]  they're disposable people I believe you made the comment well why wouldn't they somebody
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.640]  said why don't they use monkeys people cost less
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:48.640]  that was on your program yes that's something my dad was told by a research scientist
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:52.640]  exactly and that's the attitude TEPCO
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.640]  just lost their chairman because he floated a trial balloon
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.640]  to try to raise a lot more money for this project
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.640]  by taxing or raising the rates on the
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.640]  the ratepayers so that their
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:12.640]  profits would remain high and finally it got out
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:16.640]  they had to resign so they had to replace that particular chairman
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:20.640]  that happened two half three weeks ago
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.640]  well you've been studying reactors for decades as an engineer and a license
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.640]  radiation safety officer and health officer what would you do
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.640]  to clean up the nuclear industry what's your view on nuclear power
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:36.640]  a long time ago I was like you I thought it was a good idea
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:40.640]  I could see how it could be safely operated
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:44.640]  we used to talk about putting the material in
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:48.640]  the containment and yucca flaps and burying it
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:52.640]  but the defense department decided to buy all the old rods
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.640]  and turn them into weapons and to
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:00.640]  depleted uranium weapons so how we've dumped 40,000 tons
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:04.640]  of that material on the Middle East and
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:08.640]  that's that the nuclear power industry is the most dangerous
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.640]  thing we've ever done in the history of the world because if you had
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:16.640]  one or let me let me ask you this do you remember that
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:20.640]  idiotic program on public television that said after man
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:24.640]  and there were deer running around yes it's going to be so great
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.640]  well here's the scenario if you have a coronal mass
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:32.640]  ejection like the Carrington event in 1858-59
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:36.640]  where all the electronics fry
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:40.640]  on this planet the first thing you'd have is all of the
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:44.640]  buildings which now have wire in them catch on fire
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:48.640]  so you're standing around choking to death in the dark
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.640]  six weeks later all of the 711
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:56.640]  nuclear power plants that we have would go critical
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.640]  so we're one Carrington event for a mass
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.640]  extinction of every living thing on this planet and I think Einstein
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:08.640]  said well he said it's a hell of a way to boil water
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:12.640]  and Einstein says what do you mean by that and I said okay
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.640]  I'm going to boil water in a bucket out in the backyard in a year you can
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.640]  find the ashes in ten years you can in a hundred years you can
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:24.640]  in a thousand in ten thousand but if I boil
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:28.640]  equivalent amount of water with the uranium material
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.640]  that they're using now four and a half billion years
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.640]  now I can find the ways of when I boiled water for a single
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:40.640]  day now somebody is nuts
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:44.640]  that's right the more you study the nuclear power industry
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.640]  the more you realize they are a menace
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:52.640]  and again they had DU back in the 50s they wouldn't allow
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:56.640]  to be used until 1990 there's a fundamental insanity
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:00.640]  by the people running the social engineering and the decision
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:04.640]  process I think Alex we have people now
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:08.640]  who I genuinely believe like you're talking about the
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:12.640]  people say they sold their soul I think we're dealing with leaders
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.640]  who have no soul we're dealing with people corporations have
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:20.640]  no soul I mean it's supposed to be under the law
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.640]  that's a person well that's a soulless person so if you're working
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:28.640]  for a corporation like TEPCO it has no soul and the people
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:32.640]  are there to maintain the corporation so they're working for a soulless
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:36.640]  entity and there isn't any conscience in a
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:40.640]  corporation unless they're good people well we found out there are very few
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:44.640]  good people there they're willing to use the poor and the
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.640]  uneducated and they're willing to sacrifice their own children
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:52.640]  and next generation and possibly a lot more people if they come over there
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.640]  for the Olympics who are these people what are the
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:00.640]  facts that they have to do that I think it's about the fact that they don't have
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:04.640]  the right and they are vandalizing the planet the species the genetic
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.640]  genome of the entire biosphere they come to kill, steal and destroy
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.640]  I've only read in history in all cultures about one entity
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:16.640]  whether it be fiction or real who behaves like this and he has a name
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:20.640]  it's Lucifer Satan the devil I mean that's really what I think it comes down to
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:24.640]  absolutely let me tell you what these people
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:28.640]  this is the thing that I just have to the laugh and irony these
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.640]  people say well it's not so bad they're just a little bit in the water
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:36.640]  blah blah blah yes but it's a gift that keeps on giving for a minimum
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:40.640]  of another four to six generations there's no control of this
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.640]  thing now let's assume for just a moment I'm Harry Potter and I
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:48.640]  can make all the radiation go away in the whole world even Fukushima
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:52.640]  I'm sorry but we still have something that will last
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:56.640]  forever and that is the genetic
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:00.640]  damage of mutations that will be transmitted from now on
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.640]  in every species in the ocean that has just a little bit or a lot
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:08.640]  they're tiny mutations we eat that stuff they're tiny
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:12.640]  mutations in us it's going to permeate the planet that
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:16.640]  those little mutations even if no more radiation were present
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.640]  that damages the ecosystem genome of the
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:24.640]  entire planet so a little it's just as deadly as a lot
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:28.640]  and by the way you're also an author we can talk about that but
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:32.640]  going back here looking at this when you
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:36.640]  talked about these events that happened over a hundred years ago
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:40.640]  when they had a mass coronal ejection from the sun that caused telegraph wires
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:44.640]  all over the country to catch on fire and burn down houses and in Europe
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:48.640]  and of course now there's conservatively thousands of times
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.640]  I don't know the number of wiring nobody knows it everywhere and
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.640]  the Congress has done studies as you know admitting that
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:46:00.640]  they need to harden the power plants and everything and admitting all of the nuclear power
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:04.640]  plants within six weeks if we have one of these will blow up
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:08.640]  and then that's an end to this wonderful world without man
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:12.640]  because that is going to irreplicably kill almost everything on the surface of the planet
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:16.640]  I mean this is madness and they did all the studies before they approved nuclear power
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:20.640]  in the 40s and 50s they know all this and again
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:24.640]  again they just don't even
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:28.640]  care it's crazy land they don't care
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.640]  Alex you know even if we didn't have the nuclear power
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.640]  we would all end up dying in the dark because we wired
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.640]  every building on this planet virtually that is anything above
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.640]  a Hubble with wire and if we get a Carrington event
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:48.640]  all that wire melts catches those buildings on fire and if
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:52.640]  you get hundreds of millions of buildings on this planet on fire
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:56.640]  and there is no way to operate any vehicle
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.640]  snow water nothing nothing pumps
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:04.640]  the amount of toxins in the atmosphere make
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:08.640]  Krakatoa and those kind of events look like a birthday
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:12.640]  party you're talking about a new ice age it'll put all the smoke in the air
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:16.640]  cool the earth down and then we will all freeze in a planetary wide
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:20.640]  ice age yes and that would happen nowadays
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:24.640]  if the same Carrington event happened we would end up with a forest
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:28.640]  ice age by the way that's 100% MIT
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:32.640]  Stanford research told congress a decade ago last year
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.640]  all the scientists are worried about this they're not hardening anything folks if you don't know
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:40.640]  what we're talking about it's a nature made
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:44.640]  mass EMP to put it in layman's terms
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:48.640]  tell folks what a Carrington event is
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:52.640]  in 1958 and 1959 there were very few wires strung across the world
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:56.640]  and basically the only wires that existed at that time were
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.640]  telegraph systems a Carrington event is a large
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.640]  ejection of charged particles from the sun
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.640]  a huge belt if you will greater than any solar flare
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:12.640]  you've ever even thought of seeing now the solar flare doesn't
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.640]  reach the earth it's not a thing it'll burn the earth but those charged particles
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:20.640]  leave the sun at over a million miles an hour and
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:24.640]  you're looking at 93 minutes later the earth is hit
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.640]  with massive amounts of charged particles those particles
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:32.640]  then are have a magnetic effect
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:36.640]  on any kind of metal and the longer the metal the quicker
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:40.640]  and the faster it is that it will absorb the energy
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:44.640]  it actually burned people's faces who were wearing
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:48.640]  glasses in certain parts of the world where they had the
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:52.640]  wire rimmed glasses and they became hot
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.640]  and it didn't melt on their face because it wasn't long the wires
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:00.640]  weren't long enough but when you have a web inside your
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:04.640]  home those wires are long enough and there's no hardening
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.640]  you can you go through and pretend that you
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.640]  can harden a nuclear power plant or you can harden the grid or whatever
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:16.640]  no as long as the wire is exposed to the sun
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:20.640]  there's no hardening to it we have built something out on
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:24.640]  the edge of a limb near a variable star
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.640]  we paid no attention we didn't learn the lesson
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.640]  we are built we built a time bomb
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:36.640]  a huge bomb with a big fuse right up by a big campfire
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:40.640]  we did and then we went out and got
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:44.640]  an entire half a million
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:48.640]  trailer truck loads of TNT and pulled it up to the fire
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.640]  first we built the bomb
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.640]  with wiring all of our homes and then we went out and
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:00.640]  built all the nuclear power plants that can't afford
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:04.640]  to be cooled it's insanity
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:08.640]  it's insanity for people I think it was just
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.640]  greed well I don't care about the next generation as I said
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:16.640]  the corporation has sold its entity

[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:19.560]  That's exactly right. Hey, you realize Al Gore's energy rod is the magic wand that only can defeat Harry Potter
[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:25.420]  I mean these people are such con artists scum man, I'm sorry go ahead
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:32.640]  Hey, Alex man, I'm never leaving and I hope you ever do either and I just
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:39.200]  Wanted to get to a couple of symbolic points here on the day of the State of the Union by our dear leader
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:42.440]  Might as well be called our dear leader aka
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:48.800]  Barack Hussein Obama. Yeah, what time is the gracious man who makes the sun shine and saves us from global warming?
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:52.120]  What time is our Lord and Savior on according to Jamie Foxx? I
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:57.440]  Think it's pretty late. I think 9 30 Eastern time
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:02.720]  I believe because you know, you got to get to all those trendy Western. I'd be sober in California
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.920]  Yeah, no, I think our fur is on at 8 central. Oh
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:11.680]  Okay, I gotta check the internet on that but hey, well listen
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:15.400]  I want to say on the nightly news tonight. We'll have something live and something special
[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:18.040]  It'll either be me or David Knight doing it
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:24.240]  But we'll have the news that airs at 7 and then I can come on live after and rant about some issues
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:29.040]  And then as soon as he comes on I'd like to simulcast it and talk over him the whole time
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:35.320]  So there's an accurate version out there. This is too painful to watch twice and do it the next day on air
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.960]  But I was telling them about this yesterday, but we'll see what happens. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:43.960]  You want to commit more sacrilege?
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:49.200]  just a couple of historical symbols I wanted to point out and
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:54.680]  In the Congress hall where our dear leader will be speaking tonight
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:00.580]  There is too fast shy on both sides of the American flag and I didn't know this until recently that
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:03.320]  swastikas appeared on
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:07.880]  Russian paper money as early as 1917. I'd like to get your take on that
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:14.080]  Swastika is a good luck charm and you got the old ranches all over Texas and they'll you'll find an old barn with swastika
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:18.120]  It's an Indian symbol. It's a Native American symbol. It's a very powerful Sun symbol
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:21.800]  and unfortunately, it's a ruined symbol now because the Nazis but
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:28.520]  They're always helping you know, Kimples in India to pull down 2,000 year old swastikas. It's a Sun symbol. It's a pinwheel
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:30.880]  It's one of the oldest North symbols
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:35.120]  I mean they found swastikas that are 7,000 years old
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.640]  So that's what's going on with that. But people are so ignorant. They're saying take them down. There's just no end to it
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:42.640]  Paul in New Jersey. Thanks for holding go ahead
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:49.040]  Hey, yeah, we we've been taking over since the Civil War. We went to the martial law then they passed the Federal Reserve
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:55.720]  We under communism since then and they really locked it in in 1933 after the bankruptcy
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:00.200]  That's right. War Powers Act, but now they're really trying to conquer the spirit itself. Oh
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:03.280]  Absolutely, right? Hey
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:09.520]  It's evil like you said before it's Satan, Lucifer, whatever name you want to call this evil taken over
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:14.840]  They want to kill God's creation on this earth. That's it brother. Well said I
