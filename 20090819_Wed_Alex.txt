[00:00.000 --> 00:19.400]  Well, he is a very, very busy man, very honored to have him for the next 15 minutes or so.
[00:19.400 --> 00:26.200]  Dr. Alan Keyes, he's also an ambassador, United States Department of State.
[00:26.200 --> 00:33.600]  Ronald Reagan appoints Keyes to the United Nations, a full ambassador, and he served on the staff of the National Security Council,
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.200]  sought the Republican nomination for President in 96 and 2000, ran against Barack Obama for Illinois,
[00:39.200 --> 00:47.200]  State Senate 2004, would have been a lot better than Mr. Obama, and he warned people that Obama was going to be a radical.
[00:47.200 --> 00:54.600]  And I really respect Mr. Keyes, but I remember hearing this a year and a half ago going, oh, come on, you know, maybe he'll be bad like Clinton.
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.900]  Who knew he could be even worse? And so he's with us for the next hour.
[00:57.900 --> 01:07.400]  We're going to get into the government health care, the cap and trade, the abortion, expanding funding for abortion in Asia and Africa.
[01:07.400 --> 01:17.800]  Just his eco science written by the mad scientist Holdren, his science are, which if anybody's a Nazi, it's him.
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.100]  And then these attacks on free speech saying, you can't say socialist now, it's racist.
[01:22.100 --> 01:27.200]  That's invoking the race card, in my humble opinion, and so many issues today.
[01:27.200 --> 01:30.300]  Ambassador Keyes, it's really great to have you here, sir.
[01:30.300 --> 01:32.400]  I'm glad to be with you. Thank you.
[01:32.400 --> 01:34.500]  We're going to break in a few minutes and come back to the full audience.
[01:34.500 --> 01:39.700]  But what is most important on your mind right now that we'll come back and cover that first?
[01:39.700 --> 01:46.000]  Well, I think there are a couple of things, but the most important thing is the assault on the Constitution, which I think right now is a
[01:46.000 --> 01:57.400]  epitomized in the health care proposal, which are really thinking to transform our whole way of life and move us from pre government to totalitarian government.
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.600]  Well, I hardly agree with you.
[01:59.600 --> 02:06.900]  We're starting to see the establishment go from saying all the anger was staged, which obviously it isn't over 90%.
[02:06.900 --> 02:08.000]  Well, they're angry.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.300]  And most of them Democrats in many cases to now they're apologizing saying, OK, you're not thugs.
[02:13.300 --> 02:14.200]  You're not Nazis.
[02:14.200 --> 02:15.600]  You're not astroturf.
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.200]  Is that too little too late, though?
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.100]  Of course it is.
[02:19.100 --> 02:21.500]  I think we've seen who these people really are.
[02:21.500 --> 02:29.900]  Their initial reaction was the reaction of offended rulers who are looking at you saying, how dare you question us?
[02:29.900 --> 02:37.400]  And they have begun to realize that the American people aren't yet at a stage where they're going to act like the peasants and serfs of old.
[02:37.400 --> 02:45.100]  We are used to being a free people and we're going to stand up and act like it, whether they like it or not.
[02:45.100 --> 02:47.400]  Absolutely.
[02:47.400 --> 02:49.600]  The anger is just going across the board.
[02:49.600 --> 02:53.600]  He lost two more approval points this week or those three.
[02:53.600 --> 02:54.500]  Excuse me.
[02:54.500 --> 03:01.800]  He has the lowest approval of any president up to this date of seven months into their administration.
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.600]  What what is he going to do to try to save his presidency?
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.000]  Do you think?
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.200]  Well, I think that depends.
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.000]  I think he came forward because of a deep ideological commitment.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.800]  And this is what I try to explain to people for the longest time.
[03:14.800 --> 03:23.200]  This man is deeply committed to Marxist Leninism, to the Communist Marxist socialist understanding of the world.
[03:23.200 --> 03:30.700]  He did in school, in associations, in background, in both in the Illinois State Senate, in his own activities.
[03:30.700 --> 03:32.900]  This has been the focus of his life.
[03:32.900 --> 03:38.600]  And so he is pursuing that agenda and surrounding himself with people committed to it.
[03:38.600 --> 03:42.500]  And whatever else is going on, they're not really going to drop it.
[03:42.500 --> 03:46.800]  They may have to stop for a while, but they'll probe with bayonet.
[03:46.800 --> 03:47.800]  They've met resistance.
[03:47.800 --> 03:52.800]  They'll back off, but they'll keep probing just as Lenin told them.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.100]  That does seem to be the tactic.
[03:54.100 --> 03:58.200]  They'll constrict, we'll fight back and push him back a little bit.
[03:58.200 --> 04:00.500]  But it's the two steps forward, one step back.
[04:00.500 --> 04:06.900]  They are still going to continue to squeeze in your educated opinion, working internationally at the highest levels of the White House.
[04:06.900 --> 04:10.300]  When we come back over this break, how do we stop them then?
[04:10.300 --> 04:14.900]  How do we stop this incremental? Because we can get all fired up and say no.
[04:14.900 --> 04:17.400]  But then they always just come pushing back.
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.200]  I guess we've got to get on the offensive and then we never back off.
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.500]  I mean, I guess if we're not on the offensive, we're on the defensive.
[04:24.500 --> 04:25.100]  That's right.
[04:25.100 --> 04:27.800]  And I think it's important to do a simple thing.
[04:27.800 --> 04:29.500]  We're not opposed to their proposals.
[04:29.500 --> 04:33.400]  We're opposed to them.
[04:33.400 --> 04:34.800]  Well, they've proven they're liars.
[04:34.800 --> 04:36.300]  I mean, you can't believe a word they say.
[04:36.300 --> 04:40.300]  So it's kind of like you have a neighbor you've caught lying to over and over again.
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.400]  You just stop associating with them or even some...
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.500]  Well, you certainly stop trusting them.
[04:45.500 --> 04:49.300]  And I think we can trust them to continue the march to socialism.
[04:49.300 --> 04:54.100]  If we don't want it, then we have to look at another direction for leadership.
[04:54.100 --> 04:56.800]  Ambassador Keys is our guest out.
[04:56.800 --> 05:02.100]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[05:02.100 --> 05:06.600]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[05:06.600 --> 05:08.900]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs.
[05:08.900 --> 05:10.500]  You don't have to cooperate.
[05:10.500 --> 05:11.800]  There is a solution.
[05:11.800 --> 05:14.900]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[05:14.900 --> 05:20.200]  have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[05:31.200 --> 05:33.600]  From our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[05:33.600 --> 05:36.500]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee,
[05:36.500 --> 05:39.600]  infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[06:00.400 --> 06:02.200]  A New World Order.
[06:02.200 --> 06:07.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.800]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[06:09.800 --> 06:12.600]  What their objective being world domination?
[06:12.600 --> 06:15.700]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[06:15.700 --> 06:18.700]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[06:18.700 --> 06:23.500]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[06:23.500 --> 06:31.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[06:31.600 --> 06:35.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[06:35.400 --> 06:38.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.200]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[06:42.200 --> 06:43.300]  Yes, they're after music.
[06:43.300 --> 06:48.100]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com

[06:56.800 --> 06:59.800]  You worry. If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[06:59.800 --> 07:03.200]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[07:03.200 --> 07:07.700]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[07:07.700 --> 07:10.200]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.500]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[07:13.500 --> 07:15.500]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[07:15.500 --> 07:18.300]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[07:18.300 --> 07:22.000]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.400]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.500]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[07:30.500 --> 07:36.800]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[07:36.800 --> 07:41.300]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[07:41.300 --> 07:45.900]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[07:45.900 --> 07:48.600]  Start now. Knowledge is power.
[07:48.600 --> 07:50.700]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[07:58.400 --> 08:01.100]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[08:01.100 --> 08:04.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:08.700 --> 08:15.800]  Well, he's a best-selling author, researcher, former ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan.
[08:15.800 --> 08:18.100]  He needs no introduction.
[08:18.100 --> 08:22.300]  One of his websites is loyaltoliberty.blogspot.com.
[08:22.300 --> 08:28.500]  Got that up on screen as we sound will cast the radio show on the web, slash, as a TV show.
[08:28.500 --> 08:31.400]  He also writes for Whirlwind Daily and other big publications.
[08:31.400 --> 08:34.900]  Unhealthy for Liberty is one of his latest pieces.
[08:34.900 --> 08:39.600]  He also has another great piece, Socialist Right and Left, same difference.
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.900]  And so we'll go over some of that with him today, a great political mind.
[08:43.900 --> 08:46.200]  And again, we're honored to have him joining us.
[08:46.200 --> 08:48.500]  Some stations just joined us.
[08:48.500 --> 08:50.700]  So I want to recap.
[08:50.700 --> 08:57.800]  We see the town halls, the people, Republican, Democrat, old, young, black, white coming out and saying,
[08:57.800 --> 09:00.300]  we don't want this and they have copies of the bill.
[09:00.300 --> 09:01.800]  They have the subsections.
[09:01.800 --> 09:06.300]  The Democrats for three weeks tried to lie and even some Republicans did and say,
[09:06.300 --> 09:07.200]  that's not in there.
[09:07.200 --> 09:07.900]  This isn't in there.
[09:07.900 --> 09:13.600]  Now they're having to admit all the things we said were in there that were in there and apologizing.
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.500]  How do we ensure that this resistance continues?
[09:18.500 --> 09:23.000]  Because as you just said, they're going to continue to come back probing.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.100]  They put the pressure on.
[09:24.100 --> 09:26.800]  We resist they back off.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.500]  I mean, give us your battle plan of how to not just hold them off,
[09:31.500 --> 09:36.800]  but actually regain some ground because you know, Ambassador, we've lost so much liberty.
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.200]  Well, I think that we have to be clear about what it is we're opposing.
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.600]  Because I think that the president's overwhelming response to this health care program
[09:45.600 --> 09:52.600]  reminds me a little of what happened on the immigration bills when they were trying to destroy our sovereignty.
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.900]  You're not just looking at an opposition to specific proposals and elements.
[09:57.900 --> 10:01.800]  I think what happened is some of these things, particularly for instance,
[10:01.800 --> 10:06.200]  the provisions that seem targeted at rationing care for the elderly,
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.500]  yet setting up a system that would pressure people into accepting death and giving up therapy,
[10:11.500 --> 10:17.000]  side by side with provisions that might expand funding for illegal immigrants,
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.800]  which would therefore be being paid at the expense of our loved ones being encouraged to die.
[10:23.800 --> 10:28.400]  These things were rejected because they fundamentally offend the conscience.
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.200]  They seem contrary to the American way of life and the understanding we have of the intrinsic worth of human beings.
[10:35.200 --> 10:39.600]  With that in mind, you look at the whole picture, there are the invasive elements
[10:39.600 --> 10:46.700]  that would take control, first of all, of the health sector, of the terms of remuneration of doctors and things of this kind.
[10:46.700 --> 10:50.600]  So they claim that it's not aimed at phasing out the private sector.
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.400]  Two things are true.
[10:52.400 --> 11:00.100]  Barack Obama himself, in his early career, explicitly said he was for universal single payer, right?
[11:00.100 --> 11:06.100]  And then it comes out a proposal that has elements in it that, yes, over the course of a little time,
[11:06.100 --> 11:08.600]  are going to push the system in that direction.
[11:08.600 --> 11:12.800]  And these elements are backed by the big corporate guys
[11:12.800 --> 11:16.800]  who are trying to get out from under the health care cost so they can have bigger profits.
[11:16.800 --> 11:20.000]  Are we all supposed to be stupid that we don't realize what's happening?
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.200]  Of course not, people do realize it.
[11:22.200 --> 11:27.800]  And then you look at what's going on overseas with Canada and Great Britain, these other examples.
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.800]  And it turns out that there is rationing, there is pressure for the old people, there are long lines,
[11:32.800 --> 11:37.800]  there is poor access, there is lower quality in terms of medical personnel and so forth.
[11:37.800 --> 11:44.300]  And so the notion that everybody's going to have access is counterveiled by the fact that they'll have access
[11:44.300 --> 11:50.700]  to a worse system in which they'll get worse service, in which they will no longer have the sense
[11:50.700 --> 11:57.600]  that a whole bunch of people have in America that when something goes wrong with you, it's dealt with expeditiously, right?
[11:57.600 --> 11:59.000]  That won't even be there.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.500]  And so I think people are looking at this saying, wait a minute, this is not America.
[12:02.500 --> 12:09.400]  This is not how we live and we have been relying on a system that, yes, has its shortcoming.
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.100]  You know, they say that we're supposed to let government take over 100% of our lives
[12:14.100 --> 12:21.600]  because we want to care for the 10% of people who they say don't have access to some kind of health insurance right now.
[12:21.600 --> 12:23.300]  That doesn't make sense.
[12:23.300 --> 12:26.400]  So I think a lot of people have begun to suspect the truth.
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.700]  The aim of this is to improve health care.
[12:28.700 --> 12:37.200]  The aim of it is to give that power to government over life and death and the masses and privacy and personal decisions
[12:37.200 --> 12:44.500]  so that we'll be in a position where we must hang on the decisions and words and power of the people in power
[12:44.500 --> 12:49.900]  which gives them great control so that they can remain in power at our expense.
[12:49.900 --> 12:53.000]  That is what totalitarian government is all about.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.100]  That's what socialist takeovers are about.
[12:55.100 --> 12:58.700]  They use issues in order to achieve power.
[12:58.700 --> 13:02.000]  They're not really interested in the results.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.100]  Wow, Ambassador Allen Keyes is our guest.
[13:05.100 --> 13:11.100]  Absolutely amazing how you just laid it all out and everything you were saying there is true
[13:11.100 --> 13:17.000]  because right in front of me today, ABC News and MSNBC and the New York Times in my stack,
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.100]  they spin it like it's good and they go, look the big insurance companies, look the big doctors unions,
[13:24.100 --> 13:33.200]  look all these special interests are getting together with this $12 million ad package that the health care plan is good
[13:33.200 --> 13:39.700]  and really that is all it is, is big corporations really want it so they can then have liability protection
[13:39.700 --> 13:46.800]  to not give people the care they've already paid for and then the Congressman Conyers says they can't read a 1300-page bill
[13:46.800 --> 13:49.500]  but the government can then implement all our health care.
[13:49.500 --> 13:56.300]  I mean they can't get anything right and really they're just grabbing the whole industry for themselves
[13:56.300 --> 14:02.500]  so I'd like you to comment on that and then secondarily it's come out that White House funded groups,
[14:02.500 --> 14:10.100]  Acorn and others, I mean here's the actual ad, defend President Obama's health care plan over August recess $500 a week.
[14:10.100 --> 14:12.400]  Now is your chance to make health care work.
[14:12.400 --> 14:19.400]  Here they are jobs that matter.org, a Democratic funded group paying people and then they got caught
[14:19.400 --> 14:29.200]  Obama camp plant fake document and Shay Guevara fan at Jackson Lee Forum and they got caught with this woman
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.500]  who works for this lady right here in the shot who works with Obama famously in the photo with her and Shay Guevara
[14:35.500 --> 14:45.500]  and then here she is faking going to stage questioners posing as doctors saying so even the few people that they go to
[14:45.500 --> 14:52.300]  at their own town halls it's stage ambassador, they've been abusing us of it being staged, they are caught staging it.
[14:52.300 --> 14:57.300]  Well see but this corresponds and I hope a lot of people, well maybe a lot of people don't
[14:57.300 --> 15:02.600]  but one of the standard practices of the old communists right in the 20th century
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.700]  was to accuse their opponents of doing the thing that they themselves do routinely
[15:07.700 --> 15:14.000]  and that's exactly what has been happening here that particularly is with respect to these stage meetings
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.400]  in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries under communism under these dictators in the third world.
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.800]  This idea of the staged event where you pretend you got all kinds of public support when you're actually
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.000]  ham-picked people to come out and do show trials as it were and show press conferences and all of this
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.800]  that's standard practice.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.400]  These people are simply showing themselves to be exactly what they are.
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.800]  A bunch of leftists following the handbook of the communists trying to impose this system
[15:41.800 --> 15:48.600]  on the people of the United States against our will with lies and staged manipulations of perception
[15:48.600 --> 15:56.100]  and so forth exactly as a whiskey and others have recommended to the left wingers that they do.
[15:56.100 --> 16:02.400]  It also of course, max of the tactics that were used during the era of the first National Socialist push,
[16:02.400 --> 16:10.200]  the right wing National Socialist, we call them Nazis right, and they had the same kind of approach
[16:10.200 --> 16:16.000]  just for manipulating politics and practiced the same effort to vilify their opponents
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.200]  and to dehumanize them in various ways with name calling and junk like this.
[16:20.200 --> 16:26.200]  Just as these people are now trying to pretend that anybody who looks at this on the basis of the facts
[16:26.200 --> 16:33.000]  analyzes it in light of the ideology and what it's all about, calls what they're doing socialism
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.200]  and you've had these people standing up and saying, well, that's racist. That's just a code word for race.
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.600]  What nonsense is this? Do they really think we're that stupid?
[16:41.600 --> 16:46.200]  Well, I mean, they clearly, Ambassador, and I want your opinion on this, it's cold-blooded.
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.200]  They know they took all these well-meaning people that voted for Obama.
[16:51.200 --> 16:55.200]  I know a lot of rednecks around here in Texas did to prove they weren't racist,
[16:55.200 --> 17:01.200]  wanting to have everybody live together in peace and then now cold-bloodedly these poverty pimps,
[17:01.200 --> 17:07.200]  these Annenberg Foundation people, these Ford Foundation people knowingly come in and say,
[17:07.200 --> 17:12.200]  if you disagree with Capitrade, if you disagree with his policies on government health care,
[17:12.200 --> 17:19.200]  you are a racist and I get hundreds of emails a week saying that I'm secretly a white supremacist
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.200]  because we posted the Obama Joker photo saying socialism.
[17:23.200 --> 17:30.200]  I mean, isn't that really the racism or invoking the racism as divide and conquer?
[17:30.200 --> 17:32.200]  Cold-bloodedly? Isn't that...
[17:32.200 --> 17:38.200]  Absolutely. Think about it. The whole Obama effort was a cold-blooded invocation of race.
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.200]  Everything about what these people did was a cold-blooded effort to play the race card
[17:44.200 --> 17:47.200]  and that's what it was all about.
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.200]  And the whole idea that you should vote for somebody not because of the color of their skin,
[17:52.200 --> 17:58.200]  but because of their qualities and characteristics and your agreement with what they were trying to do
[17:58.200 --> 18:00.200]  was right for the country that they threw out.
[18:00.200 --> 18:06.200]  And of course, now they want it thrown out because most people look at what he's up to
[18:06.200 --> 18:09.200]  realize that people like myself were not exaggerated.
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.200]  You had a lot of people say, oh, that's just extremism. You're exaggerating.
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.200]  No, he's not like that. His speeches are so moderate.
[18:16.200 --> 18:21.200]  But that's because as we're discovering, the man's a pathological liar. I'm sorry.
[18:21.200 --> 18:25.200]  He lies and he is studied at it. He is still full at it.
[18:25.200 --> 18:31.200]  He is a shrewd actor as it were that turns his whole person and delivery into the lie.
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.200]  But nonetheless, it does not correspond with the truth.
[18:35.200 --> 18:40.200]  Well, that's what I was going to say is you live in Illinois. You knew him.
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.200]  And I respect you. I interviewed you for D Magazine back in the mid-90s.
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.200]  I interviewed you again on radio many years ago.
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.200]  I respected you and thought that you were right.
[18:49.200 --> 18:55.200]  I just thought, well, Keyes doesn't usually have any rhetoric, but man, is Obama this bad? I mean, I wasn't for Obama.
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.200]  But I remember the speeches you gave in the warnings and now it's all true.
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.200]  And that's what's concerning me.
[19:03.200 --> 19:06.200]  This is one of the problems I guess I have in life.
[19:06.200 --> 19:10.200]  I'm dealing with issues right now, whether it's the health care issue, the eligibility issue.
[19:10.200 --> 19:13.200]  People always try to pretend that there's some motive involved.
[19:13.200 --> 19:17.200]  I just try to look at things and call them as I see it.
[19:17.200 --> 19:23.200]  I've gone, the knowledge and experience that I've had, I try to clearly share with people conclusions that I think make sense.
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.200]  And that's what I tried to do in that case. And the facts were clear.
[19:27.200 --> 19:37.200]  And therefore, I feel that if you're a public person, you have an obligation to share that true understanding as best you can with the people that you're talking to.
[19:37.200 --> 19:44.200]  Well, since you gave those speeches and talked about him wanting to force abort babies, it's now been confirmed.
[19:44.200 --> 19:51.200]  Let's go over. You know this gentleman. You know who the president really is and who his controllers are.
[19:51.200 --> 20:15.200]  So let us in to your expertise on the other side. Ambassador Keys is our guest.
[20:21.200 --> 20:27.200]  Here's what you do.net. Again, here's what you do.net.
[20:52.200 --> 20:57.200]  That's 877-479-8178. 877-479-8178.
[20:57.200 --> 21:04.200]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[21:04.200 --> 21:12.200]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[21:12.200 --> 21:20.200]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[21:20.200 --> 21:25.200]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[21:25.200 --> 21:34.200]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[21:34.200 --> 21:40.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[21:40.200 --> 21:48.200]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today. It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[21:56.200 --> 22:03.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[22:03.200 --> 22:10.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[22:10.200 --> 22:17.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.200]  Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[22:21.200 --> 22:33.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[22:33.200 --> 22:36.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[22:36.200 --> 22:43.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[22:43.200 --> 22:55.200]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.

[24:15.200 --> 24:22.200]  What are some of your latest works?
[24:22.200 --> 24:46.200]  The major outlets for what I write these days, the most important one is Loyal to Liberty. You can also reach it by the way just by typing in alankeys.com.
[24:46.200 --> 24:56.200]  I'm also serializing what I hope will become a couple of books that are periodically I'm putting chapters up on the blog there for people to look at and so forth.
[24:56.200 --> 25:10.200]  I also am writing for WorldNet Daily and I'm heavily involved in the work of America's Independent Party, which has a website, aitnews.com,
[25:10.200 --> 25:19.200]  which is essentially an effort both to sign up people for a political effort where we're standing on common principles from the get-go
[25:19.200 --> 25:28.200]  and everybody commits to those things so that we're not going to be throwing them aside in order to just achieve office at any price.
[25:28.200 --> 25:36.200]  But it also corresponds to my view that in today's world if we want to take America back, the people must become the media.
[25:36.200 --> 25:50.200]  We must use the tools that are available so we're no longer relying on the corporate button paid for media outlets that now are working for some of these big business enterprises
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.200]  that are essentially the fellow travelers of the Obama Socialist.
[25:54.200 --> 26:02.200]  And that more and more is happening so they're openly saying with the hate crimes law and the cyber bullying that if something hurts someone's feelings,
[26:02.200 --> 26:09.200]  you're going to be federally charged. That's actually in the bills. I couldn't believe it and especially the cyber bullying.
[26:09.200 --> 26:17.200]  So they're certainly coming after our free speech. They're not only saying that saying it's socialism is racist,
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.200]  which is incredible race-baiting in my opinion and as you said cold-bloodily using it to drive a wedge,
[26:24.200 --> 26:32.200]  but they're now calling for the arrest of people that put up Obama posters on light polls, but Obama was in the Washington Post
[26:32.200 --> 26:41.200]  telling his supporters to put up his hope sign on stop signs, which is illegal. So just the level of hypocrisy.
[26:41.200 --> 26:54.200]  Well, I think though it goes beyond hypocrisy because hypocrisy would imply that it's almost just a function of the circumstances of particular cases. It's not.
[26:54.200 --> 27:01.200]  This is the strategy whereby you dehumanize, demoralize and destroy any opposition.
[27:01.200 --> 27:13.200]  You build up your own camps so that they have the exclusive access to public opinion and then you try to mobilize the force of law
[27:13.200 --> 27:21.200]  and law enforcement and the state, eventually including of course arresting and trying people and throwing them into jail or camp
[27:21.200 --> 27:28.200]  because they are dissenting from your policy. That's something that was systematically characteristic
[27:28.200 --> 27:34.200]  of these socialist regimes of the right and left, whether it's the Nazi regime or the old Soviet regime.
[27:34.200 --> 27:46.200]  These socialist regimes, all of them, took this approach to politics and of course they also adopted the famous Rahm Emanuel repeated victim
[27:46.200 --> 27:53.200]  that you want to take advantage of a good crisis and advance your agenda using it.
[27:53.200 --> 28:00.200]  And that of course includes manufacturing it if you don't have one. So that if you don't have a good crisis, you make one up, you cause one.
[28:00.200 --> 28:03.200]  I think that's one of the reasons why he's so irresponsible about spending.
[28:03.200 --> 28:13.200]  He actually wants to push us deeper and deeper into a critical and desperate economic situation that will justify consolidating more and more power
[28:13.200 --> 28:18.200]  in the hands of the government that he controls. That's a standard practice.
[28:18.200 --> 28:25.200]  It just breaks my heart that because of the end of the Cold War, when we were actively confronted by the Soviet,
[28:25.200 --> 28:33.200]  people were more aware on a daily basis of who these people were, what they did, what practices they carried forward.
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.200]  It was something that you grew up with and knew and understood.
[28:37.200 --> 28:43.200]  I think we have now had, what is it, 20, 30 years in which that's become less and less the case and you have a lot of folks now
[28:43.200 --> 28:51.200]  who don't realize that what we're watching is simply part of a pattern that was common from the mid-20th century.
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.200]  Yeah, in case you don't know, sir, it's up on infowars.com.
[28:55.200 --> 29:00.200]  We have at least six different in English, two in Spanish, Florida news reports,
[29:00.200 --> 29:06.200]  and several of them call for my arrest. I didn't come up with the Obama Joker poster.
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.200]  I saw it in LA. Nationally, they said it was racist. You should be arrested.
[29:10.200 --> 29:17.200]  So I put it up on my site and I said, folks, we've got to stand up to this attack on free speech, post these in legal places everywhere.
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.200]  Now, they're on the news calling for my arrest.
[29:21.200 --> 29:27.200]  So I can think of nothing more on American ambassador. I want to get your take on that and get back to the question of,
[29:27.200 --> 29:33.200]  you know what makes them tick, you've been proven to be right about them, what are they going to try next?
[29:33.200 --> 29:45.200]  Then I want to get into some other issues like governor's opposed DOD emergency powers. Obama wants to put 400,000 troops on the streets of America.
[29:45.200 --> 29:47.200]  You can't make this up.
[29:47.200 --> 29:51.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:51.200 --> 29:57.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.200 --> 30:01.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[30:01.200 --> 30:03.200]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[30:03.200 --> 30:11.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[30:11.200 --> 30:17.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[30:17.200 --> 30:19.200]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[30:19.200 --> 30:25.200]  The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[30:25.200 --> 30:36.200]  The Acola blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[30:36.200 --> 30:44.200]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[30:44.200 --> 30:56.200]  That's 1-800-691-6043. Or visit Acola blue on the web at www.ecolo.com.
[30:56.200 --> 31:03.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:03.200 --> 31:09.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[31:09.200 --> 31:16.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[31:16.200 --> 31:20.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:20.200 --> 31:33.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:33.200 --> 31:44.200]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:44.200 --> 31:56.200]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[31:56.200 --> 32:04.200]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations. You got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[32:04.200 --> 32:14.200]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[32:14.200 --> 32:20.200]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[32:20.200 --> 32:32.200]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[32:32.200 --> 32:43.200]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[32:43.200 --> 32:54.200]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[32:54.200 --> 33:17.200]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[33:17.200 --> 33:30.200]  I want to thank the sponsor of this hour of the show, Akola Blue, and it is an atmospheric water generator. It grabs 7.5 gallons out of the air a day and then sends it through reverse osmosis, a carbon filter, a bunch of other stuff.
[33:30.200 --> 33:42.200]  It's just a great unit. AkolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O Blue. Again, that's E-C-O-L-O Blue.com. Or give them a call at 800-691643.
[33:42.200 --> 33:51.200]  I have this in the office. I have this in my home. It's an amazing system. And it doesn't come out of the tap. There's no fluoride, nothing in it.
[33:51.200 --> 33:58.200]  And then it goes through seven filters. AkolaBlue.com, or 800-691643.
[33:58.200 --> 34:08.200]  And I remember years ago listening to Mr. Key's radio show, so informed, we didn't do that anymore, but he's all over talk radio and TV, and we always enjoy having him.
[34:08.200 --> 34:16.200]  And he got arrested. You could be there pro abortion. You just couldn't be against it. We're going to talk about that coming up in a few minutes.
[34:16.200 --> 34:26.200]  But, sir, I continue with the free speech issue. How can you put up signs with Bush as the Joker, Bush as a vampire?
[34:26.200 --> 34:31.200]  And I wasn't a fan of Bush tripling the size of government. Now, Obama's tripled it in seven, eight months, though.
[34:31.200 --> 34:39.200]  So he, obviously, even worse. I didn't know that was possible. How do you, how do these people, in fact, take the village voice?
[34:39.200 --> 34:54.200]  They put out Bush as the vampire, killing the Statue of Liberty, drinking his blood. The very artist came out and said, no, it's okay to show Bush bad, but because Obama is partially African, you are not allowed to.
[34:54.200 --> 35:04.200]  I mean, it's just they're, they are, they got so much bravada. They're just so incredibly arrogant and just so over the top, they have no shame.
[35:04.200 --> 35:09.200]  Can you comment on what makes them tick and the attacks on your free speech?
[35:09.200 --> 35:17.200]  Well, first of all, I think it's purely ideological. These people come from a point of view, which basically says, whatever we say goes.
[35:17.200 --> 35:30.200]  If we do it, then it's acceptable. If our opponents do it, then it's unacceptable. And you make them suffer for what they do in whatever way you can because there is no such thing as a standard of truth.
[35:30.200 --> 35:44.200]  That's the most important thing to keep in mind when listening to their words and everything, the ordinary notion that you are trying to speak the truth and make sense and that you have respect for some standard of reasonableness and common sense and logic and factuality.
[35:44.200 --> 35:56.200]  And none of it applies to them as it did not apply to the people who edited Pravda in the old Soviet Union as it never applies to, did not apply to the gerbil's propagandist under the Nazis.
[35:56.200 --> 36:13.200]  These people aren't about speaking the truth. They are simply about imposing their will by manipulating people's minds, by cutting off others so that they won't have access, won't be able to make arguments and only allow their voice
[36:13.200 --> 36:27.200]  and their understanding and their interpretation to be heard. And they are moving forward to implement that understanding, which of course is contrary to everything that Americans have professed to believe over the course of pretty much our entire history,
[36:27.200 --> 36:38.200]  since that notion of free and open and sometimes even raucous discussion and debate has been a hallmark of what our society is all about.
[36:38.200 --> 36:50.200]  Well, Ambassador, Ambassador, specifically, you've grown up, lived in Illinois, you know him as a state senator, as a U.S. senator, you're aware of his activities.
[36:50.200 --> 37:01.200]  So can you give us a snapshot of him? Because, I mean, specifically, here's the question, though, even if you agree with his policies or disagree, I've never seen one this flagrantly or slickly lie.
[37:01.200 --> 37:09.200]  He makes Clinton look like a poor liar. He's a great actor. He should be in Hollywood because he gets up and says, I will have no lobbyist anywhere.
[37:09.200 --> 37:21.200]  They will not write the laws. He hires more than anybody ever has. He says, I'll have total transparency. He keeps all of Chinese secrecy and more and then even makes it secret who comes to the White House where you even worked,
[37:21.200 --> 37:35.200]  taking it to a new level. So can you comment on knowing who he really is and how he seems to enjoy lying and can one of the few people I've seen who can lie and it looks like he's telling the truth?
[37:35.200 --> 37:52.200]  Well, first of all, I don't want to pretend. One, I did not grow up in Illinois. You know I ran there, but I ran there on invitation.
[37:52.200 --> 38:05.200]  I know Barack Obama as I was engaging in the preparations and carrying out of that campaign effort. It is not a personal thing and I never pretend that I have some special personal slant on Barack Obama.
[38:05.200 --> 38:17.200]  I don't know about that. What I do know, I know from facts, from the positions he's taken and from the facts that one can garner and that are now being shared on the Internet and elsewhere,
[38:17.200 --> 38:31.200]  but that were hidden from the American people because the media clack of the Obama faction, the people who are kind of stupefied by their zealous support of Obama, did not share these facts with the American people.
[38:31.200 --> 38:43.200]  And so they were promoting a false understanding. So in a sense, I came at Barack Obama from an objective point of view, not from a point of view of any kind of special knowledge or animus of any kind, like a lot of Americans.
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.200]  I didn't even know him from Adam.
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.200]  Let me just stop you. Let me just stop you. I just figured that you were a little state senator that nobody had ever heard of until he started being pushed.
[38:53.200 --> 39:01.200]  And what's interesting is when you get to know more about his background, there were forces that were obviously helping to move him along.
[39:01.200 --> 39:11.200]  There are questions about who funded his education and all of these kinds of things. It looked like somebody had it in mind to prepare him for us even though they weren't preparing us for him.
[39:11.200 --> 39:22.200]  Okay. Well, I apologize for my ignorance. I figured since you were running in Illinois and since you knew, I mean, I remember seeing you a year and a half, two years ago, speeches on YouTube, hearing you on the radio.
[39:22.200 --> 39:35.200]  You were so accurate about him. I was just guessing that you must have been in and around him in politics, but I guess you just had a crash course and research when you saw him being pushed and propelled by all these special interests.
[39:35.200 --> 39:44.200]  Sometimes you can be accurate simply because you bring an objective state of mind to the past and are willing to let them instruct you.
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.200]  And that, I guess, is all I can claim in terms of any understanding of that.
[39:48.200 --> 39:57.200]  Okay, good. Break down then who he really is and what he would like to do if we weren't blocking him right now. What would Barack Obama be doing? Who is he?
[39:57.200 --> 40:08.200]  Well, I think Barack Obama wants, and at the very least, to impose a Chavez-style socialism on the United States and to do so in a way that alters our Constitution.
[40:08.200 --> 40:20.200]  He has no respect for the Constitution, believes that the whole idea of limited government constrains the government from doing what the elitists think is good and interferes with their freedom of action.
[40:20.200 --> 40:29.200]  And therefore, he wants to throw it out the window. They also seem to believe in what you might call a majority tyranny.
[40:29.200 --> 40:43.200]  So that if you win an election, you then have license to do whatever you want and no longer have to pay any attention to individual rights, to the rights of the minority group of voters that don't support the things you're doing, all of that overthrow.
[40:43.200 --> 40:55.200]  The patterns are patterns that we see in contemporary life with somebody like Chavez, and they're patterns that we have seen in the past, as I've been saying, with these other socialist regimes.
[40:55.200 --> 41:03.200]  So none of it, in that respect, is surprising. And he just seems to be caught from an ideological cloth that came from his background.
[41:03.200 --> 41:22.200]  His association with people like Bill Ayers is an instruction in the approaches of folks like Saul Alintzi, his preference for Marxist-Leninist teachers and instructors who, among other things, have shared with him that understanding of the world, which devalues the individual
[41:22.200 --> 41:41.200]  and which lifts up the notion that individuals are no different than stones or rocks or any other material things and should be arranged and ordered by the will of the ruler so that their ideas and understanding of what is right for the society can be carried out.
[41:41.200 --> 41:50.200]  The whole moral understanding that puts an intrinsic value on individuals that started with our Declaration of Independence, he also rejects.
[41:50.200 --> 42:05.200]  And once you realize that you're dealing with somebody whose moral universe has rejected the fundamental premise of liberty that most Americans kind of take for granted even when they can't fully articulate them,
[42:05.200 --> 42:16.200]  then you are a long way toward understanding what he's about. And what does he want to do? He wants to impose that kind of controlling socialist government on the United States.
[42:16.200 --> 42:31.200]  Does he think it's going to do us good? I imagine so, but I've got to tell you, when you see somebody so unwilling to look at the factual truth, and a lot of these leftists are and have been for the whole of my lifetime,
[42:31.200 --> 42:47.200]  you have to wonder whether they haven't completely surrendered to the fervor of their ideology in a way that makes their good intentions worthless because they're not willing to discipline those intentions with the discipline of common sense and reason and truth.
[42:47.200 --> 43:00.200]  Amazing points. Dealing with lying though, you worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan, and even if you disagreed with him or loved him or hated him, Reagan didn't do a lot of lying.
[43:00.200 --> 43:13.200]  I mean, he really was honest and his policies were very transparent. In fact, there wasn't any lying, as much I can tell, which is universes away from Clinton.
[43:13.200 --> 43:20.200]  Bush certainly did some deceptive things, but Obama, I mean, you've been around presidents, you've been an ambassador, you've been in these campaigns.
[43:20.200 --> 43:29.200]  Is it safe to say, or would you disagree with my perspective, that he is the greatest liar I've ever seen, a new level of lying?
[43:29.200 --> 43:38.200]  I mean, I've read books about Hitler. I've read books about other people. It seems that Obama is really the slickest liar I've ever seen.
[43:38.200 --> 43:53.200]  I'm not sure. I think part of the reason he appears though right now is because the mass of the American people kind of aren't used to having to assume that the person they're dealing with is, how can I put it?
[43:53.200 --> 44:00.200]  Not just lying, they are constructing a fiction and intending that fiction to manipulate you.
[44:00.200 --> 44:12.200]  So in a sense, when we sit down and watch a TV show, right, we are drawn into the world. We accept the characterization, we accept the assumptions and so forth and so on, but they call the suspension of disbelief.
[44:12.200 --> 44:19.200]  Now, at one level, everything we're watching is false. Those people aren't really who they're pretending to be.
[44:19.200 --> 44:24.200]  They're inflections and phones do not reflect feelings they really have and so forth and so on.
[44:24.200 --> 44:30.200]  And yet, because they're good at what they do, we accept it and are drawn into that world.
[44:30.200 --> 44:38.200]  Well, imagine that you're dealing with people for whom every aspect of public life is that kind of acted out fiction.
[44:38.200 --> 44:52.200]  They're pursuing their objectives and they just want to get you to come in and believe the world is what it needs to be so that they can achieve their power, achieve their objectives, achieve what they want to achieve.
[44:52.200 --> 45:03.200]  That's Barack Obama. And to say he's great as I, but it's just that we're not used to having such thorough-going actors with no respect for truth in American politics.
[45:03.200 --> 45:12.200]  Yeah, we're used to liars, people lie, but underlying it all, there's been this assumption that the aim somehow is still to respect the truth.
[45:12.200 --> 45:15.200]  That's not the case with these folks because they don't believe it anymore.
[45:15.200 --> 45:27.200]  You know, the notion of the self-evident truth that establish our rights, that show clearly that justice somehow has a basis that isn't just based on the power of those who rule over you.
[45:27.200 --> 45:43.200]  They reject all of that. And I think right now very striking to us because Americans kind of have had the luxury of taking it for granted that overall this is not what American life and politics was about.
[45:43.200 --> 46:01.200]  But now we're having to deal with a very real fact that this way of doing politics, which overtook Europe, which overtook countries in the third world and which radically transformed those countries into gulags and hellish places of oppression, it has now come to America.
[46:01.200 --> 46:11.200]  Wow. You know what? I rarely have epiphanies these days from guests. I mean, I get a lot of good points, a lot of good ideas, but you just actually shifted my perspective.
[46:11.200 --> 46:20.200]  I mean, I know it's a matrix. I know it's a facade, a Wizard of Oz lie, but the way you just explained it, you're right. It's at the mainstream media.
[46:20.200 --> 46:32.200]  And the system is playing to his tune with such choreographed precision that it creates a whole Disneyland of lies.
[46:32.200 --> 46:41.200]  So it's not just Bill Clinton saying, I didn't have sex with that woman or lying about corruption. It's that the whole things a lie.
[46:41.200 --> 46:58.200]  Well, exactly. They are creating as it were a perceived reality that served their purposes. And of course, the ground started to be laid for this years ago when these people started that phony mantra, perception is reality, perception is reality.
[46:58.200 --> 47:07.200]  This is not true. Not if God exists, at least, because there is a principle of reality that transcends human perception and understanding.
[47:07.200 --> 47:16.200]  And it's the basis for making real judgments in a rational way about what is right, what is wrong, what should or should not be done.
[47:16.200 --> 47:23.200]  They rejected that notion of having such a basis for morality. And the only standard they claim is a scientific one.
[47:23.200 --> 47:30.200]  And of course, remember, science cannot tell us anything about what is right and what is wrong.
[47:30.200 --> 47:34.200]  What is just, what is unjust. Science can't address that in any way.
[47:34.200 --> 47:43.200]  Well, sir, we've got limited time. We've got about 12 minutes left. And I'm even going to skip this network break so we have this time with you because I've got several other questions I want to get to and certainly have you back up in the near future.
[47:43.200 --> 47:53.200]  I'm sure you're very honored to have Ambassador Alan Keyes on with us today. Very thought provoking. Especially perception isn't reality.
[47:53.200 --> 48:05.200]  The person giving you the perception is putting false data in or lying or distorting. I mean, if you're wearing a headset of virtual reality goggles and you see a flat green field you're walking in,
[48:05.200 --> 48:14.200]  you're about to walk off a hundred story building, you're going to fall and die, the goggles are lying to you, perception isn't reality, but that was just me backing you up there.
[48:14.200 --> 48:24.200]  Think of it, think of it. This is exactly what they were trying to do with this healthcare system. Tell it on the basis that we're going to give everybody access, it's going to be better, it's going to be less costly and all of this.
[48:24.200 --> 48:42.200]  And then when you started to get into the detail, it wasn't actually less costly, they were just going to shift the distribution of the cost so that the elderly citizens and so forth were going to be targeted in particular for rationing so that those costs could be distributed differently.
[48:42.200 --> 48:54.200]  They said, well, everybody's going to have access and so forth, but the burden of paying for that suddenly shifted so that instead of coming out of the corporate profit, it will now come out of the taxpayer coffers.
[48:54.200 --> 49:06.200]  What does that mean? It means that invisibly and quietly the working people are being made to pay for what they were not paying for in terms of the present arrangement.
[49:06.200 --> 49:15.200]  And the government's got a whole new tax to pull out of your paycheck. Now, we've got ten minutes left here, I want to ask you quick questions now.
[49:15.200 --> 49:26.200]  Eugenics from my research ambassador is the foundation of these control freaks. They believe we're all just blobs of protoplasm, so why not get rid of 80% of us?
[49:26.200 --> 49:36.200]  United Nations biological diversity assessment 96, State Department memorandum 200, Eric Holder, all these other people.
[49:36.200 --> 49:51.200]  John P. Holdren, John P. Holdren, eco science, population, resources, environment, calls for force, drugging the water to sterilize us, forced abortion, CPS taking basically all children, raising them in government hives.
[49:51.200 --> 49:58.200]  And I have all these other government textbooks, and you're a learned person, you're aware of this, exposing the whole abortion agenda, which is only one level.
[49:58.200 --> 50:07.200]  And then he unfreezes the money for forced abortion and, you know, they say, oh, you'll get the welfare in Africa, but we've got to sterilize you.
[50:07.200 --> 50:18.200]  Can you speak to John P. Holdren and the whole Eugenics situation and what Margaret Sanger and the whole abortion industry really is?
[50:18.200 --> 50:29.200]  Well, this is one of those things that is one of the reasons I had been so clear about his absolute adamant commitment to this whole abortion thing,
[50:29.200 --> 50:36.200]  so that he carried it as far as saying that babies born alive should be allowed to die because their mother's one is unaborted.
[50:36.200 --> 50:46.200]  That is a reflection of what you're talking about. Sometimes people think this is just about the specific particular murder of that baby that abortion itself involves.
[50:46.200 --> 50:55.200]  No, you look at Margaret Sanger. That woman was about a strategy based on Eugenics for basically cleansing the world of the inferior people.
[50:55.200 --> 51:08.200]  It is an inherently elitist understanding that sees no value or intrinsic worth except in those lives that stand up to the measuring rod of these elitists that are somehow valuable to humankind.
[51:08.200 --> 51:16.200]  In one respect, it turns out that as the left wingers move down this road, they are implementing a dehumanizing understanding,
[51:16.200 --> 51:25.200]  but instead of dehumanizing people based on the racist notions of somebody like Hitler and the things that were being portrayed in Germany,
[51:25.200 --> 51:32.200]  they dehumanize people based on the scientific understanding that there's nothing essentially human about us,
[51:32.200 --> 51:39.200]  that we are in that sense just blobs of flesh and chemicals and junk that can be manipulated like any other physical thing.
[51:39.200 --> 51:47.200]  And that, of course, means that there's no boundaries whatsoever that you have to respect except the whimsical boundaries of personal attachment
[51:47.200 --> 51:51.200]  so that if you're part of the favorite clique, you might be treated differently.
[51:51.200 --> 51:53.200]  That's the world they're pushing us for.
[51:53.200 --> 52:02.200]  And abortion was essentially the cutting edge to get people implicated in a moral understanding that destroyed our steps,
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.200]  that humanity and every single human being have a moral work that must be respected by the power of government,
[52:09.200 --> 52:18.200]  that can't be disregarded on the basis of some elitist measuring rods of who's worth having around and who can be killed with impunity.
[52:18.200 --> 52:27.200]  Ambassador, isn't this really the religion of control freaks on power trips where Peter Singer says,
[52:27.200 --> 52:35.200]  let parents kill their babies for a year after they're born, get rid of the old people, they've got the same value as mackerel.
[52:35.200 --> 52:43.200]  I mean, these are quotes saying an old person has the same value as a fish, that a retarded child needs to be killed,
[52:43.200 --> 52:52.200]  and I found they really are the ultimate racist as Margaret Singer wrote in her own letters to W. D. B. Du Bois.
[52:52.200 --> 52:58.200]  She said, I've got to hire black men to be my fronts to get rid of these black weeds.
[52:58.200 --> 53:07.200]  In my research, I found that the real racist, the real Nazis always cloak themselves as liberals, and that it's even more than that.
[53:07.200 --> 53:17.200]  It's not just some pseudo-science and their excuse to play God that they ratherlessly enjoy going after Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, poor people.
[53:17.200 --> 53:25.200]  It doesn't matter, and that they even have people of color in their ranks who enjoy this.
[53:25.200 --> 53:32.200]  Well, you know, the sad thing is, underlying it all, there is an element of what I call self-worship involved in this.
[53:32.200 --> 53:42.200]  That is involved in the fascination these elites have for themselves and their own power and the confirmation they see when they enjoy a little success,
[53:42.200 --> 53:44.200]  that some of them are better than everybody else.
[53:44.200 --> 53:52.200]  That even, by the way, accounts for their so-called compassion, because it affirms their superiority to see themselves from a height,
[53:52.200 --> 53:59.200]  helping the downtrodden, because of their inferiority, couldn't do as well, and so forth and so on.
[53:59.200 --> 54:09.200]  But remember, that kind of self-worship has an implication that goes to the very heart of religion and faith and spirituality,
[54:09.200 --> 54:18.200]  because it denies that there is anything other than themselves that is worthy of that kind of real reverence.
[54:18.200 --> 54:25.200]  And so it is premised at the end of the day on the vanishing of God from the consciousness of human beings.
[54:25.200 --> 54:34.200]  And that's why people like myself who put a great stress on the American Declaration, on the fact that our unalienable rights come from the hand of Almighty God,
[54:34.200 --> 54:46.200]  we are their deep enemy, because we will not let people forget the existence of God and the fact that most of us accept that and believe it.
[54:46.200 --> 54:56.200]  Well, Ambassador, when you read, as I know you have, all these futurist and transhumanist and neo-eugenicist that just fill the government ranks,
[54:56.200 --> 55:03.200]  Dr. Piankas and the Holdrens and Earlecks, they actually believe they're God.
[55:03.200 --> 55:10.200]  In the BBC, there was a report last year where they said, we're going to split off and be an elite species of the government planner,
[55:10.200 --> 55:12.200]  and then all the rest of you are these subhumans.
[55:12.200 --> 55:18.200]  I mean, you're right, but it's not just that they don't want to say God doesn't exist, they're saying, I am God.
[55:18.200 --> 55:25.200]  Well, you see, but I think that's a return to something quite old in terms of human injustice.
[55:25.200 --> 55:36.200]  Remember that when the people of the world were subjected to these old oligarchic aristocratic regimes, you know, the nobles and the peasantry and all of this,
[55:36.200 --> 55:45.200]  the mists of the time were centered on apotheosis, that is, where the elite, because of their success and achievements and greatness,
[55:45.200 --> 55:48.200]  they are elevated to the status of God.
[55:48.200 --> 55:51.200]  That happened to the Caesar, that happened to others.
[55:51.200 --> 55:58.200]  The aim, therefore, in that pagan understanding was for these people to transform themselves to God-like status.
[55:58.200 --> 56:10.200]  And all we're seeing is the return of that age-old chivalrous, now being used once again to impose the idea of some kind of inherent superiority of these elites,
[56:10.200 --> 56:13.200]  upon people whom they intend en masse to oppress.
[56:13.200 --> 56:16.200]  Amazing, Ambassador, we've got to have you back up on this subject.
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.200]  The last question.
[56:18.200 --> 56:21.200]  Governors opposed DOD emergency powers.
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.200]  That's from The Hill, newspaper in D.C., as you know.
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.200]  Congressman could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.200]  Congressman told the Louisville Journal.
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.200]  Congressman Paul Brown said they may use it to declare martial law as a cover for Obama because his agenda.
[56:37.200 --> 56:42.200]  Pentagon wants authority to impose 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[56:42.200 --> 56:45.200]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[56:45.200 --> 56:55.200]  And we now hear Obama saying terrorist, right-wing terrorist in the Southern Prairie Law Center and the DOD documents in the Justice Department.
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.200]  Homeland security veterans and gun owners and Ron Paul supporters are terrorists.
[56:59.200 --> 57:07.200]  In the last two minutes, can you comment on that and are you concerned that Obama may stage crises, as Michael Savage and others have said?
[57:07.200 --> 57:16.200]  Well, I think we're seeing again a reliable pattern that was there in the 20th century versions of this imposition of communism.
[57:16.200 --> 57:19.200]  The blurring of the distinction between the military and law enforcement.
[57:19.200 --> 57:25.200]  The destruction of the idea that human beings have individual rights.
[57:25.200 --> 57:35.200]  Instead, there's some national security threat that overrides those rights and justifies making use of any kind of action against individuals
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.200]  that you can put them in a category as a national security threat.
[57:39.200 --> 57:44.200]  I warned against this for many years and we are now seeing it brought to full fruition.
[57:44.200 --> 57:50.200]  Finally, I think there is a mentality that we now know was there, for instance, with the Nazis.
[57:50.200 --> 57:56.200]  The famous turning point in terms of the consolidation of Hitler's power was the burning of the Reichstag,
[57:56.200 --> 58:02.200]  which they blamed on the communists and leftists and those who were opposing what Hitler was trying to do
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.200]  and what we now know from the historical record they did it themselves.
[58:06.200 --> 58:14.200]  They burned down the Reichstag in order to provoke the excuse that allows them to impose that totalitarian control
[58:14.200 --> 58:17.200]  and consolidate it completely over Germany.
[58:17.200 --> 58:23.200]  I think that we're watching a repetition of this pattern and we need to wake up and we need to use those tools
[58:23.200 --> 58:28.200]  we still have available as Americans to stop this from happening.
[58:28.200 --> 58:32.200]  Amazing, Ambassador Alan Keyes, I look forward to having you back up.
[58:32.200 --> 58:37.200]  The website is loyloliberty.blogspot.com. Thank you so much, sir.

[59:57.200 --> 1:00:09.200]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:18.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:28.200]  It is the fifth day of August, on this Wednesday edition, fifth day of August, 2009.
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:42.200]  We have three hours left in this transmission. We're here live Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time, 5 to 7, Eastern.
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:01:03.200]  Again, I want to thank you all for joining us today. Now is the time for me to go full bore, and for all of us to go full bore, operational, against the globalist, exposing the fact that they're clearly planning to use a staged flu pandemic,
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:09.200]  whether it kills a bunch of people or not, as a pretext for their martial law control grip.
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:27.200]  Hundreds of mainstream news articles in the last six months have acclimated the public to have regular Marines, regular Army, Marine Corps Reserves, Army Reserves, National Guard on the streets of America at checkpoints for DWIs at mass shootings.
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:40.200]  I read the headline last hour out of Birmingham, Alabama, where they're going to use the National Guard there now as the police force, because the town and the county is collapsing.
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:47.200]  The Associated Press is reporting this. This is all part of acclimation.
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:57.200]  Now, I went to Urban Warfare Drills 12 years ago, 11 years ago, 10 years ago, 9 years ago. I've been to scores of these.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:07.200]  Where are the troops practiced locking down the city, taking over city hall? I would cover this. People would deny it.
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:21.200]  Now, they admit Northcom is there to not fight, quote, Al Qaeda, their own creation. That was their excuse to set it up, making the United States a military jurisdiction.
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:37.200]  But they're now saying in the DHS report and the MIAC reports that we broke, that were sent to us by good police and good military. We've been sent secret documents that later get confirmed in the Baltimore Sun, that the Army is spying on anti-fed activists who want to abolish the Fed or audit it.
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:42.200]  They're spying on myself or on solid events. This is all confirmed.
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:48.200]  The good news is the military sending us this information from inside channels, because they're upset about it.
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:57.200]  They know those that can still think who aren't felons or illegal aliens at the military's hiring. They're getting rid of the good people bringing in these criminals and foreigners.
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  They just had NLE09 using troops from 14 nations to admittedly take on the American people.
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:12.200]  The DHS report says the number one threat is gun owners, veterans, and constitutionalists who, quote, want to end the Fed or audit the Fed.
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:18.200]  They tell the police that they have a Ron Paul sticker, anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest you.
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:27.200]  All over the nation, if you have people out handing out anti-Obama healthcare documents, we have video coming up, armored vehicles pull up, SWAT teams jump out and run up scared.
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:36.200]  They're scared. They're breathing heavy. They've been told they're terrorist, and they say there's no First Amendment on video. Get off the streets. We have the video of this.
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:45.200]  We're already under martial law. Now, how are they going to make everybody feel like they're guilty? How are they going to make everybody feel like they're suspect?
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:51.200]  First, they say it's for al-Qaeda, then they say, oh, guess what? This whole North Com system is for you. We're going to use the Army for everything.
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  Car wrecks, drunk driving, you know, just the Army's going to help local police, local schools. They're going to help give the force inoculations.
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:08.200]  The flu makes everybody suspect, and they have the feds covertly everywhere, including Dripping Springs High School.
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:16.200]  One of my employees, husbands, works at the school. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:23.200]  One person might have had the flu, and nine times out of ten, it turns out it's not even the swine flu, which isn't even the swine flu.
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  It's part human, part pig, part bird, and clearly manufactured, but not deadly. Only killed very few people compared to the regular flu.
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:39.200]  Any excuse they have, they lock the school down, scared everybody, locked the teachers down for four hours after school, then let them go.
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  The feds were telling them to do this. For anybody gets sick, they lock the school, they lock the bank, they lock the business down to create a grassroots perception that there's fear.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  While the media builds towards the forced inoculations, an expert on this, Steve Quill joins us for two hours coming up.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:02.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:06.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:12.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:17.200]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:24.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:27.200]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:31.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:36.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:41.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:48.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:57.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[1:05:57.200 --> 1:06:00.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:06.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:13.200]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:18.200]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:23.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:28.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:32.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:38.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:41.200]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:52.200]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:56.200]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:01.200]  Being a part of Life Change T has been an exhilarating experience.
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:04.200]  I love the testimonies. Julian New York writes,
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:09.200]  I love this product. I feel great. It worked immediately. You can feel the cleansing right away.
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:15.200]  Other products don't work right away like this one does. Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes,
[1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:18.200]  My daughter has lost 27 pounds. She loves the tea.
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:20.200]  And David from Tennessee writes,
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.200]  My wife has a lot of digestive problems and the tea really helps her a lot.
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  I like it too. And here's my favorite from CJ in Minnesota.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:35.200]  He writes, This stuff really works. No, I mean it really works. No, I mean it really works.
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:41.200]  Be one of the many testimonies that we receive every month. Order today online at GetTheTea.com.

[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:58.200]  You know the number, 928-308-0408. Be our next testimony. You love us and we love you.
[1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:04.200]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us in the fourth hour today, coming up in an hour and 52 minutes.
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  For the balance of that time, though, before he joins us, we have Steve Quayle,
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:31.200]  best-selling author, syndicated radio host, researcher, survivalist.
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:37.200]  Steve wrote books back in the mid-90s about how they would use a genetically engineered flu
[1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  as their pretext and cover to bring in world government, because it makes everyone guilty.
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  See, first they built the police state control grid Northcom in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda,
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:52.200]  the globalist creation on record, Sybil Edmond's FBI translator on record
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:58.200]  that Al-Qaeda was working for the CIA and FBI and Defense Intelligence right up to 9-11.
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  And all these other documents that have come out, they flew them out to safety, that's Times of London.
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:09.200]  Once they've got their system set up, then they announce, oh, it's for the American people.
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:16.200]  Oh, there's terrorists. And all over the news, remember in the Missouri papers, what, two weeks ago?
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:21.200]  I'll pull that out and put it on screen later. The Army is now writing articles for local newspapers
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:24.200]  saying, oh, we're running checkpoints in the town.
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:30.200]  We're trying to protect the town from militia attacks.
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:36.200]  So we're going to be searching your cars. This is in the news all over the country.
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:46.200]  They just announced that they're going to be running drills and checkpoints in the towns,
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:49.200]  searching you to fight the militia, the American guns.
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:55.200]  See, suddenly, oh, Northcom admits its main enemy is the American people.
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:01.200]  Now, this is perfect cover to pass the banking takeover, the new bank of the world they want to set up in October.
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:08.200]  It's perfect timing in October to pass the anti-gun bills they've got introduced, the cap and trade for the Senate.
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:13.200]  That's what they're saying. Everything's going to happen in October, November.
[1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:18.200]  Obama's approval ratings plunging. They've got to get it done by then. They're saying this.
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:25.200]  Now, back in, there's some background. I want Steve Quill to talk about this first and then we'll go through what's happening in the future.
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:31.200]  I went on air in January, February and March. We had emergency managers from towns on.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:41.200]  We had reporters on where the feds were building mass graves, where the feds were preparing local cemeteries for hundreds of thousands dead per town,
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:49.200]  where the feds were telling police departments harden yourselves for IED attacks, terror attacks. The American people are going to attack you.
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:55.200]  They would do drills with the feds, with the local police would guard the flu vaccine coming in.
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:00.200]  And I said, folks, it appears they're going to play a flu card as the next stage falls flat.
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  I said, call the White House, call Congress, tell them don't do it.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:12.200]  And then in April, they launch. They say, end of the world, hundreds of millions are going to die. And I said, wait a minute, hardly anybody's dying.
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:17.200]  This is genetically engineered though. Scientists were already saying, what's the deal?
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:24.200]  Is this a psychological primer for the fall? Then the Poletano comes out and says, oh, it will happen in the fall.
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:29.200]  It will happen in October. They love telling you what they're going to do.
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:37.200]  And so now we see it's the perfect cover. Now, all over the country, they're telling banks, schools, Walmart, anything in infrastructure protection through InfraGuard,
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:43.200]  this secret network of 50 plus thousand spooks and spies for the feds in industry and business and government.
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:50.200]  Water treatment plants, power plants, anything in infrastructure. They're now expanding that out to hundreds of thousands where everything's infrastructure.
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:57.200]  License to kill. Kill your employees. Kill whoever we order you to kill. That's mainstream news. InfraGuard.
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:02.200]  We have the clergy response teams going back three years ago. We got the secret documents since confirmed mainstream news.
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:09.200]  But they say it's good. The clergy response teams training and telling their flocks, it's of God.
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  Take the flu shot. Take the smallpox. Take the anthrax shot. Turn in your guns. Let them take your children.
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.200]  Go to the FEMA camp. Go to the relocation camp. We played those clips over and over again.
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:26.200]  Exactly what we showed you in the documents years later announced in the news because they're getting ready to go operational.
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:35.200]  Suddenly, trips to run checkpoints for drunk drivers, trips to run checkpoints for gun checks in Illinois,
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:46.200]  trips to run checkpoints for militias that want to attack the National Guard just out of the blue. This is in the newspapers.
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:53.200]  Why is all this happening? Because our system of government is falling. We're going into foreign bank receivership.
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:13:06.200]  But we hope in the choices of bad to worse that they just hype it to inject people with sterilization campaigns and cancer viruses
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:14.200]  and to make tens of billions off these vaccines. That's on the bad, but not the worse.
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:22.200]  They could actually put out something that kills a bunch of people to really create a panic so more people take the shots that have the soft kills
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  that the White House science are talks about and says they're going to put in your vaccines and put in your water.
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  I mean, they're not playing games. They may go with the mass culling.
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:41.200]  I believe though it's just going to be more fair mongering to train us to go under level six under U.N. control
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:48.200]  and to get people to take the soft kill shots and to practice having trips on the streets for bigger biological releases in the future.
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  Because their psychological tactic is create a crisis, restrict people, resist back off a little, but not as much.
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.200]  Then squeeze in again. The people saying we've had enough. They back off a little.
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:06.200]  Then as soon as our resistance dissipates, they squeeze again. We get angry. They back off a little and over time they squeeze us.
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:11.200]  That's the psychology. But their whole agenda is stalling and falling apart.
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:21.200]  So they may go with something bigger, sprinkled in terror attacks, saying Al Qaeda did it, linking up with White Al Qaeda, the American people.
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:26.200]  They're saying fear everyone. They're now putting out the script. I see the preconditioning for that.
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:31.200]  They may launch a war with Iran. I mean, they're going for broke. Everything's lined up for them.
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:35.200]  I've never seen such a buildup of the establishment's operations.
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:42.200]  Now I've got Steve Quill with us. I just wanted to, this video I'm asking listeners to spread it everywhere to make it go viral.
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:50.200]  Because if we expose them enough, they may back off and not do the really bad stuff and just do the soft kill operation, which is bad enough.
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:54.200]  But we can warn people and that buys us some time. We're trying to triage here.
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:15:00.200]  It may even blow up in their face and they may back off on the whole program, but they're going to keep coming back, coming back.
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:05.200]  That's their MO. Ladies and gentlemen, everything is lined up for this.
[1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:10.200]  And they're doing weird quarantine secretly at high schools, dripping springs yesterday.
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:16.200]  One of my employees, husband's works there. They locked it down, wouldn't let the kids go home, wouldn't let the coaches go home.
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:24.200]  It said national security don't tell anybody. This was all over. This was all over one kid who got a fever.
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  And then of course now they're telling him, oh, don't worry. It was probably nothing.
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:36.200]  They don't even know that was swine flu. See, but they're doing grassroots psyops everywhere so that everybody will be scared and take the shot.
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  Now, Steve Cuell wrote a book back in the mid 90s documenting all this.
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:45.200]  We can see what they're building. Steve, I know I've been ranting the last 10 minutes here.
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:56.200]  Break down comments on what I've just said, the history of what we saw, the intel you're getting, and then let's move in to the future of what they're planning.
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  And all the other facets. Steve Cuell, great to have you here with us.
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:06.200]  Thanks, Alex. Well, first of all, this is it. And this is the end game, how appropriate your title for your video.
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:17.200]  The whole thing that I'm hearing and seeing in play now is multiple strains of vaccines, double talk, but the implementation, Alex, and all my sources say they're going for broke.
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:25.200]  They have backed off in the past, but now the arrogance, and this is coming from people who live in the realm of the Illuminati circles.
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:30.200]  They know that their, quote, game is up. The thing that most people are missing, you've been talking about.
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:41.200]  I've been talking about, but isn't it fascinating how the fast track vaccination program with no independent surveys, safety surveys, U.S. government mandating, martial law declared?
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:47.200]  Who, you know, the World Health Organization not trading or even sharing actual cases that are happening?
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:55.200]  In other words, the thing is to say that it's not going to scare us into submission. It's the vilification of the American public.
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:05.200]  Let me share something. In the last week, a very high-ranking and high-level intelligence official deep within the caverns of their world broke ranks.
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:13.200]  I don't know the guy, don't know his name or anything, but the point is that he said he will not take part in the death of 25 to 50 million people.
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:19.200]  Now, Alex, this is the thing. This isn't just to scare people. Scare is working, obviously, to fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:24.200]  And you and I went on record as saying, this was not it when you had me on your show that night.
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:28.200]  We said, this is not it. This is setting us up for the fall.
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:36.200]  I think people are losing track of what these mouthpieces for the Department of Human Sacrifice are saying.
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:44.200]  And by the way, Alex, this thing is kicking into such high speed that I'm going to encourage everyone to call their senators.
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:52.200]  We know that enough pressure is already on them for all the different town hall meetings and everything on this healthcare bill.
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:58.200]  Look at the insanity of that coupled with the orchestration of the implementation of martial law.
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:08.200]  Listen, every day goes by, we hear of more military troops being placed. You've laid out for the people of psychological conditioning of military troops that were trained in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:12.200]  house-to-house weapon searches. We've always heard, oh, there are too many guns.
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  Well, unfortunately, I hope that's true. Unfortunately, I don't think it is because most people,
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:25.200]  most, quote, sportsmen and average gun owners are not trained in the skills of modern combat.
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:38.200]  The thing that is really irritating to me is that this next round of scare tactics, look, they can parade out a Hollywood production of people dying and bleeding out of their eyes,
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:42.200]  ears, nose, throat, and other orifices and basically claim that it's Ebola.
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:49.200]  We have that story, by the way, you covered it in Texas, a couple of people literally having some form of a hemorrhagic disease.
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:57.200]  100 of the world's preeminent scientists have been murdered, assassinated, liquidated over the last 10 years.
[1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:02.200]  Well, the flu shot itself, which they admit is live virus in many of the varieties, they're testing.
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:09.200]  Many top virologists are in the news saying that all this testing of live virus vaccines could actually cause an outbreak,
[1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:14.200]  and that's the perfect way to mutate a virus is to inject it into a bunch of people.
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:18.200]  They're doing the main swine flu testing in Texas.
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:24.200]  Absolutely. Here's the word that people got to get used to, a word called mutagenic, okay?
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:32.200]  That means that it's the mutation or the ability of the viruses to incorporate any of the pre-planned defenses against them.
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:39.200]  Listen, these people are straight out of the cauldrons of hell, and the idea and what's the difference is somebody's going to come put a gun in your head
[1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:42.200]  and blow your brains out or give you an injection in which you die later.
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:48.200]  There are multiple strains of the vaccine for different people according to their perceived threat against the federal government.
[1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:53.200]  Steve Quayle, stay there. Continue to break all this down the different facets on the other side.
[1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:57.200]  Your calls are coming up in the next hour on the flu martial law takeover probe.
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:04.200]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Grafundersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available in the market today.

[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:01.200]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, August 19, 2009.
[1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:04.200]  Goal opened this morning at 9.33.40.
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:11.200]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 9.60.23, 4.80.11 for the half ounce, or 2.40.06 for a quarter ounce.
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:15.200]  That's 9.60.23, 4.80.11, and 2.40.06.
[1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:26.200]  On June 4, 1963, executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government in interest.
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:29.200]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:33.200]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.200]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:42.200]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:47.200]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free. Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:57.200]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:02.200]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:07.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.200]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:12.200]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:23.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:31.200]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:35.200]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:38.200]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:43.200]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:02.200]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:08.200]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:09.200]  The answer is simple.
[1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:11.200]  PureBulk.com

[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:07.200]  Alright, I want listeners to very carefully pay attention to what we're saying.
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:25.200]  Hearing that whole flue hysteria that the government and the media created over a few hundred people dying in Mexico and the United States, maximum. Most of those turned out to have died of other illnesses or were already on breathing machines or had cancer or very elderly.
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:38.200]  I never got during that whole hysteria to point out I had foreseen all this in March, on the March 5th shows specifically, and said they're going to launch a massive flue hysteria, whether it actually kills a bunch of people or not, because I saw them building the mass graves,
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:48.200]  telling local police get ready for troops to be on the streets. Now suddenly, for any and all reasons, they're putting troops on the streets after they built this up for years. They didn't just do this overnight.
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  And so I see decades of preparation and taking over local governments and paying people off and all of the psyops and the Hollywood movies showing troops with the police and troops of the Kentucky Derby and Super Bowl all coming together now.
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:11.200]  And I would say there's an 80% chance that they're going to go with it in the fall and that this is the big one.
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:21.200]  Now, if we get the word out and scream bloody murder, Steve Quell, do you have any hope that we can back this off if we just go absolutely wild and get the information out?
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:23.200]  Adding to that, most people...
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:42.200]  I do in one respect. I really believe that when we're appealing to the individuals in the military and law enforcement, that if we can give them enough information, I mean, there are people out there that are listening to you and I that control the most powerful weapons in the world, that control things that most people don't even know exist.
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:26:00.200]  And I'm talking about those that have the systems that echo through the universe that literally should put a stop to this because, look, in the intelligence community, and by the way, people don't understand that when people break rank with multiple stars,
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:07.200]  and I'm talking in the national security agency and other places, it costs them an effect if they're signing a death sentence to themselves.
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:12.200]  So my hope is that by your program, my program, and all the different things we're saying...
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:16.200]  Let me just give you one statement that we've got to get on record, okay?
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:27.200]  The Dr. May Wan-Ho and biologist Professor Joe Cummings have written that vaccines themselves can be dangerous, especially life-attenuated viral vaccines or the new recombinant nucleic acid vaccines.
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  They have the potential to generate the virulent viruses by recombination. The recombinant nucleic acids could cause autoimmune diseases.
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:43.200]  What that means, and this is something that people have got to understand, those in the military, you should question the vaccines you're being given.
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:48.200]  Those of you in law enforcement, you're going to be on the first lines of this.
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:27:00.200]  By the way, information came to me from some guys in Kansas with, I think, the state patrol there that they're having some really bad reactions to some of the vaccines they're being forced to take.
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:09.200]  And also, Alex, I have validated through multiple highway patrols in different states that they're being told they have to be able to redeploy for 30 days.
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:21.200]  You covered that, but even in Montana, that was just initiated last week, and being able to go another state and be basically on their own for 30 days without any resupply.
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:27.200]  It's important that people understand this, so the only hope we have, and this is true, is, first of all,
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:42.200]  and I say this with absolute clarity, people have got to recognize the spiritual nature of this thing and absolutely repent for being apathetic and different and totally caught up with the mundaneness of it.
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  Yeah, people don't care about 51 million abortive babies and say they're not human.
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:53.200]  The New World Order and John P. Holdren, the eugenicists, don't think you have a right to life either.
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:28:00.200]  And later, before you leave, let's get into this huge revelation of the eugenicist, what how science are.
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:07.200]  Steve, what I want to do in the time we have, though, is I want to go point through point with you in the next long segment coming up.
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:10.200]  I want to go over the history of chemical biological testing on the people.
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:12.200]  We know the government's done this before.
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:18.200]  We know in 76 they vaccinated troops at a base that killed them, that started the swine flu epidemic.
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:23.200]  That vaccine killed a bunch of citizens, that's why they had to stop them.
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.200]  2,000 people died, 4,000 people were permanently incapacitated.
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  Well, that's a conservative government number.
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:29.200]  Yeah, I've seen it as high as 10.
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.200]  I can tell you, that's what they admit to.
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:37.200]  The numbers I was told by people in the background said it was 10 times higher and they said they quit reporting it too.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:43.200]  They went into damage control mode where they literally said, Steve, they are burying people faster than they could count them.
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  Well, that's the issues. We have to go through these because when you're saying this, it's all mainstream news.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.200]  When you're saying the points you're making, it's all admitted.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:29:02.200]  When you talk about the fact that there are scores of different indeterminate numbers, I know it's more than 30 or 40.
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:09.200]  Last time I saw the list of test vaccines of live virus being given, that's mainstream news.
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:14.200]  When they admit it's causing incredible adverse reactions, that the virus is now mutating in the body,
[1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:22.200]  that Texas suddenly has five new mutations according to the State Health Department last week caused from the vaccinating.
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:31.200]  They're clearly trying to have this genetically engineered flu virus mutate and it's admittedly manufactured.
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:39.200]  And then on top of it, the flu vaccines they're trying to develop won't cover whatever it's mutated into in the future.
[1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:43.200]  They're designed to initiate it, Alex. They're designed to initiate it.
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:47.200]  They're not defending, they're not protecting, they're initiating it.
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:01.200]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:03.200]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:12.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:17.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:19.200]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:26.200]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:33.200]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration,
[1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:37.200]  reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:02.200]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:09.200]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:12.200]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:36.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.200]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:40.200]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:41.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:44.200]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:52.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:32:52.200 --> 1:33:15.200]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:27.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this whole thing has been skillfully directed.
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:33.200]  The whole thing's been scripted and built and prepared over years.
[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:35.200]  We know that this fluid was manufactured.
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:37.200]  That's now admitted in the lab.
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:41.200]  Top parologists and epidemiologists are on record.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:45.200]  You can just Google anything we're talking about and you'll see the mainstream news on it.
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:49.200]  Why have it just killed a few people in Mexico City and a few people in the U.S.?
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:52.200]  And regular flu kills tens of thousands every year in the U.S.
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:53.200]  So they hype it.
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:57.200]  That was the primer as the pretext in the cover to move the troops in,
[1:33:57.200 --> 1:33:59.200]  move the FEMA Northcom system in.
[1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:02.200]  We told you Northcom was going to forcibly inoculate.
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.200]  That's now seeing in.
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:05.200]  That's now Fox.
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:07.200]  They're openly saying martial law is good.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.200]  Forced inoculations are good.
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:13.200]  Fox News saying, I was just at a Pentagon meeting.
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:17.200]  They're going to lock down the cities and have forced quarantines.
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:20.200]  And then the feds are telling the locals everywhere,
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:23.200]  if one person gets a cold, they shut the school down.
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:24.200]  They act all scared.
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:26.200]  They indoctrinate the kids with fear.
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:32.200]  Right as the inoculation season comes in with public school and school starting.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:36.200]  And I talked to one of my employees who had to go in getting ready for the first days of school.
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:39.200]  And they were like, there's no such thing as a vaccine waiver form.
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:42.200]  She pulled it out and they said, oh, okay, we'll accept that.
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:46.200]  But don't tell anybody about this because they've been told you lose your job.
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:48.200]  If you don't get this stuff in their body.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:54.200]  When the White House science chief wrote a government policy book on how to sterilize you through the vaccines.
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:35:00.200]  Now, this is real.
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:02.200]  We can see that it's staged in a hoax.
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  The question is how bad is it going to be?
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:10.200]  I got a bunch of points I want to go through with Steve Quell of Steve Quell.com.
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:11.200]  We're going to get into Holds Run.
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:18.200]  We're going to take your calls next hour and a lot more, but the phones aren't open yet.
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:25.200]  Steve, you've got a lot of intel, a lot of points to make about the history of this, the preparations, the troop deployments.
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:33.200]  Talk about the intel you've got and worst case scenario, if they think their trial balloon is successful,
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:37.200]  as they test the public, as they test terrorizing the public right now,
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.200]  beating the drum, building up towards October to try to ram through their whole agenda
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:47.200]  while everybody's fearing for their lives under flu lockdown and the government poses as the savior,
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:55.200]  scripting things like a Hollywood script, casting themselves as the saviors as Mighty Mouse coming to the rescue.
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.200]  What is the worst case scenario?
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.200]  What is it the globalist want to get out of this?
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:05.200]  If they think we're going to go along with it, what is your, because you're a guy talking about this in 95,
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:10.200]  writing books about it in 95, 96, laying out exactly what was happening now,
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:17.200]  saying that the flu and other pathogens would be used because it makes everybody guilty
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.200]  and is the perfect cover for a political takeover.
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  Well, absolutely.
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.200]  And first of all, Alex, I believe that it's multiple agendas plural, okay?
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:31.200]  The bottom line is that we're dealing with multiple strains and some of the stuff is very real.
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:32.200]  You asked about the history of it.
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:36.200]  Remember when we had hoof and mouth disease released in Britain?
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:39.200]  Remember when we had the situation with Mad Cow?
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:40.200]  I was on the radio.
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.200]  I was doing hundreds of talk radio shows saying this is an intentional release.
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:46.200]  This didn't just happen.
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:52.200]  Dr. David Kelly, the head of the British Military of the Ministry of Defense's biological weapons program,
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:54.200]  he saw this coming.
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:37:03.200]  There is a book that's been written about all of his previous research that's been sort of held at bay by a British Q-letter,
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:06.200]  meaning you can't publish it because they're claiming it's national security.
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:10.200]  I think if people want to watch what's going to come down in this country,
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.200]  watch what's going down in Britain because now they're claiming 100,000 people a day are going to be infected.
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:19.200]  Listen, there are normal transmission routes and normal transmission vectors,
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:22.200]  the vector being that which carries the pathogen.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:26.200]  The point is that you cannot get what they want to accomplish.
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:30.200]  The Illuminati wants the death of 5.5 billion people.
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:32.200]  We cannot lose track of that.
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:34.200]  They openly talk about it.
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.200]  They've openly stated it.
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:37.200]  You've quoted so many Rockefeller quotes.
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  You've quoted so many New World Order elitist quotes.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:43.200]  But that's what the end game is, okay?
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:45.200]  By the way, Holdren is nicer.
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:52.200]  He doesn't say 90% like Pianca or Bill Gates or Ted Turner.
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:55.200]  He only wants to kill 75% of us.
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:38:00.200]  Right. Well, quick and dirty, that's still close to, you know, excuse me, 4.5 million.
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:02.200]  But isn't that nice of him?
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:08.200]  Well, sure. And see, this is the disconnect, Alex, you know, by lethal injection.
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:10.200]  And here's what people have got to understand.
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:15.200]  And I don't think, I don't know how to communicate any more clearly than this.
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:20.200]  There are multiple strains of genetically altered viruses
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  based on when you're stopped at a roadblock
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:27.200]  and you will be given your stainless steel band with your RFID chip.
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:30.200]  They're checking a data computer instantly.
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:32.200]  So let's say Alex Jones and Steve Gale get touched.
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:34.200]  I mean, listen, they want to shoot us more than vaccines.
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:37.200]  My brother and by the grace of God, they will not succeed.
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:42.200]  But the point is, is that that's where the determination goes.
[1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:46.200]  Listen, it's no longer the blue pill, the red pill, the blue pill.
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:48.200]  It's a red list, the blue list, the green list.
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:52.200]  And what we're talking about, Alex, is multiple, multiple strains
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:55.200]  of some of the most deadly viruses.
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:58.200]  But do you remember when I started talking, you and I started talking those days
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:04.200]  about the Spanish flu being reanimated from the cadavers that were dug up?
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:07.200]  And they now admit part of this has been engineered into it.
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.200]  And they now admit the army is going to give us wristbands and set up checkpoints
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:16.200]  and they're training for the militia to attack it.
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:17.200]  Well, yeah.
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:19.200]  And so, but let me share this.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:21.200]  Nobody believed that.
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:22.200]  I mean, I was laughed at by publishers.
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:24.200]  I'm not going to always be a thing.
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:25.200]  I'm just telling you.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:29.200]  So I published my book, Breathe No Evil, is specifically at that point in history.
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:34.200]  But then following through, the Spanish flu became so important to me
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:39.200]  because I saw the most money that, and according to different people I've talked to,
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:40.200]  you know, here's the thing.
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:43.200]  The bottom line is the who can tell you the what.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:45.200]  The what cannot tell you the who, okay?
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:48.200]  So it's not important who tells you, it's what they tell you.
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:53.200]  And if what they tell you consistently lines up, and that is they want the death of,
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:58.200]  you know, your quoted guy, 4.5 billion, everyone else we quoted 5.5 billion,
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:39:59.200]  how are they going to do that?
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:05.200]  Notice the global pandemic theme when they don't even have a epidemic in most countries.
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:08.200]  Notice the nature of the fear tactics.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.200]  Notice how the press, you just ran through the litany.
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:14.200]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, it is mind control.
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:16.200]  It's neurolinguistic programming.
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  People say, well, if I don't buy, if I don't buy their lie, how will I buy food?
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:23.200]  How will I feed my babies?
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:28.200]  A SWAT team took over a hospital in Kalispell, Montana two weeks ago,
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:33.200]  told they had nurse there that they're getting ready for a total civilian upright.
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:34.200]  This is Montana, Alex.
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:38.200]  I mean, you know, we got cities in Montana, only 50,000 people.
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.200]  Hey, we've had the emergency managers on months before it came out mainstream news.
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:48.200]  My point is everything we say gets confirmed where the police are being trained in every town and city
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:55.200]  for the military, the vets to attack them and to lock up citizens and do this.
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:59.200]  And they're now admitting that they're training for a citizen uprising
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:02.200]  and hardening all the police stations, cops.
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:07.200]  What is it that's so horrible that was planned that they knew to set all this up
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:09.200]  before the flu ever showed up?
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:11.200]  It's premeditated.
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:13.200]  It's a setup.
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:16.200]  It is, and Alex, what I want to share with every law enforcement
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:20.200]  within the sound of our mutual voices, and this thing goes around the world,
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:24.200]  is that when they're done with you, the reason they're telling you to be deployed
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:27.200]  in other states is you're not coming back.
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:31.200]  Thank God in Montana, I know some Texas Highway trolmen are down there.
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:35.200]  You guys call them state troopers or whatever, but they know what the game is.
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:39.200]  How do you say to a patrolman in any state, get ready to leave your state,
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:42.200]  leave your family and children, and we'll take care of them.
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:46.200]  Yeah, right, and go be deployed in some other state because that way
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:49.200]  you can get around your conscience about firing on your own.
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:52.200]  Look, the globalist funded Hitler, they funded Lenin, Stalin, Mao.
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:56.200]  David Rockefeller wrote op-eds in the New York Times praising the 60 million killed.
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:58.200]  It's in my film Endgame.
[1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:00.200]  You cannot make up this magnitude of evil.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:05.200]  Folks, they want to do in America what they did in Germany and Russia and China.
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:07.200]  They are not playing games.
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:10.200]  They want to wipe the middle class out just like Ukraine.
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:12.200]  They mean business.
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:16.200]  Alex, I think the most horrific thing in the last 24 to 48 hours
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:20.200]  is the open statements from the head of Department of Homeland Security,
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:22.200]  or maybe you've carried it on your website.
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:25.200]  I've carried it that they want people to spy on each other.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  Now we get the whole thing that Rush Limbaugh is talking about,
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.200]  and everybody's talking about it.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:33.200]  Gee, they're asking people to turn others in.
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.200]  Where is the disconnect?
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:39.200]  We are in a supercharge on steroids, notification.
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:45.200]  Total destruction, and it pisses me off that people are standing by who have voices
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:47.200]  and shame, shame, shame on you.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:49.200]  The Lord God, I haven't rebuked those of you.
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:52.200]  That could stop this, and you still refuse to do anything about it.
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:54.200]  Let me expand on that. You're right.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:56.200]  Limbaugh is covering it right now.
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:01.200]  The White House confirmed, this is from WhiteHouse.gov,
[1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:05.200]  White House calls for citizens to inform on opponents of Obamacare.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:09.200]  And then in that video, we have the link to the newscast where they're saying,
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:13.200]  the police may arrest you if you criticize him.
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:15.200]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:18.200]  Steve Quayle, I can't even believe this is actually happening.
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:20.200]  I mean, I've known it was coming for years.
[1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:22.200]  I've known it was being set up.
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:27.200]  But I mean, they're really going to try a Soviet-style purge in America,
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:33.200]  and they think they're going to use flu as the cover for it to acclimate everybody.
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:35.200]  How do we stop them, Steve?
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:38.200]  How do we short-circuit this clear sigh-up?
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:41.200]  Well, first of all, information, information, information.
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:45.200]  I would advise everyone to start sending the major networks,
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:47.200]  the listeners to you, listeners to me, major networks,
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:50.200]  saying if they don't stop the propaganda for the notification
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:54.200]  of the destruction of American citizens, everybody has to basically say to you,
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:57.200]  listen, we're your listeners. We're the people that buy your stuff.
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:59.200]  You have to cut them off economically.
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:04.200]  Second of all, the thing is, is that you have to appeal to anybody you know
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:06.200]  and everyone you know to do the same thing.
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:10.200]  Look at Alex. You quoted, I think you were playing where you specter statements
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:12.200]  and the response from the town halls to him and others.
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  People have got to recognize that they have a voice now.
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:19.200]  If they have no voice and choose to remain silent, they're dead.
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:22.200]  You know, the point is, is that it's now or never.
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:25.200]  See, this isn't, and I want to make something clear.
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:30.200]  This is no longer a fake out. This is a total takeout, okay?
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:34.200]  They have, they have done their testing. They've done their beta testing.
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:38.200]  They know, you know, everybody, this is why so many threats are being made.
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:43.200]  This is why people are having real-time surveillance by agents on them.
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:47.200]  This is why, you know, they're so afraid of Obamacare because what is Obamacare?
[1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:49.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll make it easy for you.
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:55.200]  It's euthanasia and it's a total destruction of free will in America to choose your own destiny
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:58.200]  and we are being systematically destroyed.
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:01.200]  By the way, Steve Quayle, that is not your opinion.
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:03.200]  They keep, I mean, I have the bill.
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:06.200]  I've gone over the subsections where it socializes, takes over,
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:08.200]  the government takes more of your check.
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:12.200]  It's like workers' compensation or it's like, you know,
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:17.200]  where employees and employers have to pay in for their unemployment insurance
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:20.200]  and then you never get one-tenth of it.
[1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:23.200]  I mean, they just deny it all. It's like government health care.
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:26.200]  They're going to take a big part of your check now and then you get an aspirin
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:28.200]  when you have a heart attack.
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:34.200]  I mean, this is such a takeover and then Obamacare people are running around
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:36.200]  saying it's lies if you say it.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:42.200]  Meanwhile, Dashiell wrote a book saying if you're above 60, you don't get eye surgery or brain surgery.
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:44.200]  I mean, they really say they're going to ration care.
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:47.200]  It's all eugenics. They talk about it in this book.
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.200]  It's happening in Oregon right now. Oregon will no longer, I think, pay for chemotherapy.
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:55.200]  They're saying they'll fund your assisted suicide.
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:58.200]  And I'm telling people, if you don't believe in assisted suicide,
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:01.200]  well then you better get up to the speed because the point is,
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.200]  is there about ready to assist in your genocide?
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:09.200]  Time Newsweek, they're all, every time I read them, in fact, I have some right here,
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:13.200]  they're promoting euthanasia and how it's beautiful and how it's wonderful.
[1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.200]  But it isn't your right to choose.
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:17.200]  It's the government killing you.
[1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:20.200]  And they have this article I saw, it was either in Time or Newsweek.
[1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:24.200]  Actually, where are those two times in Newsweeks I had in here earlier in the week?
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:26.200]  The point is, they were in my stack. They're gone now.
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:27.200]  Oh, here they are.
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:31.200]  In one of these articles, while I'm interrupting, the point is,
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:35.200]  is that it actually says, well, having the right to die is good,
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:38.200]  but should the government be able to kill you?
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:43.200]  As soon as they get you to the point of, oh, it's beautiful to be able to kill yourself.
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.200]  Next, it's, is it also beautiful for the government to kill you?
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:52.200]  Yeah, why don't you set a good example, all of you guys are promoting it on Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS.
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:57.200]  Listen, they're vomit brokers. People are either going to drown in their stupidity.
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.200]  They're in difference or someone else's cocktail, you know, from hell.
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:05.200]  Oh, look, the Grim Reaper's taking the old person.
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.200]  It talks about how beautiful the death is, how these people committed suicide,
[1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:11.200]  like Romeo and Juliet.
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:14.200]  And then it says, oh, but should the government kill you?
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:19.200]  Because it mentions governments in Northern Europe actually kill the people without them wanting to die.
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:23.200]  And she goes, well, you know, maybe it's reasonable, Steve.
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:30.200]  Yeah, again, Alex, the thing is, is that if people do not turn off their television sets, listen, here's the thing.
[1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:37.200]  Why, and look, it's not, it's not spooky. The whole change to HDTV, okay?
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:42.200]  There are realms of the electromagnetic spectrum, I'll just say this, that people are unaware of.
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:48.200]  There are scientists who were trying to bring this out to the public that are being systematically executed or threatened.
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:49.200]  The thing is, is that-
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.200]  No, I've been to the UT psychology department. They admit, I was there seven years ago,
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:59.200]  with the flicker rate, they have monkeys chained down, and they're practicing how to put us into a mesmerized state.
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:01.200]  That's admitted. That's caught in our TF.
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:04.200]  Yeah, and also with Gwen Towers, G-W-E-N Towers.
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  You see, this is the thing, Alex, that people have got to understand.
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:16.200]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen, troop movements all across the country, tanks, bradlies, humbees with 50 calibers mounted.
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:24.200]  Not just troop movements, they're openly deploying the army for car wrecks, drunk drivers, counties don't have money.
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:26.200]  I mean, they're openly taking over.
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:31.200]  And that's the thing that people- you know, forgive me, Alex, martial law is in effect right now.
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:37.200]  It is. No, no, it's in effect right now, exactly as I've said for years, and you've said, the feds were going to bankrupt the states,
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:46.200]  and then they'd say, oh, from Schenectady, New York, to Birmingham, Alabama, oh, the army's here now, the feds will take over. It's happening.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:55.200]  Right, and I want to share something. The most troubling thing that I know as a French general is just appointed ahead of the NATO troops for the United States.
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:00.200]  You know, we've caught a lot of crap from a lot of skeptics, those scornful, you know, wicked people over the years,
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:07.200]  but now isn't it amazing that a French general is appointed head over the NATO troops of the United States?
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:15.200]  There are reports, Alex, coming from the field, even U.S. military, career officers, I have others saying, we have these foreign observers.
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:18.200]  You know what I tell them? Guess what the foreign observers are there to do?
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:24.200]  They're not just to watch effectively how you do your job. If you fail to do your job, they whack you.
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.200]  And see people say, well, that can happen in America.
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:33.200]  No, that's infra-guard. That's the 56,000 infrastructure protection officers. It's all admitted.
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:43.200]  Right, so I hope that people understand this. In other words, there are foreign military officers, flash assassins, assigned to different units of U.S. military,
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:50.200]  that should any of the U.S. military fail for conscience, fear of God, fear of the Lord, whatever concern for their own families,
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:54.200]  they will be, you know, targeted, executed. It's like the SS.
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  That's what Hitler originally set the SS up for, was to make sure that his troops fell in line.
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:04.200]  Now we have... Steve. We have triple S. We have steroids.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:09.200]  Oh, my God. Look, look, I want to go through flu issues and then take calls.
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.200]  I want to go through the eugenics. I haven't gotten your take on Holdren.
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:18.200]  He is in the Associated Press and Wall Street Journal calling for terraforming the planet.
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:25.200]  We know they're engineering the droughts to starve out the third world, which they propose in their own publications.
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:33.200]  Now he's in the mainstream news saying, oh, they want to weather control, but to help you, they're being forced to admit this because we've been exposing them.
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:39.200]  I want to talk about how you see this unfolding first, though, in October and November,
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:45.200]  and how they're going to use this flu fear mongering as the pretext to get their whole agenda through.
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:48.200]  Steve Quill is our guest. Stevequill.com. I'm Alex Jones.

[1:52:21.200 --> 1:52:25.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:34.200]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:37.200]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:44.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:22.200]  Stay with us for that.
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:37.200]  Steve Quill will be back next Wednesday again same time to give us the latest updates and developments as we track and cover the flu situation with massive troop movements, open announcements of martial law, open announcements of quarantine force inoculations.
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:42.200]  For a non-event, this flu is nothing. So what are they planning?
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:45.200]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio. Tim, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:54.200]  Yesterday while monitoring the cable news feeds, I came across the anchor in his bimbo babe down playing the textbook by Mr. Holdren.
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:55:02.200]  And it was obvious they were like taking part in these interspersal techniques. Now Steve, earlier you had mentioned neolinguistics.
[2:55:02.200 --> 2:55:10.200]  And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how they use that neolinguistics to create the neural pathways in the brain at the Hegelian dialectic level.
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:16.200]  Yeah, well they teach a massive programming. Steve, thanks for the call, caller.
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:18.200]  Do you want me to answer that, Alex? Yes, go ahead.
[2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:45.200]  Well, really, simply, you tell the lie, you tell it enough time, you tell it a big enough lie, and pretty soon people basically, because thinking does require some effort, neuralinguistic programming just means that on the referencing of keywords over and over and over, all the subliminal orders, if you will, or subliminal directions are automatically going to bypass your reasoning process
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:56.200]  and you're just going to jump from A to B, real simple, flu vaccine, flu vaccine, flu vaccine, images, flu, people dying of flu, oh, this is the most horrible flu, images found, everything flu, flu, flu.
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:00.200]  What's the NLP answer vaccine?
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:23.200]  Yeah, I should have kept the caller on asking what they were saying, but they've had national publications attack me saying Holden didn't write this book and didn't say it. We have the book. This guy wrote a whole bunch of books with Erlich, who was Bush Seniors Advisor, saying forced drugging, forced sterilization, have the CPS take your kids at birth, and England's now doing it.
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:34.200]  Well, everything, that's why Alex, the last thing I got to get through to everybody today is they've got to watch England. England will be the stepping stone or diving board to telling us what's going to happen.
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:41.200]  Should there be a nuclear incident in London, which I still believe there's going to be, then you can bet your bottom dollar will have one here too.
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  So if people have got to be open to everything, and for the record, this situation with Russia is not a lightweight deal. Behind back channels, if the United States goes to war with Iran, the Russians have already put us on notice.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:56:57.200]  Well, go ahead.
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:57:08.200]  I'm telling you, listen, doesn't matter what I think, doesn't matter what you think, I'm telling you that the Russians, whether people believe there's still a threat or not, the point is that they've already let it be known.
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:14.200]  And the fact that they have contempt for the current president of the United States is an understatement.
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:23.200]  All right, well, Steve Quill next week, we'll get into false flags, stage terror, we'll see what else they may mix in with this whole bird flu hype that they're pushing.
[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:31.200]  You were there years ago saying that this is one of their favorite moves. You were there early in the year before April even came up, so was I.
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:38.200]  We could see the buildup, the movement towards this and Steve Quill dot com. Steve Quill, we'll talk to you again next Wednesday.
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:40.200]  Thank you, Alex. God bless you. Bye bye.
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:41.200]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:41.200 --> 2:57:47.200]  We're going to go to break here in about one minute. We do have Congressman Ron Paul for 30 minutes while Congress is in recess.
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.200]  We really appreciate him giving us this time. I want to go over the in the Fed legislation.
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:54.200]  I want to go over the flu hype.
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:57:58.200]  He's a medical doctor who spoke out against it as a fraud in 76.
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:01.200]  He's on record there on video.
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:05.200]  I want to go over the economy, China and others moving away from T bills.
[2:58:05.200 --> 2:58:19.200]  I want to go over just the basically what's happening in the world and our resistance to that as more and more people run on the campaign for Liberty Banner like his son, Rand Paul for Senate and getting behind that.
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:30.200]  So 30 minutes with the one, the only Congressman Ron Paul on the other side of this quick break as we blast out on the MNFM dial sample cast on global shortwave XM.
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:35.200]  And of course, prisonplanet.tv. Stay with us.
[2:58:35.200 --> 2:58:48.200]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[2:58:48.200 --> 2:58:51.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:56.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:58:56.200 --> 2:59:02.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:02.200 --> 2:59:09.200]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:14.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:19.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:23.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:29.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:59:29.200 --> 2:59:35.200]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:59:35.200 --> 3:00:01.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:00:01.200 --> 3:00:10.200]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:19.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:33.200]  Well, I really appreciate him coming on. We've been having a lively discussion. Dr. Henry L. Nyman, highly recommended, prestigious researcher and vener.
[3:00:33.200 --> 3:00:40.200]  Many of the major technologies used today in researching all this and treating it. I hope he's wrong, though.
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:44.200]  I mean, I don't want this to be a real deadly flu. I mean, I know it's deadly for those that are being dying,
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:53.200]  but you've got the flu season raging right now and a few thousand dead, or 1,700 and something. That doesn't sound like a big deal to me,
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:01:01.200]  but he's saying it could mutate. So are you saying, doctor, it's bad now or it could be potentially mega-bad?
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:04.200]  I mean, I just want to be clear on that.
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:15.200]  Let me explain why it's bad now and why it could get much worse. Seasonal flu. You know, the number thrown out is 36,000 and the United States die.
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:23.200]  90% of the people that die from the flu in the United States and worldwide are 65 years or older.
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:28.200]  Most of those people are actually quite a bit more than 65. They're a nursing home.
[3:01:28.200 --> 3:01:34.200]  They basically have very serious illnesses. They get the flu and the flu kind of puts it over the top.
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:38.200]  They really can't mutate good response to the flu.
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:39.200]  They're compromised.
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:44.200]  Right. They're compromised in many ways, and that's who normally dies from the flu.
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:56.200]  The people that are dying from the flu today, those 1,000 people that died in Argentina, they are previously healthy young adults.
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.200]  So, I mean, is this like the 1918 then that it has that hemorrhagic effect?
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:10.200]  Yeah. I mean, there are reports actually. I was just reading what I was trying to find out where it was, where patients actually turned blue overnight and died.
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:15.200]  Those are the characteristics of 1918.
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:23.200]  There's this diagnosis. Basically, the person literally turns blue and ends up dying suddenly.
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:31.200]  There are reports in 1918 of people that basically were sitting down and playing bridge, and they literally fell over and died at the bridge table.
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:34.200]  Yeah, no, because it has this huge autoimmune response.
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:35.200]  Right, right.
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:37.200]  But doctor, doctor.
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:42.200]  And here's why that's a problem for this year, okay?
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:48.200]  Because the virus is adapting, so it really doesn't take a whole lot of time.
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:53.200]  The virus is actually growing at twice the rate that it is right now.
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:58.200]  It's going to elicit a much greater autoimmune response.
[3:02:58.200 --> 3:02:59.200]  Oh, God.
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:10.200]  It's going to grow quickly, and people are going to respond to it, and that's this cytokine storm, that's this cascade, and that's why people end up dying.
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:14.200]  Okay, let me just stop because we're almost out of time. It's clear I've got to have you back up. I'm very appreciative of your time.
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:20.200]  I hope you're wrong because, you know, I got family, and I live here in Texas.
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  It seems to be one of the epicenters for all of this, and I don't trust these vaccines.
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:30.200]  I've seen what their history, what they do, and this whole thing has stage written all over it.
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:32.200]  I know you don't get into areas like that.
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:40.200]  You just cover the facts that you can document, but I've had a bad feeling all along for the last year in the buildup to this.
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:46.200]  And are you saying, Doc, with your educated opinion, you've got a bad feeling about this year?
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  Yes. I've said it looks like 1918 for the last several months, and there has been nothing in the last several months to take it off the 1918 track.
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:56.200]  My God.
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:04:00.200]  It was tracking then, following the exact same track right now.
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  In Texas, you know, there's likely to be cami flu resistance in Texas.
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:10.200]  There was a report that came out a day or so ago on the border.
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:13.200]  Yeah, Houston Chronicle. There's now, you know...
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:19.200]  And that indicated there were several versions that had cami flu resistance.
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:25.200]  There's a sequence that just came out that actually isn't even, it's only semi-public.
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:32.200]  They showed cami flu resistance in Singapore, and that's going to create another problem that we can talk about next time around.
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:35.200]  Well, Dr. Nyman, let me get you up then in the next few weeks as this unfolds.
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:39.200]  When do you see it quickly, really starting to break out then, October?
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:43.200]  I would say, yeah. You'll see the first time in September, October.
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  You know, in the Northern Hemisphere. I think it will get worse in the Southern Hemisphere before that.
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  All right, Dr. Nyman, the flu tracker. Just Google that. You'll find him. Thank you, sir.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:54.200]  Okay. Good talking to you.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:56.200]  Well, that's scary.
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:01.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:05:01.200 --> 3:05:03.200]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:12.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:05:12.200 --> 3:05:17.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:05:17.200 --> 3:05:19.200]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:05:19.200 --> 3:05:26.200]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:03.200]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:07.200]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:06:07.200 --> 3:06:12.200]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[3:07:57.200 --> 3:08:04.200]  Okay, Mark, so I could start with you. What is it about Goldman Sachs? How does the government should turn the figures around like that?
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:08.200]  Well, Goldman Sachs are scum. I mean, that's the bottom line.
[3:08:08.200 --> 3:08:15.200]  They basically have co-opted the U.S. government, they've co-opted the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve functionality.
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:26.200]  They've co-opted the Obama administration, Barack Obama dances to Goldman Sachs' tune, and they are really crooked and abominable in what they've done.
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:38.200]  You just remember, Hank Paulson held the Congress hostage to come in the back room and said, give us $700 billion, we're going to crash this market.
[3:08:38.200 --> 3:08:45.200]  Well, joining us for the rest of the hour, maybe twist his arm a little bit into the next, take some phone calls, is Max Kaiser.
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:55.200]  He's a former Wall Street broker and is the inventor of the virtual specialist technology, prediction markets, Hollywood Stock Exchange, a bunch of other systems.
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:09:00.200]  In my private film, Max is currently a TV presenter, radio host, entrepreneur, broadcast journalist.
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:04.200]  He's the host of On the Edge with Max Kaiser on Press TV.
[3:09:04.200 --> 3:09:08.200]  He's also done a BBC show called The Oracle, blogger for The Huffington Post.
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:13.200]  Max also presented the films for Al Jazeera. He joins us from Paris, France.
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:21.200]  And he's also a little bit in the new Obama film that I will soon announce the name of by, I'll announce it by next Wednesday.
[3:09:21.200 --> 3:09:28.200]  But I quit procrastinating and get to doing that. You just heard me play a clip of him on national main French television.
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:33.200]  We're going to play another clip of something coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:43.200]  This is your chance to have financial questions. We're going to clear the board of calls, fresh calls specifically for Max Kaiser on the economy, on the police state.
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:49.200]  But Max, let me throw you a curveball before we get into Goldman Sachs and all this out of the gates here.
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:10:02.200]  It's a curveball. It's a knuckleball. But seriously, the flu situation, troops everywhere, mass graves, they denied it a year ago.
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:09.200]  Now they admit it, forced inoculations, talks of lockdown, only less than 2,000 dead worldwide.
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:13.200]  They are really hyping this thing, really trying to scare people.
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:23.200]  This looks like, to me, the perfect cover to get their carbon tax through, to get their open borders through their gun control, their government health care that they're trying to push through in October.
[3:10:23.200 --> 3:10:29.200]  What does Max Kaiser's Spidey sense tell him?
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:43.200]  Well, I'm all about the banking and finance systems. That's what I cover as far as the whole swine flu epidemic.
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:52.200]  I'm an idiot because I go to the junk store every day and I buy stuff for your hands that disrespect my hands.
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:11:03.200]  Of course, I was laughing at those people a year ago, but it's a herd mentality. How much do they charge $8 for a squirt of that stuff over here?
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:07.200]  Think of the profits that are being generated. It's all herd mentality.
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:23.200]  I go to these meat friends and they're sharing these things, little antiseptic gel. It's pathetic. You fall into the behavior that is inculcated through this massive wave of scare tactics.
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:26.200]  Everything can be sold using scare tactics now. They figured that out.
[3:11:26.200 --> 3:11:37.200]  Shock and awe, 9-11. If you scare enough people, they can scare you into buying anything now. Why bother coming up with a creative campaign to sell stuff?
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:41.200]  Why don't you show people getting blown up and then you'll sell a truckload of whatever it is you're trying to sell.
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:52.200]  It's all salesmanship. It's like just basically infomercials for psychosis and mass destruction and they'll sell anything down the pike.
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:12:01.200]  I want to talk about Goldman Sachs for a second because it's just gotten so hilarious. It's gotten ridiculous. It's gotten absurd.
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:03.200]  That's okay by you.
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:10.200]  Let's get into $23.7 trillion missing in 10 months. They're refusing to say where the money went.
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:18.200]  Paulson gets up before Congress last week and says, yeah, I took $200 million myself. That's not a conflict of money he gave himself.
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:24.200]  I mean, this is a new level of heist. You're an expert in all this. Break it down for us.
[3:12:24.200 --> 3:12:29.200]  And then I want to get into, they say the economy's fixed. Everything's wonderful. The stock market's going up.
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:38.200]  But housing at all time low. Reuters reporting that half of U.S. mortgages seen underwater by 2011.
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:42.200]  Record joblessness. All of that is degrading quickly.
[3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:48.200]  But they're meanwhile saying Marie Antoinette let them all eat birthday cake.
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:56.200]  Let's just talk about a couple of things here. One, I don't know if you saw this or not. The high frequency trading scandal.
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:13:00.200]  High frequency trading, which is now being talked about and watching.
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:03.200]  That's a special little computer. Tell us about that.
[3:13:03.200 --> 3:13:07.200]  Yeah, this is really amazing. Now, just to give you an analogy here.
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:14.200]  If you go into, if you saw somebody, your neighbor, and they had a rubber hose in your neighbor's gas tank,
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:22.200]  and he had that hose that was over a bucket, and he was stealing gas from your, you know, you would say, hey, buddy,
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:27.200]  you know, don't steal our neighbor's gas. That's not very nice. That's not very social behavior.
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:34.200]  He's siphoning off gas, right? Basically, and it happens, they don't even argue. They don't deny this.
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:40.200]  Goldman Sachs over at 85 Broad Street is where they have their headquarters down there on Wall Street.
[3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:48.200]  They co-located a server next to the New York Stock Exchange, and they used this high frequency trading to siphon off,
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.200]  depending on whose estimate you read, between $100 million and $200 million a day.
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:56.200]  They're just siphoning gas directly off the floor of the exchange.
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:02.200]  And that's what we know of with a computer program plugged in secretly rigging the market.
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:10.200]  But that's okay, because they're allowed to give themselves the bonus money while their former executives are the Treasury Sec.
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:16.200]  They claim that they're, quote, unquote, adding liquidity to the system.
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:22.200]  So if you caught a guy siphoning gas from a car, and his defense was, no, I'm adding gas to the car.
[3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:30.200]  So they say, hey, Goldman, you're siphoning money from the floor of the exchange using high frequency trading,
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:34.200]  using all this proprietary algorithms, which I know a lot about,
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:40.200]  because I created the virtual specialist technologies used to trade bonds by Cantor Fitzgerald on Wall Street.
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:44.200]  It's used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange to trade box office features, and I designed these systems.
[3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:49.200]  So I know all about these systems, and it's basically something more than siphoning off cash.
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:54.200]  And Barney Frank says, oh, a little profit tiering is okay.
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:14:57.200]  We need the banks on Wall Street to have a little profit tiering,
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:01.200]  because, after all, if the banks aren't healthy, the economy is not healthy.
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:07.200]  So the entire economy, 23.7 trillion of our money that we have to pay interest to them on.
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:10.200]  Oh, here's our money, and we pay you interest to take our money.
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:16.200]  Then it turns out the Fed is paying banks not the loan, because they want to consolidate and blow out the economy.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:17.200]  Is there no end?
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  I mean, will Geithner soon be barbecuing children on his lawn, and we say, well, he's got to eat?
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  The economy will collapse if we don't feed him our children.
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:28.200]  In fact, let me ask you that question.
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:34.200]  Why is he in the Wall Street Journal and other pub papers screaming and cussing and yelling at Bernanke and freaking out?
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:37.200]  Are they scared of the auditing the Fed?
[3:15:37.200 --> 3:15:40.200]  I mean, Bernanke suddenly on TV stuttering and bumbling.
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:45.200]  These omnipresent Mount Olympus elites are now coming and groveling.
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  I mean, are we seeing the momentum shift against their criminal activity?
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:56.200]  He's upset because now that he works for the government, his life for the bonus pool is smaller.
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:15:59.200]  He's upset that he's got to give him more money.
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:05.200]  He's upset he can't sell his house in large modern New York, which, by the way, his house in large one is less than a mile
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:08.200]  than where I grew up in Westchester County.
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:11.200]  I used to ride my bicycle by his house all the time.
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:15.200]  He's upset he can't sell his house because of the economic problems that he himself helped create.
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:22.200]  And now that Paulson successfully ransomed the government for $700 billion, which became $13 trillion,
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  he's now paying himself. He's working with the Chinese to manage their money.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:27.200]  He's going to make billions again.
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:29.200]  When he took the job for the government, of course, he said,
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:34.200]  well, I had to sell my Goldman Stocks stock close to its all-time high.
[3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:37.200]  By the way, because I'm working for the government, I don't pay taxes on that game.
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:42.200]  So his whole role as a servant for the government was a tax dodge.
[3:16:42.200 --> 3:16:49.200]  Paulson was just a tax dodger. He saved something like $100 million in taxes by taking that job,
[3:16:49.200 --> 3:16:54.200]  worked for a couple of years, engineered the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns,
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:58.200]  took away all the competition from Goldman and JPMorgan and his crony buddies,
[3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:02.200]  and got rid of his arch enemy Dick Fould over Lehman Brothers.
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:04.200]  It was nothing but a grudge match between those two.
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:07.200]  They could have easily, Alex, this is the tragedy of it.
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:13.200]  Going back to what I call the 9th of August or 8-9, which is right up there with 9-11,
[3:17:13.200 --> 3:17:20.200]  two years ago, the 9th of August, two years ago in 2007 is when BNP and Paris said that
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:24.200]  they couldn't value the subprime bonds on their books,
[3:17:24.200 --> 3:17:29.200]  and that started what we call the credit crash for the next 24 months.
[3:17:29.200 --> 3:17:32.200]  The response from the government was not to reform the banking system,
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:36.200]  but to give them now what we know to be roughly $13 trillion.
[3:17:36.200 --> 3:17:39.200]  And according to guys like Carl Denninger, who's a very plugged-in guy,
[3:17:39.200 --> 3:17:41.200]  that number is going to double again.
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:45.200]  And the tragedy is that they could have very easily wiped out every mortgage debt
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:49.200]  and every credit card debt in America for less than that money.
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:53.200]  Well, yeah, I mean, Bloomberg reported $9.4 trillion would pay off all mortgages,
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:59.200]  not just bad mortgages, but $50 million palaces, $100,000 bungalows.
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:03.200]  Everything paid off, but now you're saying $13 trillion.
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:07.200]  The Congress and the banks are saying $23.7 trillion.
[3:18:07.200 --> 3:18:09.200]  But I guess that's different types of money they created,
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:15.200]  and that's not counting all the magical SDRs and these other layers of global currency.
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:19.200]  Yeah, but okay, but get back to this point, because it's a very important point.
[3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:22.200]  Every single mortgage in America could have been paid off.
[3:18:22.200 --> 3:18:25.200]  Every single credit card debt could have been paid off.
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:30.200]  So therefore, any citizen in America could be sitting there with no debts at all.
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:33.200]  And at their credit card, they'd be in the mall shopping.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:36.200]  The economy is 70% consumption anyway, so the economy would be growing.
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:39.200]  The jobs would be growing, not collapsing.
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:41.200]  The banks would actually be still making some money,
[3:18:41.200 --> 3:18:43.200]  because they're still in the business of making loans.
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:47.200]  The world you'd have left are these incredible black hole of debt,
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:50.200]  which would have to be addressed, and the way to address that
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:54.200]  would have been to force the banks to write off those debts in real time
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:57.200]  and suffer the consequences, because they created those debts.
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:00.200]  So instead of Warren Buffett, who's now saying,
[3:19:00.200 --> 3:19:02.200]  I'm going to have to block Buster Quarter in my life,
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:06.200]  because 75% of his business is trying to get bailed out by the government,
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:11.200]  it's his stock going from $70,000 a share back to $100,000 a share
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  back to $147,000 a share.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:17.200]  If you want to buy one share of Berkshire Hathaway Stock,
[3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:20.200]  Warren Buffett, and be part of the global elite,
[3:19:20.200 --> 3:19:25.200]  you need $147,000 to buy one, and you're right, that's $100,000.
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:29.200]  Well, I was reading that he got $98 billion in bailout money.
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:35.200]  Unless you have $100,000 to buy one share of Berkshire Hathaway Stock
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:37.200]  of Warren Buffett, then you forget it.
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:38.200]  You're not part.
[3:19:38.200 --> 3:19:42.200]  You're not going to be part of the true economy that's run by all these insiders.
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:46.200]  So you're sitting there holding your 50 shares of some over-the-counter
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:51.200]  NASDAQ.com bomb that was sold to you by some hard-selling telephone salesman
[3:19:51.200 --> 3:19:52.200]  working on commissions.
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:55.200]  Of course, that's going to go to zero, and the whole cycle is repeated.
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:19:56.200]  Matt, stay there.
[3:19:56.200 --> 3:19:58.200]  Buffett deserves all the money.
[3:19:58.200 --> 3:20:01.200]  Did you know that millionaire entrepreneur, businessman,
[3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:04.200]  and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles,
[3:20:04.200 --> 3:20:07.200]  wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[3:20:07.200 --> 3:20:10.200]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[3:20:10.200 --> 3:20:12.200]  This book is for you.
[3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:15.200]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth,
[3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:17.200]  and it's called Here's What You Do.
[3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:21.200]  You can buy it for only $6 at Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[3:20:21.200 --> 3:20:23.200]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[3:20:23.200 --> 3:20:26.200]  Again, Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[3:20:26.200 --> 3:20:27.200]  Buy it today.
[3:20:27.200 --> 3:20:29.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:31.200]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:33.200]  won't talk about gold IRAs?
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:36.200]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry
[3:20:36.200 --> 3:20:39.200]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[3:20:39.200 --> 3:20:42.200]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:47.200]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:51.200]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:53.200]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:20:53.200 --> 3:20:58.200]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:00.200]  Hi, John Huebner from Mitus Resources.
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:03.200]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:06.200]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:09.200]  is creating in excess of $20 billion a week,
[3:21:09.200 --> 3:21:12.200]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:16.200]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:20.200]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:22.200]  How much are you willing to lose?
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:28.200]  Take action now. Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:32.200]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[3:21:32.200 --> 3:21:35.200]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:42.200]  have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[3:21:42.200 --> 3:21:48.200]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:50.200]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[3:21:50.200 --> 3:21:57.200]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[3:21:57.200 --> 3:22:04.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:11.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:18.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:22:18.200 --> 3:22:22.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:22:22.200 --> 3:22:27.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:22:27.200 --> 3:22:34.200]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:37.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:44.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:01.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:07.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:12.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:23:12.200 --> 3:23:16.200]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:19.200]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:24.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:29.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:33.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:42.200]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:23:42.200 --> 3:23:49.200]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:23:49.200 --> 3:24:00.200]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:29.200]  Joining us from Paris is Max Kaiser.com. He is in my big new upcoming Obama film.
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:36.200]  Max, you got cut off there by the break. Obama's approval ratings gone from the mid-80s to now the mid-40s
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:41.200]  depending on which poll you look at. He's now lower than Bush, lower than Jimmy Carter,
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  than they were at this point seven months into their administration.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:51.200]  What do you see happening to Obama over the next few years? I'm almost feeling sorry for him now
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  because when he's this big star and they're pushing the corporate agenda through on him,
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:02.200]  he's dangerous and I had to oppose him and I still do. But now that everything's being blamed on him
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:07.200]  he almost becomes a shield for the bankers.
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:12.200]  He needs to do a guide and a rectum.
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:16.200]  Look at Tony Blair over there in the UK. When he left number 10 Downing Street,
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:22.200]  after all the dodgy dossier, after all the fake rhetoric leading up to the invasion,
[3:25:22.200 --> 3:25:27.200]  after telling the 2 million people that were in the streets in Britain that they didn't want to get into the Iraq war,
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:33.200]  within 10 minutes of leaving number 10 Downing Street in disgrace, where does he end up? JPMorgan.
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:40.200]  The presidency is now used as a resume sweetener. So whether it's one term or two terms,
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:44.200]  the next step for Obama is Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan. And that's the true end game.
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:49.200]  That's the goal for these guys. That's where they cash in. The presidency is just a fancy thing on your resume now.
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:53.200]  It doesn't mean anything in terms of public service anymore.
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:57.200]  Well, it means you can read off a teleprompter good. That's why Bush was so hated,
[3:25:57.200 --> 3:26:01.200]  is that he couldn't sit there with puppy-dog eyes lovingly lying to you.
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:06.200]  But you know, you arrive at the Huffington Post, you deal with some of the classical type liberals out there.
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:11.200]  It seems a lot of them are starting to wake up those that are honest, like yourself, who had supported Obama.
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:19.200]  But then when you talk to other Democrats or progressives or whatever, they just scream you're a racist.
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:28.200]  Like they're now saying that the archetypal poster of Obama socialism, we've changed it to Obama fascism,
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:35.200]  because we believe that's closer to what it actually is. They're now saying that's racist when it has nothing to do with race.
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:39.200]  This parroting race, race, race over and over again isn't working.
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:44.200]  The media is also trying to claim it's partisan, so the establishment's throwing Democrats under the bus,
[3:26:44.200 --> 3:26:50.200]  or under the train trying to say all these congressmen getting shouted down at town halls or only Democrats.
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  I've tracked it. They're shouting the Republicans down too.
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:27:00.200]  So this is something completely new. It looks like the United States is on the verge of revolution, Max Geyser.
[3:27:00.200 --> 3:27:09.200]  Well, we've been saying this for a few years that the wealth and income gap is getting wider and wider.
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:14.200]  The amount of wealth controlled by the top 1% is just getting wider and wider.
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:22.200]  The past six months and the past two years has been nothing more than the Wall Street banks and other banks around the world
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:28.200]  and the central banks getting together and grabbing more power and more wealth.
[3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  There was a New York Times story, I think it was today or yesterday, where Lloyd Blankfein, the new CEO of Goldman Sachs,
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:40.200]  was saying, what crisis? There was no crisis. We were never in jeopardy. We're just smart.
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:45.200]  We're doing business like we've always done it. Here's the thing about the stock market rally.
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  All that money that goes into the stock market rally, the $3 trillion rally,
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  that money is not coming from the money market funds, which would be an indication that the public is involved in the stock market.
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:05.200]  This money is coming from the bailout funds and it's being not used to lend to businessmen and people in America
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:11.200]  to help them get through this crisis. It's being used as speculative capital by the banks to make money in the stock market.
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:17.200]  And once this rally, which is fed by this spec money, the bailout money is being used by the speculators on Wall Street
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:22.200]  to speculate the stock market. It caught everyone flat footed. It took 50% or something like this.
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:27.200]  This is the biggest rally since the 1930s. Oh, by the way, that's very significant if you want to think about it.
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:35.200]  And now that you've got this CNBC and Jim Kramer now pounding the table, they're going to sit just another sucker's rally
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:40.200]  where they're going to come in. People are going to be buying this thing again and they're going to be buying it at the top again.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  And they're going to be asking for a bailout again in another six months to the cycle repeats itself.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:51.200]  Nobody ever learns anything because if you have a rising stock market, it tends to cloud people's thinking.
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:56.200]  They're willing to overlook everything and anything if they think they can buy a winning lottery ticket.
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:28:59.200]  People just ignore their own self-interest and they go loopy.
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:05.200]  They add the drugs, the antidepressants, and the failure to have a decent diet.
[3:29:05.200 --> 3:29:11.200]  And you just have a sick zombie nation of speculators who are trying to be the next partner of Goldman Sachs
[3:29:11.200 --> 3:29:15.200]  and the chances of that are like being the next winner on American Idol.
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:24.200]  You called that the casino gulag model and I concur with you 100%.
[3:29:24.200 --> 3:29:29.200]  They're taking all the tens of trillions they're stolen from taxpayers, pumping it in in a controlled stock market.
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:32.200]  They'll know when to pull it, probably when it hits 12,000.
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:40.200]  Let's see how the suckers rally is going to work from the insider, the inventor of major stock exchange systems, Max Kaiser.
[3:29:40.200 --> 3:29:48.200]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com. You can get your Obama Hitler t-shirts at infowars.
[3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:52.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:03.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[3:30:03.200 --> 3:30:07.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:13.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:18.200]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:25.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:25.200 --> 3:30:28.200]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storms season is here again.
[3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:32.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:36.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:42.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[3:30:42.200 --> 3:30:48.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:30:57.200 --> 3:31:02.200]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well, you should.
[3:31:02.200 --> 3:31:07.200]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right.
[3:31:07.200 --> 3:31:13.200]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[3:31:13.200 --> 3:31:17.200]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:24.200]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:31.200]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:31:31.200 --> 3:31:37.200]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:45.200]  This is real. Don't miss out. Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit

[3:31:58.200 --> 3:32:01.200]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[3:32:01.200 --> 3:32:07.200]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:32:07.200 --> 3:32:12.200]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:17.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:23.200]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucus membranes.
[3:32:23.200 --> 3:32:29.200]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap. All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:58.200]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[3:32:58.200 --> 3:33:03.200]  Mike, so what's to make of this decision by BNP to pay out these bonuses?
[3:33:03.200 --> 3:33:05.200]  Echoes of the Goldman Sachs last month?
[3:33:05.200 --> 3:33:11.200]  Well, I think BNP wants us all basically to toss their salad. That's their game plan.
[3:33:11.200 --> 3:33:19.200]  Let's keep in mind that two years ago on August 9th was the beginning of a staged, controlled, financial, terrorist demolition
[3:33:19.200 --> 3:33:26.200]  of the world's financial system when BNP announced that they couldn't value bonds in their books, the subprime loans.
[3:33:26.200 --> 3:33:30.200]  That started the credit crash, the controlled demolition of the global banking system two years ago.
[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:37.200]  This is, we'll go down in history, as basically the 9th of August or 8th, 9, similar to 9-11.
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:40.200]  This is when they started this controlled demolition.
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:47.200]  That's Max Kaiser on the main National News channel in France.
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:52.200]  He's got a show on Press TV, starting a show on Russia Today, huge worldwide.
[3:33:52.200 --> 3:33:55.200]  Paul Watson has that on his broadcast TV in Sheffield.
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:33:58.200]  Give you an idea how big Russia today is.
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:03.200]  And he's also done the BBC TV show, a very busy person.
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:07.200]  I'm going to be on this week's Press TV show with him, so always honored to be there.
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:11.200]  Before we go back to Max Kaiser and ask about his upcoming TV appearances,
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:14.200]  he'll be with us 20 minutes into the next hour, starting next segment.
[3:34:14.200 --> 3:34:21.200]  We're going to take phone calls for Max Kaiser at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:23.200]  He could talk about a whole host of issues.
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:26.200]  But he can't talk about chubacabras and stuff like that.
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the t-shirt being made right now.
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:34.200]  I had the idea Monday to, when I noticed that that image of Obama socialism was going viral,
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:43.200]  I knew that it was a hot image because it just took him and really bared his soul
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:45.200]  and broke the back.
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:47.200]  It was ready to be broken.
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:49.200]  This illusion of him is this sweetheart that loves you.
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:53.200]  And I think the image of him as a psychopathic criminal is much closer to the reality.
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:55.200]  But again, he's just a front man.
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:57.200]  So we made these t-shirts. They're selling like hotcakes.
[3:34:57.200 --> 3:35:01.200]  I'm very glad I'll get the word out because they have good messages on the back.
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:06.200]  They have very, very important messages on the back, like, wake up before it's too late,
[3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:08.200]  stop the criminal in the fad.
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:10.200]  There's eight different t-shirts, eight different variants.
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:15.200]  Obama fascism, ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama New World Order.
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:21.200]  And I'm sending a crew out right now to make a viral YouTube video where I'm going to have my crew plaster
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:25.200]  BarackObamaInfoWars.com posters everywhere.
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:27.200]  We're having a $1,000 prize.
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:29.200]  I'll announce it next Friday.
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:33.200]  You just make a YouTube video, you go out, make a bigger poster, smaller poster,
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:36.200]  and you just say ObamaInfoWars.com.
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:39.200]  You can mix in a little Obama fascism because I think that's closer to what he is.
[3:35:39.200 --> 3:35:43.200]  Socialism is bad enough as if we're going to take money from one group and give it to another.
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:49.200]  But this is $30 for the bank, $1 for the people as Max Kaiser and others are broken down.
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:56.200]  So we're going to have this contest launching today up on infowars.com to print off the flyers
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:35:59.200]  on the Joker Obama posters to go viral page.
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:03.200]  That's the name of the page that has all these files.
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:05.200]  You can print off in color, black and white.
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:06.200]  I don't care.
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:12.200]  The winner will be the person that the most inventively puts out the most posters in the most public places.
[3:36:12.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  So just show that in a 10 minute or less YouTube video.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:17.200]  Everybody make them.
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:18.200]  The word gets out.
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:19.200]  Huge viral event.
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:26.200]  And let's start today with the Obama poster bomb all over the country everywhere.
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:28.200]  I'm going to work on films today, do some interviews.
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:31.200]  Then I'm going to go home and see my children when I'm driving back tonight.
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:37.200]  I'm going to get out with staplers and glue at different power boxes and poles.
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:39.200]  And I'm going to put up at least 10 of these.
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  So, you know, walk to walk.
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:45.200]  I certainly talk to talk also walk to walk.
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  So get these off infowars.com.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:48.200]  Get them out to everybody.
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:52.200]  And don't forget we're also selling the t-shirts because they're trying to say it's racist.
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:53.200]  It's evil.
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:54.200]  It's bad.
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:36:55.200]  You're not allowed to lampoon him.
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:56.200]  He's a God.
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:36:59.200]  I love taking their deity, their royalty.
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:03.200]  And showing what he really is, a joker, a scammer.
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:09.200]  I mean, Max Kaiser, do you think it's unfair and mean to put up a joker A and B?
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:16.200]  Isn't it all right anyways, whether it's nice or not to show the Godlike creature in whatever way we wish,
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:21.200]  or should it be illegal as some democratic operatives are calling for?
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:29.200]  Well, like Alex, I grew up during the Nixon era and the amount of vitriol spouted toward Nixon,
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:32.200]  as you can imagine, was quite vehement.
[3:37:32.200 --> 3:37:38.200]  The parodies and the things that were done were extreme.
[3:37:38.200 --> 3:37:41.200]  And because the country was angry.
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:43.200]  And why are they angry?
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:45.200]  Because they don't have a job.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:51.200]  Because the economy is thinking, because the president seems to curry favor with the Wall Street banks,
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:56.200]  and he has done no reformation of the banking system whatsoever.
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:37:59.200]  If anything, he's given them more power.
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:05.200]  And the people, unfortunately, have no power except through, historically,
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.200]  the people have always resorted to pamphleteering, and through parity,
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:15.200]  to any means necessary that is cheap, but carries their message.
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:21.200]  And this is just what happens when an economy is concentrated wealth,
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:27.200]  is by the fewer and fewer percentage, and it leaves the vast majority faced out in the mud.
[3:38:27.200 --> 3:38:30.200]  And this just creates this dynamic.
[3:38:30.200 --> 3:38:39.200]  And the way to stop it is to address this unbelievable power grab of the money and wealth
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:46.200]  of the United States by the select few, and start to engage in some measures that will restore balance.
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:51.200]  The problem with these banks on Wall Street is that as the power grab continues,
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:53.200]  there's less and less competition for them.
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:59.200]  And people say, well, you know, people are just envious that Goldman Sachs was making a lot of money,
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:01.200]  which is completely incorrect.
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:06.200]  What is disturbing is that there are no competitors for Goldman Sachs.
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:08.200]  Why doesn't Obama and Geithner and Bernanke,
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:13.200]  why don't they start a few new banks that will challenge Goldman Sachs?
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:16.200]  No, everything has to be fed into the mega bank at the expense of the people,
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:19.200]  and that's what John D. Rockefeller first said.
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:25.200]  He said competition is a sin, and it is a sin to these mega monopoly capitalists.
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:29.200]  Competition is the lifeblood of what's called the American dream.
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:34.200]  The purpose of the government is to allow like an empire at the ball game,
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:36.200]  so that there can be fair competition.
[3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:38.200]  That's what a government can do.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:40.200]  They play the empire at the ball game.
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:42.200]  And then we'll see who competes the best.
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:45.200]  Some people are talented, some people are really hard working,
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:50.200]  and you have the ability through sheer hard work to make it in that economy.
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:54.200]  But if the empire is working for the banks,
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:39:57.200]  and there are no laws or other rules,
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  then the people in the country are going to rise up and say, you know what, this is BS.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:06.200]  You know, we want to compete. The people want to work.
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:09.200]  They want to compete, but the banks on Wall Street won't let them.
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:13.200]  And that blockage has got to be removed from the economy.
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:17.200]  There needs to be a reintroduction of competition in the United States.
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:23.200]  And the way to do that is to remove the egregious monopoly of everything financial.
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:28.200]  Every loan, every price on every exchange is totally manipulated at this point.
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:31.200]  It's done so thousands of times a minute,
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:34.200]  and they're just stealing, like I said at the top of the interview,
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:38.200]  they've got a siphon stuck into the pot of money that is America's wealth,
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:41.200]  and they're just siphoning it out with no competition whatsoever.
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  They're just taking it. They're just stealing it
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:48.200]  without any intrusion from any regulator whatsoever.
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:57.200]  Now, how is that going to foster an economy of hard working, diligent, moral people?
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  Great points, Max Kaiser. Did you...
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:08.200]  Look at the front page of the Financial Times. Wall Street profits from Fed role.
[3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:12.200]  This is on the front page of the Financial Times. What does this mean?
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:18.200]  The Federal Reserve tells Wall Street what they're buying and selling before they buy and sell.
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:22.200]  Wall Street then steps in, they quote unquote, front run,
[3:41:22.200 --> 3:41:25.200]  which means they place orders ahead of the government,
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:27.200]  and they make money without taking any risks.
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:36.200]  So it's a rigged inside economy insider trading now publicly.
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:40.200]  Crime is just absolutely mainstream now.
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:43.200]  Insider trading crime and fevery are listed on the exchange.
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:45.200]  You can buy them every single day.
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:51.200]  It's a listed open sewer of corruption that they're just buying and selling on the exchange,
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  and they're basically taunting people and saying,
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  so with us or against us, that's why I have that site, gulagwealthfund.com,
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:01.200]  which has all the companies that are profiting from this gulag casino state.
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:06.200]  So I've got the various military contractors and the various banks,
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:09.200]  and if you want to participate in the gulag wealth industry,
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:11.200]  you should buy the shares in these stocks
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  because you can watch your country go into the mud as well,
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:19.200]  and you'll be the richest guy in the world, but you will have lost your country.
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:22.200]  So that's the trade-off. That's the trade-off you have to ask yourself.
[3:42:22.200 --> 3:42:27.200]  Are you willing to become rich in exchange for their wealth?
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:29.200]  Are you willing to give up your country?
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:31.200]  That's the question everyone has to ask themselves.
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:33.200]  But at a certain point, they destroy the standard of living
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  and turn all the western countries into sewers,
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  but I guess they don't care as long as they're the king monkey sitting on top of the pile of dung.
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:45.200]  It's just amazing. Did you see where the White House,
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:48.200]  we actually broke this on Monday, it's now been picked up nationally,
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:54.200]  the White House is asking its people to report anyone that talks bad about the health care plan,
[3:42:54.200 --> 3:42:57.200]  and then back during the campaign, they had cops in Missouri going,
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:01.200]  we're going to arrest you if we decide you lie about Obama
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:06.200]  and all these youth brigades and youth corps with all these big Republicans running them for Obama,
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:08.200]  like David Gergen?
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:13.200]  Well, because the business of the casino gulag model,
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  the supporting of the cops in this case and the surveillance and the invasive technology 24-7,
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:22.200]  this is the only business.
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:23.200]  You know, here's an interesting point.
[3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:28.200]  If you look at the last, the Gross Domestic Product of America for the last quarter,
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:33.200]  and they say that it was, the figures were up minus,
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:36.200]  plus or minus one percent from a year earlier,
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:39.200]  and they were saying, see the economy is on some kind of growth track,
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:42.200]  or it's not decelerating as fast as we said it would.
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:50.200]  If you subtract the military from the durable hard goods number, the military component,
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:53.200]  it's more than 50 percent.
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:58.200]  So in other words, the only growth that you see in the U.S. right now comes from invading countries,
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  slaughtering people, and installing surveillance equipment.
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:02.200]  That's it.
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  That's what America exports now.
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:04.200]  That's their growth industry.
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:05.200]  And they look at that, they say it's great.
[3:44:05.200 --> 3:44:09.200]  The people who are doing it, they can borrow money from Wall Street at virtually no money,
[3:44:09.200 --> 3:44:13.200]  no interest rates whatsoever, because they keep those artificially low interest rates for them.
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:17.200]  If you're a saver, if you work and you save money, like I'm a saver.
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:18.200]  I have only savings.
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:19.200]  I have no debt.
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:20.200]  I don't have a mortgage.
[3:44:20.200 --> 3:44:21.200]  I don't have a credit card.
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:22.200]  I don't have a car loan.
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:23.200]  I've never had any debt.
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:26.200]  But I'm being penalized because on my savings, I get one percent at most.
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:27.200]  That's outrageous.
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  When the demand for credit is there, I should be getting four or five percent.
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:33.200]  So I'm subsidizing Goldman Sachs.
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:34.200]  I'm subsidizing JP Morgan.
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:37.200]  They're stealing money from me every single day.
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:39.200]  That's completely ridiculous.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:40.200]  So why?
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:43.200]  What productive role are they playing in the society?
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:44.200]  None.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  They're just having acid.
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:47.200]  They're just ripping it apart.
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  And it's not even because, and they're not even having a lot of fun doing it.
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:52.200]  It's just because they're sadistic.
[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  It's like Caligula capitalism.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:56.200]  They're just sick sadistic.
[3:44:56.200 --> 3:44:57.200]  No, that's it.
[3:44:57.200 --> 3:45:01.200]  They love blasting out the free market, destroying societies, bankrupting people.
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:06.200]  I read the Malthusian eugenicist views of all these elites.
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:10.200]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan publicly fund most of the eugenics groups.
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:12.200]  Most of the zero growth groups.
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  They're paying people to sell good cars.
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:17.200]  Then the car dealers just don't go down as much and actually rip you off.
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:19.200]  The studies show for cash for clunkers.
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:23.200]  Obama's idea to renew America is to quote bulldoze cities.
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:26.200]  USA Today, command destruction.
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:28.200]  This is what they want.
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:31.200]  And I wanted to ask you, Max, before we go to calls, eco science.
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:32.200]  Holdren.
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:36.200]  And it turns out the guy he wrote the book with Paul Ehrlich was George Bush seniors.
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  Science advisor openly wanting to drug the water, take all children at birth,
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:45.200]  train them, raise them in government dormitories.
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:51.200]  And now in England, 20,000 families to have cameras in the homes watching their children.
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:54.200]  They're saying they're going to take the children and raise them in dormitories.
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:55.200]  That the family is bad.
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:45:58.200]  The state is actually this is in the book.
[3:45:58.200 --> 3:45:59.200]  Now they're doing it.
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:02.200]  Can you comment on these people?
[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:10.200]  The, you know, it's just, you know, it's just, it just makes you well up in tears inside
[3:46:10.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  because you realize that this great experiment that was started in the 18th century is come
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:24.200]  to a shocking close and very suddenly because of complete inability for those who are benefiting
[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:28.200]  most from a democratic society to stand up for their democracy.
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:32.200]  You know, if you're a collegial capitalist, if you're running a casino gulag state and
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:37.200]  you've got no resistance whatsoever, then why, why, why, why blame them?
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:40.200]  They're just, you know, rust never sleeps.
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:45.200]  Rust is rust without, you know, there's no, these people are never going to stop.
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:46.200]  They don't have no logic.
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:49.200]  There's nothing behind them that makes any human sense.
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:52.200]  So, so there's not going to stop.
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:57.200]  And the people who are getting the most affected by this are refusing to stand up for themselves.
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:47:01.200]  I don't see any change in the dynamic here whatsoever.
[3:47:01.200 --> 3:47:02.200]  I just don't see it.
[3:47:02.200 --> 3:47:07.200]  And it's really, you know, I live in France because I can't even live in the United States.
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:13.200]  It makes me a little queasy inside to walk around and just, it's like being in a zombie
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:14.200]  ville.
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:19.200]  Here in France, the people in France have a situation where the government fears them.
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:23.200]  The government fears the people.
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  If the government says something or does something in France that the people don't like,
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:28.200]  they immediately are out of the street.
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  They're protesting and demonstrating every single day.
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:33.200]  In the U.S., of course, it's the opposite.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:35.200]  The people fear the government.
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:37.200]  And that's totally unacceptable.
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:39.200]  That's completely unacceptable.
[3:47:39.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  And you can't even be around it.
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:42.200]  It's sickening.
[3:47:42.200 --> 3:47:43.200]  Well, absolutely.
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  The media is always bashing France.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:48.200]  And I think it's taxes is too high, but the people actually have a form of socialism there.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  They're demanding it.
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:53.200]  I'm not for that system, but they're actually getting some of it, which is better than this.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  I mean, if you're going to have socialism, I will get part of it.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  But the issue is, I will get some services every day.
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:01.200]  That's the worst socialist system in the world.
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:03.200]  But that's what I'm saying.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:04.200]  This isn't even socialism.
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:10.200]  It won't treat it the most egregious socialistic parasite on the entire globe.
[3:48:10.200 --> 3:48:12.200]  That's socialism.
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:14.200]  But Max, I'm agreeing with you.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:16.200]  I'm saying they steal all our money and give it to elites.
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  At least in France, they take the money and actually give it to some of the people.
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:21.200]  But what I'm saying is they try to plant GMO.
[3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:22.200]  They burn it down.
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:24.200]  They try to do something corrupt.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:25.200]  The people riot.
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:27.200]  And so you're right about that.
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  You were telling me during the break that you were in a French coffee shop or something and heard something interesting.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  Oh, yeah.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:35.200]  They were talking about Alex Jones.
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:36.200]  I couldn't believe it.
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:39.200]  A couple of French people were to talk about Alex Jones.
[3:48:39.200 --> 3:48:44.200]  So I broke in with my limited French and we had an interesting conversation.
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  But they were really curious.
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:48.200]  I mean, what were they saying?
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:58.200]  Well, they were fascinated by really the film, the Obama deception is actually being viewed here in France by people.
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:49:02.200]  And I guess some people have some versions with subtitles out there or something.
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:05.200]  But they knew significant parts about it.
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  And here in Europe, Obama was very, very seductive and he really won over the Europeans.
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:16.200]  And so this is something that has come up.
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  It's really a topic of discussion that this whole reversal, the fact that his popularity has been dropping and what does this mean?
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:26.200]  And, you know, we're in love with him and how did we think about this?
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:30.200]  And then the Obama deception film came up because how many views does it have on the net?
[3:49:30.200 --> 3:49:31.200]  Like 20 million views?
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:32.200]  Yeah, it's more than that.
[3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:33.200]  But yeah, that's conservative.
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:36.200]  Well, the issue is it wasn't their love of Obama.
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:38.200]  It was their hatred of Bush.
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:39.200]  And I found that in my own life.
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:44.200]  I'll hate somebody so much that I end up being friends with that person's enemy.
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:46.200]  That person turns out being just as bad.
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:51.200]  And I think that's what it is, is that Bush was so horrible.
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:53.200]  People associated all the tyranny with him.
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:50:00.200]  So went running to Obama and he was just a pimp who then got us in the hotel room and punched us in the face and knocked our teeth out.
[3:50:00.200 --> 3:50:04.200]  And now we're crawling around on the ground bleeding and he's going, yeah, bitch, you like it.
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:07.200]  And I think people are finally going, no, I don't like it.
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:08.200]  I'm leaving.
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:15.200]  And so we're, we're running out the door in our skirt crying in the rain and he's slapping us with a, with a, you know, with a coat hanger.
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:19.200]  And I just think it's time for people to wake up.
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:27.200]  People in France, you know, contrary to popular belief are really love American a lot of ways.
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:34.200]  I mean, there's a huge boulevard in the middle of Paris, you know, Franklin Roosevelt Boulevard, JFK Boulevard.
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:38.200]  And, you know, the French are the ones that financed the American Revolution.
[3:50:38.200 --> 3:50:41.200]  And as a result, their own economy went into free fall.
[3:50:41.200 --> 3:50:43.200]  They want to like the United States.
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  They want to like, exactly.
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:47.200]  They want to like the United States.
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:49.200]  And so the angle files have always hated that.
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:54.200]  So that's why they love to demonize France on our news because they helped found America and the British government hates that.
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:51:05.200]  Max Kaiser, he knows what he's talking about.
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:29.200]  And here's the best part.

[3:51:58.200 --> 3:52:02.200]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:07.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:10.200]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:13.200]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:16.200]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[3:52:16.200 --> 3:52:20.200]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:25.200]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:32.200]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:36.200]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:26.200]  I'm going to pick the best video that I think gets the word out about Obama being a liar
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:29.200]  and a criminal and a front man for the New World Order.
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:34.200]  So let's not just blame him. Let's get past him to the real elites and bring them to justice.
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:39.200]  Max Kaiser is our guest. Max, I want to go to calls Doug and Dan and Chris and Dr. Gushin
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:41.200]  and others that are holding.
[3:54:41.200 --> 3:54:48.200]  Please join us. 1-800-259-9231. But you've got a pretty good brain.
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:52.200]  I mean, I've been reading some of your writings from years ago and almost all of it came true.
[3:54:52.200 --> 3:54:54.200]  What do you think is going to happen in the next few years?
[3:54:54.200 --> 3:55:00.200]  Because I knew that Obama had this God-like level, but that as soon as he proved he was a liar,
[3:55:00.200 --> 3:55:03.200]  that would dissipate. The bigger they are, the harder they'll fall.
[3:55:03.200 --> 3:55:07.200]  But it also seems that Obama's controllers are going to want to stage something.
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:12.200]  A new war with Iran, an economic collapse, more economic terrorism,
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:17.200]  domestic stage terror attacks. I mean, what do you see happening in the next couple years
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:22.200]  with the people taking over all these town halls, going after both parties,
[3:55:22.200 --> 3:55:26.200]  and how the empire is going to strike back?
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:35.200]  Well, as you know, as I said on your show before, I think that as the economy continues to collapse,
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:41.200]  there's going to be a big push across the country, state to state, to legalize gambling.
[3:55:41.200 --> 3:55:44.200]  And the gambling is going to be more of a factor in the economy.
[3:55:44.200 --> 3:55:48.200]  There's going to be more ways to gamble specifically online.
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:53.200]  The reason you don't have online gambling right now is because of the mob in Vegas and New Jersey.
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:56.200]  They control gambling and those two things.
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:55:59.200]  So you think the revolution is just us turning into total slobs?
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:02.200]  You think we're going to get worse?
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:12.200]  Yeah, I think that the combination of online gambling, cheap, pharmaceutical-engineered, over-the-counter,
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:19.200]  mood-altering drugs, and terrible food products, high-fructose corn syrup-based food products,
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:25.200]  you put all those things into a cocktail of silliness,
[3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:29.200]  and you end up with a population that is completely strung out
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:32.200]  and just trying to gamble their way toward making...
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:37.200]  Basically, it's indentured servitude is what we're heading toward,
[3:56:37.200 --> 3:56:41.200]  because the debts are never going to be paid.
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:43.200]  They're simply never going to be paid.
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  And as the banks reorganize the system right now, they're putting all the bad bets into the publicly held banks,
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:53.200]  like, for example, in the UK, this Northern Rock, which was one of the first banks to go under.
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:57.200]  They just announced that they've got three times the bad toxic assets that they thought that they had,
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:56:59.200]  but that's a publicly owned bank.
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:02.200]  So now, it's really the public that owns those toxic assets.
[3:57:02.200 --> 3:57:07.200]  The private banks are the banks that are held by the runners of the Gulag Casino State,
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:11.200]  and of course, they hold the performing assets and the performing loans.
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:14.200]  So they're dividing the bad assets from the good assets,
[3:57:14.200 --> 3:57:18.200]  and they're keeping the ones that are still relatively high-profile and performing,
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:23.200]  and they're putting all the really trashy, junk grade Z never ever going to be paid back
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:25.200]  into the public domain and the public ownership,
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:27.200]  and the public will never pay back those loans,
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:30.200]  and the public will continuously get themselves further and further into debt.
[3:57:30.200 --> 3:57:33.200]  Look at the Cash for Clunkers program as a perfect example.
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:41.200]  They encourage people to take cars that they own 100%, trade them in, and put themselves into debt.
[3:57:41.200 --> 3:57:45.200]  Like, now they get a new car, but they put it, they're on debt.
[3:57:45.200 --> 3:57:50.200]  They've increased their debt file, you know, and the debt levels are continuing to increase.
[3:57:50.200 --> 3:57:56.200]  Max Kaiser, it sounds like you're describing hell, and on top of that,
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:58:01.200]  now the police, the government, the minions, 10% of Texans with arrest warrants,
[3:58:01.200 --> 3:58:03.200]  more fines, more fees.
[3:58:03.200 --> 3:58:06.200]  The other part of the equation is those of us that don't want to drink corn syrup,
[3:58:06.200 --> 3:58:08.200]  be zombies, eat GMO.
[3:58:08.200 --> 3:58:12.200]  We're going to be, like, planted to the apes, being chased by the CPS and police
[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:16.200]  with them with net scooping us up to take us back to the FEMA camp
[3:58:16.200 --> 3:58:23.200]  so they get more chips to buy big gulp beers and sit there buying hookers at the slot machines.
