[00:00.000 --> 00:14.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.880]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:16.880 --> 00:24.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on July 1, 2019, from the Info Wars
[00:24.760 --> 00:29.440]  News Center in Austin in defiance of the globalist on TV and radio satellites on hundreds of
[00:29.440 --> 00:36.080]  radio and TV stations on global shortwave and dominating at infowars.com, newswars.com,
[00:36.080 --> 00:39.960]  prisonplanet.com, and Paul Watson's great site, summit.news.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.160]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:41.160 --> 00:45.280]  You know, I have an incredibly full plate of the Democrats promise terror, anti-fuzz
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.520]  hitting people over the head with crowbars, throwing acid attacks on people.
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.520]  That's what it is.
[00:51.520 --> 00:53.520]  These concrete attacks have lime in them.
[00:53.520 --> 00:54.520]  It's all coming up.
[00:54.520 --> 00:59.240]  But first, I want to air this piece that I've aired Friday, Sunday, and today, because
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.840]  it's so important remembering how evil the globalist are and the Democrats, that their
[01:03.840 --> 01:08.800]  operating system is killing children and hating humanity while they claim give them all the
[01:08.800 --> 01:10.640]  power because they love humanity.
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.000]  No, they hate children.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  They hate life.
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.000]  They hate everybody.
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  They hate themselves.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  Here's the report.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.720]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[01:20.720 --> 01:21.720]  Some are against them.
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.000]  Others believe they're fine in rare cases, and many believe you should be able to get
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.200]  them whenever the fuck you want.
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.640]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.640]  I meant abortions.
[01:31.640 --> 01:34.640]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.320]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the brief 10th
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.320]  annual salute to abortion.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.320]  Get out of my behind.
[01:46.320 --> 01:47.320]  Get out of my vagina.
[01:47.320 --> 01:48.320]  Get out.
[01:48.320 --> 01:53.080]  It's a woman's body, and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.560]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.560]  That has a heartbeat.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.840]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[01:58.840 --> 01:59.840]  A fetus is a parasite.
[01:59.840 --> 02:00.840]  Sweetie.
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.840]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[02:01.840 --> 02:02.840]  It's a liposome of the 12 weeks.
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.840]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[02:03.840 --> 02:04.840]  How many did you adopt?
[02:04.840 --> 02:05.840]  How many did I adopt?
[02:05.840 --> 02:06.840]  I killed my kids.
[02:06.840 --> 02:07.840]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[02:07.840 --> 02:08.840]  I love it.
[02:08.840 --> 02:09.840]  You love it, huh?
[02:09.840 --> 02:10.840]  Yeah, I do.
[02:10.840 --> 02:11.840]  Okay.
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.840]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:12.840 --> 02:13.840]  Oh, I'd ever go to Christ.
[02:13.840 --> 02:14.840]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.840]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[02:15.840 --> 02:16.840]  A fertilized egg is a human being.
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.840]  Yeah.
[02:17.840 --> 02:18.840]  I think it's a human being.
[02:18.840 --> 02:28.840]  You're a pain because I don't let it come, baby.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.840]  Oh, you kill them.
[02:30.840 --> 02:33.840]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.840]  Why'd you spit at us?
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.840]  I don't agree with you.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  No uterus.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.840]  No right to talk about it.
[02:40.840 --> 02:41.840]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.840]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mind.
[02:47.840 --> 02:52.840]  Rip out the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.
[02:52.840 --> 02:58.840]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay
[02:58.840 --> 02:59.840]  with me.
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.840]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases, and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.840]  terribly unfortunate.
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.840]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center Spire in Pink to celebrate
[03:12.840 --> 03:15.840]  his erotical expansion of abortion in New York.
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.840]  He approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason until the 24th week of
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.840]  pregnancy and then up until birth.
[03:22.840 --> 03:26.840]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[03:26.840 --> 03:28.840]  The infant would be delivered.
[03:28.840 --> 03:30.840]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[03:30.840 --> 03:36.840]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.840]  then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.840]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[03:45.840 --> 03:49.840]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[03:49.840 --> 03:56.840]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[03:56.840 --> 03:58.840]  Is it okay to still have children?
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.840]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[04:04.840 --> 04:14.840]  There's a new video out on informers.com of two partial birth abortions, eight and a half
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.840]  month old babies, and it makes you want to kill people.
[04:19.840 --> 04:22.840]  I'm just going to be honest with you right now.
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.840]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole and
[04:29.840 --> 04:31.840]  then they make a joke out of it.
[04:31.840 --> 04:38.840]  Doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born, defiling them, making jokes
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.840]  about them that they're having a fight.
[04:40.840 --> 04:47.840]  They're playing with dead babies in a little medical pan, and it was pretty shocking through
[04:47.840 --> 04:51.840]  some stuff to see and just total lack of regard for humanity.
[04:51.840 --> 04:53.840]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[04:53.840 --> 04:57.840]  We're going to have Abby Johnson.
[04:57.840 --> 05:00.840]  I'm sorry.
[05:00.840 --> 05:04.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.840]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.840]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.840 --> 05:15.840]  one another.
[05:15.840 --> 05:19.840]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.840]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.840]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.840]  goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[05:33.840 --> 05:34.840]  supporting Infowars.
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.840]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.840]  on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven
[05:43.840 --> 05:44.840]  model.
[05:44.840 --> 05:48.840]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting
[05:48.840 --> 05:52.840]  the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[05:52.840 --> 05:55.840]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[05:55.840 --> 06:02.840]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:25.840 --> 06:37.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear a world exclusive piece of information hiding
[06:37.840 --> 06:41.840]  in plain view.
[06:41.840 --> 06:44.840]  There are so many angles to this.
[06:44.840 --> 06:46.840]  But here's the fact.
[06:46.840 --> 06:51.840]  I have reviewed in the last two days more than 100 videos.
[06:51.840 --> 06:53.840]  We're going to be presenting many of them here.
[06:53.840 --> 06:58.840]  They're up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[06:58.840 --> 07:09.840]  Antifa engaged in more than 20 acid attacks in Portland damaging the eyesight and eating
[07:09.840 --> 07:15.840]  the skin off of more than 15 people's faces.
[07:15.840 --> 07:22.840]  And Fox News is only focusing on one person saying he had a milkshake thrown on him.
[07:22.840 --> 07:27.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Antifa pledged two weeks ago and again yesterday to attack the Trump
[07:27.840 --> 07:31.840]  pro-America rally coming up July 4th in D.C.
[07:31.840 --> 07:36.840]  They pledged to block the entrances to get in near the White House area.
[07:36.840 --> 07:41.840]  And they said we are preparing acid attacks and put out the ingredients list and also
[07:41.840 --> 07:46.840]  talked about attacking Tucker Carlson's house, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:46.840 --> 07:57.840]  This is unprecedented evil.
[07:57.840 --> 08:02.840]  So pulling back from this, did you hear what I just said?
[08:02.840 --> 08:04.840]  We have the videos.
[08:04.840 --> 08:05.840]  We have the audio.
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.840]  We have the photos.
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.840]  We have them admitting it on the Antifa site in D.C., the Antifa site in Portland, Oregon,
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.840]  the Antifa site in San Francisco, the Antifa site in Austin, Texas, that there are different
[08:17.840 --> 08:26.840]  ways to produce acid compounds and to then throw them on people to blind them.
[08:26.840 --> 08:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, they themselves said, and there's photos and videos that are on screen
[08:32.840 --> 08:43.840]  if you're a TV viewer, that they were going to mix quick-setting concrete and throw it
[08:43.840 --> 08:45.840]  in people's faces.
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.840]  Why would you do that?
[08:46.840 --> 08:52.840]  Because when it's setting, for about an hour after it gets mixed, it will put your eyes
[08:52.840 --> 09:01.840]  out because it has forms of bleach in it and lime activated by the limestone dust, calcium
[09:01.840 --> 09:14.840]  sulfate, alumni, and amorphous silica, calcium, sulfa-aluminate, and other deadly chemicals
[09:14.840 --> 09:15.840]  when mixed.
[09:15.840 --> 09:17.840]  That's why it's quick-setting.
[09:17.840 --> 09:20.840]  It has a chemical acid reaction.
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.840]  Now, I worked in construction off and on in high school and college because I could pick
[09:25.840 --> 09:28.840]  up 20 bucks an hour doing some work here, doing some work there.
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.840]  Very hard-working folks in construction.
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.840]  You wear thick industrial gloves, you wear goggles, you wear a breather if you're dealing
[09:38.840 --> 09:40.840]  with a large mix of it.
[09:40.840 --> 09:43.840]  You've got to wear rubber boots when you get into it.
[09:43.840 --> 09:49.840]  And let me tell you, it's man's work because it gets through the gloves, it gets under
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.840]  things, it eats little holes in you.
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.840]  Portland PD reported on anti-fumixing concrete into milkshakes.
[09:58.840 --> 10:00.840]  This creates acid-like chemical weapons.
[10:00.840 --> 10:02.840]  So, oh, Jack Pasobit gets it.
[10:02.840 --> 10:05.840]  I searched all yesterday and found no one getting this.
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.840]  So, this is a chemical weapon.
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.840]  This is a chemical weapon.
[10:14.840 --> 10:26.840]  Amino ferrite is a dark brown crystalline phase commonly found in cements in the cement
[10:26.840 --> 10:29.840]  industry and it's termed ferrite.
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.840]  It also exists in nature as a rare mineral.
[10:33.840 --> 10:36.840]  And then it goes on to talk about what it'll do to you.
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, lime is what the mafia dumps on top bodies to basically eat them.
[10:43.840 --> 10:45.840]  It's acid.
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.840]  So, they mix all these acid compounds together that when they come together have a chemical
[10:50.840 --> 10:57.840]  reaction that makes the concrete set quickly and fuses all of the silica together and they
[10:57.840 --> 10:58.840]  throw it in your face.
[10:58.840 --> 11:01.840]  And that's why when you look at the photos and the videos, people that were hit with it,
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.840]  their skin is all burned, their eyes are all totally bloody and bloodshot.
[11:05.840 --> 11:07.840]  They will guarantee you have vision loss.
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.840]  So, what you're looking at is mass terrorist if you're a TV viewer.
[11:11.840 --> 11:14.840]  Radio listeners, the articles are on infowars.com.
[11:14.840 --> 11:21.840]  Literally mixing acid attacks and then notice the left is all about deception, calling it
[11:21.840 --> 11:23.840]  milkshake attacks.
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.840]  And then we've seen prominent Democrats, prominent BBC reporters, prominent U.S.
[11:28.840 --> 11:35.840]  reporters left us saying they'd like to see Nigel Farage hit with an acid attack.
[11:35.840 --> 11:37.840]  Remember that?
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.840]  Prominent leftist journalist calls for acid attack on Nigel Farage.
[11:41.840 --> 11:44.840]  He says there needs to be acid in there.
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.840]  That was three weeks ago.
[11:46.840 --> 11:53.840]  Antifa now vows to attack families trying to go to a fourth of July event in D.C.
[11:53.840 --> 11:56.840]  They're trying to get somebody to shoot them.
[11:56.840 --> 11:57.840]  Doesn't matter.
[11:57.840 --> 11:59.840]  They dump acid right on your five-year-old's face.
[11:59.840 --> 12:00.840]  You pull a gun and shoot them.
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.840]  You will be the terrorist.
[12:02.840 --> 12:03.840]  You will be the bad guy.
[12:03.840 --> 12:08.840]  They are the little methods that work for the cities, that work for the universities,
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.840]  and work for the federal government.
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.840]  That's why the Portland mayor allows them to do all this because a lot of them are his
[12:13.840 --> 12:16.840]  staff, it's turned out.
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.840]  They are a domestic terror group.
[12:20.840 --> 12:23.840]  The Proud Boys never got designated a terror group, but the media lied.
[12:23.840 --> 12:28.840]  They lost all their bank accounts and everything because of another media hoax.
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.840]  Kind of like they said, I sent child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[12:31.840 --> 12:32.840]  Didn't know such thing.
[12:32.840 --> 12:34.840]  I sent 9.6 million emails.
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.840]  After I get sued, people put magic links that are hidden in emails about Sandy Hook,
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.840]  they subpoenaed the emails we'd never opened, find the hidden links.
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.840]  Same law firm that found that put a fake transcript into the court two weeks ago saying that I
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.840]  talked about white Jew boys on air, did no such thing, said white shoe boys.
[12:54.840 --> 12:57.840]  But again, I'm not saying that that law firm did that.
[12:57.840 --> 13:02.840]  I'm saying after I got sued, somebody sent us the child porn we never opened, but magically
[13:02.840 --> 13:06.840]  they subpoenaed, found the hidden links, and you get that headline.
[13:06.840 --> 13:12.840]  This is total weaponization by the left, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.840]  It's absolutely insane.
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.840]  It's totally out of control.
[13:16.840 --> 13:20.840]  If you want to find the right article from last week, that's about a two-year-old article
[13:20.840 --> 13:21.840]  up there you put up.
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.840]  What you pull up is Raw Story did a retraction on the Jew boy comment and said white Jew boy
[13:25.840 --> 13:26.840]  and that's the one.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.840]  Let's put a rawstory.com at the end of your search.
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.840]  There it is.
[13:30.840 --> 13:36.840]  But this is the reality of how the globalists are operating.
[13:36.840 --> 13:39.840]  Now, I'm going to say this again.
[13:39.840 --> 13:41.840]  Let this sink in.
[13:41.840 --> 13:48.840]  Antifa, the Maoist communist group in the United States set up 30 years ago that calls for
[13:48.840 --> 13:53.840]  overthrowing the government, killing their political enemies, banning free speech.
[13:53.840 --> 14:00.840]  They are now nationwide saying they're going to attack anybody at Fourth of July rallies,
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.840]  anybody that tries to go out in public, anybody that tries to support Trump, any type of veterans
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.840]  rallies, any type of free speech rallies, that they're going to attack them with chemical
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.840]  weapons, with acid attacks, barring it from the Islamists who are their gods.
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.840]  They were so vicious and hateful in Portland outnumbering folks 10 to 1 that they beat
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.840]  up a, quote, gay man in a summer dress who they just decided to beat up.
[14:27.840 --> 14:29.840]  If you're in a wheelchair, they attack you.
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.840]  They target weakness, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.840]  And they were wearing brass knuckles, leaded gloves.
[14:36.840 --> 14:40.840]  When we come back, we'll play clips of the media praising it and defending it.
[14:40.840 --> 14:45.840]  These are the street level brown shirt terrorists.
[14:45.840 --> 14:54.840]  All of these videos are up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[14:54.840 --> 14:55.840]  We come back.
[14:55.840 --> 15:01.840]  We'll go through all the articles on infowars.com and newswars.com where we show the crowbarred
[15:01.840 --> 15:08.840]  heads, the blood, all of it when we come back on the other side of this break.
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.840]  But acid attacks are taking place in America.
[15:13.840 --> 15:24.840]  They mixed hundreds of containers of the chemical weapon, and they attacked men, women, and children
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.840]  with crowbars and with clubs and with improvised hatchets.
[15:30.840 --> 15:36.840]  And the police stood there as terrorists and did nothing aiding the criminal left, beating
[15:36.840 --> 15:45.840]  people in the head for no reason with clubs over and over and over again up to 30 stitches
[15:45.840 --> 15:47.840]  per giant slash.
[15:47.840 --> 15:54.840]  This is America while spraying pepper spray and dumping acid on their faces.
[15:54.840 --> 15:58.840]  This is the left terrorist.
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.840]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.840]  What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:07.840 --> 16:09.840]  at heart and body extract.
[16:09.840 --> 16:12.840]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:12.840 --> 16:13.840]  Don't just take my word for it.

[16:39.840 --> 16:43.840]  Slingbow products are compact and models start from just 1798.

[16:55.840 --> 16:58.840]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[17:25.840 --> 17:29.840]  We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.840]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:34.840 --> 17:36.840]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:36.840 --> 17:38.840]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:38.840 --> 17:42.840]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.840]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:44.840 --> 17:48.840]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:48.840 --> 17:49.840]  And the best part?
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.840]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:53.840 --> 17:55.840]  That's myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:55.840 --> 18:24.840]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:25.840 --> 18:27.840]  I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:27.840 --> 18:56.840]  It's a time to be praying my friend.
[18:57.840 --> 18:59.840]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:27.840 --> 19:55.840]  Thank you for your support.
[19:55.840 --> 19:58.840]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[19:58.840 --> 20:03.840]  We're not going to back down.
[20:03.840 --> 20:32.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Antifa said they would start tearing out asset attacks
[20:38.840 --> 20:42.840]  and they mixed up hundreds and hundreds of containers of it in the park in Portland,
[20:42.840 --> 20:47.840]  came out and attacked men, women and children, split heads open with crowbars,
[20:47.840 --> 20:52.840]  and Fox News is calling it milkshake attacks, chemical weapon asset attacks.
[20:52.840 --> 21:01.840]  And they're pledging to attack Trump's Fourth of July Celebrate America event coming up on July 4th in D.C.
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.840]  We're going to have reporters there.
[21:03.840 --> 21:06.840]  This is an incredible time to be alive in America.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.840]  The left knows they're losing, so they're launching a violent revolution.
[21:09.840 --> 21:11.840]  And the mainstream media is praising them.
[21:11.840 --> 21:16.840]  And coming up, we've got clips of the Democrats praising Antifa and what they've done.
[21:16.840 --> 21:18.840]  They're starting a violent war.
[21:18.840 --> 21:33.840]  Here is a clip of just some of what happened in Portland.
[21:33.840 --> 21:38.840]  Andy Ngo is hit, punched, pepper sprayed and has acid thrown his face,
[21:38.840 --> 21:45.840]  tearing his eyes and face as they throw more quick set concrete.
[21:45.840 --> 21:49.840]  Some of the concrete's totally set, so their glass is full of concrete.
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.840]  Others, it's still setting with lime and acid.
[21:52.840 --> 21:57.840]  The attack works! The attack works!
[21:57.840 --> 22:02.840]  This is terrorism in America, mobs of cowards, ganging up.
[22:02.840 --> 22:05.840]  This is why we have the Second Amendment, Fox.
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.840]  And they start coming to your houses, which they pledge to do, like Tucker Carlson's.
[22:09.840 --> 22:14.840]  And they're now doxing federal agents in Portland's rolls saying they're going to come to their houses and kill them.
[22:14.840 --> 22:21.840]  They're going to find out that the acid won't beat bullets when we defend ourselves.
[22:21.840 --> 22:28.840]  But in any leftist system, the arch crime is defending yourself against leftist thugs.
[22:28.840 --> 22:30.840]  We have stacks of articles with that.
[22:30.840 --> 22:38.840]  Here they are beating men who are peaceful from behind with metal bars splitting their heads open.
[22:38.840 --> 22:45.840]  And they throw some of the photos here of people literally covered in blood.
[22:45.840 --> 22:48.840]  This is the reality. This is what is unfolding.
[22:48.840 --> 22:56.840]  This is terrorism, leftist organized, defended terrorism in America.
[22:56.840 --> 23:01.840]  Joe Biden came out and praised Antifa's wonderful people during the debates.
[23:01.840 --> 23:07.840]  And we've got a compilation of some of the other leftists praising the domestic terror group
[23:07.840 --> 23:12.840]  where the police just stand there while men, women, and children are beaten ahead with metal bars,
[23:12.840 --> 23:18.840]  up to 30 stitches, and acid attacks, a chemical weapon attack.
[23:18.840 --> 23:22.840]  No one else is breaking this down. No one else is even getting what's happening,
[23:22.840 --> 23:24.840]  because the left defines things.
[23:24.840 --> 23:26.840]  There aren't two genders.
[23:26.840 --> 23:28.840]  They're not terrorists when they attack you.
[23:28.840 --> 23:33.840]  And quick set concrete throwing your face to put your eyes out and eat your skin off.
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.840]  That's milk, because they are God.
[23:37.840 --> 23:41.840]  And even babies after they're born should be killed now, because the left said they're not human.
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.840]  Kill those little creatures.
[23:44.840 --> 23:55.840]  And there's the photos of them mixing it all, handing out hundreds and hundreds of acid bombs.
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.840]  So they could come out and just split people's heads wide open.
[24:00.840 --> 24:03.840]  You know, more folks are going to show up now to Portland and D.C.
[24:03.840 --> 24:05.840]  This won't intimidate Americans.
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.840]  And I predict that mayor is going to end up getting arrested for protecting them.
[24:09.840 --> 24:14.840]  I predict that you're going to have serious stuff go down in that meth head,
[24:14.840 --> 24:16.840]  demon infested area known as Portland, Oregon.
[24:16.840 --> 24:19.840]  And these folks will be identified. They will be going to prison.
[24:19.840 --> 24:24.840]  Unbelievable, but this is when the scum comes out of their rat holes.
[24:24.840 --> 24:28.840]  By the way, the man that got particularly beaten badly, Adam Kelly,
[24:28.840 --> 24:30.840]  his head split open, many others did.
[24:30.840 --> 24:36.840]  He was helping a, quote, gay man in a summer dress, who the Antifa just attacked,
[24:36.840 --> 24:38.840]  because they thought they were weak.
[24:38.840 --> 24:40.840]  Antifa even attacks their own people.
[24:40.840 --> 24:43.840]  Like when Pelosi was forced to say they were basically terrorists a year ago,
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.840]  because they were just attacking their own people at a Democrat rally event,
[24:48.840 --> 24:50.840]  countering a Christian prayer vigil.
[24:50.840 --> 24:55.840]  They're a bunch of scum who are cowards, who've never had any power, who were bullies.
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.840]  So they go out and get together and they go into feeding frenzies, beating innocent people.
[25:00.840 --> 25:03.840]  Here is the enemy of the American people, the globalist corporate media,
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.840]  on the Chai-Kong payroll, celebrating their brown-shirt shot tricks.
[25:08.840 --> 25:14.840]  I argue to you tonight, all punches are not equal morally.
[25:14.840 --> 25:20.840]  In the eyes of the law, yes, but in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument.
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.840]  They are strictly principled anti-fascists, and what they see in the Trump administration
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.840]  and what they see happening in this country, they see the neo-fascism that we see.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.840]  And they've taken a principle stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists
[25:35.840 --> 25:37.840]  wherever they may show up.
[25:37.840 --> 25:42.840]  It says it right in the name, Antifa, anti-fascism, which is what they were there fighting.
[25:42.840 --> 25:46.840]  Listen, there's, you know, no organization is perfect, there was some violence.
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.840]  I think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed, self-defense is a legitimate response
[25:51.840 --> 25:53.840]  to white supremacist and neo-Nazi violence.
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.840]  The problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.840]  is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough treatment,
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.840]  but it is meant to remove the cancer.
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.840]  There's a group of anti-fascists called the Black Bloc, which do tend to get violent.
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.840]  The idea is, look, non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this.
[26:16.840 --> 26:18.840]  But they wouldn't have been there.
[26:18.840 --> 26:22.840]  They wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been for the fact that white supremacists,
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.840]  neo-Nazis, were out scaring the living-day louts out of most of the people in that town.
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.840]  Thuggishness is thuggishness wherever it comes from politically, and we should be the first to call it out.
[26:33.840 --> 26:35.840]  Wow, somebody said no to it.
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.840]  Andy knows Asian got beat over the head and had acid thrown on him, and his eyes are all red
[26:42.840 --> 26:50.840]  and his face is all half-eaten off, but that's okay to have a quick concrete thrown in your hair and your face
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.840]  because, again, the media said we're Nazis.
[26:55.840 --> 27:03.840]  And what did Congressman Crenshaw say last week in Congress?
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.840]  Well, the veteran in Congress, when he pointed out that, to big tech, we'll play that when we come back,
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.840]  that calling everyone Nazis when this country invaded a continent and millions of people were killed
[27:13.840 --> 27:22.840]  to take out the Nazis is inciting violence, and that's exactly what they've done, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:22.840 --> 27:32.840]  So they're out there involved in chemical weapons attacks, violent attempted murder with steel clubs thrown full power.
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.840]  They basically had foil swords, if you really look.
[27:36.840 --> 27:43.840]  They had big, long batons that you can kill people with if you hit them in the neck.
[27:43.840 --> 27:50.840]  And this is what it's come down to because a bunch of white methods that worked for the mayor said that an Asian guy,
[27:50.840 --> 27:57.840]  who's just a journalist, oh, let's beat him up because we're a bunch of trash.
[27:57.840 --> 28:02.840]  Whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, let this sink in that the corporate media is going to cover this up.
[28:02.840 --> 28:05.840]  They're going to defend it. You just saw them defend the violence.
[28:05.840 --> 28:13.840]  You just saw the left and the corporate media defend the radiation treatment you're about to get to teach you to submit.
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.840]  They've been breeding this in the colleges and the foundations, and now they're making their move.
[28:17.840 --> 28:19.840]  Hillary was supposed to get in.
[28:19.840 --> 28:22.840]  They were supposed to roll all this out against us with her as president.
[28:22.840 --> 28:25.840]  But now they're doing it even though she's not in.
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.840]  We don't have full control of the government back folks.
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.840]  They're fighting to maintain their control and getting violent to teach us.
[28:31.840 --> 28:34.840]  Don't eat at leftist restaurants. Don't shop with them.
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.840]  We must separate ourselves economically in boycott Hollywood, the globalist, all their trash,
[28:39.840 --> 28:45.840]  and don't visit their cities. Let them be in the rats and feces and heroin needles.
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.840]  They are absolute baby killing trash, demonic filth from the pit of hell, and fight back.
[28:51.840 --> 28:53.840]  They want to silence you. They want to bully you.
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.840]  They can't stop you from spreading the word about infowars.com and newswars.com.
[29:24.840 --> 29:26.840]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.840 --> 29:30.840]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.840 --> 29:32.840]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.840 --> 30:01.840]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[30:01.840 --> 30:05.840]  Infowars. The most banned network in the world.
[30:05.840 --> 30:08.840]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[30:08.840 --> 30:11.840]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.840]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me,
[30:16.840 --> 30:20.840]  that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people,
[30:20.840 --> 30:23.840]  that you knew they were liars. You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[30:23.840 --> 30:29.840]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.840]  You know, that love is right back at you.
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.840]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support,
[30:35.840 --> 30:38.840]  because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[30:38.840 --> 30:42.840]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[30:42.840 --> 30:45.840]  But that's not what's important. The enemy could win.
[30:45.840 --> 30:47.840]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.840]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[30:49.840 --> 30:54.840]  This is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:54.840 --> 30:59.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:59.840 --> 31:06.840]  Infowars and free speech, and your right to speech, has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[31:06.840 --> 31:11.840]  It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[31:11.840 --> 31:19.840]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.840]  and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before, and thanks for keeping us afloat,
[31:24.840 --> 31:29.840]  but this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[31:29.840 --> 31:32.840]  Infowars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[31:32.840 --> 31:36.840]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[31:36.840 --> 31:41.840]  We have withstood so many of their attacks. We've gone through so much because of your support.
[31:41.840 --> 31:44.840]  You have been there. But let me tell you, they are pissed.
[31:44.840 --> 31:50.840]  They haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault. So we need your prayers, your financial support,
[31:50.840 --> 31:54.840]  and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com. It's your fight.
[31:54.840 --> 31:59.840]  Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[31:59.840 --> 32:04.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[32:04.840 --> 32:10.840]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor
[32:10.840 --> 32:16.840]  or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[32:16.840 --> 32:23.840]  It is completely independent of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[32:23.840 --> 32:28.840]  and freedom of speech. That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning of the country,
[32:28.840 --> 32:33.840]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this, because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[32:33.840 --> 32:39.840]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[32:39.840 --> 32:45.840]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[32:45.840 --> 32:52.840]  And the Infowars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age, ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[32:52.840 --> 33:10.840]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[33:23.840 --> 33:27.840]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[33:27.840 --> 33:53.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:57.840 --> 34:21.840]  He attacked first! He attacked first!
[34:21.840 --> 34:28.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this, and you're kind of lucky.
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.840]  A lot of these are infowars.com.
[34:32.840 --> 34:38.840]  The left, these are radical Islam. They have up to seven acid attacks in London a day.
[34:38.840 --> 34:44.840]  Up to 30 knife attacks a day. Children just got stabbed. Paul Watson's going to be joining us.
[34:44.840 --> 34:52.840]  He's coming on about calls for acid attacks on Briggs-itters that are being called for by BBC journalists.
[34:52.840 --> 34:57.840]  Other journalists are saying they don't want to see milkshakes thrown. They want to see acid.
[34:57.840 --> 35:05.840]  Well, Antifa made good. They started saying two weeks ago they're going to attack the 4th of July event that Trump has celebrating America.
[35:05.840 --> 35:07.840]  We're going to have journalists covering.
[35:07.840 --> 35:14.840]  There's one of the headlines news wars.com left us to advocate acid attacks against Nigel Farage.
[35:14.840 --> 35:18.840]  Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, that was just May 21st.
[35:18.840 --> 35:23.840]  So Antifa picked up on that. Corporate media praises the attacks.
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.840]  And now it's here. Now it's unfolding. Ted Cruz is calling for an FBI investigation.
[35:28.840 --> 35:38.840]  FBI investigation. Ladies and gentlemen, if I went and had a demonstration at a park and loaded quick set concrete into hundreds of paper cups
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.840]  to go tell people, talk about mind control. Oh, it's milkshakes, but really it's acid.
[35:43.840 --> 35:47.840]  They brag we're going to put people's eyes out. They can put your eyes out.
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.840]  And then they go and throw it on people's faces.
[35:52.840 --> 36:00.840]  Eating their skin off, burning their eyes, macing people and hitting them in the head with metal clubs, splitting their heads open.
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.840]  Giant split open heads, blood pouring everywhere of peaceful people.
[36:04.840 --> 36:11.840]  And CNN goes, oh, there was a fight in Portland when liberals attacked Nazis.
[36:11.840 --> 36:16.840]  It's like the congressman said Crenshaw last week, naming everybody that's your opposition.
[36:16.840 --> 36:22.840]  Nazis is a form of terrorism. And then they tell all these city workers, that's mainly what it is, method city workers,
[36:22.840 --> 36:25.840]  to go attack peaceful people that dare exercise their First Amendment.
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.840]  I am so blown away. Ted Cruz calls for FBI to investigate and bring legal action against Portland mayor.
[36:31.840 --> 36:39.840]  Ted Cruz calls for legal action against Portland mayor. Democratic terrorist could target for this July holiday events, ABC News,
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.840]  but no known plots, say the feds. Incredible. Domestic terrorists could target it.
[36:45.840 --> 36:53.840]  And of course, we know who those are. No known plots? You just saw terrorists mixing up hundreds of cups of a chemical weapon.
[36:53.840 --> 37:00.840]  Quickset concrete has four different types of acid in it. It makes concrete fuse together.
[37:00.840 --> 37:04.840]  It'll eat your eyeballs out. Ask anybody. Read the damn package.
[37:04.840 --> 37:09.840]  New video shows Antifa Crobar attack, macing of elderly man.
[37:09.840 --> 37:16.840]  Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com, newswars.com. We're going to go to Paul Watson right now.
[37:16.840 --> 37:26.840]  But please remember, this is why we need your support. America is going in to the most insane times in 1776.
[37:26.840 --> 37:33.840]  The world is going into the most insane time we've seen. There's a major global realignment against tyranny.
[37:33.840 --> 37:40.840]  And all over the world, from Brazil to England to the United States to Germany to Sweden to Russia.
[37:40.840 --> 37:49.840]  They have, Soros funded his sons, the main controller of it, funded Antifa physically attacking people as modern brown shirts.
[37:49.840 --> 37:59.840]  You cannot make the magnitude of this up. And infowars is the vanguard of fighting it and standing against it with our intrepid reporters that go into this.
[37:59.840 --> 38:05.840]  Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett, Owen Shroyer, they met a Shroyer with guns threatened to killing just last year in Austin.
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.840]  The police did nothing because we're a blue city. The police are aiding and abetting this. This is America.
[38:11.840 --> 38:16.840]  They're not going to let Trump win. They're censoring. They're preparing terror attacks.
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.840]  And if Trump doesn't move against them, doesn't matter how popular he is, they will sweep him from office and bring in a reign of terror.
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.840]  Then you'll have a civil war and the Second Amendment in defensive terms will come out.
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.840]  Remember when I got banned off Twitter last year? They said that I said kill journalists with guns.
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.840]  Never said it. They never showed you video. I said Antifa says they're coming to people's houses to kill them.
[38:36.840 --> 38:42.840]  Members of law enforcement, they're doxing you in Congress. You have a right to defend yourself.
[38:42.840 --> 38:45.840]  So be there and understand, have your battle rifles ready.
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.840]  Well, now they're doxing federal law enforcement everywhere and saying they're coming to your house to kill you.
[38:50.840 --> 39:00.840]  And now they're mixing up concrete with acid and throwing it in people's faces and beating them over the head with clubs.
[39:00.840 --> 39:05.840]  They're about to make their move. Paul Joseph Watson of summit.newsandinfullwars.com.
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.840]  You have been at the epicenter. I asked you to come on last week. You were too busy about the threats of acid attacks against ricketers.
[39:11.840 --> 39:18.840]  And now it's happening in America and they say coming up July 4th, they're going to hit everybody at July 4th in D.C.
[39:18.840 --> 39:29.840]  My God, imagine terrorists are going to mix up acid and attack conservatives all over the world and our own governments aren't going to do a damn thing, Paul.
[39:29.840 --> 39:38.840]  Well, there's one congressman that's come out about an hour ago, Alex, and it's up on info was Congressman calls for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror organization.
[39:38.840 --> 39:42.840]  This was already happening back at the start of 2016.
[39:42.840 --> 39:54.840]  You had New Jersey Homeland Security Homeland Security in general telling local and state authorities that Antifa was involved in quote domestic terror activities.
[39:54.840 --> 39:59.840]  So you already had that going back to early 2016. They're still getting away with it.
[39:59.840 --> 40:05.840]  They're now literally threatening acid attacks on a free speech rally next weekend.
[40:05.840 --> 40:15.840]  And the question is, why are they allowed to wear masks, Alex? Police have confiscated weapons from Antifa domestic terrorists before.
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.840]  These masks are only being worn for one reason so they can get away with committing violent crime.
[40:21.840 --> 40:32.840]  OK, so if they come into a protest area with an object which is going to be used in the process of committing a violent crime, why is that not being taken away from them?
[40:32.840 --> 40:38.840]  They can ban the masks and then it's buy by Antifa because they can no longer hide their identities.
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.840]  But finally, we've got a congressman not just saying it needs to be investigated.
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.840]  He said outright declare them a domestic terrorist organization.
[40:47.840 --> 40:54.840]  They're a vowel of violence and routine intimidation, harassment and assault of Americans has no place in our country.
[40:54.840 --> 41:07.840]  So again, will we see any action or will we see potentially acid attacks on mass against Americans standing up for their free speech rights this weekend in Washington, D.C.?
[41:07.840 --> 41:13.840]  Paul, they are organizing. They are serious. They are protected. As you wrote at m4wars.com today.
[41:13.840 --> 41:22.840]  This has all got to go viral, folks. You've got to be the Paul Revere. Fox is barely covering the CNN is praising Antifa as of going live today.
[41:22.840 --> 41:28.840]  If these articles don't get out, people don't even know that concrete was used and they don't even know that it was quick set that's acid.
[41:28.840 --> 41:40.840]  They don't even know about the heads being split open. This is a massive cover up and Antifa is flexing and testing and the police just stood there while all this happened.
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.840]  Yeah, and it's all being organized on Facebook and Twitter. I'm banned on Facebook. You're banned on Facebook. You're banned on Twitter.
[41:47.840 --> 42:02.840]  We know the group behind it. Alex is called Rose City Antifa. They've literally got a post on Facebook right now celebrating the quote amazing success of their people smashing in old men's heads with crowbars,
[42:02.840 --> 42:18.840]  and macing them in the face. They're on Twitter, not being banned, not being suspended on Twitter. They're raising money from a website called rally.org. People need to contact this website called rally.org and ask them do you support domestic terrorism
[42:18.840 --> 42:28.840]  because your platform is being used to raise money for domestic terrorists. They've got a website who hosts their website on this website.
[42:28.840 --> 42:39.840]  They openly dox people. They list their direct address. They talk about Haley Adams who was attacked at one of these events last year, but violently attacked again.
[42:39.840 --> 42:50.840]  They list her exact apartment, her exact address on their website. Who's hosting this website? Why are people who are doxing people who have been proven to commit violent crimes?
[42:50.840 --> 42:58.840]  You could call that attempted crowbar attack. Attempted murder. They're allowed on Twitter, Alex.
[42:58.840 --> 43:08.840]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[43:08.840 --> 43:22.840]  The false claim that you purposely sent Kitty Porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false. It's a smear. Somebody sends you something that's encrypted. You don't even open it.
[43:22.840 --> 43:33.840]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you. This is Kafkaesque. This is bizarre, but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say,
[43:33.840 --> 43:42.840]  Jones sent Kitty Porn is really outrageous. I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[43:42.840 --> 43:52.840]  But I wonder, where are the big boys? Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press? When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[43:52.840 --> 43:58.840]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[43:58.840 --> 44:07.840]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have.
[44:07.840 --> 44:14.840]  There's their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to end here.
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.840]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[44:20.840 --> 44:29.840]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[44:29.840 --> 44:36.840]  That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[44:36.840 --> 44:44.840]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[44:44.840 --> 44:52.840]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[44:52.840 --> 45:18.840]  You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[45:22.840 --> 45:31.840]  And that's it. And it funds the operation. It's a clown world. And we're just living it. Celebrate the circus that is democratic base. This exclusive limited time clown world shirt.
[45:31.840 --> 45:43.840]  1995 really soft nice high quality fabric, whole nine yards for everybody. No reviews yet. And yes, we're running store wide free shipping 50% off the supplements in double patriot points.
[45:43.840 --> 45:56.840]  And that's how we fund this operation. Thanks to you, the amazing audience and this amazing crew. Everybody else we will prevail info or store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[45:56.840 --> 46:04.840]  Please support us today. These sales are big Robert Barnes. What does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies.
[46:04.840 --> 46:11.840]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.840]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this.
[46:16.840 --> 46:23.840]  The ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[46:23.840 --> 46:34.840]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[46:34.840 --> 46:44.840]  The infamous audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[46:44.840 --> 46:51.840]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts.
[46:51.840 --> 46:54.840]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.840]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[46:59.840 --> 47:06.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:06.840 --> 47:11.840]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. All watchers with us for two more segments.
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.840]  We'll be hosting the second hour, fourth hour tomorrow.
[47:16.840 --> 47:39.840]  The second hour today, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, founder of Oath Keepers, is going to be joining us.
[47:39.840 --> 47:46.840]  And then we have Soph coming on the broadcast as well. We'll talk about all the censorship that's been going on.
[47:46.840 --> 47:54.840]  And Gerald Salente and I think Robert Barnes is going to be popping in the last 30 minutes with some information as well.
[47:54.840 --> 48:01.840]  I'm pretty upset right now because see I'm not adapting to being enslaved.
[48:01.840 --> 48:09.840]  I'm not adapting to how they use Islamist, the left does, as their enforcers all over Europe and how they use anti-fun Europe in the U.S.
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.840]  as their vicious enforcers in every blue, cesspit, city or area around beating people up under police protection.
[48:15.840 --> 48:23.840]  I'm adapting and overcoming. I'm upset that my reporters are going to be up there in DC covering this
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.840]  where terrorists are saying they're going to throw acid on people and beat them up with metal bars for no reason
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.840]  for exercising the Fourth of July and our corporate media is defending it and saying they're heroes.
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.840]  I'm upset that Trump isn't doing anything about this.
[48:39.840 --> 48:42.840]  I'm upset that Trump gives lip service about his going to fight censorship.
[48:42.840 --> 48:47.840]  We all get excited. He's going to have a summit coming up on July 11th.
[48:47.840 --> 48:54.840]  Well, guess what? If I go to that summit, I'll be outside bullhorning it to get media attention that we don't have action.
[48:54.840 --> 48:58.840]  I don't care about having my being patted on the head inside.
[48:58.840 --> 49:08.840]  Just like press passes don't do anything in some rotting press office where Obama's picture still hangs up at the White House in the press room.
[49:08.840 --> 49:11.840]  The left is making the revolutionary terrorist move.
[49:11.840 --> 49:19.840]  They've now ratcheted up to organized people handing out concrete acid chemical weapon milkshakes
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.840]  and congressman calls for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror organization.
[49:24.840 --> 49:31.840]  Republican Congressman Jim Banks has called for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror organization following the violence in Portland.
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.840]  The violence. You mean the left viciously attacking anybody and everybody.
[49:36.840 --> 49:39.840]  Get that article out in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[49:39.840 --> 49:42.840]  Send out to everybody you know. We're going to go back to Paul Watson right now.
[49:42.840 --> 49:46.840]  I was just during the break meeting with the warehouse folks.
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.840]  Our products are made in America, distributed in America, you name it.
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.840]  And they said, listen boss, your 50% off sale has been so good, but you only mark stuff up 150%.
[49:57.840 --> 50:00.840]  So what's up with 50% off? We're only making 20, 30%.
[50:00.840 --> 50:05.840]  If that, you're selling out of X2, you're selling out of brain force, you're already selling out of turbo force,
[50:05.840 --> 50:08.840]  you're selling out of bodies, you're selling out of a whole bunch of stuff,
[50:08.840 --> 50:11.840]  you're going to have to end this sale at least on a bunch of products.
[50:11.840 --> 50:20.840]  So the 50% off, store-wide free shipping and double patriot points will end on July 5th
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.840]  because a bunch of stuff is about to sell out. It will end.
[50:24.840 --> 50:29.840]  Now we'll still have some stuff that's on sale because I've habituated everybody to always wanting 50% off.
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.840]  And that's great. We just have to sell a lot of it to be able to operate because there's not a lot of profit.
[50:34.840 --> 50:39.840]  We've only got about 100 left of the Clown World Ultra Limited Edition Clown World T-shirts.
[50:39.840 --> 50:44.840]  That's at infowarstore.com. We have the great new limited edition space shuttle,
[50:44.840 --> 50:47.840]  space force shirt that's so popular and a lot of others.
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.840]  But whatever you do, think about how free speech is under attack and how critical info wars is
[50:53.840 --> 50:57.840]  to be the loud, focused voice pointing out this is a chemical acid attack.
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.840]  You're not seeing that on Fox or CNN. That's the truth. That's how crazy it's gotten.
[51:02.840 --> 51:10.840]  So read the thousands of five star reviews. Everything is 50% off at infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[51:10.840 --> 51:14.840]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. A lot of other big specials as well.
[51:14.840 --> 51:17.840]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[51:17.840 --> 51:20.840]  All right, Paul Watson, you've got the floor of the next 10 minutes.
[51:20.840 --> 51:26.840]  Get into what you predicts coming next, DC, the lack of action on this terror group,
[51:26.840 --> 51:31.840]  the mixing of the chemical weapon in front of everybody, the police standing down.
[51:31.840 --> 51:37.840]  This show is there really going to go the whole way coming into 2020.
[51:37.840 --> 51:47.840]  Well, people forget that Antifa members were actually arrested back in February 2017 for planning an acid attack on Trump supporters.
[51:47.840 --> 51:54.840]  Whether Trump administration is actually going to do anything about literal terrorists trying to target his supporters remains to be seen.
[51:54.840 --> 52:02.840]  But there's a headline from 2017, third arrest made in connection to planned deplorable acid attack.
[52:02.840 --> 52:12.840]  And it was a plan that involved quote, setting off butric acid bombs into the ventilation systems of the National Press Club who was hosting this event.
[52:12.840 --> 52:17.840]  The activists allegedly planned the attack with members of the DC anti fascist coalition.
[52:17.840 --> 52:23.840]  And again, these are some of the same groups that have terrorized Tucker Carlson's family there in DC at his home.
[52:23.840 --> 52:36.840]  Court documents claim the plan was to deploy butric acid near the air ducts and or deploy bottles of butric acid on the floor in order to cause the ball attendees to evacuate the building as a result of the smell.
[52:36.840 --> 52:39.840]  So that was a plan. People were arrested for it.
[52:39.840 --> 52:48.840]  And then we have a new plan today, which is up on info wars dot com and T for member threats to acid attack attendees of DC free speech event.
[52:48.840 --> 52:58.840]  And they got the telegram messages of whoever this individual is, who should be the subject of a FBI or DHS investigation right now.
[52:58.840 --> 53:08.840]  And he's using the pseudonym and he's using the artwork of this journalist who works for Rolling Stone magazine and Playboy magazine.
[53:08.840 --> 53:23.840]  The individual who is the journalist claims that it's not him, even though he's written pro and T for articles in the past, and the guy sending the messages is obviously pro and T for and using his symbology, but he claims it's not him.
[53:23.840 --> 53:29.840]  And he's literally in this telegram group chat saying, you can't fight if you can't see.
[53:29.840 --> 53:39.840]  These are his words. Quo, I just want to toss as many bloons of muriatic acid in the faces of many as of many proud boys as I can.
[53:39.840 --> 53:43.840]  I want to blind as many of you bleep suckers as possible.
[53:43.840 --> 53:48.840]  A nice balloon filled with muriatic acid covered in wax.
[53:48.840 --> 53:59.840]  And the reason they want to cover it in wax as big big league politics explains muriatic acid can be purchased in virtually any pool store or home improvement store.
[53:59.840 --> 54:02.840]  It's dangerous on its own. You can wash it off with water.
[54:02.840 --> 54:06.840]  But by combining it with the axe, it will immediately with a wax.
[54:06.840 --> 54:11.840]  Sorry, it will immediately form a film similar to candle wax on the injured injured person's skin.
[54:11.840 --> 54:16.840]  So then that's a way of getting it into the bloodstream of the intended victim.
[54:16.840 --> 54:19.840]  They're literally talking about this in these telegram.
[54:19.840 --> 54:22.840]  So it's like napalm napalm is meant to stick to your body.
[54:22.840 --> 54:26.840]  So this is an acid that sticks to your body. It's very hard to get off.
[54:26.840 --> 54:29.840]  Yeah, and they plan to do that in the past.
[54:29.840 --> 54:31.840]  They're planning to do it again.
[54:31.840 --> 54:35.840]  Apparently DHS and FBI are now going to provide some kind of security.
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.840]  Are they going to have a presence at this DC free speech rally on the six?
[54:40.840 --> 54:43.840]  So it remains to be seen if they actually do anything.
[54:43.840 --> 54:47.840]  Again, why not confiscate the masks, ban the masks, then they can't turn up
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.840]  because they're wearing the masks because they're committing violent crimes,
[54:51.840 --> 54:53.840]  trying to hide their identities.
[54:53.840 --> 54:56.840]  Think about the magnitude of this, that they're doing this,
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.840]  that it's organized, they're making acid attack stuff in the park in front of the police.
[55:01.840 --> 55:05.840]  This just shows the blue cities are saying they represent illegal aliens now,
[55:05.840 --> 55:06.840]  that we should have borders.
[55:06.840 --> 55:09.840]  Beto O'Rourke is campaigning in Mexico.
[55:09.840 --> 55:12.840]  Major journalists are calling for acid attacks on Nigel Farage.
[55:12.840 --> 55:16.840]  I mean, they've just gone stark raving lunatic mad.
[55:16.840 --> 55:17.840]  No, precisely.
[55:17.840 --> 55:19.840]  And we predicted it all along.
[55:19.840 --> 55:22.840]  The media made a big joke about the milkshake attacks.
[55:22.840 --> 55:24.840]  Oh, it's just a milkshake snowflakes.
[55:24.840 --> 55:25.840]  What you're worried about.
[55:25.840 --> 55:29.840]  Bear in mind, these are the same people who are literally terrified of words
[55:29.840 --> 55:31.840]  and encountering ideas which they disagree with.
[55:31.840 --> 55:33.840]  Oh, but where the snowflakes?
[55:33.840 --> 55:35.840]  Because we don't like being doused with milkshakes.
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.840]  Now the milkshakes have got acid in them.
[55:37.840 --> 55:39.840]  They've got quick drying cement in them.
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.840]  You had bigger left-wing comics on BBC radio shows a few weeks ago,
[55:45.840 --> 55:49.840]  joking about throwing acid on Nigel Farage and other people like that.
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.840]  And to segue, Alex, meanwhile in the UK,
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.840]  they're literally treating the guy who bravely fought off the terrorists
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.840]  during the London Bridge attack where dozens of people were slashed,
[56:03.840 --> 56:05.840]  eight people killed.
[56:05.840 --> 56:10.840]  Now the guy who literally fought off the terrorists and said, by the way,
[56:10.840 --> 56:13.840]  revealed that during the attack the jihadists were saying, quote,
[56:13.840 --> 56:16.840]  this is for Allah, Islam, Islam, Islam.
[56:16.840 --> 56:19.840]  That's what the terrorists said according to this victim who was there on the scene.
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.840]  He was literally being slashed in the neck in the head,
[56:23.840 --> 56:24.840]  biting them off.
[56:24.840 --> 56:25.840]  Let's be clear.
[56:25.840 --> 56:27.840]  They killed eight people, stabbed 30.
[56:27.840 --> 56:30.840]  He charged them and basically said that, you know, I'm British.
[56:30.840 --> 56:31.840]  I'm not going to back down.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.840]  They stabbed him all over his body.
[56:33.840 --> 56:36.840]  He's a hero and now he has to go to a reeducation center.
[56:36.840 --> 56:37.840]  Tell me about it.
[56:37.840 --> 56:40.840]  Yeah, he's been part in the UK government.
[56:40.840 --> 56:42.840]  He's been part on the terror watch list.
[56:42.840 --> 56:43.840]  Okay.
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.840]  He's been forced to attend de-radicalization classes
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.840]  because some anti-Islam activists in the UK contacted him.
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.840]  So now he's a suspected potential terrorist simply because they contacted him.
[56:57.840 --> 56:59.840]  He should have been given a medal.
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.840]  They should have given him the George Cross, which is the highest civilian award that you can get
[57:03.840 --> 57:08.840]  for fight literally fighting off Jihadists as they mowed down people in vans
[57:08.840 --> 57:10.840]  and stabbed people in the neck.
[57:10.840 --> 57:12.840]  This guy is now on a terror watch list.
[57:12.840 --> 57:14.840]  This is the situation we're at.
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.840]  Meanwhile, the British army says that if you describe yourself as a patriot,
[57:18.840 --> 57:21.840]  that's a sign of dangerous right-wing extremism.
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.840]  This is the clown world that we live in, in the UK right now.
[57:25.840 --> 57:26.840]  That's right.
[57:26.840 --> 57:27.840]  Let's probably come back.
[57:27.840 --> 57:30.840]  The British government, what a month ago, put out flyers saying,
[57:30.840 --> 57:34.840]  look out for people that like the UK, that want to be in Brexit
[57:34.840 --> 57:38.840]  and that like to be British or Scottish or Irish.
[57:38.840 --> 57:39.840]  That's bad.
[57:39.840 --> 57:41.840]  The army is watching you.
[57:41.840 --> 57:43.840]  You, the muzzle wants to stab you.
[57:43.840 --> 57:44.840]  You stretch your neck up.
[57:44.840 --> 57:46.840]  You say, right here, sir.
[57:49.840 --> 57:53.840]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[57:53.840 --> 57:57.840]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off,
[57:57.840 --> 58:01.840]  but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[58:01.840 --> 58:03.840]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[58:03.840 --> 58:05.840]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.840]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[58:09.840 --> 58:12.840]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[58:12.840 --> 58:15.840]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[58:15.840 --> 58:17.840]  I want to expand, not contract.
[58:17.840 --> 58:19.840]  And for six months, we've not just been able to stand still.
[58:19.840 --> 58:20.840]  The enemy's been winning.
[58:20.840 --> 58:24.840]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[58:24.840 --> 58:25.840]  I like to be expanding.
[58:25.840 --> 58:26.840]  I like to be winning.
[58:26.840 --> 58:27.840]  I like to be fighting.
[58:27.840 --> 58:28.840]  And we are winning the Info War.
[58:28.840 --> 58:29.840]  That's why we're so hated.
[58:29.840 --> 58:30.840]  But we need to be retreaded.
[58:30.840 --> 58:31.840]  We need to be tuned up.
[58:31.840 --> 58:32.840]  We need to be fixed up.
[58:32.840 --> 58:34.840]  We never have time to get it to dry out.
[58:34.840 --> 58:35.840]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[58:35.840 --> 58:37.840]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[58:37.840 --> 58:40.840]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[58:40.840 --> 58:42.840]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[58:42.840 --> 58:46.840]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the tricombs.
[58:46.840 --> 58:50.840]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[59:17.840 --> 59:20.840]  The audience determines what content goes up.
[59:20.840 --> 59:24.840]  The audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars.
[59:24.840 --> 59:35.840]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that.
[59:35.840 --> 59:42.840]  And at the same time, support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[59:42.840 --> 59:49.840]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:18.840]  All right, Stuart Rhodes is coming up in about 10 minutes, founder of the Oathkeepers to give us his expert take on this.
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:28.840]  But Paul, you were saying during the break that this even shocks you that organized asset attacks, mainstream media calling for asset attacks in the U.S., in the U.K. against public officials.
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:40.840]  Doxing of law enforcement homes saying they're coming to kill them, publicly mixing up asset attack milkshakes in the park, beating people's heads in, burning their skin off.
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:45.840]  And they're just getting started and CNN says, great job. Keep it up.
[1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:58.840]  Well, the thing that shocked me the most this morning was this had they've literally took the hero of the London Bridge terror attacks, the guy that valiantly fought off the terrorists.
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:00.840]  He's called the Lion of London Bridge.
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:10.840]  This stems back to the fact that he screamed F U I Millwall to the terrorists as two of them were simultaneously literally stabbing him in the neck.
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:17.840]  Millwall is a football team in London who are noted for liking to get in fights. Let's just put it that way.
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:21.840]  But this guy was rightly lionized and celebrated after the attack.
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:30.840]  He was in hospital with 80 stitches to his head, ear, arms, hands and neck after literally fighting off two terrorists.
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:45.840]  Okay, this is why he's in the deradicalization program because he dared to tell the public what the terrorists were saying while they were carrying out this attack, which was, quote, this is for Allah and, quote, Islam, Islam, Islam.
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:55.840]  Now there's a video, horrifying video, but from that attack when the terrorists are literally killing people from somebody who's coward under a chair or a table in a restaurant.
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:01.840]  And somebody else shouts out, it might even have been this guy, Roy Lorna, the Lion of London Bridge.
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:06.840]  Someone else shouts out, oh, this is effing Muslims, which it was.
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:11.840]  And the Muslims carrying out the attack were saying this is for Allah, this is for Islam.
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:25.840]  So in the video, someone shouts out, this is effing Muslims. And then one of the victims, to illustrate the Stockholm syndrome, literally says in the moment when he's cowering from Islamic terrorists, oh, no, this is not Muslims, shut up.
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:38.840]  So he's literally denying that it's an Islamic terror attack while the terrorists are saying it's an Islamic terror attack while he's literally cowering under a table because it's more important to be politically correct than dead.
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:43.840]  So on the flip side, you've got this Roy Lorna, who was the hero of the whole thing.
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:52.840]  Now he's been put on a terror watch list by the government, and he's been forced to attend deradicalization classes.
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:56.840]  He says, quote, they treat me like a terrorist, but I'm not political at all.
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:02:58.840]  So he wasn't even political.
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:01.840]  And they've put him in this database, they've put him on this program.
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:12.840]  Meanwhile, as I mentioned, we had another story from back in May, British army safe people who describe themselves as patriots are extremist right wingers.
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:21.840]  Now bear in mind, just like in America, in many cases, the army itself is being taken over by these social engineers.
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  So they put out a TV commercial trying to recruit Muslims into the British army by showing the Muslim soldier doing a Muslim prayer while on operation, while in full British army uniform.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:43.840]  Problem is that hasn't really worked, Alex, because more British Muslims joined ISIS than joined the British army didn't really work out.
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.840]  But then it got even worse because they put out this leaflet, the British army.
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:51.840]  And it says, extreme right wing indicators and warnings.
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:55.840]  And this is what they list as indications of right wing extremism.
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:03.840]  People who describe multicultural towns as lost, people who use the term is Lamo fascism, which is used by academics and everyone.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  People who refer to political correctness as a left wing plot, people who are angry about the loss of national identity, people who make inaccurate generalizations about the left or government.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  That's so vague, it could mean anything.
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:23.840]  People who refer to those who challenge any of these views as being indoctrinated, and they include describing oneself as a quote,
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  patriot is an indication of right wing extremism.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:34.840]  So they're literally saying that if you say you're a patriot who wants to join the British army, you're probably a right wing extremist.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  Meanwhile, they're putting out television commercials trying to recruit Muslims into the British army.
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:43.840]  Paul, stay there, I want to ask you what you think is coming next.
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.840]  Stay there, I want you to tell us what you think is coming next.
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:51.840]  And then, the founder of O Keepers joining us to give us his analysis on all this, the collapsing border and more.
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:05:17.840]  In 60 seconds, infowars.com, newswars.com, summit.news.
[1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:30.840]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:34.840]  There has never been a more important time to support infowars.
[1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:41.840]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:44.840]  Order now at the infowars store.
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of patriot blend coffee delivered right to your door at infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:25.840]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:36.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, the lion of London Bridge that stopped a bunch of Muslims who had stabbed eight people to death, run over a bunch of others, injured 30 others.
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:45.840]  He fought them off, he was stabbed more than 30 times, had over 50 stitches just in his neck, and they tried to slit his throat, but missed his carotid arteries.
[1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:49.840]  It's absolutely incredible. Let me just show people a photo of this right now.
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.840]  Doc McChamp shot please. Let me just look at his neck right there. Absolutely insane.
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:07:00.840]  Stabbed over and over again, he has been sent to a reeducation camp. That's what it is.
[1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:07.840]  He's been sent for anti extremist training because someone in the crowd while they were being stabbed said, oh, it's damn Muslims.
[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:15.840]  We're not joking. Paul Watson just covered that. And it's just in the news. Well, he's on probation now. He's going for reeducation.
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:24.840]  These are globalist taking over our countries. That's why Beto O'Rourke has gone to Mexico to organize the next invasion force.
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:29.840]  When he was running for Senate, he was bragging, oh, three caravans got in last week.
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:35.840]  Because, you know, we're putting them in concentration camps. Paul Joseph Watson looking at the anti-chemical attacks,
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:45.840]  mixing up the hundreds of glasses of quick set concrete to put people's eyes out, splitting people's heads open.
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:52.840]  And this happened Saturday and Fox News was saying, oh, you know, oh, somebody got hit in the head with a milkshake.
[1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:57.840]  No, people have had their heads split open. They have had acid attacks on them.
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:01.840]  If you or I did this to a leftist, we'd go to prison immediately. The police would do something.
[1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:06.840]  Why is the left seen as God and able to engage in any crimes they want?
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:11.840]  And what do you predict this 4th of July with the coddled Antifa, most of them government workers,
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:19.840]  saying they're coming to D.C. to try to stop Trump's 4th of July rally pledging to attack people with acid?
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:26.840]  Well, the media is never going to admit that these are violent domestic terrorists because their narrative radicalized them in the first place.
[1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:33.840]  That's the whole point. They're responsible for it by putting out this ridiculous narrative that some soy boy in a mask,
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:42.840]  some run in a mask is on the same level as the troops storming the beaches of Normandy in that absurd comparison that they did a couple of years ago,
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.840]  which by the way, people like Chris Cuomo on CNN actually supported.
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:57.840]  They literally compared these runs to British soldiers who are actually fighting Nazi troops on the beaches in France.
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:04.840]  But what's going to happen? Probably at some point you've had ISIS's own propaganda magazine come out and say,
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:09.840]  look, we broadly support the same goals as the extreme left in America.
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:13.840]  Let's work together. Let's give them weapons. Let's give them training.
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.840]  There was an FBI field manual, which we reported on last year, I think it was.
[1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:22.840]  Can't find the articles anymore, Alex, because Google broke its own search engine.
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:24.840]  So there's no way I'm going to find them.
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:34.840]  Well, I reported on it for info wars where it was, again, antifa, far left radicals and ISIS Islamic terrorists looking to work together.
[1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:38.840]  You had a guy who tried to massacre vast numbers of people.
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:45.840]  This came out December 2017. Pius, 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump and Tifa supporter.
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:54.840]  OK, Muslim convert called every Aaron Jamison who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pia 39 in San Francisco.
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:01.840]  You go on his Facebook page, he likes Antifa, he likes Al Jazeera, he likes Buzzfeed, he likes CNN.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:07.840]  Of course, whenever anyone pops off a right wing extremist, which we denounce because we denounce all political violence,
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:13.840]  if he so much does like one of your tweets five years ago, then you're responsible for his violence.
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:17.840]  This guy was literally straight out of Antifa casting.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.840]  He was a Muslim convert, planned a massacre, and that story disappeared.
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:23.840]  It barely made the news.
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:27.840]  So the threat, obviously, is when are they going to start working together?
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:33.840]  And that is hopefully why federal authorities actually have to be on this now and treating it seriously,
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:38.840]  given what happened in Portland on Saturday.
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:43.840]  What do you make of Ted Cruz coming out and saying he wants the Portland mayor investigated?
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:47.840]  The Portland mayor has admittedly ordered police stand-downs and the police sit there, I guess,
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:51.840]  because they're leftists or want their paycheck and allow even children to be attacked,
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:54.840]  people to be attacked with acid and metal clubs.
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.840]  That is violating their oath of office.
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:58.840]  They're aiding and abetting terrorism now.
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:03.840]  I absolutely agree we need to see that mayor in chains.
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.840]  Well, the guy who got smashed in the head with the metal pipe with the lacerations
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.840]  and absolutely shocked that he didn't get brain damage or something, he's very lucky.
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  He said that his problem was not with the police because they actually came
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:20.840]  to actually try and file a report and try and investigate it.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:22.840]  So he's blaming Wheeler.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:24.840]  He's blaming the mayor.
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.840]  You know, how much of it is the police doing a stand-down because last year they did start
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:32.840]  confiscating the weapons in Portland from Antifa members.
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:35.840]  That obviously didn't happen on Saturday.
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:39.840]  So it looks like once again, it's coming from the mayor, it's coming from Wheeler,
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:42.840]  this stand-down order, and it's to what extent you blame the police,
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:44.840]  to what extent you blame the mayor.
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:48.840]  But this guy himself, the victim, directly blamed the mayor.
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:52.840]  And you've also got to blame verified check marks on Twitter,
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:57.840]  some of them who work in the mainstream media, people like Sarah Gailey,
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:00.840]  with a verified Twitter user who said, quote,
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:03.840]  while this is all happening, if we can't throw milkshakes,
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:06.840]  I guess we'll just have to go back to bricks,
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:11.840]  literally advocating violent crime and domestic terrorism
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:13.840]  under a verified Twitter account.
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:16.840]  The tweet wasn't even deleted as last time.
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:18.840]  And Paul, let's expand on that.
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:20.840]  If you watch the videos, we have a one-minute boil-down.
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:22.840]  We've been rolling for TV viewers.
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.840]  We have all unedited hours of them on infowars.com and newswars.com,
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.840]  that the audience must get out to warn the public about,
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:31.840]  because mainstream media is soft-soaping this or whitewashing it.
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:35.840]  Even Fox News is, some of the, quote, milkshakes, nothing comes out.
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:39.840]  They're hardened, they're bricks, camouflaged in a cup.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  Others are still liquid and burn their faces.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.840]  You're actually more lucky to be hit by the brick than by the acid.
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.840]  These are assaults with deadly weapons, assaults with chemical weapons.
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  This is just unprecedented,
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:57.840]  and it just shows the ratcheting up towards 2020 as America turns towards the left
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:59.840]  as they turn against them.
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:02.840]  They're just going to get more and more out of control.
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.840]  Yeah, and it's when people are going to start paying attention.
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:07.840]  I mean, you had Farage being attacked.
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:09.840]  You've had other people in the UK being attacked.
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:13.840]  Matt Gaetz was attacked with a milkshake on June 1st,
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:15.840]  the Republican congressman.
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:20.840]  Now it's come out that a staffer who is on the campaign of Mayor Pete
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:24.840]  is now advocating that he be attacked with your in next time.
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:26.840]  So they always want to step it up.
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:30.840]  So it's whether it gets to the level where you have actual lawmakers,
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:34.840]  elected congressmen and women being viciously attacked, not just with milkshakes.
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:36.840]  Paul, it's already happened, remember?
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:40.840]  The crazy guy went from Illinois because he was mad at Trump,
[1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:43.840]  tried to kill the 18 members of the conservative caucus,
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:45.840]  but there was security there and took him out.
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:50.840]  But not before he shot the congressman from Louisiana.
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:53.840]  I mean, this is the reality of what's happening.
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:59.840]  And then even CNN crazed the guy, not as a terrorist, but as a hero.
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:03.840]  Wolf Blitzer had guests on saying he was a hero going after the evil people
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.840]  and shooting congressman's police.
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.840]  Yeah, James T. Hodgkinson, Bernie Sanders fan,
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:14.840]  was screaming about healthcare when he was trying to massacre a bunch of Republican congressmen.
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:17.840]  Then you had the guy who remember before the election,
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  rushed the stage and tried to violently attack Donald Trump
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:24.840]  while he was given a speech in front of Air Force One.
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:29.840]  What happened to him in the media, the next day he was given a sympathetic platform,
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.840]  he was lionized by CNN and others.
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:33.840]  So this is the whole point.
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:38.840]  The radicalization process itself has come from the mainstream media,
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:42.840]  which is now why they can't suddenly disavow Antifa
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:47.840]  because they've been in for the duration with them from the very start.
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:49.840]  So that's why, I mean, to be fair, there were a few,
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:52.840]  like even Brian Stelter had to decry it.
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:54.840]  Jake Tapper had to decry it.
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:56.840]  So the dam is breaking a little bit,
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:01.840]  but then you've still got hundreds on Twitter who still advocate violent terrorism.
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:02.840]  And they've got...
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:05.840]  And Twitter is allowing it and condoning it and boosting it.
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:09.840]  And in closing, I've been sued by Georgetown University,
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:13.840]  claiming I said some photographer killed that woman in Clarksville,
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:15.840]  or whatever it was in Virginia.
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:16.840]  Charlottesville.
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:18.840]  Charlottesville, teleprompter-free folks.
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:20.840]  No, I said Antifa was funded by Soros,
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.840]  the police stood down, hurted him together,
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:25.840]  knowing there'd be an explosion,
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:28.840]  and then the media tried to brand Antifa as heroes then,
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:29.840]  which they're not.
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:31.840]  And so that's why they're pissed at suing me,
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:34.840]  is because I talked about their little darling meth-head professors
[1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.840]  that dress up like Batman and go out and attack women and children.
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:39.840]  Paul, you're kicking butt with your prolific writing
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:42.840]  at newswars.com, infowars.com,
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:44.840]  and summit.news, the great site you're commanding.
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:46.840]  And we commend you, keep it up, my friend,
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:48.840]  and you're hosting tomorrow in the fourth hour.
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:49.840]  Thank you, Paul.
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:50.840]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:52.840]  All right, for the rest of the hour,
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:54.840]  Stuart Rhodes is straight ahead of both keepers.
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:16:05.840]  This is critical.
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:16:58.840]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain,
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:01.840]  the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:04.840]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:06.840]  without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:09.840]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News,
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:12.840]  blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:14.840]  in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:16.840]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:19.840]  during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment
[1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:22.840]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets,
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:24.840]  not a security IPO or note.
[1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:26.840]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:29.840]  equipment sale leaseback program with a 27%
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:33.840]  annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:34.840]  each month.
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:36.840]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today.
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:39.840]  Call 800-600-3388.
[1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:42.840]  That's 800-600-3388.
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.840]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.840]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:49.840]  800-600-3388.
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:51.840]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:53.840]  who consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:55.840]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:58.840]  an offering document.
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:01.840]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people,
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:03.840]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:06.840]  all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:08.840]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:11.840]  and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:13.840]  and how they were the best and why they were,
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:15.840]  and I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:17.840]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like,
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:19.840]  hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:21.840]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:23.840]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:25.840]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:27.840]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:29.840]  And he claims they're supplements.
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:31.840]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:34.840]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:37.840]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:39.840]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them,
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:42.840]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:44.840]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[1:18:44.840 --> 1:18:46.840]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:48.840]  They have side effects, not with mother nature,
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:50.840]  but with mother nature.
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:22.840]  In fact, the founders were so concerned with,
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:25.840]  at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.840]  and subsidize organizations just like this
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:29.840]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.840]  And then ultimately, we now live in an era
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:33.840]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:36.840]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:39.840]  and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:41.840]  or express or hear.
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:43.840]  And the M4's audience has broken through that.
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:46.840]  They are the bridge from the founding to the end of the century.
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:49.840]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.840]  ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:53.840]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:20:22.840]  of the platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:51.840]  Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, you have photos.
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:57.840]  You have video of terrorists cooking chemical attacks
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:00.840]  in a Portland park right by the police
[1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:05.840]  and then coming out and doing it, launching the attack.
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:09.840]  And it's not even national news.
[1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:12.840]  Quick set concrete and put your eyes out.
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:14.840]  But also, they were letting it harden.
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:15.840]  They were really bricks.
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:17.840]  And they said, we're going to go out and attack.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:20.840]  They split people's heads open
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:21.840]  and they did it all.
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:25.840]  Organized criminal activity, organizing for assaults
[1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:30.840]  with deadly weapons, mixing quick set concrete
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:32.840]  with the lime and four types of acid in it.
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:36.840]  Anybody's ever worked with quick set concrete?
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:38.840]  No, you've got to drop it in your eye.
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:39.840]  It's like bleach.
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:40.840]  It can blind you.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:42.840]  One time, I wouldn't listen to these guys.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:43.840]  Like, man, you better be careful.
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:47.840]  I was working on a construction site and it was almost set.
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:50.840]  And I was sitting there just playing around with it, patting on it,
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:52.840]  and it burned my hands.
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:55.840]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers Army Veteran,
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:57.840]  has also practiced as a constitutional lawyer,
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:21:59.840]  joins us to give us his take on this.
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:03.840]  Beto O'Rourke going and campaigning for a president in Mexico.
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:04.840]  That's even AP's headline.
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:08.840]  We're going to talk about the left clearly is going into a revolutionary mode.
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:14.840]  It's a Marxist, Leninist mode with a malice mindset from my research.
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:19.840]  Stuart, what would you call this incredible period we're in right now?
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  I think it's Weather Underground part two.
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:26.840]  I think it's the same exact pattern you saw in the late 60s, early 70s,
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:31.840]  except now, as you've already noted, they've got a mass of new voters.
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.840]  And they're replacing Americans with new voters from other countries
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:37.840]  through illegal immigration and mass.
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:40.840]  That's why all of the Democratic candidates,
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:42.840]  they were talking to their new constituency.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:44.840]  They weren't talking to American citizens.
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:47.840]  So President Trump is going to take decisive action right now.
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:51.840]  In addition to declaring an antifa terrorist organization,
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.840]  he should go ahead and just federalize the National Guard
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:57.840]  and deploy them into both California and Oregon.
[1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:00.840]  And while he's there, not just press antifa,
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:08.840]  but also start rounding up illegal aliens and deporting them using the National Guard, frankly.
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:09.840]  That's what he has to do.
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:13.840]  Absolutely. And they'll call that martial law.
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:17.840]  Now, we have foreign powers, the Chai comms, and others funding revolution.
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:20.840]  We have the Democratic Party calling for violence in the streets.
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:24.840]  We have this video, a play next segment of all these Democrats calling for violence
[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:27.840]  against Republicans and against their supporters.
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:33.840]  You have major talk show hosts on the BBC calling for Nigel Farage to be acid attack.
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:38.840]  They're saying they're going to attack the 4th of July all over Twitter and Facebook with acid.
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:41.840]  They just attacked a bunch of people with acid in Portland
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:45.840]  and CNN's calling them heroes and Fox is barely reporting it.
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:47.840]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:48.840]  It is.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:51.840]  So we should recognize we're already in a civil war.
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:53.840]  We've talked about this before with Matt Bracken.
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:56.840]  We've been in a cold civil war for years.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:59.840]  But the left, I believe, is ramping it up.
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:02.840]  And we should just go ahead and just pull the trigger right now
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:06.840]  in the form of President Trump declaring what it is
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:10.840]  and declaring an insurrection and deploying the military on the border to seal it.
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.840]  And then internally, you should use a National Guard and as you call on us,
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:16.840]  the retired military veterans out there in particular,
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:19.840]  and bring us in the service too as the militia.
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:20.840]  We should do.
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:22.840]  And of course, what's happening is his advisors are telling him,
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:23.840]  well, you can't do this.
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:24.840]  You can't go after them.
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:27.840]  You can't go after the sanctuary cities or sanctuary states.
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.840]  You can't do any of these things or the country will explode.
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:32.840]  Well, let it explode.
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:34.840]  Let it explode now while he's commander-in-chief.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:35.840]  Let's get it over with.
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:38.840]  Because otherwise, what's going to happen is they're going to steal the election.
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:42.840]  I mean, the judicial watch already came out and said at least a million and a half.
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  I think it's very low.
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:46.840]  A million and a half illegal aliens voted in midterms.
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:48.840]  I think it's far higher than that.
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:49.840]  So I think-
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:50.840]  That's just in California.
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:52.840]  They just won their lawsuit.
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:54.840]  In California, it's 1.5 million.
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.840]  That just broke JudicialWatch.org.
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:57.840]  Absolutely.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:59.840]  Proving that Trump was right when he said 3.5 million nationwide.
[1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:02.840]  I bet it was more like 10 million.
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:03.840]  Yeah, I think so too.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:04.840]  I think it's far higher.
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:08.840]  And it'll probably be closer to 20 million those next year for 2020.
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:09.840]  That's what they're doing.
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:15.840]  And it's the only reason why all of them are catering to, you know, speaking in Spanish
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:20.840]  and catering to the illegal aliens, promising them free healthcare, promising them to decriminalize
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:21.840]  being in the United States.
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  In other words, carte blanche.
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:23.840]  You come here, you can stay here.
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:25.840]  You won't be deported in the end of ICE.
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:29.840]  And they say on the stage, all Hispanics are insulted by us having borders.
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:31.840]  Most Hispanics, I know, aren't insane.
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:32.840]  They don't want open borders.
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:34.840]  They know it's people all over the world coming in.
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:37.840]  You had some ancestors that came from Mexico, but they came here legally.
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:38.840]  Right.
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:43.840]  And that's the reality is a lot of American patriots in the Hispanic community are also
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:46.840]  very much in favor of secure borders.
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:47.840]  This is complete nonsense.
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:50.840]  So all that really is, is the standard leftist tool.
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:56.840]  All they have is to call us all racist and fascist and xenophobic while they go ahead
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:58.840]  and replace Americans of every color.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:03.840]  Black, Hispanic, we're all being replaced with someone from a third world country who
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:08.840]  has been given a free ride and be given, you know, they get $1,000 on their cards and
[1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:09.840]  free housing.
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:11.840]  Stuart, we're going to walk through all that in the next segment.
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:14.840]  I'm going to try to give you the floor because you're an expert on the border and have spent
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:18.840]  thousands of days down there in the last decade covering it all and where you predict this
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:19.840]  is going.
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:21.840]  But I want to say something.
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:24.840]  What you said is incredibly profound.
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:29.840]  And it's so profound that we almost just can't come on air and just kind of halfway talk about
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:30.840]  it.
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:37.840]  So I want to come back and I want to specifically get in to what you just said because it's true.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:38.840]  I don't want a violent revolution.
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:41.840]  I don't want to offensively launch anything.
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:45.840]  But when the left is terrorist, they're far and funded.
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:46.840]  They say we don't believe in free speech.
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:47.840]  We're going to open for the government.
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:50.840]  We're going to kill our political opposition.
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:52.840]  And they're out there chemical attacking people.
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:55.840]  They're saying we're going to attack for the July Parades.
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:57.840]  The mainstream media is promoting it.
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:26:59.840]  The borders have broken down.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:03.840]  The leftist Congress won't act and is blocking the president.
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:04.840]  We're already here.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:09.840]  We've already been brought into this crisis and we have the entire democratic stage of
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:14.840]  20 people speaking in Spanish and pandering to those outside the country and Beto going
[1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:17.840]  to Mexico saying let's tear down the border and invade.
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:19.840]  This is the globalist onslaught.
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:22.840]  This is America facing fifth generation warfare.
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:24.840]  This is the globalist movement.
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:25.840]  What you said is so profound.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:26.840]  We come back.
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  We want to give you the floor as your military background, constitutional lawyer background,
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:34.840]  but also just a man who's been trained on the streets of this country traveling to all
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:40.840]  50 states and predicting this over a decade ago that Trump's in now.
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:41.840]  Imagine if Hillary was in.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:43.840]  Imagine if they assassinated him.
[1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:46.840]  Imagine, and again, we're going to win this physical civil war.
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:48.840]  But I predict it's going to kill millions.
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  They're going to start the fight.
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  We're going to defend ourselves.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:53.840]  They've already been punching us in the nose.
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  They're going to label us terrorists.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:58.840]  They're going to order Blue City police to come after us, and then it's all going to
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:27:59.840]  kick off.
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:02.840]  And it's going to be Katie bar the door and then they're going to call it a race war
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:05.840]  and going to trick a lot of folks into a race war.
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:09.840]  And the country is going to descend into a black hole.
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:14.840]  It's going to descend into a warlord state for several years.
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:16.840]  I would predict at least five years.
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:18.840]  And the blue cities will starve to death.
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:20.840]  We're going to have to quarantine those cities.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.840]  And we need to, let's talk about, is there time to turn it around, but let's work in
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:28.840]  the scenarios of having to quarantine the blue cities as the best move during the civil
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:29.840]  war.
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:34.840]  And we know Trump's got the military for now and what the real divides are in the civil
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:35.840]  war.
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.840]  But it's time to really be honest about all this and why they got so upset about me last
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:44.840]  year when I said, Antifa says they're coming to your houses to kill you.
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.840]  You need to have your battle rivals ready.
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:50.840]  We're already in a civil war.
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  They went on errands that I call for violence.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:53.840]  They want to be banned.
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.840]  No, they knew that I was aware of their plan and said, get ready.
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:02.840]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate.com.
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:06.840]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:07.840]  my family to freedom.
[1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:12.840]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:15.840]  with our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:08.840]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:14.840]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:19.840]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,

[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:54.840]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:56.840]  We're not going to back down.
[2:30:56.840 --> 2:31:01.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:31:01.840 --> 2:31:04.840]  Infowars and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:07.840]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:11.840]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how
[2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:15.840]  much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:18.840]  you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and
[2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:19.840]  found out the truth.
[2:31:19.840 --> 2:31:24.840]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:25.840]  my heart.
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:26.840]  I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:30.840]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and
[2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:34.840]  your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[2:31:34.840 --> 2:31:38.840]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun.
[2:31:38.840 --> 2:31:39.840]  But that's not what's important.
[2:31:39.840 --> 2:31:41.840]  The enemy could win.
[2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:43.840]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[2:31:43.840 --> 2:31:44.840]  We're being used by God.
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:45.840]  You're being used by God.
[2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:46.840]  This is Providence.
[2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:50.840]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[2:31:50.840 --> 2:31:56.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:00.840]  I talk about this on the air and I know it stinks into people, but I've decided that
[2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:04.840]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[2:32:04.840 --> 2:32:07.840]  before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:10.840]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were.
[2:32:10.840 --> 2:32:13.840]  And I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:16.840]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:17.840]  shut us down.
[2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:20.840]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:21.840]  wonderful they were.
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:23.840]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:27.840]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:33.840]  Now under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:35.840]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:39.840]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:42.840]  system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:44.840]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:48.840]  They have side effects, not with mother nature, but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:50.840]  God's medicine chest.
[2:32:50.840 --> 2:33:07.840]  Tell us.
[2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:19.840]  And now here we are.
[2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:26.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting in Uruguay, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:26.840 --> 2:33:31.840]  Well, Soph is 14. She's been on the internet for a couple years. She has millions of followers.
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:35.840]  Her average video is about a half million views, and that's what the shadow band she's under.
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:41.840]  Well, she talked about Greta Thunberg and got so many strikes on her YouTube, it was frozen.
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:47.840]  It's bullying. If you talk about a 16-year-old climate activist, that means pay the Rockefellers,
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:52.840]  pay Obama, pay the globalist carbon taxes, literally, at the Chicago and London mercantile.
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:58.840]  That's like when I was criticizing David Hogg last year, when he was literally saying I was a horrible person, a criminal,
[2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:04.840]  and I would criticize him when he was giving speeches to 10,000 people, and they banned me.
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:08.840]  They said, you do not talk about David Hogg, who's 17 years old.
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:13.840]  And so I was asking, why no videos for two months? Well, she's been locked out of her account for two months
[2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:19.840]  because I guess she talked about Greta Thunberg. Tell us about that. So you're 14, but you don't get to have your opinion.
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:21.840]  I guess you said something mean about her?
[2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:27.840]  I didn't really say anything mean. I mean, the worst thing I said was she had a square head,
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:32.840]  but I said, like, fellow square head, and YouTube just classified it as harassment and cyberbullying,
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:36.840]  even though she's way more famous and, you know, two years older than I am.
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:40.840]  And I tried to appeal the strike, but they still haven't gotten back to me on it.
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:44.840]  I guess that's a tactic they use. They just don't respond to your appeals.
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:46.840]  I mean, I just think it's insane.
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:55.840]  Well, Antifa was caught on video loading hundreds of acid bombs that they threw at people
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:35:00.840]  and beat people over the head with steel bars, splitting their skulls open, but that's okay.
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:05.840]  But if you disagree with someone saying the world's ending in 12 years like AOC or Greta Thunberg,
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:11.840]  you're the bad person. How dare you a 14-year-old young woman criticize one of their Lord and Saviors?
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:15.840]  I know. It's just crazy. I think, yeah, she's like one of their protected people,
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  because I think she's very effective at getting the message across to young people.
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:25.840]  And that's what I commented on. I mean, I think she's, you know, just being used as a tool
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:29.840]  to push the message of, oh, yeah, the government's just trying to collect more taxes.
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:35.840]  It's just an effort for, you know, the whole climate change thing is probably just exaggerated
[2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:41.840]  by, you know, government employed scientists to collect more taxes through a carbon tax or whatever.
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:42.840]  Greta Thunberg.
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.840]  The world's ending. Please pay all the money to AOC or I'm dead.
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:51.840]  And don't criticize that plan, even though only a few countries have to do it,
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:54.840]  and then we won't be able to economically operate against China.
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:36:00.840]  And China and Saudi Arabia have been actually funding us to shut down our energy so we can only buy it from them.
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:04.840]  But that's okay. I'm Greta Thunberg.
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  Wow.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:12.840]  I mean, it's, well, she's very articulate, and that's probably the main reason they've been striking her.
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:16.840]  If she was not articulate and she wasn't effective and she wasn't savvy at technology,
[2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:18.840]  she wouldn't be targeted in this manner.
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:23.840]  The idea is that essentially there's a safe space for only protected ideas and protected classes,
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:27.840]  and everyone else is subject to harassment, to targeting, to censorship,
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:29.840]  to physical assault has happened this weekend.
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:31.840]  It's a sad situation.
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:35.840]  And Google calls that internal documents, Project Veritas video, fairness.
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:38.840]  It's fair to suppress you, Soph.
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:45.840]  Yeah. I've been keen to the whole, you know, Google bias for like a year and a half now.
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:49.840]  So I'm not surprised with any of this Project Veritas stuff that's coming out.
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  I think it's just, you know, to be expected because it's so clear the bias that they put out on people like me
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:02.840]  while they just propel Greta Thunberg to the top of everything, to top of, you know, recommended videos or whatever else.
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:08.840]  It's amazing. Let's talk about millennials. Let's talk about, because we're not saying all millennials are bad,
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:12.840]  but statistically they steal more. They don't give to charity, but they tell you how to live your life.
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:19.840]  More than half of them identify as communists with their smartphones and $200 skinny jeans and $200 sunglasses.
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:25.840]  What's wrong in your view, Robert Barnes? I mean, even the Atlantic says the boomers ruined everything.
[2:37:25.840 --> 2:37:31.840]  They gave birth to the millennials. Maybe Generation Z will save us.
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:38.840]  Well, I mean, I think what happened is there's good articulation of this by various sociology professors
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:40.840]  and other political science professors.
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:43.840]  Sociological is a hard word to say. Exactly. That's what I'm trying to get to.
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:49.840]  But essentially what happened was this safe space culture was impregnated into the boomer class
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:52.840]  as they were raising their kids because of the kidnapping scares
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:56.840]  and the various childcare scares that took place in the late 80s, early 90s.
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:37:58.840]  So they were, so don't go out and mix.
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:04.840]  The whole world has become a little, and Google's even building and shows Facebook little AI spy cities
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:06.840]  where you live in a dome bubble.
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:10.840]  And you have these special safe spaces on top of other safe spaces on top of other safe spaces.
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:15.840]  And they've grown up in a safe space culture that mingled with that self entitlement culture.
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:18.840]  And you combine safe space culture and self entitlement culture
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:22.840]  and you get people who really believe without any question, without any doubt, without any reservation
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:25.840]  that they are entitled to only their voice being heard.
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:27.840]  They're entitled to nobody. Because they're the ruling class.
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:29.840]  Exactly. Very much so.
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:34.840]  And that the safe space culture that they grew up with as kids, with play dates, that everything was controlled and organized,
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:40.840]  it's sort of a mini version of the nanny state is how they grew up and were cultivated by their boomer liberal parents.
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:44.840]  Whereas my generation was the last to just, oh, you're 10 years old, you want to take the shotgun?
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:48.840]  I'd put a preview to seven on my side with a holster.
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:54.840]  Then I'd get a tent, a couple of my buddies, and I'd go out on a four wheeler, a thousand, you know,
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:59.840]  acres in the middle of a wilderness and just sit there and hunt and hang out for two or three days.
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:04.840]  Exactly. People think that's like, now leftist outside major cities, they're moving in like outside of land,
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:06.840]  outside of other areas, there's always news of this.
[2:39:06.840 --> 2:39:10.840]  And they'll, people will drive by somebody's house and they'll be skinning a deer.
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:15.840]  They'll call the police for animal cruelty and the cops will arrest them even though it's legal, they had a license.
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:20.840]  They go, we still think that someone called from the nanny state, yes, skinning a deer is hurtful.
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:25.840]  Well, it's amazing. I mean, I do think generation Z has a lot of promise.
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:30.840]  They're much more independent. They, there tends to be a generational reaction to the prior generation.
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:34.840]  And the generation Z is sort of the anti-save space culture in place.
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:38.840]  Very independent, understand how to reach out to each other through social media,
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:41.840]  understand how to persuade and communicate through social media,
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:46.840]  understand how to express dissident opinions and be unafraid of big tech and unafraid of big media
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:49.840]  and unafraid of having quote unquote unapproved opinions.
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:54.840]  And I think they are the generation that's going to salvage and save the American future moving forward.
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:58.840]  I totally agree, but you bring that up. I mean, literally when my dad was like 9, 10,
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:01.840]  they would send him every summer to apprentice a month here, a month there in a factory,
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.840]  and an oil rig to go pick cotton somewhere with family to see what the real world was like.
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:11.840]  But they just throw him on a bus and he'd just go drive down there and they'd take guns to their school,
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:13.840]  put them in the locker to go hunt at their friend's house.
[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:21.840]  And literally, I remember being a kid just 33, 34 years ago, 35 years ago, being 10, 11,
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:26.840]  and nobody thought anything in the country, if you were walking by a fence, somebody's out there cutting stuff with a tractor,
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:30.840]  that there's a bunch of little kids with 357s on their hips and shotguns.
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:33.840]  That was totally, because we were all trained, it was normal, nobody got hurt.
[2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:38.840]  Nowadays, people flip out of, they see an adult like that, self. What do you think's happened?
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:46.840]  I mean, I didn't even consider all the safe space stuff, but I think it's just the contrast in the way that boomers were raised versus generation Z.
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:51.840]  That's something I focus on. Boomers grew up in an age of great prosperity,
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:56.840]  so they got, most everything was pretty much handed to them is what I focus on.
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:41:02.840]  And I think growing up in such an environment, they didn't need to learn how to defend themselves
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:10.840]  or need to learn any good life advice, financial advice, because no matter what they did, they got success.
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:14.840]  So they just say assimilate, do what the establishment says, they're in a cult.
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:18.840]  Yeah, well, pretty much the upper middle class liberal boomers that she's describing.
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:22.840]  So for like your blue collar working class boomer, what they experienced,
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:26.840]  and this is, you see this in the division of Trump support amongst boomer generation,
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:31.840]  it's your non-college folks who saw their entire livelihoods ripped away and disappeared.
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:34.840]  They had to serve in multiple wars that were failed wars, that were dumb wars,
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.840]  that were unsuccessful wars, that were unpopular wars, that killed their friends, their family and their neighbors.
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:44.840]  They had to go home to communities that were being ripped apart by racial politics,
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:46.840]  by their homes ripped apart by gender politics.
[2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:52.840]  You're right, we've got to divide the working class boomers for great people versus elite boomers.
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:56.840]  When we say boomers, we mean elite, generally white upper class boomers.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:02.840]  Privileged kids who grew up so privileged that entitlement was second nature to them, no sense of scarcity.
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:07.840]  One critical principle of conservatism in sort of its hardcore root is a recognition of scarcity.
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:09.840]  There was no recognition of scarcity because they were just used to...
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:12.840]  AOC says they go, how are you going to pay for all this? It's five times the budget.
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:15.840]  She goes, we'll just do it.
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:18.840]  Exactly. There must be the military must spend a whole bunch, right?
[2:42:18.840 --> 2:42:21.840]  So it's just, there's people that don't have any sense of limits,
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:24.840]  don't have any sense of know what it's like to live with limits.
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:29.840]  People, it's a self-entitled, babied culture that easily bullies others
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:31.840]  because of how easily they were babied their whole time.
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.840]  I agree. Self-do a few more minutes with us and we're going to get into the other issues with Barnes.
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:37.840]  A little bit in the next hour, Joe Salante coming up.
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:41.840]  On where you think this is all going, what you think President Trump should do, and more.
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:45.840]  With Shof, be sure and follow her at Twitter at Shurenugget.
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:51.840]  She's named after Barack Obama's wife and YouTube at Shofpatreon.com.
[2:42:51.840 --> 2:43:06.840]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com.
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:28.840]  And so we've reached that point.
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:31.840]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever.
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:33.840]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:35.840]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:37.840]  You have, you have been there.
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:40.840]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:42.840]  and they're giving us their full assault.
[2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:46.840]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:48.840]  at infowarscore.com.
[2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:51.840]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want infowars to continue
[2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:54.840]  because we could be shut down.
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:57.840]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics,
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:00.840]  I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:04.840]  in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:10.840]  The false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:13.840]  is ludicrous as well as false.
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:16.840]  It's a smear. Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:18.840]  You don't even open it.
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:21.840]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:23.840]  and then it's blamed on you.
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:26.840]  This is Kafkaesque. This is bizarre.
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:29.840]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say,
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:32.840]  Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:34.840]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:38.840]  and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:40.840]  But I wonder where are the big boys?
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:42.840]  Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press?
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:45.840]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.840]  and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[2:44:48.840 --> 2:44:51.840]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:54.840]  to support info wars with your dollars.
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:44:58.840]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:00.840]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:02.840]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[2:45:02.840 --> 2:45:04.840]  of social, economic, political or legal
[2:45:04.840 --> 2:45:06.840]  for their illicit activities over two decades.
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:09.840]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries,
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:12.840]  the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:15.840]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:18.840]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:20.840]  to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:22.840]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs,
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:24.840]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:27.840]  who ran American politics and ran American economy
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:30.840]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:34.840]  The info wars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:37.840]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[2:45:37.840 --> 2:45:40.840]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:43.840]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:46.840]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections,
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:47.840]  to try to shake people's thoughts.
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:50.840]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[2:45:50.840 --> 2:45:51.840]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:53.840]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:55.840]  Even it is what we just saw.
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:45:58.840]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:01.840]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:03.840]  from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:06.840]  due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:10.840]  and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:11.840]  We need to end here.
[2:46:11.840 --> 2:46:14.840]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment
[2:46:14.840 --> 2:46:17.840]  that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[2:46:17.840 --> 2:46:21.840]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:23.840]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:26.840]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:28.840]  and that just brings more people here.
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:31.840]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[2:46:31.840 --> 2:46:32.840]  I need gas.
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:34.840]  I need ammo politically now.
[2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:37.840]  Literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:40.840]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[2:46:40.840 --> 2:46:41.840]  We're unstoppable together.
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:43.840]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:46.840]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:48.840]  that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us
[2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:50.840]  and I will never back down to have my commitment.
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:53.840]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:47:06.840]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:24.840]  I'm going back to soap.
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:27.840]  I'm going 50 minutes to the next hour with Barnes on all the big news.
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:31.840]  We haven't had a hit yet and it recapped the anti-fighter attacks.
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:36.840]  I don't want to explain something at Rishi Lee's that is so critical.
[2:47:36.840 --> 2:47:37.840]  They are probing.
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:40.840]  They are testing us to normalize attacking us.
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:43.840]  They call acid milkshakes.
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:46.840]  Understand this is all a big test to see what they can get away with.
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:49.840]  Charlottesville was that.
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:53.840]  I'm going to be dare pointing out that Soros financed it.
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:54.840]  I'm being sued.
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:55.840]  Fine.
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:47:56.840]  Let's represent all you want.
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:47:57.840]  The truth will come out.
[2:47:57.840 --> 2:47:59.840]  Georgetown University.
[2:47:59.840 --> 2:48:05.840]  Financing losses to shut us down because they fear us and they know we're effective.
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:08.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the same info.
[2:48:08.840 --> 2:48:10.840]  Fourth of July special.
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:14.840]  I'm going to have to end it by the fourth of the day after because
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:19.840]  I'm going to be saying deep earth crystal, pure iodine.
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:22.840]  The soil is depleted.
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.840]  The types of iodine you get are bound with other substances, other minerals,
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:30.840]  other periodic table elements.
[2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:33.840]  And you can't absorb it.
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:38.840]  If you don't know about iodine and loss of IQ and loss of energy and problems in the glands,
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:40.840]  well, you just don't know.
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:43.840]  When I remember to take X2, four, five times a week, I have so much energy,
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:44.840]  everything.
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:50.840]  I've heard of taking it seven years ago and I was exercising all the time
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:51.840]  and couldn't drop weight.
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:52.840]  I lost 50-something pounds.
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:55.840]  Now, I basically quit working out except for some ellipticals.
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:48:56.840]  So I've gained 30 of it back.
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:48:59.840]  I'm just going back on a regimen again where I'm taking all the vitamins,
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:00.840]  all the minerals, and I'm exercising.
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:02.840]  I've already lost five pounds last week and a half.
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:04.840]  And you're going to see quite a transformation.
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:10.840]  The next two months, folks, you're going to see because I'm going to work out like I used to before I took X2.
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:12.840]  The stuff has made me lazy.
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:14.840]  But you take the X2.
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:15.840]  You take the fish oil.
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:16.840]  You take the turmeric.
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:19.840]  You take the ultimate bone broth formula.
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:24.840]  They're all 50% off double-patria point store-wide free shipping.
[2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:25.840]  I want to explain something.
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:26.840]  Everybody knows how great bone broth is.
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:27.840]  You go to Whole Foods.
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:28.840]  You go to other grocery stores.
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:31.840]  They've got little mason jars for $10.
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:32.840]  It's on sale, $8.
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:35.840]  It's got the equivalent of a quarter scoop of bone broth from chicken in it
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:38.840]  and chaga mushroom and bee pollen and stuff.
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:41.840]  I keep meaning to go to the store and get some of these to come show you.
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:42.840]  There's almost nothing in them.
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:48.840]  You're talking hundreds of times more in a canister for $19.95.
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.840]  And this is $9.95 for one little mason jar that's just yellow.
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:55.840]  It just has the bone broth flavor.
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  Nobody's ever made a bone broth like this.
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:49:59.840]  If you don't know what bone broth does for you, research it.
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:00.840]  I don't have hours to get into it.
[2:50:00.840 --> 2:50:03.840]  All of it's 50% off in FullWareStore.com.
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:06.840]  We're selling out of the X2.
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:11.840]  They put us over a barrel, they get it between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:14.840]  The oil company we're getting it from is just pure crystal source.
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:18.840]  It goes to the DEA to store it before it's transferred into the process
[2:50:18.840 --> 2:50:21.840]  that makes it where you can take it because it's a controlled substance at that level
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:23.840]  because you can make all the stuff with it.
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:25.840]  It's a magic element.
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:27.840]  They hit you with all the bad halogens like fluoride and the rest of it.
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:29.840]  This is the good halogen.
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:32.840]  It took us over six months to get it re-secured.
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:33.840]  I played Gutsball.
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:34.840]  I said it's discontinued.
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:37.840]  I wouldn't let them raise the prices on us because it would be like $50 a bottle.
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:40.840]  They're going to double prices on it for us.
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:45.840]  Right now, it's $19.98 even though, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:48.840]  we only make like $5 or $6 on it at that and maybe that.
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:51.840]  So, $4.9 stars, 98% reviews.
[2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:53.840]  Original X2 at FullWareStore.com.
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:54.840]  X3 is excellent.
[2:50:54.840 --> 2:50:55.840]  It's triiodyne.
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:50:59.840]  The other two types and then the pure type because some people can't absorb just the pure type.
[2:50:59.840 --> 2:51:01.840]  Most folks can't absorb the bound types.
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:04.840]  So, X3, doctors and scientists told me it was great.
[2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:07.840]  Folks, when I tell you X2 has been the best, they don't want X3 to go,
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:08.840]  well, X2 is the best.
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:11.840]  It's kind of like when Gillette had the best a man can get with three razors.
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:14.840]  And then I kind of agree, four or five is a little too much.
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:16.840]  People are like, hey, it's the best a man can get.
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:17.840]  Don't tell me you have four blades.
[2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:18.840]  Okay, fine.
[2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:20.840]  Some like three, some like four, some like two.
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:22.840]  X3 is excellent as well.
[2:51:22.840 --> 2:51:23.840]  It's not sold out.
[2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:25.840]  So, FullWareStore.com.
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:29.840]  So, we're two old guys running over a 14-year-old lady here.
[2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:32.840]  So, I really want to hear what you have to say.
[2:51:32.840 --> 2:51:35.840]  Any other key points you'd like to make about where you see society going,
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:38.840]  the massive censorship, what you think Trump should do,
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:43.840]  Antifa just north of you, openly producing, you know,
[2:51:43.840 --> 2:51:47.840]  all of these acid attack cocktails to attack people.
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:50.840]  I mean, it's big news when Islamists throw acid on somebody,
[2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:52.840]  but when the liberals do it, it's loving.
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:55.840]  And we have a CNN clip saying this is a good thing.
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:51:59.840]  I mean, yeah, everything seems to be accelerating just leading up to the election.
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:01.840]  I mean, all the Antifa stuff is crazy.
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:05.840]  They're certainly doing a lot of damage, but I think,
[2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:08.840]  I don't think they're something that people should be scared of.
[2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:12.840]  I mean, you see the videos, it's like a whole crowd against one person,
[2:52:12.840 --> 2:52:15.840]  and the one person is still able to get away.
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:17.840]  Proportional to the size, they can't do much damage.
[2:52:17.840 --> 2:52:18.840]  They're weak.
[2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:21.840]  So, you know, people can meet back with a greater force,
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:24.840]  which I think is easier than, you know, things will be good.
[2:52:24.840 --> 2:52:29.840]  Um, yeah, I mean, we can talk more about boomers if you want.
[2:52:29.840 --> 2:52:32.840]  Well, again, I'm not up here as Mr. Tough guy.
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:35.840]  I've had my ass kicked plenty of times and I never started to fight.
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:38.840]  And I got in fights with people like state wrestling champs and folks that have
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:40.840]  your head in the concrete in 10 seconds.
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:42.840]  It didn't matter what you did, you couldn't kick their ass.
[2:52:42.840 --> 2:52:45.840]  But I've certainly, you know, won most of the fights I've been in,
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.840]  but I can tell you this, if somebody tried to hit me in the head with a metal club,
[2:52:48.840 --> 2:52:49.840]  they're going to die.
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:52.840]  I mean, or I'm going to die because I'm going to get on top of them
[2:52:52.840 --> 2:52:54.840]  and I'm going to ram their head in the concrete.
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:55.840]  And by the way, that's not premeditated.
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:52:57.840]  You try to kill me or you hurt me.
[2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:00.840]  That's when you really get hurt because the state wrestling champion,
[2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:01.840]  I said, I didn't beat him.
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:02.840]  Actually, dead break is tricky.
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:03.840]  He had crushes.
[2:53:03.840 --> 2:53:04.840]  Win pipe.
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:05.840]  He had to get tricky out of me and put in the hospital.
[2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:07.840]  But so I guess I did kind of win.
[2:53:07.840 --> 2:53:10.840]  But the point is he had, he had, he had, he had,
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:14.840]  Powell drive me and thought he kicked my ass and I popped right back up
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:15.840]  and punched him in throat full power.
[2:53:15.840 --> 2:53:18.840]  But all I'm saying is there's always somebody tougher than you out there.
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:23.840]  But why do you think so if they think they can go out and engage in acid attacks
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:26.840]  and hit people over the head with metal bars?
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:29.840]  Um, I think they know that the establishment is on their side.
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:33.840]  I mean, something that the leftist like Carlos Mazza often says that,
[2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:36.840]  Oh, the establishment is right wing, you know, big corporate,
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:38.840]  big corporations like YouTube are anti gay.
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:42.840]  They're never on our side, which is completely just opposite of the truth.
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:45.840]  Uh, you know, everybody's working together with the left wing.
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:48.840]  They, so they know they have a, they're not stupid.
[2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:51.840]  They just have overconfidence in the fact that the system is on their side.
[2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:54.840]  I don't know if that's how it's going to work out,
[2:53:54.840 --> 2:53:58.840]  but it seems that the police really aren't doing much to stop them.
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:02.840]  And I think this is why the right to bear arms is so important in situations like these
[2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:04.840]  where the police doesn't have a handle on it.
[2:54:04.840 --> 2:54:08.840]  You need to be able to defend yourself.
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:10.840]  I know your dad's had threats.
[2:54:10.840 --> 2:54:11.840]  You've had threats online.
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:14.840]  Has anybody recognized you on the street and said anything to you?
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:19.840]  Um, so far, I mean, I haven't been recognized on the street in a while.
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:23.840]  I've been, I've been recognized a few times before, but it was always positive.
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:27.840]  Um, so far, I haven't been harassed, you know, out of school just in public,
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:31.840]  but we'll see how long that lasts.
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:33.840]  Barnes, you've been out in public with me.
[2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:34.840]  We're not bragging.
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:35.840]  It's good news.
[2:54:35.840 --> 2:54:40.840]  What you probably 90% of folks that come up are positive.
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:42.840]  Others are kind of neutral.
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:45.840]  Maybe I don't think you've ever seen anybody get in my face yet.
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:47.840]  I went and dropped my daughters off at camp.
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:48.840]  I couldn't get out of there.
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:51.840]  I shook almost all the girls' hands, all the guys' hands.
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:53.840]  They all chased me.
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:54:54.840]  I'm not kidding.
[2:54:54.840 --> 2:54:56.840]  Chased me where my truck was parked.
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:54:59.840]  It's a huge camp and we're demanding photos and more kept coming.
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:04.840]  I got stuck there for an hour taking photos with up to 30 people who just kept,
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:07.840]  somebody chased me in a truck to take photos once I got on the highway.
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:08.840]  I'm not bragging.
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:11.840]  That shows we're winning the info war, but that minority is violent.
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  No doubt.
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:17.840]  And the goal of Intifa is to scare the soaps of the world from into silence.
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:18.840]  That's really the goal.
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:22.840]  The goal is if you get out there and you're going to be a high profile person with views
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:26.840]  that we don't like, it will escalate from, it will start with censorship.
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:31.840]  Then it will go to sort of cyber stocking, true cyber bullying, and then it will escalate
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:35.840]  into actual physical bullying and actual physical threats and physical violence.
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:40.840]  Am I wrong, Soph, in saying that type of behavior only would make you fight harder?
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:46.840]  I mean, yeah, I definitely, I don't know if it's a good thing, but it definitely excites
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:52.840]  me in a sort of way that I feel like I need to get involved in what's going on.
[2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:56.840]  It seems like there's so much civil unrest that I need to be in the middle of it and
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:55:57.840]  get involved.
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:01.840]  And yeah, people seeing things like this will alienate them from the left.
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:02.840]  That's all it does.
[2:56:02.840 --> 2:56:06.840]  It makes them angry or it gets them more revved up and ready to fight.
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:11.840]  And it's only going to just, you know, accelerate things and make more people ready to fight
[2:56:11.840 --> 2:56:12.840]  Antifa.
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:15.840]  Well, that's, that's not what I think.
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:16.840]  And I agree with Soph.
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:19.840]  I mean, this is exciting.
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:21.840]  The threats to our freedoms and then threatening to attack us.
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:23.840]  That doesn't make me want to stay away.
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:24.840]  It makes me want to go there.
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:25.840]  Yeah.
[2:56:25.840 --> 2:56:28.840]  Well, the spirit of Americana and the spirit of America cannot be put out by a bunch of
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:35.840]  sort of black block style of vigilantes who are basically just trying to be the sort
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:38.840]  of lefty brown shirts of the modern age.
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:39.840]  By the way, let's be clear.
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:43.840]  Even the Daily Beast is now reporting when I told you first hour, the FBI is warning
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:45.840]  of terror attacks in DC by Antifa.
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:49.840]  The FBI is now calling them a terror group because when you're cooking acid bombs by
[2:56:49.840 --> 2:56:55.840]  the hundreds and hitting people helping a gay dude, they attacked a gay guy in a sundress
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:57.840]  and Antifa was attacking.
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:56:59.840]  When you're doing that, you're a terrorist.
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:00.840]  Look at that.
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:02.840]  Homeland Security warned of Antifa terrorist attacks.
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:04.840]  Soph, what do you make of that?
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:11.840]  I mean, I'm glad that there's actually being a resistance to it, that they're at least
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:14.840]  trying or seemingly trying to take care of it.
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:17.840]  And, you know, hopefully that's, hopefully that's effective.
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:22.840]  But I think most of the fights are going to be taking place between citizens themselves.
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:25.840]  Well, I know this.
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:27.840]  Anybody does anything to my family.
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:29.840]  I'm not going to go after Antifa.
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:31.840]  I'm going to go after their bosses.
[2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:38.840]  So, everybody should, in their target menu for attack profile, be doing that research
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:41.840]  for defensive counterattacks.
[2:57:41.840 --> 2:57:43.840]  Antifa is not the target.
[2:57:43.840 --> 2:57:44.840]  Their controllers are.
[2:57:44.840 --> 2:57:46.840]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:47.840]  Marcus here on the air.
[2:57:47.840 --> 2:57:48.840]  Thanks for holding.
[2:57:48.840 --> 2:57:49.840]  Hey, Alex.
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:50.840]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:54.840]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is
[2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:56.840]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:01.840]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:05.840]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:06.840]  2020.
[2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:07.840]  That's it.
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:09.840]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:12.840]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:13.840]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:14.840]  I agree entirely.
[2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:17.840]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:19.840]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:22.840]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:24.840]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:28.840]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:30.840]  You've won a lot of battles.
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:34.840]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:36.840]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[2:58:36.840 --> 2:58:40.840]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:42.840]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[2:58:42.840 --> 2:58:46.840]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:58:46.840 --> 2:58:52.840]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[2:58:52.840 --> 2:58:58.840]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality
[2:58:58.840 --> 2:59:02.840]  Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.

[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:13.840]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:18.840]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:59:18.840 --> 2:59:22.840]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[2:59:22.840 --> 2:59:29.840]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[2:59:48.840 --> 2:59:54.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:54.840 --> 3:00:10.840]  We're going to ride like the one-eyed, riding like the one-eyed, jacket diamonds with the devil
[3:00:10.840 --> 3:00:12.840]  close behind.
[3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:14.840]  Devil's always close behind.
[3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:16.840]  We're doing the Lord's work.
[3:00:16.840 --> 3:00:24.840]  Get behind me, Satan.
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:27.840]  I'm going to find me a reckless woman.
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:31.840]  I'm going to find me a reckless woman.
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:32.840]  You like Well and Jennings?
[3:00:32.840 --> 3:00:33.840]  Oh, I love Well and Jennings.
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:34.840]  Old school.
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:37.840]  He was in Buddy Holly's, man.
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:38.840]  Yeah, he was.
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:41.840]  Back in the 50s, you could have been on a tour and you could have seen Buddy Holly,
[3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:44.840]  Well and Jennings, Johnny Cash, Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley.
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:49.840]  They were out in the West Texas and it was Sub-Zero and he had to ride in the bus
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:51.840]  and it was going to be freezing and take a look.
[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:54.840]  And he goes, I hope your damn plane crashes and you die.
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:56.840]  Yeah, they did.
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:00:57.840]  One of the great ones.
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:00:58.840]  Powerful when you're well in Venice.
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:00:59.840]  You can't be curtsome people.
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:00.840]  That's true.
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:02.840]  Got that Providence.
[3:01:02.840 --> 3:01:04.840]  All right.
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:05.840]  This son's a cool guy.
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:06.840]  Oh, yeah.
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:08.840]  Shooter, you know him as a good guy.
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:09.840]  Yeah.
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:12.840]  So, you're awesome and we like the work you're doing.
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:16.840]  You got a lot of sophistication, got a long, long, long career in the M4 ahead of you.
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:18.840]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:20.840]  Because me and this old dog have been running over you.
[3:01:20.840 --> 3:01:26.840]  I mean, I just hope everybody watching is just keeps hope for what's going on.
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:30.840]  I mean, just seeing the onslaught of things on Twitter all day and the news about this
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:34.840]  and that and the left wing attacks and people are getting hit over the head with crowbars.
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:40.840]  I think, you know, in the end things are going to work themselves out and justice will be
[3:01:40.840 --> 3:01:41.840]  brought about.
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  You know, people like this are not going to get away with it forever.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:46.840]  I agree.
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:47.840]  Tell us about you.
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:49.840]  You're representing a client.
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:50.840]  It was a semi-autistic.
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:51.840]  They beat up twice.
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:52.840]  So, he pulled a gun on them.
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:53.840]  They're trying to put him in jail.
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:54.840]  That's right.
[3:01:54.840 --> 3:01:57.840]  I mean, all of what happened, Andy, to go and Portland is predicated upon the Portland
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:02.840]  police, the Portland prosecutors, the Portland politicians, including the mayor and the judges.
[3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:06.840]  When someone who was put on the Asperger spectrum was had...
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:07.840]  On your client's name.
[3:02:07.840 --> 3:02:08.840]  Michael Strickler.
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:09.840]  He'd been violently assaulted before.
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:11.840]  He'd been violently threatened with assault.
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:15.840]  He went to film a public event and when he was there, they were approaching him from
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:17.840]  the back, from the side and from the front.
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:18.840]  They're all wearing masks.
[3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:19.840]  There's a reason why they're wearing masks.
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:20.840]  They've attacked him before.
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:21.840]  Exactly.
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:22.840]  They have weapons with them.
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:25.840]  They're all much bigger than him, much stronger than him.
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:26.840]  There's a lot more of them.
[3:02:26.840 --> 3:02:30.840]  And all he does is while moving backwards, shows them that he has a gun.
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:33.840]  And he does it in exactly the manner that you're trained to do.
[3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:37.840]  He does it while he's walking backwards, just brandishes it and shows it to them and then
[3:02:37.840 --> 3:02:38.840]  puts it away.
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:40.840]  And it had its intended, protective and right.
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:41.840]  We're a bunch of cowards.
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:42.840]  We just want to kill you.
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:43.840]  How dare you.
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:44.840]  Police.
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:49.840]  And the police, knowing the backstory of this situation, knowing what happened, arrest
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:50.840]  him instead.
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:53.840]  Charge him with 21 different felonies.
[3:02:53.840 --> 3:02:54.840]  He ends up with not even...
[3:02:54.840 --> 3:02:58.840]  Portland's jury pool is so bad, they could not even get a fair and impartial jury.
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:00.840]  We're going to roll that video coming up.
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:02.840]  What's the headline of that video?
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  We'll pull it up.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:06.840]  There's multiple different ones about him pulling a gun on Intifa.
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:07.840]  There's video of it, though.
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:08.840]  Oh, yeah.
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:10.840]  There's multiple videos of it because he had played multiple times at the time.
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:13.840]  Try to go to YouTube and type in Michael Strickland and Tifa Gun, Portland.
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:14.840]  Yeah.
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:15.840]  So we'll have that.
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:17.840]  So thank you so much.
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:20.840]  What's your next video going to be about?
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:24.840]  Next video, I'm going to try to recap everything that's, that, that happened over the past few
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:28.840]  months with me in May and June, that what happened with the school that happened with
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:33.840]  all the mainstream media and what were the repercussions for that in my daily life.
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:37.840]  I mean, it was, it was some crazy things like the school was like essentially putting a
[3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:38.840]  target on my back.
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:39.840]  Yeah.
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:41.840]  There's a lot to talk about.
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:46.840]  You'd also do sarcastic videos where you like talking about that girl with the carbon
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:48.840]  taxes and just go, I agree with AOC.
[3:03:48.840 --> 3:03:50.840]  The world is ending in 12 years by the cliff.
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:51.840]  I agree with this little girl.
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:53.840]  We must all pay carbon taxes to Al Gore.
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:55.840]  I will do what they say.
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:03:59.840]  Thank you, YouTube, for taking my channel down and giving me strikes before.
[3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:01.840]  I now know how to behave.
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:02.840]  You are right.
[3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:03.840]  You are correct.
[3:04:03.840 --> 3:04:06.840]  I mean, I'm thinking about that for people that are still on YouTube, still able to do
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:07.840]  it.
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:08.840]  I was still there.
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:09.840]  I do a bunch of sarcastic videos.
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:10.840]  Yeah.
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:13.840]  And they can just always finish with Alex Jones, bad, orange man, bad, and then they
[3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:14.840]  have it all wrapped up.
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:16.840]  Kill babies after they're born.
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:17.840]  I love world government.
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:18.840]  I love Islam.
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:19.840]  I love acid attacks.
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:20.840]  Sorry, Sophie.
[3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:21.840]  Go ahead.
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:22.840]  You're bad.
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:26.840]  I think that's the only way that I would ever survive on YouTube.
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:30.840]  I mean, everybody's going to get kicked off eventually, but if I actually like wanted
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:34.840]  to stay on there, which is, I don't, uh, I think that's the only way I would be able
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:35.840]  to get by.
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:40.840]  I know folks that know, and I know if you have a high level writer for BuzzFeed and
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:43.840]  all these other crappy, like they all know it's a big joke.
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:45.840]  It's all a sick joke.
[3:04:45.840 --> 3:04:50.840]  But they write articles about, you know, milk, milk is racist and the media goes with it.
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:05:18.840]  So thank you so much and God bless, be safe.
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:44.840]  Thank you.
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:06:10.840]  Thank you.
[3:06:10.840 --> 3:06:38.840]  Thank you.
[3:06:38.840 --> 3:07:00.840]  Thank you.
[3:07:00.840 --> 3:07:26.840]  Thank you.
[3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:55.840]  Thank you.
[3:07:55.840 --> 3:08:21.840]  Thank you.
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:47.840]  Thank you.
[3:08:47.840 --> 3:09:13.840]  Thank you.
[3:09:13.840 --> 3:09:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:09:39.840 --> 3:10:05.840]  Thank you.
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:31.840]  Thank you.
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:57.840]  Thank you.
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:26.840]  Thank you.
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:52.840]  Thank you.
[3:11:52.840 --> 3:12:18.840]  Thank you.
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:46.840]  Thank you.
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:13:12.840]  Thank you.
[3:13:12.840 --> 3:13:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:13:39.840 --> 3:14:05.840]  Thank you.
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:31.840]  Thank you.
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:57.840]  Thank you.
[3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:23.840]  Thank you.
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:51.840]  Thank you.
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:53.840]  Thank you.
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:47.840]  Thank you.
[3:16:47.840 --> 3:17:13.840]  Thank you.
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:55.840]  Thank you.
[3:17:55.840 --> 3:18:21.840]  Thank you.
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:47.840]  Thank you.
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:19:13.840]  Thank you.
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:19:39.840 --> 3:20:05.840]  Thank you.
[3:20:05.840 --> 3:20:31.840]  Thank you.
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:59.840]  Thank you.
[3:20:59.840 --> 3:21:27.840]  Thank you.
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:55.840]  Thank you.
[3:21:55.840 --> 3:22:21.840]  Thank you.
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:49.840]  Thank you.
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:23:17.840]  Thank you.
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:45.840]  Thank you.
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:24:13.840]  Thank you.
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:41.840]  Thank you.
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:25:09.840]  Thank you.
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:37.840]  Thank you.
[3:25:37.840 --> 3:26:05.840]  Thank you.
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:33.840]  Thank you.
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:27:01.840]  Thank you.
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:29.840]  Thank you.
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:57.840]  Thank you.
[3:27:57.840 --> 3:28:25.840]  Thank you.
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:53.840]  Thank you.
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:29:23.840]  Thank you.
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:51.840]  Thank you.
[3:29:53.840 --> 3:30:21.840]  Thank you.
[3:30:21.840 --> 3:30:49.840]  Thank you.
[3:30:49.840 --> 3:31:17.840]  Thank you.
[3:31:17.840 --> 3:31:45.840]  Thank you.
[3:31:45.840 --> 3:32:13.840]  Thank you.
[3:32:13.840 --> 3:32:41.840]  Thank you.
[3:32:41.840 --> 3:33:01.840]  Thank you.
[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:33:39.840 --> 3:34:07.840]  Thank you.
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:35.840]  Thank you.
[3:34:35.840 --> 3:35:03.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:31.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:59.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:27.840]  Thank you.
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:55.840]  Thank you.
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:37:23.840]  Thank you.
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:51.840]  Thank you.
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:38:19.840]  Thank you.
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:47.840]  Thank you.
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:39:15.840]  Thank you.
[3:39:15.840 --> 3:39:43.840]  Thank you.
[3:39:43.840 --> 3:40:11.840]  Thank you.
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:39.840]  Thank you.
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:41:07.840]  Thank you.
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:35.840]  Thank you.
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:42:03.840]  Thank you.
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:31.840]  Thank you.
[3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:59.840]  Thank you.
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:27.840]  Thank you.
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:55.840]  Thank you.
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:44:23.840]  Thank you.
[3:44:23.840 --> 3:44:51.840]  Thank you.
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:45:21.840]  Thank you.
[3:45:21.840 --> 3:45:49.840]  Thank you.
[3:45:49.840 --> 3:46:17.840]  Thank you.
[3:46:17.840 --> 3:46:45.840]  Thank you.
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:47:05.840]  Thank you.
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:19.840]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:19.840 --> 3:47:25.840]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:47:25.840 --> 3:47:27.840]  Hello, hello.
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:29.840]  Thank you for being here on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:33.840]  Yeah, I was telling you before about my book which Zizi gave Honey Boy.
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:35.840]  And again, everything I've ever written is my favorite.
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:37.840]  This is about my 83-year-old dad.
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:39.840]  And I was just thinking about it.
[3:47:39.840 --> 3:47:44.840]  Targeting some of the essential issues of our time, work, family, health care, health care,
[3:47:44.840 --> 3:47:46.840]  politics, war, and aging in America.
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:54.840]  Zizi made Salente think about whether America was delivering on its promises.
[3:47:54.840 --> 3:48:00.840]  Have we lost too many timeless old world values in a march to progress?
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:04.840]  Are we really better off today than we were yesterday?
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:12.840]  And what does the future hold to each one of us, our families,
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:16.840]  our communities as a whole?
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:30.840]  So, took Zizi to help Salente see the unsettling truths about what has happened to America over the last several decades.
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:40.840]  They would talk about the world they once knew, a world filled with family, dinners together, and Sundays at church.
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:48.840]  So, if you want to get what Zizi gave Honey Boy, just go to our website, trendsjournal.com,
[3:48:48.840 --> 3:48:52.840]  trendsjournal.com, and you get a copy if you'd like to buy one.
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:56.840]  And of course, the Trends Journal, our monthly magazine, new issue coming out this week.
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:48:58.840]  Coming out this week.
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:03.840]  So, and again, don't forget to support Infowars.
[3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:05.840]  Put your money where your heart is.
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:07.840]  I want to talk a little bit about the economy.
[3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:11.840]  Market's went away up today, went down a little bit back up.
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:12.840]  Gold went down.
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:15.840]  Here's my forecast for gold.
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:22.840]  Gold has to stay above the $1,385 an ounce mark for to gain strength.
[3:49:22.840 --> 3:49:31.840]  The downside risk I see of gold is $1,270 between their 1,250 at the very worst.
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:34.840]  I don't believe it's going to go down that low.
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:35.840]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:36.840]  I don't tell you what to buy.
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:39.840]  I do not give financial advice.
[3:49:39.840 --> 3:49:47.840]  Gold has to break over $1,450 an ounce to spike to the $2,000 mark.
[3:49:47.840 --> 3:49:51.840]  So, I want to just give you some kind of few headlines.
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:56.840]  Oh, before I do, though, Apple picks China for production of new Mac Pro.
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:50:00.840]  Yep, it's the only device assembled in the U.S.
[3:50:00.840 --> 3:50:02.840]  Isn't that great?
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:09.840]  They got all these tax breaks, and now they're getting it made in China with those commies.
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:11.840]  I hate those commies.
[3:50:11.840 --> 3:50:17.840]  We had moron teachers having us hiding on the desks in case an atom bomb went off.
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:21.840]  Like, that was going to save your life because we were afraid of those commies.
[3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:23.840]  Oh, and if you see a flash, don't look at it.
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:27.840]  Yeah, like, you'd be toast if you saw a flash.
[3:50:27.840 --> 3:50:30.840]  That's the moron education system we have.
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:32.840]  We need a new education system, too.
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:35.840]  I write about that as well, Interactive University.
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:44.840]  You know, you saw what happened with Walmart putting virtual reality on people that are hiring for management positions.
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:45.840]  It's the new way of learning.
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:46.840]  It's the 21st century.
[3:50:46.840 --> 3:50:59.840]  Our education system is a German system developed for the Industrial Revolution to take people that were making their own things and putting in centralized locations to read, write, do a little bit of math and follow orders.
[3:50:59.840 --> 3:51:02.840]  And that's all our educational system is, the follow orders.
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:14.840]  So going back to Apple and trade, you know, this is where our future is, bringing the jobs back home because the jobs at Walmart aren't paying a living wage.
[3:51:14.840 --> 3:51:16.840]  Millennials can't buy homes.
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:19.840]  You see the numbers coming out all the time.
[3:51:19.840 --> 3:51:21.840]  The story just came out now.
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:24.840]  Let me see if I could find it.
[3:51:24.840 --> 3:51:27.840]  Ah, here it is.
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:29.840]  Okay.
[3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:30.840]  Let me read the headline.
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:31.840]  $5.
[3:51:31.840 --> 3:51:32.840]  No, I'm only kidding.
[3:51:32.840 --> 3:51:36.840]  Rental demand surges as home sales keep sagging.
[3:51:36.840 --> 3:51:40.840]  People cannot afford to buy a home.
[3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:45.840]  So I'm totally in favor of bringing the jobs back.
[3:51:45.840 --> 3:51:50.840]  And to me, it's very simple.
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:56.840]  No trade wars, no tariffs put back in place the laws that existed before.
[3:51:56.840 --> 3:52:06.840]  End of story Jack and to be politically proper in these days and Jill don't want to leave anybody out.
[3:52:06.840 --> 3:52:14.840]  Also, with the with the immigration issue, which is the big democratic issue or demo crap issue.
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:15.840]  Very simple for me.
[3:52:15.840 --> 3:52:16.840]  Put it on the ballot.
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:18.840]  Let the people vote.
[3:52:18.840 --> 3:52:32.840]  Yes, I want to bring in more immigrants and I am willing to pay X amount of dollars for each one coming in for their health care, for their education and other services.
[3:52:32.840 --> 3:52:38.840]  No, I don't want more immigrants, illegal immigrants coming in.
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:46.840]  I will pay X amount to build a wall or to I would say to protect the borders.
[3:52:46.840 --> 3:52:49.840]  To me, it's a very simple formula.
[3:52:49.840 --> 3:52:54.840]  Close all those 800 bases overseas.
[3:52:54.840 --> 3:52:56.840]  Bring home the troops.
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:52:58.840]  Secure the homeland.
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:03.840]  And while they're at it, fix out with third world infrastructure.
[3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:06.840]  You know how many times I blow you blow out your front end.
[3:53:06.840 --> 3:53:08.840]  You go down to New York City.
[3:53:08.840 --> 3:53:10.840]  Holy cow.
[3:53:10.840 --> 3:53:14.840]  The potholes in that road all over the place.
[3:53:14.840 --> 3:53:20.840]  Third world rail we got taken a subway in New York is a night in Calcutta.
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:25.840]  So anyway, going back to the economic trends.
[3:53:25.840 --> 3:53:32.840]  Yes, the Dow is up, but there's worry coming in that earnings are going to be down.
[3:53:32.840 --> 3:53:33.840]  And that's what you have to look at.
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:36.840]  And again, what we saw with these tax cuts.
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:39.840]  And again, I call them as I see them.
[3:53:39.840 --> 3:53:47.840]  According to the tax policy center, well over 80% went to the 1% and most of the money went into stock buybacks.
[3:53:47.840 --> 3:53:52.840]  They had capital improvements early on in the first few months, but that died.
[3:53:52.840 --> 3:53:58.840]  And now you're seeing Apple moving their production overseas as our other companies.
[3:53:58.840 --> 3:54:03.840]  And again, I believe with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, you get it made overseas.
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:06.840]  You pay the taxes coming back in for that product.
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:11.840]  That's who you put the trade tariffs on Nike, Apple, Levi's.
[3:54:11.840 --> 3:54:15.840]  That's who you tax.
[3:54:15.840 --> 3:54:18.840]  Again, getting it made in Vietnam.
[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:23.840]  How, you know, the United we look at we did to our soldiers guys my age.
[3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:25.840]  How many lives are we lost?
[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:29.840]  Almost 60,000 250,000 wounded.
[3:54:29.840 --> 3:54:32.840]  People dying of Agent Orange poisoning.
[3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:36.840]  They finally just passed the law to give him some breaks, but not all of them.
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:39.840]  Yeah, now, you know, we're in our 70s.
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:42.840]  How many how much more life you have left?
[3:54:42.840 --> 3:54:44.840]  And finally getting it now zone.
[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:46.840]  No more wars. That's why I occupy peace.
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:48.840]  I honor the founding fathers.
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:51.840]  You're getting with George Washington, a real man.
[3:54:51.840 --> 3:54:53.840]  Remember Washington crossed the Delaware.
[3:54:53.840 --> 3:55:03.840]  Yeah, could you imagine Clinton crossing the crossing the ocean to go fight or Obama or Bush?
[3:55:03.840 --> 3:55:06.840]  Couldn't fight the way I have a paper bag.
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:08.840]  So that's why I occupy peace.
[3:55:08.840 --> 3:55:12.840]  I want to go on to more economic news to show what's going on.
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:15.840]  They're coming out with a job figures on Friday.
[3:55:15.840 --> 3:55:19.840]  That's going to make a big decision on where the Fed is going to go.
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:25.840]  So you're looking for, I believe, let me see here.
[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:28.840]  160,000 jobs to be created.
[3:55:28.840 --> 3:55:31.840]  Last month, they only created about 75,000.
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:36.840]  That number may be artificially low and they may boost it back up.
[3:55:36.840 --> 3:55:42.840]  But my forecast is the Fed is going to rate lower rates in July.
[3:55:42.840 --> 3:55:48.840]  And they will probably lower them at least one or two more times this year and at least two more times next year.
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:51.840]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[3:55:51.840 --> 3:55:57.840]  That's why you're seeing oil prices where they are and not going up with the tensions in the Middle East.
[3:55:57.840 --> 3:56:04.840]  Matter of fact, Russia and Saudi Arabia just announced that they're going to keep holding back on production.
[3:56:04.840 --> 3:56:11.840]  The OPEC and non-OPEC members are cutting off some 1.2 million barrels a day.
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:15.840]  You're looking at some companies in the United States going bankrupt.
[3:56:15.840 --> 3:56:21.840]  In the shale business and other oil-related businesses because the prices are low.
[3:56:21.840 --> 3:56:23.840]  Then you take a trip to Saudi Arabia.
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:29.840]  They need oil at $100 a barrel for their economy to break even.
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:31.840]  And we're looking at what?
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:35.840]  $60 something, $63, $64 a barrel for Brent Crude.
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:39.840]  So these are indicators that's important to watch.
[3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:42.840]  Other ones to look at.
[3:56:42.840 --> 3:56:45.840]  Gold, of course, that's the leader.
[3:56:45.840 --> 3:56:50.840]  Where gold goes, so goes the global economy because it's the ultimate safe haven asset.
[3:56:50.840 --> 3:56:54.840]  The higher prices of gold goes, the worse it looks around.
[3:56:54.840 --> 3:56:59.840]  And the reason the dollar is not going down, by the way, is because the other currencies are so weak.
[3:56:59.840 --> 3:57:01.840]  They got problems with Chinese banks.
[3:57:01.840 --> 3:57:03.840]  They're lowering their reserve ratio requirements.
[3:57:03.840 --> 3:57:06.840]  The money that banks have to hold to loan it out.
[3:57:06.840 --> 3:57:08.840]  So they're in a lot of trouble.
[3:57:08.840 --> 3:57:11.840]  Eurozone, they're going to be putting more quantitative easing.
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:15.840]  So watch gold, watch oil, and watch copper.
[3:57:15.840 --> 3:57:18.840]  Copper prices are down about over 7% this year.
[3:57:18.840 --> 3:57:20.840]  Dr. Copper, they need it and everything.
[3:57:20.840 --> 3:57:24.840]  From high tech to heavy industry.
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:28.840]  So the lower prices go on copper, the lower the global economy.
[3:57:28.840 --> 3:57:30.840]  So those are the things to watch.
[3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:35.840]  And also, don't forget, support Infowars.
[3:57:35.840 --> 3:57:38.840]  Do what you can to keep the truth alive.
[3:57:38.840 --> 3:57:41.840]  We'll see you when I get back, the next time.
[3:58:09.840 --> 3:58:13.840]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[3:58:13.840 --> 3:58:21.840]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[3:58:21.840 --> 3:58:24.840]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[3:58:24.840 --> 3:58:29.840]  And all drugs are, is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[3:58:29.840 --> 3:58:30.840]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[3:58:30.840 --> 3:58:36.840]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[3:58:36.840 --> 3:58:41.840]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:58:44.840 --> 3:58:45.840]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:58:45.840 --> 3:58:46.840]  Marcus here on the air, thanks for holding.
[3:58:46.840 --> 3:58:47.840]  Hey, Alex.
[3:58:47.840 --> 3:58:49.840]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:58:49.840 --> 3:58:52.840]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[3:58:52.840 --> 3:58:56.840]  And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:58:56.840 --> 3:59:04.840]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[3:59:04.840 --> 3:59:05.840]  The approaching 2020.
[3:59:05.840 --> 3:59:06.840]  That's it.
[3:59:06.840 --> 3:59:08.840]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:59:08.840 --> 3:59:11.840]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:59:11.840 --> 3:59:12.840]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[3:59:12.840 --> 3:59:13.840]  I agree entirely.
[3:59:13.840 --> 3:59:18.840]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:59:18.840 --> 3:59:21.840]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:23.840]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:59:23.840 --> 3:59:26.840]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:59:26.840 --> 3:59:28.840]  You've won a lot of battles.
[3:59:28.840 --> 3:59:32.840]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[3:59:32.840 --> 3:59:37.840]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[3:59:37.840 --> 3:59:41.840]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:59:41.840 --> 4:00:03.840]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
