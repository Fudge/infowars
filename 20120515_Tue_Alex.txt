[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:42.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones Wow I just barely
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.920]  slid into my chair because we're out there reading articles stapling I'm
[00:46.920 --> 00:52.000]  getting them ready if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv I know about 99% of you
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.400]  were listening you'd be able to see that I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:58.400 --> 01:07.440]  14 15 16 17 18 19 20 stacks of news here and all of it is incredibly important
[01:07.440 --> 01:14.320]  and that's why I canceled guest today we don't have any guests today so that I
[01:14.320 --> 01:21.440]  can cover this news and take your calls I said I don't have any guests today
[01:23.720 --> 01:30.240]  except for one that's gonna be coming on with us and that's because I had dinner
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.080]  with this gentleman last night I've known him for a while and he trains with
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.200]  military police I'll just leave it at that and he was willing to come in and
[01:41.200 --> 01:48.200]  say his name and go on the record but because he's such a good source of
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.200]  information I told him no we're gonna give you the standard gnome-de-plume of
[01:53.200 --> 02:01.960]  David and so David's gonna be joining us coming up in 30 minutes and the info he
[02:01.960 --> 02:05.840]  gave me I've already confirmed separately but why this is important is it
[02:05.840 --> 02:12.400]  shows that the military and even the contractors don't like what's happening
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.920]  you know Joel Scalzen's talked about his sources that they plan to use
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.200]  contractors and foreign troops to suppress insurrection if the American
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.680]  people are ever forced try to take their country back from the globalist we are
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.120]  going to be called the insurrection as those that are counter revolutionaries
[02:28.120 --> 02:32.360]  against the globalist takeover and we know that they've started shifting
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.520]  behind the scenes five years ago but now publicly from al-Qaeda to now homeland
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.920]  security is for people that can skin a buck and run a trot line gun owners
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.200]  libertarians conservatives returning veterans and they've actually increased
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.880]  troops but they're just contractors in Afghanistan they've increased troops but
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.680]  they're contractors in Iraq that's the new model the military is not paid
[02:54.680 --> 03:00.440]  enough to even buy dog food for dinner these guys are lavished but only during
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.000]  the enticement phase just like a crack dealer will give you free crack the
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.280]  first five or six times or a heroin dealer will give you free heroin the
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.160]  first few times or a meth dealer will give you free meth the first few times
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.960]  they're paying them 180 200 thousand dollars a year but now that pays
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.400]  starting to drop because they've now cut down the military to nothing they've
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.520]  incentivized and they've set the precedent to go to a merc military and
[03:28.520 --> 03:33.160]  by the time they're done they'll be getting paid 50 60 thousand to be
[03:33.160 --> 03:37.560]  combat marks and they're now reaching out trying to get former veterans who
[03:37.560 --> 03:41.560]  were unemployed that's why the word has gone out with big corporations not to
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.040]  hire veterans show that you can force them into the national security state
[03:46.040 --> 03:52.880]  and they're even going after 55 60 year old veterans they're going after Vietnam
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.840]  veterans desert storm one veterans you name it to be part of the new
[03:57.840 --> 04:04.740]  civilian security force here in America and when them and some of the guys are
[04:04.740 --> 04:10.680]  signing on and I've got this from other sources not just from David and we've
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.920]  got news articles where we get large snapshots of it and we can put the
[04:14.920 --> 04:21.800]  info together connect the dots they get to the training bases and they find out
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.040]  wow this is for the takeover of America and they're they're leaving in droves so
[04:27.040 --> 04:32.680]  they're refusing the problem is instead now the feds are just going and
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.960]  actually expanding auxiliary federal agents and sending them in to be trained
[04:37.960 --> 04:44.360]  and it's a big deal here in Texas where international training Inc or armor is
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.000]  based one of the biggest defense contractors Mert groups in the world
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.280]  and they've got a full bore mutiny going because they're pretty much converting
[04:53.280 --> 04:57.720]  from fighting quote haji Muslims as they call them to fighting John dear good
[04:57.720 --> 05:02.480]  old boys we'll be right back sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.080]  adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die start

[06:13.000 --> 06:16.240]  perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[06:16.240 --> 06:20.000]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put

[08:19.120 --> 08:23.640]  going to be an absolutely totally and completely jam-packed incredibly
[08:23.640 --> 08:30.880]  important edition of info wars I'm Alex Jones your host you are dialed in to the
[08:30.880 --> 08:38.720]  number one broadcast media system in the world resisting the globalist and the
[08:38.720 --> 08:45.120]  new world order the websites are info wars.com prison planet TV prison
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.440]  planet.com and of course info wars shop.com is the online video bookstore
[08:50.440 --> 08:59.520]  or you can find tools to awaken others in your area while where do I start this
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.080]  is from the electronic frontier foundation and we're going to get a
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.240]  report out on this the next hour and info wars.com DHS considers collecting
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.240]  DNA from kids DEA and US Marshall's already do it and they're the ones
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.520]  taking over police departments in Texas in California in Michigan in Florida and
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.480]  many other states I covered some of this last week they come into the school and
[09:24.480 --> 09:29.080]  they just say give us your swab we're talking about elementary students to get
[09:29.080 --> 09:34.200]  their cheek tissue it is one of the easiest places to get tissue and just
[09:34.200 --> 09:44.480]  scrape it right off and they then put it in a database now my point here is this
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.560]  just shows the total lawlessness because when parents complain and say what
[09:48.560 --> 09:54.880]  about parental consent they say oh we got consent from your 7-year-old or we
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.640]  got consent from your 11-year-old to have an abortion or to take vaccines under
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.800]  common law international law ancient law every culture's law you cannot get a
[10:05.800 --> 10:18.000]  child most cultures are about 17 to 18 in the Jewish culture it's 13 you have to
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.600]  be an adult to give consent maybe like saying you know Jeffrey Dahmer well I
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.840]  got your 14-year-old to willingly come into my house and they told me it was
[10:27.840 --> 10:31.720]  okay for me to time down and kill him oh really does that make it okay I mean
[10:31.720 --> 10:37.960]  this is just so illegal and they do it everywhere now abortions of even 10
[10:37.960 --> 10:43.840]  year olds oh you want an abortion don't tell mommy happens by the thousands
[10:43.840 --> 10:47.640]  every year in Austin to 12 13 14 year olds and they make people that live in
[10:47.640 --> 10:53.640]  Austin where I live in Texas pay for it only county in Texas where you pay to
[10:53.640 --> 11:00.920]  have little kids kill their babies and again this is just one article out of
[11:00.920 --> 11:08.680]  more than 150 I've got here and they're all just as insane and they have a
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.200]  copy of the Napolitano letter where they've been doing this really for years
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.080]  the point is why do you think all these local departments do this they have the
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.880]  TSA coming to departments now in places like New Mexico and Santa Fe remember
[11:22.880 --> 11:28.000]  last year headline TSA to screen high school prom and because people were
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.160]  saying look when we go to school events now they're grabbing our genitals
[11:31.160 --> 11:34.840]  parents don't like it and the state police said yeah that's illegal you
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.120]  can't do that and the feds came in and a federal judge came in and said the TSA
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.800]  will train your people and now they can wave a wand no 10th amendment states
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.040]  rights wave a month one no night the amendment states rights or individual
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.360]  rights wave a wand no 4th amendment wave a wand no parental consent wave a
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.680]  wand no nothing America's gone cuz they say so
[11:59.680 --> 12:12.320]  oh there is no end to this that is one article I have a whistleblower who's
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.720]  ready to come on air with his full name but I'm not gonna let him do that
[12:16.720 --> 12:20.200]  because I've been friends with him for a while we had dinner last night some of
[12:20.200 --> 12:25.960]  the crew and we were just talking he's like oh you're absolutely right they're
[12:25.960 --> 12:28.840]  training take on the American people sort of naming all the names and this
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.440]  generally met with and all that and how you know the biggest contractor group
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.680]  just tried to hire him and all this stuff and yeah most of the people he knows
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.120]  the veterans and military and police they're trying to hire actually go out
[12:42.120 --> 12:46.480]  there and find out it's not about fighting the Muslims anymore this guy
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.720]  gets that it's staged but still you know how a lot of buddies that have been
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.120]  killed in the wars over there so he does still doesn't particularly you know he
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.240]  still like wants to go over there and fight him the point is it becomes
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.720]  personal he understands it's staged but then he also still
[13:03.080 --> 13:08.400]  basically hates the radical Muslims but he understands he's coming on in about
[13:08.400 --> 13:18.520]  20 minutes that now the training is before it was 90% kill Hodges as they
[13:18.520 --> 13:26.280]  call them Muslims and 10% domestic now it's 90% gun owners libertarians
[13:26.280 --> 13:30.760]  returning veterans they're the enemies role-playing drills to take on the
[13:30.760 --> 13:36.640]  American people mass arrest civil unrest door-to-door stuff you saw in New
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.040]  Orleans gun confiscation drill that was all about a test and now it's full on
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.720]  the main shift they're telling international training Inc. or armored
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.120]  that you want contracts Bubba you're not gonna be getting them in Afghanistan
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.440]  it's gonna be here in America so whistleblowing from his sources and I
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.880]  won't let him say too much it'll give away who he is here on the show in 20
[14:01.880 --> 14:07.480]  minutes breaking just like the reeducation camp news see the bad guys
[14:07.480 --> 14:13.160]  took the country over federal government's gone federal government's gone
[14:13.160 --> 14:18.560]  it is purely a criminal enterprise and they could steal tens of trillions a
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.240]  year they can gut everything they can pay to ship general motors with your tax
[14:22.240 --> 14:25.720]  money to build the factories in China and Brazil and Eastern Europe and
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.880]  Mexico they can engage in every form of treason they got the purse strings and
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.160]  policy but they still can't get all your guns they still can't get all your
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.240]  private property they still can't shut down all those family farms they're
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.600]  trying they're setting up the systems to do it they're setting up the
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.800]  paddle-tell groups every dentist my dad knows when he got approached last year
[14:44.800 --> 14:53.640]  to spy on his patience and to be a change agent in the community he thought
[14:53.640 --> 14:59.440]  well maybe there they've come to me this patient he had for a decade to who he
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.880]  says is pretty goofy person there's a lot of people are just idiots he thought
[15:04.880 --> 15:07.840]  it might be a setup so he kind of got into a little bit to see what they would
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.720]  do and then he started talking to their dentist and they're all oh yeah we're
[15:10.720 --> 15:14.200]  all getting those visits at home and stuff we thought we were the only ones
[15:14.200 --> 15:16.920]  they always tell you you're the only one it's like a guy to a girl you're the
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.440]  only one baby I really love you every town that you urban warfare drills in
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.400]  you're the first to have this in Arcadia Iowa it said in the newspaper a gun
[15:24.400 --> 15:27.480]  confiscation drill and the colonel comes on and goes well it is a gun
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.560]  confiscation drill but you're still you know anti-military oh really anti-
[15:33.560 --> 15:39.440]  military because I don't want to have the military be used for evil oh by the
[15:39.440 --> 15:46.840]  way that's another issue here we started covering this early last week people
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.760]  couldn't believe it I mean we had the state police pulling up taking people
[15:50.760 --> 15:56.000]  admitting they take people to give them drugs cocaine heroin marijuana mass
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.360]  drugging them to make occupy Wall Street look criminal and to get
[15:59.360 --> 16:05.440]  informants and we got the training manuals for it and and then the state
[16:05.440 --> 16:10.520]  police said it didn't exist and we were liars here's Reuters today Minnesota
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.880]  police accused of giving out pot to watch behavior then they go on to say
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.520]  well it's a program in 48 states and they do do it but it's still a
[16:18.520 --> 16:23.840]  conspiracy theory so I mean it's like this double thing yeah we're doing it
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.120]  but it didn't happen yeah the troops grow the opium but still let's not
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.920]  discuss that a heroine's bad and we're gonna put you in jail we catch you with
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.040]  it you understand yeah but you're you admit you grow it as the troops are
[16:36.040 --> 16:41.280]  going public you had to just like never mind never mind but here it is DHS
[16:41.280 --> 16:46.840]  considers collecting DNA from kids DEA and US Marshall's already do it and then
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.280]  it goes on to admit they're doing this and folks 30 doing this all over the
[16:51.280 --> 16:57.440]  country so again it's DHS already collecting DNA illegally and they go to
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.400]  your kids every public school in the country I've looked at has a law
[17:03.400 --> 17:09.960]  enforcement training semester course in 6 7th or 8th grade at very school to
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.320]  school look it up you'll be shocked like oh they'll learn they might want to
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.000]  become a police officer no no no no I've shown you the training manuals is in my
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.040]  phone the takeover in that case it's out of them what is it Tennessee and
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.360]  Virginia where it says they'll have access to in the lunchroom on the

[17:55.240 --> 17:58.860]  they go into these seminars with FEMA and they start getting up there going

[18:30.560 --> 18:34.840]  have us take on their debt and tell us it's our fault and run our lives and
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.880]  arrest whoever they want it's all getting ready to fully unravel and implode
[18:39.880 --> 18:43.480]  the euro is going to go down and when it goes down folks get ready because the
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.840]  chain of the dominoes just got chills start heading towards us and they think
[18:47.840 --> 18:51.320]  the military industrial complex run by foreign banks thinks it's going to use
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.560]  the crisis it's created to pose as the savior and reorganize this country and
[18:55.560 --> 18:58.440]  they're going to shut down talk radio they're going to shut down freedom on
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.920]  the web it's already starting and they're going to try to come set people up

[19:20.440 --> 19:26.440]  along with it I'll be all right it's over and they are fully converting right
[19:26.440 --> 19:32.560]  now the majority of contracts for domestic operations with mercenaries
[19:32.560 --> 19:36.760]  against the American people just as the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of
[19:36.760 --> 19:46.880]  07 says that they're in the preparatory phase the preparatory phase to take over
[19:46.880 --> 19:51.640]  the governorships the legislatures it talks about insurrection by

[19:56.680 --> 20:02.720]  he takes orders from the UN the country is gone a little over a year ago I began
[20:02.720 --> 20:06.800]  to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I
[20:06.800 --> 20:11.240]  was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[20:11.240 --> 20:14.480]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the

[35:11.840 --> 35:15.760]  how to use it I hate it I use text messages and things it doesn't matter we
[35:15.760 --> 35:20.920]  use IM's we've had people breaking into our Yahoo I am and spoofing it we're
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.840]  gonna go to our guests in a moment Rob Jacobson has people posing as Burmese
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.920]  asking him if he wants to buy drugs saying they're coming to town and and
[35:30.920 --> 35:35.200]  that Burmese is coming to town and and and that he wants to buy drugs as we
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.520]  usually do and then he calls Burmese up and it's not Burmese or I mean you
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.080]  immediately we don't buy drugs this is we have the feds in our Yahoo instant
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.880]  messenger because they know we're using that to send news links to each other
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.000]  you know my IT guys like I got five of them he's like that's not secure I'm
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.040]  like secure I'm sending them Washington Post and associated press links so we
[36:00.040 --> 36:02.960]  can just you know I can send it to everybody in the list hey look at this
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.000]  article boom message everybody but in a way I guess there is nothing secure I
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.040]  mean next week are they gonna go in there and you know say that we're selling
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.720]  heroin or something and then oh Alex Jones got busted yeah it's hard to
[36:18.720 --> 36:23.520]  believe dealing heroin if anything like that ever happens if they say we're
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.120]  downloading pirated software not happening we buy all our software I
[36:27.120 --> 36:33.120]  hear those tattletail commercial saying tattle on your employer I've even had
[36:33.120 --> 36:35.960]  employees go oh I brought in my own software and put it on my computer I
[36:35.960 --> 36:39.880]  thought that saving money go no buy it oh but my computer is even broken I'm
[36:39.880 --> 36:45.600]  allowed to put no no we're gonna buy the software we pay extra taxes the private
[36:45.600 --> 36:51.240]  Federal Reserve I know it's all fraud we pay I tell the CPA extra because when
[36:51.240 --> 36:56.200]  they set us up it's I'm gonna 100% know it's a pure setup you understand that
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.040]  and I don't say when I say if they've already tried so many times and we're
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.560]  getting more and more effective but I'm on God's side I love God I'm standing up
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.680]  for the innocence I believe in the truth and justice and I stand against these
[37:08.680 --> 37:12.960]  people because the message has gone out even if they destroy my name whatever
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.240]  the case is shut me up kill me I win because I stood up for humanity just
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.600]  like my ancestors did and I'm not a slave and a coward and a sellout like
[37:21.600 --> 37:26.760]  them and that's what matters is what I do while I'm alive that I know I'm good
[37:26.760 --> 37:33.560]  and God knows I'm good in my heart I'm not perfect I'm a worldly person I'm
[37:33.560 --> 37:43.960]  aggressive I mean all those things but I care about the innocence so again we're
[37:43.960 --> 37:46.720]  gonna be getting into this whole report how they're setting people up and then
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.360]  and that is on there's another FBI agent missing right now this is so dangerous
[37:53.360 --> 37:59.120]  this story coming up later is on the drudge report drudge report calm talking
[37:59.120 --> 38:06.440]  surveillance cameras coming to us streets and in full wars calm story and
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.560]  they've announced that yes all over England they have another coming here
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.520]  you pay for it where every streetlight has a hidden microphone that listens to
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.800]  you at hundreds of yards it's called a shotgun mic and they're gonna hack in and
[38:17.800 --> 38:23.600]  track your cell phone traffic that's available in the package and they're
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.560]  going to shout orders at you so the bureaucrats can sit up in their little
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.080]  nest and boss you around and tell you not to do this and tell you not to do
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.520]  that just to get the general public acclimatized to living in a Soviet
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.640]  society unbelievable talking surveillance cameras coming to us streets and
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.840]  tele streets the same ones that also listen to you covertly they also have
[38:48.840 --> 38:55.440]  announced they're putting in fake little limbs and things on trees with
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.080]  unlimited money not just the drones with microphones and cameras watching you in
[38:59.080 --> 39:02.720]  the park and again every time there's a crime it can't solve anything or they
[39:02.720 --> 39:06.040]  never even tell you about it it's about letting you know foreign banks run
[39:06.040 --> 39:09.200]  America and we're surveilling you and there's nothing you can do resistance
[39:09.200 --> 39:22.600]  futile well that's a fraud now this next news is really big it's not news that the
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.720]  big defense contractors have been training for a long time and the big
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.080]  mercenary firms to take on the American people it's not news that the guns
[39:31.080 --> 39:35.480]  were confiscated in Katrina in the high and dry safe areas and aid was not
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.040]  rendered all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed in the
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.960]  city remember that quote by the police chief while the other police were busy
[39:43.960 --> 39:49.720]  robbing Walmart and local banks that's what you can expect during any type of
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.240]  collapse with the EU starting to go down by design the next will be the United
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.640]  States all by design the very banks that have engineered all this will pose as a
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.560]  savior it's important to understand that we know about the John Warren defense
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.240]  authorization act the NDAA the CIA director said yeah we're watching you
[40:07.240 --> 40:10.960]  domestically no more warrants all the major appliance you pay for now have
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.160]  spy tech microphones cameras built into them from clock radios to computers and
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.120]  cell phones it's just all in your face TSA now at highway checkpoints from
[40:20.120 --> 40:28.560]  Dallas to Los Angeles from Chicago to Boston 203,000 people search without
[40:28.560 --> 40:31.520]  warrants on the streets of New York the first three months of this year source of
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.640]  that New York Times yesterday it's on full acclamation checkpoints on
[40:37.640 --> 40:42.320]  highways Marines Army checkpoints private contractor checkpoints private
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.040]  contractors now calling themselves district 23 in Tennessee we got a call
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.720]  about that I confirmed it through my sources in the state police up there
[40:50.720 --> 40:54.160]  that they're just told these are contractors they can do what they want
[40:54.160 --> 40:58.640]  or you'll be fired if you don't go along with this it's all totally illegal I
[40:58.640 --> 41:02.280]  just read to you DHS documents where they announced they're taking your
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.400]  children's DNA at school and telling them not to tell you without warrants
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.280]  it's on you read the headline it's DHS considers it then goes on to admit they
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.680]  are since 2010 it shows the documents and I read you articles last week where in
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.200]  Texas and California they're taking DNA from elementary students without telling
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.680]  parents they take your blood at birth I told you that 15 years ago declassified
[41:25.680 --> 41:31.880]  three years ago put in a global database it's on it's real it's here but the
[41:31.880 --> 41:37.040]  reason my guest info is so important is that I'm not gonna tell you what he does
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.920]  but obviously he works in and around contractors and works in the training and
[41:41.920 --> 41:47.520]  works with the military and police I'll just leave it at that and as a firearms
[41:47.520 --> 41:54.680]  expert was just saying armor is the best way to describe him and most his
[41:54.680 --> 41:57.960]  bodies are being sent as contractors to Afghanistan he's been offered a lot of
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.480]  money he's refusing to do it because of family the point is is that he confirmed
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.320]  what my other sources are telling me we know they're training the contractors to
[42:07.320 --> 42:10.360]  take on the American people that's admitted but there's a total flip now
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.960]  where before it was 90% trained to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan where they
[42:14.960 --> 42:18.640]  pulled most the troops out or pulling them out but are putting contractors in
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.480]  those wars are on that conversion to mercenaries is happening but it's one
[42:24.480 --> 42:32.200]  thing to get mercenaries to fight the foreign armies and foreign insurgents
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.880]  another thing to get them out of these training facilities and say okay now
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.880]  it's not 90% Hodges as they call them it's 90% gun owners libertarians
[42:41.880 --> 42:46.920]  conservatives land rights groups and they have role players where Americans
[42:46.920 --> 42:50.080]  don't put us in the camp you're not taking my guns the same stuff you've seen
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.240]  me film it drills that's not the big news it's that they're flipping it to not
[42:55.240 --> 42:59.640]  just beta testing and creating small cadres to train larger groups they're
[42:59.640 --> 43:03.720]  going fully operational they admit even mechanics in the army and Air Force
[43:03.720 --> 43:06.640]  for being trained in riot control my cousins told me that he's an officer in
[43:06.640 --> 43:13.360]  the army 23 years in there's a total conversion that's admitted but the issue
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.960]  is they're accelerating the conversion and there's a mutiny because they tried
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.760]  to go out and I mean they're going to veterans who are 50 years old 55 they're
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.880]  going to out there and trying to get them in as a secret infraguard domestic
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.880]  army and when the guys are told oh yeah you're gonna be fighting terrorists but
[43:33.880 --> 43:39.320]  they get to the base and it's all right your enemy looks like this and they
[43:39.320 --> 43:42.720]  basically put you know literally on video demonized founding fathers I have
[43:42.720 --> 43:49.320]  footage of that in that they show police in Missouri in my film martial law just
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.040]  type in the YouTube FEMA says founding fathers are bad and you'll see FEMA
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.640]  teaching police this well basically it's that but they say get ready to go
[43:57.640 --> 44:02.760]  operational and I've got this from multiple sources but David and that's not
[44:02.760 --> 44:06.320]  his real name he has a lot of courage he wanted to come in here on air and talk
[44:06.320 --> 44:11.160]  about this today we were having dinner last night after some work we were doing
[44:11.160 --> 44:17.000]  and I said no you're not coming on air we're gonna protect you as a source
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  you're gonna get us more information I can open the phones up to after he's
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.400]  on fact we'll do that and you'll watch as police and military contractors call
[44:25.400 --> 44:30.000]  in and confirm it all on air but plus we have all the documents it's just it's a
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.360]  piece to hear a piece there you know the reeducation camp document for
[44:33.360 --> 44:37.640]  American citizens who won't accept communism and again it's big banks
[44:37.640 --> 44:41.440]  communizing us to steal our wealth transferring it offshore it's the mega
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.680]  rich funding that all right I'm gonna shut up David I wanted to preface it
[44:45.680 --> 44:50.960]  we're gonna have you to the end of the hour tell us tell us what these groups
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.320]  of people that they've tried to take and train what's happening because the news
[44:55.320 --> 45:02.000]  of the mutiny against this is is is big news that even contractors are saying
[45:02.000 --> 45:11.440]  no tell us what's happening David basically we have we have training camps
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.740]  all throughout the United States for a lot of these military contractors these
[45:15.740 --> 45:20.400]  military contractors are former soldiers that have switched over to the
[45:20.400 --> 45:24.480]  private sector for the benefit of more money unfortunately with the way the
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.000]  economy is going and a lot less contractors being focused on that
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.920]  anti-stand region that's left them out of work so to speak so they are offering
[45:32.920 --> 45:38.440]  their services to really the highest bidder we've been volunteering down on
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.520]  a certain location in South Texas with a company called International Training
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.240]  Incorporated that's really been focusing on insurgencies and things like that
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.560]  throughout the Middle East so we've been volunteering as insurgents and in that
[45:51.560 --> 45:58.160]  way it gives these contractors the ability to sort of get used to the
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.200]  environment of being ambushed on roadside bombs driving through small
[46:04.200 --> 46:07.360]  villages and being attacked things like that but now what they're doing is
[46:07.360 --> 46:13.360]  changing with focus over the civilians American civilians they are looking for
[46:13.360 --> 46:19.280]  what they call domestic terrorists and civil on the mass civil unrest I've heard
[46:19.280 --> 46:23.680]  terminology used and compared towards what's going on in Greece right now and
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.920]  a lot of us volunteers had done this pretty much just to stay in the game
[46:28.920 --> 46:36.040]  but it's one thing when we're helping units go overseas and maybe save lives
[46:36.040 --> 46:41.600]  or save American lives but it's another when they start coming over here to
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.640]  train to oppress American people and label them so loosely as the American
[46:46.640 --> 46:55.200]  domestic terror or civil unrest they could be defined as anything nowadays now
[46:55.200 --> 47:02.520]  David breaking this down for people the good news is that there's also some bad
[47:02.520 --> 47:09.360]  news what percentage of people like yourself that have worked with the
[47:09.360 --> 47:12.560]  contractors playing the part of insurgents playing the part of highly
[47:12.560 --> 47:19.120]  trained insurgents what percentage are now refusing to be part of the let's go
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.600]  after people wearing John Deere caps the new mission I would say 80 or 90% a lot
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.440]  of us just turned our back on the whole subject there's been various government
[47:28.440 --> 47:33.080]  agencies coming in to fill the slots that's the bad news explain what's
[47:33.080 --> 47:38.280]  happening there well you know they they this company only accepts military
[47:38.280 --> 47:44.880]  former military active military as volunteers or recruits so they're
[47:44.880 --> 47:51.080]  starting to tie in with government agencies from the FBI DHS the ATF and
[47:51.080 --> 47:57.400]  basically the three of them are starting to send in these volunteers to replace
[47:57.400 --> 48:03.800]  us and once we heard that the number of that 80 to 90% is what materialized it
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.840]  was I would say about 20 or 30% but once we started seeing government agencies
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.960]  coming in to fill those gaps you know we started smelling something that we
[48:14.960 --> 48:20.520]  didn't like and this is a massive gear up tell us about the particular company
[48:20.520 --> 48:26.080]  international training Inc. International training Inc. is just just
[48:26.080 --> 48:31.240]  fed up with G4S they're basically one of the largest security contractors for
[48:31.240 --> 48:37.480]  Pentagon when blackwater fell these are the guys who picked up the slack and
[48:37.480 --> 48:41.760]  they have considerable activity over the Middle East right now they are the
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.680]  majority of security contractors in Iraq that everyone says that aren't there
[48:46.680 --> 48:52.800]  how big do you think their black division is their hitman division hitman
[48:52.800 --> 48:56.640]  division and something like that really just it's that's a pay grade it's not a
[48:56.640 --> 49:01.200]  designation these are people who fight for money they don't fight for causes
[49:01.200 --> 49:06.240]  and the problem is as I said we have an economy that's how much are they gonna
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.760]  have to get paid to take on families and take the dads away so the government
[49:10.760 --> 49:14.280]  people can take a little toddlers away and have fun with them well I know it
[49:14.280 --> 49:18.600]  would be anywhere between 150 to 180 thousand for a nine month tour if you're
[49:18.600 --> 49:25.160]  going overseas so I can only imagine that they would match that here well
[49:25.160 --> 49:30.040]  that's pretty cheap for somebody sold absolutely and that's why a lot of us
[49:30.040 --> 49:39.000]  that turn our back because it's cheap because it's just not right you were
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.040]  telling me recently you turned down a quite a bit of money to do some of this
[49:42.040 --> 49:45.880]  work I mean how much were they offering you they were offering me a hundred and
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.000]  eighty thousand dollars to do escorts from Pakistan to Afghanistan for a nine
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.400]  month tour you know because I have children I just yeah I just can't put
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.200]  that risk of my life and so a single would be a little bit different but at
[50:01.200 --> 50:05.880]  the end of the day the way things are going my family there's just too many
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.400]  reasons not to do it so is this a pretty big you were telling this is a big
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.440]  wake-up call in the police and military community I mean that's what I'm hearing
[50:14.440 --> 50:16.720]  you were telling me about you were having dinner with a three-star retired
[50:16.720 --> 50:20.360]  three-star general recently retired and I mean all this coming out in the open
[50:20.360 --> 50:23.840]  the work and I and others have done I think it's really waking people up now
[50:23.840 --> 50:30.200]  that this is so real yeah it's getting alarming I mean this individual I had
[50:30.200 --> 50:33.840]  dinner with I'm not going to mention any names but the individual I had dinner
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.120]  with had retired because of what's going on in the climate he refused to do his
[50:38.120 --> 50:42.240]  duty and he opted for retirement he was at the age he had the years under his
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.520]  belt and he took it he took it smart wise way tell you what stay there I want to
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.880]  hear about that folks this is no joke this is no game we are in so much
[50:51.880 --> 50:55.800]  trouble I mean this is a foreign takeover of America if you ever want to
[50:55.800 --> 51:01.200]  know how America would fall infiltration this is an infiltration sick of the
[51:01.200 --> 51:04.920]  globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing

[54:07.280 --> 54:15.640]  name today and talk about all this but I said no but just amazing to find out
[54:15.640 --> 54:22.000]  that he's you know meeting with big groups of veterans police types you
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.840]  military and that they're really waking up well you better wake up I mean FEMA
[54:29.840 --> 54:35.480]  sits there and says the founding fathers in America is bad on video right there
[54:35.480 --> 54:41.400]  I mean that's that's the enemy of course they're saying people that know what
[54:41.400 --> 54:44.600]  America really is in the bad guys and there's the footage FEMA says founding
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.160]  fathers or terrorists just type that in the YouTube 84,000 views I was sent 18
[54:50.160 --> 54:55.640]  hours of this and I've had police calling and go yeah they teach us that that was
[54:55.640 --> 55:02.920]  from 2000 so now they're getting the contractors ready do you think this is
[55:02.920 --> 55:08.040]  going to fly even if they have a false flag David a stage terror attack to make
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.320]  it look like domestic groups are working with foreigners or something I mean you
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.920]  think the contractors are really going to buy into this and really try to go for
[55:14.920 --> 55:20.280]  gun confiscation and door-to-door arrest of people on pickup list these are men
[55:20.280 --> 55:26.520]  without the level of honor that most soldiers are out there have they'll do
[55:26.520 --> 55:30.760]  whatever they're paid to do at the end of the day you know they use mainstream
[55:30.760 --> 55:37.800]  media as a marketing tool for their next big plan a lot of stuff I see and then I
[55:37.800 --> 55:45.400]  see it in a news article six months later which is completely false but you know
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.600]  the the minority gets drowned out no one wants to listen to us until they're
[55:49.600 --> 55:52.960]  actually brought into something like this and then they wake up
[55:52.960 --> 55:57.160]  unfortunately that's not a large number let's go back to the three-star general
[55:57.160 --> 56:02.160]  who got out because of this recently tell us what he was telling him well his
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.200]  conversation with me was primarily over Afghanistan a lot of what we were
[56:07.200 --> 56:10.960]  discussing was lithium deposits and so forth that they announced about a year
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.240]  or two ago that they found this huge it's not the largest lithium deposit of
[56:15.240 --> 56:19.480]  the world in Afghanistan which pretty much seals our fate there but at the
[56:19.480 --> 56:25.680]  same time we happen to know geologists for Texaco who found that exact same
[56:25.680 --> 56:31.320]  deposit about 25 years ago it's not something it's not something you got a
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.040]  guess on it's just adding one plus one it's really you have something it's
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.840]  discovered and then all of a sudden it's newly discovered what 23 years ago and
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.160]  it's a key well you can't discover it right before the invasion and admit it
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.240]  because that's what it's about and of course they admit trillions of dollars
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.000]  of it one of the only big deposits it's known as a rare earth mineral it's
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.120]  needed for everything yeah all the electronics batteries you name it
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.240]  absolutely essential no at the end of the day there's so many lobbyists going
[57:01.240 --> 57:04.960]  in the American government that they're using the security contractors in our
[57:04.960 --> 57:11.280]  own military as basically enforcement to get what corporations need and I've
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.320]  seen it with my own eyes it's just something that they want it they're
[57:15.320 --> 57:20.240]  gonna get it how much is gonna cost them and they see America they see America is
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.800]  that look at the euro getting ready to implode I mean this is dangerous what
[57:24.800 --> 57:28.840]  was also a reason why they've allowed a lot more gang members or gang-affiliated
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.240]  individuals into the US Army in the US Marines right now with the highest rate
[57:33.240 --> 57:39.200]  of gang-affiliated soldiers that were at 19% these are the primarily the large
[57:39.200 --> 57:42.600]  demographic who go into these security contracting bits when they get out
[57:42.600 --> 57:46.320]  because otherwise what are they gonna do go put bang bang on the street why do
[57:46.320 --> 57:49.960]  that when you can continue doing what you're doing making six figures you know
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.560]  I saw that they keep busting gangs of the Army special forces shipping guns and
[57:55.560 --> 57:59.120]  drugs back and forth and then hanging them out to dry but it turns out they're
[57:59.120 --> 58:02.520]  really working for the Justice Department yeah I mean they had a big
[58:02.520 --> 58:07.640]  incident last year with Navy SEALs doing baton San Diego Southern California has
[58:07.640 --> 58:10.920]  been a hotbed for that you got a lot of police officers who are responding to
[58:10.920 --> 58:17.080]  calls against basically gang members who are ring or train and these cops are
[58:17.080 --> 58:21.240]  dying they're not prepared for it so there's a lot of interaction between
[58:21.240 --> 58:26.820]  law enforcement and the military to exchange tactics well you know Stalin
[58:26.820 --> 58:31.480]  Stalin did that he took the criminals and made them his enforcers against the
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.720]  military stay there I want to come back this is so important David is our guest

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.960]  Alex Jones all right David I've been bringing up a lot of points we had up on
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.560]  screen for people watching on prison planet TV the big Texas training
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.760]  facility of international training Inc. where you told me that they're now
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.560]  converting over to take on the American people gotta love it take our tax money
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.880]  squeeze it out of people take all ladies houses because they can't pay the IRS and
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:52.400]  then hire mercs to go after the American people I would not want that job if they
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.600]  think Afghanistan has been a problem boy what are they thinking again if you
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.520]  just joined us David is giving us the intel we know the contractors are
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.720]  training to take on the American people that's not denied but that there's a
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.800]  revolt against this comments on how you see this unfolding and could our speaking
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.400]  out against this make this program back off or if the globalists put something
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:22.280]  into motion that they can't stop a lot of the volunteers are speaking out about
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.680]  it primarily because they got their own lives to live and they're afraid they're
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:32.360]  afraid of repercussions how this I see this playing out I see incidents in
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.040]  neighborhoods urban areas where a suspected domestic terrorist is maybe
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:46.040]  called upon and the use of play phrase and it's swelling you know usually in
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.360]  these training stamps they're not meant to suppress one individual they're meant
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.240]  to suppress an area so that means innocent people are gonna have to succumb
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.440]  to this and if they fight back they too will be labeled as domestic terrorists
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.920]  this will swell it's just a matter of demographics it depends where they hit
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.840]  if you did this in New York or LA you got a very very complacent society there
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.800]  so at that point it probably be somewhat effective but if you tried this
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.440]  somewhere say Texas or Tennessee or Central Florida these are places that
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:25.080]  would and most they would definitely revolt and they would be labeled as
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.680]  domestic terrorists and this issue would swell making news media pretty much
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.400]  beating it however the government you know it's gonna cause the revolt I want
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.200]  to come back and do five more minutes I know you've got a ghost and but I want
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.160]  to break this down from history looking at it it's gonna be the minions of the
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.800]  enforcers and the tattletales that are gonna get abusive and start abusing
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.920]  people that are gonna cause the revolts and I see the system losing the civil
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.960]  war and then yeah absolutely but not before there's a lot of attrition I mean
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.200]  there's a lot of people who are gonna be far farmed because of this these
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.600]  security contractors do not care who their guns were pointed at and that's
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.600]  what a lot of people don't realize that's why they're contractors they do
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.280]  what they do for money and they're gonna be calling in drones that's why
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.800]  they're getting the drones ready for everybody yeah the government won't do
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.880]  it there's someone out there that will I mean at this point people are hurting
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:22.240]  for money and not all these people have ethics and ideally with their level of
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.080]  training putting a well-paid lawyer I'm sorry a well-paid warrior out of
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.800]  business and in financial financial ruin is a dangerous thing because you make
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.600]  them desperate and when you make them desperate you'll make choices that you
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.240]  normally wouldn't make and then you also have the contingency that really don't
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.440]  care anyway and those are the ones that are still residing in these companies
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.440]  ITI you know they are just like black water they sell the highest bidder they'll
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.880]  offer things to civilians they'll offer to government programs corporations
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.640]  held they'll run coupons with living social they've done it back in a couple
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.920]  months ago they don't care who they train and the things they trained are
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.440]  very very detrimental to their fellow man yeah I think the most important thing
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.280]  here David is that we try to stave this off with information warfare with the
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.640]  truth we try to point out that foreign interests are basically infiltrating and
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.680]  trying to overthrow this republic as they've done countless other countries
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.360]  and this is the big moment of truth but if it goes to physical confrontation it's
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.800]  gonna be a lot of black propaganda a lot of stage terror attacks and atrocities
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.160]  blamed on domestic groups to turn the public against them we've got to
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.640]  inoculate people psychologically about that tool up front and also we have to
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.080]  understand just killing police military and contractors does not defeat the New
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.040]  World Order we have to understand the globalists are the enemy the globalists
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.360]  are the ones that did this I want to come right back on the other side stay

[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.440]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:17.440]  coming up federal workers data shows that their salaries exploded across the

[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:44.280]  the future belongs to us Steve Watson article what does he is suspending the
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.040]  main campaign mean but keep going for delegates we'll break that down and take
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.480]  your phone calls but first David I want you to recap everything you've talked
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.720]  about and then get into the subject of the globalist wanting to cause a civil
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:02.040]  war because I've looked at it I've seen do this in other countries they want to
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.880]  wreck this nation they want to have something so bad they can get the guns
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.240]  so bad during a depression they can pose as a saviors and then roll in with
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.040]  foreign mercenaries and UN troops hundred or old timers the military
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.040]  mainly a high-level officers 20 years ago coming out and saying there's a plan
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.160]  to use foreign troops I thought it was a conspiracy theory then I saw urban
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.000]  warfare footage of foreign troops training with our military to take on
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.160]  the American people with role players having their guns confiscated here in
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.200]  the US then I went to drills myself at Roth base and at the military try to set
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.320]  me up and and my hotel rooms broken into and and I'm in Florida and Brooksville
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.440]  trying to cover it by a park with the military and a guy jumps out and playing
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.760]  closer at setting things on fire and saying that I'd done it and me and Mike
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.480]  Hansen had to put it out and basically we start restraining the person then
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.800]  doing buggies come pulling up I mean let me tell you you're not in Kansas okay
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.800]  America's been this giant prize to take over the world with our tax money our
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.000]  military our our system the global a stage events then send us in to fight
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.960]  people they're actually funding as well as a pretext to create battle hardened
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:15.080]  troops to bring them back here to the US to attack us and that is exactly what
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.880]  has now happened that is exactly what has now unfolded and David let's just
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.920]  say as an armor firearms expert and trainer and works with a lot of people
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.040]  that are contractors slash mercenaries and we'll just leave it at that and he
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.520]  was talking about he just joined us now international training ankle into the
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:43.360]  biggest mercenary outfits huge training complex in Texas and before it was
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:51.600]  pretty much all fighting Afghans and Iraqis or others that was the simulations
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:58.720]  that they were they were engaged in now it's shifting to a breakneck massive
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.800]  gear up for domestic terrorists for the American people and you get the training
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.600]  manuals it's gun owners libertarians conservatives Ron Paul supporters all I
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.400]  got to say is good luck now let's let's get any other tidbits you haven't
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.880]  covered and where you think all this is going and why do you think they're
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.600]  gearing up and the police and military you work with and talk to what do they
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.160]  think is happening because I know I I know why this is happening but I want
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.960]  their perspective what do they think's happening well I mean there's a lot of
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.400]  people think that they're responding in a negative way usually in a situation
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.200]  where you have a lot of people who become alarmed because of activity
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.880]  government has but anytime there's really no intention to apply that kind of
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.120]  force to the people the government will usually respond with the tactic of do
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.400]  nothing but now they're doing something in the polar opposite they're
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.400]  actually gearing up they're bringing in these people they're flexing the idea you
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.720]  know originally it was you know everyone was fearing the UN troops there's
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.000]  maneuvers going on stateside things like that and they started seeing the
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.440]  reaction the American people and now they've switched their focus more over
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.040]  to the security contractors these are people who don't exactly actually sort
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.040]  of live above the law and a lot of people are concerned with it a lot of
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.800]  people are starting to stockpile provisions because of it you know before
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.560]  they had some concerns that were legitimate about the economy and things
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.280]  like that but when you actually see the government take steps like this to hire
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:34.120]  these types of people to do these types maneuvers it's terrifying and at the
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.360]  end of the day no one can really say how exactly it's going to play out so
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.720]  everyone's just starting to prepare
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:52.120]  continuum basically we have a lot more of these firms popping up GS4 was a
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.000]  separate firm now they're united with ITI they have a location in Virginia as
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.840]  well as Texas these are huge compounds like 300 acres or give or take a quarter
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.360]  but basically they're training everything from ambush tactics urban
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.200]  warfare going on into hand-to-hand as well as you know doing a live
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.680]  semi-discrimination fire they're also utilizing some of this training on as I
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.280]  said earlier they're bringing the community in and unbeknownst to them
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.200]  they're you know these people think they're having fun fighting these
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.120]  government contractors meanwhile these government contractors are practicing
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.600]  on them and they don't even realize that this is this mainstream as I said
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.480]  earlier I saw a living social ad back in March I think that you know was
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.000]  basically for a live train a live fire training day where they would learn how
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.920]  to you know drive a car and in hospital situations and go through tactical
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.880]  live fire simulation drills and what they're not realizing is the
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.640]  instructors there are practicing on them they're utilizing them to create
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:07.560]  more war games on a private end well that's what's funny is people would put
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.680]  all these blackwater stickers on their car and talk about how patriotic they
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.360]  are they're in Dubai they are you know in there overcharging the government the
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.040]  contractors has come out in federal court would get naked at parties and with a
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.720]  bunch of men this came out in federal court and use so much cocaine and
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.880]  Baghdad they would run around and just start shooting everybody for fun we
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.440]  would hear those stories now that's confirmed well obviously somebody
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.880]  morally that will take on the American people of course they're gonna have
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.480]  other problems and and it just shows they're divorced from reality and so what
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.760]  you see is all the good people leaving again these evil people though I've
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.280]  noticed don't work very good together and it doesn't go on for long and they
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.680]  have so many problems I think this is an enemy we're gonna be able to defeat
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.440]  if it does go to physical confrontation because they're gonna commit atrocities
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.960]  and the American people are gonna wake up and so I think the global is to
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.360]  miscalculated they think it's gonna be some long-term civil war they're gonna
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.200]  be able to control it they're gonna be able to stage events and blame it on
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.440]  domestic groups that's not gonna happen we got the jump on them we warned people
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.480]  for years and got made fun of we're not getting laughed at now and I just want
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.800]  people to understand that is that the police and military I talked to now are
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.760]  waking up what are you seeing with police and military because you work with a
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.680]  lot of them are they waking up as I'm saying a lot of them are a lot of them
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.960]  are and that's really the contingency that I don't think the government has
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.760]  prepared for you have a lot of these people like you these civilians who are
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.600]  seeking training aggressively and pick up like the deals like I mentioned
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.840]  earlier and while they're getting training they're also being labeled but
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.280]  what a lot of people don't realize is a lot of these veterans police officers
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:57.240]  things like that they are actually prepared they are ready to go they're
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.960]  keeping their mouth shut because it keeps them in line of information you
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.880]  know they like that they don't like to be kept in the dark about these kind of
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:10.240]  things a lot of them are just ready and waiting so there's a contingency of
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.480]  active soldiers veterans as well as law enforcement who will turn and when that
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.000]  happens the government's gonna get a bigger bite than they're they're
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.840]  expecting and again the government is a foreign Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.200]  occupation force on record that's the Economist magazine they think we're so
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.600]  stupid they think you're so stupid soldiers and police that they brag and
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.720]  Henry Kissinger wrote in Woodward and Bernstein's book was quoted as calling
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.400]  you dumb animals well are you dumb animals I have to say the military is
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.000]  the most await group I've seen now that's why they're converting and over to
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.800]  gang members and contractors and criminals and foreigners is because they
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.760]  believe they'll do whatever they're told so by and large more and more the
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.000]  military is gone because they the globalists have to destroy it before
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.200]  they destroy the United States and while having our military do missions that
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:11.600]  are illegal and criminal while giving us a domestic propaganda broadcast that
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.000]  makes us think it's good the globalists are demonizing us worldwide before our
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.400]  destruction this has all been fought out 20 30 levels deep people say the
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.640]  globalists are thinking you know six month increments so they're thinking in
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.560]  50 year plans as the big New Brzezinski wrote in two of his books that's why we
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.520]  saw this way off and many people saw it 50 years ago and we've been on a 50 year
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.160]  plan against them knowing it was coming to this and that's why we're going to
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.960]  beat them we don't have a choice but I'm telling you folks we have a good chance
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.440]  if you scream bloody murder get the word out aggressively now and warn people
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.720]  and speak out now and keep leaking information now I've been told by high
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.880]  level sources David the system got so freaked out when we leaked two weeks ago
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.280]  the reeducation camp document to the army now confirms is real have you heard
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.960]  anything about reeducation camps I haven't heard about it I've heard it's
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.240]  something up in Wyoming you know when in one ear and out the other I'm like
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:16.960]  and get more information about but some sort of the DHS facility they'd set up
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.160]  outside of Cheyenne for domestic terrorism or some some something like
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.280]  that but outside of that and I've just been focusing on this and the appalling
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:34.680]  nature of what's going on I'm just completely disgusted the fact that the
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.720]  fact that you know you and I are one day will be under fire is starting to
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.400]  become more and more of a reality you know what I want you to elaborate in the
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.160]  final five minutes in the short segment and I'm gonna go to calls and other
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:49.720]  news David I appreciate your time I want you to elaborate on the other side
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:55.640]  just briefly on on a point that you were making there about you think you're
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.400]  having fun when you go out and play the part of a combatant you're now being

[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.800]  this final segment and so much news broke during the break I forgot the big
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.280]  question I had for you David what was the point I was bringing up during the
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.320]  break the point was a lot of Americans going and seeking training out of fear
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.800]  for their government they got to really take a deep look at who they're taking
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.640]  training from a lot of these individuals are still active military a lot of them
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.280]  are working in military intelligence and you can bet that your life that they are
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:24.040]  recording the information you know a lot of these are doing one-day tactical
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.400]  courses two-day tactical courses sometimes even the full week and what
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.440]  they're doing is they're utilizing this not only to sort of monitor the behavior
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.760]  patterns of these people but also their tactics and seeing how they start
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.240]  evolving all their own little groups they'll do one-day training exercise now
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.680]  allow these civilians to sort of come up and modify these these exercises and
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.240]  tactics they've learned and then what they're doing is analyzing what they're
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:55.280]  doing and recording it for their own needs and those own needs is going out
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.320]  and suppressing domestic terrorists and civil unrest well also it's creating a
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.320]  database of people to later claim that they're threats to create a synthetic
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.400]  fake threat and you've got all these well-meaning people that think you know
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:15.320]  the local Blackwater facility or G4S is their friend that they're helping the
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:22.880]  contractors and and it's all a big joke to them it's all really funny and it's
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.960]  totally disgusting I want to tell the military and police and conduct or
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:30.000]  something you're all put on list to just because you're taught to be
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.760]  sociopathic and look at everybody as idiots those above you look at you like
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.840]  that Henry Kissinger calls you a dumb animal and the fact that you would sell
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.000]  out your country and think that your winners because you've signed on to
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.840]  tyranny you are the biggest fools of them all to somebody that doesn't have
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.640]  their morals and doesn't have their backbone and doesn't stand for something
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:56.280]  is a punk and is a nobody what do you say to that David you know money does
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.680]  some odd things to people you know desperation does even worse and that's
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.280]  what we're facing right now is sort of the filtering out of people who will and
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.000]  people who won't but people who won't or financially suffer and a lot of these
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.840]  individuals if you're a zoning out there and you're actually seeking training
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:20.080]  don't do it with the agency that also provides military contracts it's just a
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.880]  conflict of interest eventually you will be on the radar well my point is you
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.000]  can either be totally on the radar or stay off the radar I tell people either
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.480]  go hot or go cold don't go in between and you know as for trainings and
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.920]  tactics I mean my all I you know is nobody's taking my kids to a FEMA
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.120]  camp and I have to know that there are a lot of American people who are not
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.440]  going to go quietly into the night and we just can't turn our children over to
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.880]  Abu Ghraib situations absolutely and there's people out there the Texas
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:58.080]  rumors the Texas State Guard is starting to work on routes and safe places for
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.320]  these types of events where they need to get innocent people out to safe
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:06.240]  environments and get them out of the fray I don't hear of anything of actual
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.160]  contact with these contractors as far as engagement or for planned
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.440]  engagement but I'm sure that's on the back burner once they finalize safe
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.400]  havens for innocent people well let's be clear they safe havens you mean FEMA
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.800]  camps or safe havens for the guards children because they're now having the
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.240]  State Guard go out and just show up at high school football games and search
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.240]  people as part of slave training they're now having them out at the kite
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.760]  festival well the National Guard and the State Guard that definitely operating
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.960]  in two different capacities National Guard is still branched to US military
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  State Guard is not now I know that explain to me what's the relationship
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.480]  between State Guard and the Mercs there's not they won't touch them they are
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.440]  completely opposed to their existence and that is one of the one of the one of
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.600]  the things that allow faith still in State Guard is that they're pushing so
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.680]  much distance away from agencies like that including the National Guard so
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.720]  they're good guys that's what I've heard so the system wants to get rid of them
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:12.440]  them well the system may want to but State of Texas won't all right buddy good
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.440]  having you on let me say bye to you here during the break we got huge Ron Paul
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.880]  news that rattled me so hard I was flummox when I got on air poll axed think
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.360]  that's the first time I've screwed up and use somebody's real name he didn't

[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.760]  again how do I know it's a setup Paul Watson and I put this article together
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.320]  this morning I gave him the basic research and he added more and when I
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.800]  put the article together I'm not telling you about that so that you know who
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.120]  actually did the article it's more so you understand why my name is on the
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:37:00.480]  article Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones how do I know that because giant
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.320]  agencies private contractors FBI agents you name it are allowed to kidnap kids
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.000]  and snuff them on video it's come out and they don't get in trouble they're
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  allowed to run giant child kidnapping rings that are so big it's in the millions
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.560]  over a three-year period was 1.1 million that's BBC 2000 to 2003 look it up the
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:29.200]  UN everywhere they go rape rob murder sex slaves physical slaves Halliburton
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.680]  loads up thousands of men usually flies on to remote islands other side of the
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.880]  world to work in horrible sweatshop factories as total slaves I mean it's
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.840]  it's beyond any movie you could imagine and it's going on everywhere totally
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:50.400]  ruthless and they really hate America and they want to do that here the FBI will
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.800]  do whatever it's told they've shown that with Oklahoma City 9-11 you name it so
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:02.440]  when they are busting somebody it's the occasional PR bust a snack is what they
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.800]  call it to make it look like they're fighting crime or it's the low-level
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:12.760]  compartmentalized groups that are just dealing with white collar stuff but when
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.560]  you get a senior FBI agent I'm gonna cover this more in the next hour after
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:22.440]  go to calls who goes off and start his own firm and then they busting and it's
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.720]  this thing of looking at child porn you know a federal court ruled I'm gonna
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.160]  cover that later that looking at it isn't a crime it's disgusting it's
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:36.640]  horrible to humanizing but the point is they don't want to actually prosecute
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.440]  the real people they want to be able to just have something pop up on your
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.920]  computer I mean what about the world that daily reporter we had on last week
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.600]  who went out and showed that Facebook allows serious child porn all over it and
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.400]  I told the crew I said don't even look at it don't even look at the world that
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.160]  daily article even though it's blurred out and don't show it on TV they'll
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:05.240]  selectively enforce on us just get her on because under this system they could
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.520]  go after a reporter that reports on it well the federal court said you can't
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.040]  and they're saying it's a pro pedophile ruling no it's not it's saying something
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.400]  pops up on your computer I've never seen anything like that on a computer but
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.720]  I've I've been on back when my space was still being used you know and a video
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.920]  pops up of a guy with a horse you know just discuss I mean you know what you
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:30.640]  see you've been on the internet and you're on one of those big sites and
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.640]  some cookie gets thrown on your computer I'm not really a tech guy but you know I
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:42.080]  saw once something pop up that was just you know a lot of disgusting stuff on
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.760]  there's the point and that you know it just pops up when we're gonna even close
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.000]  your eyes there's that image of just you know just disgusting things it's not
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.880]  kind of stuff the globalists are into eating poop and things like that so the
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.360]  point is that stuff pops up oh you're going to jail now all they got to do is
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.840]  put that stuff on the Pentagon computers then blackmail everybody and that's what
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  they're doing and again even if he was really doing this because a lot of the
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:14.960]  folks that will bomb buildings or be part of covering them up they're into
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.640]  that kind of stuff I mean if you're gonna blow up federal buildings and then
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.280]  poses the guy doing the research you know to cover up as we know they had
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.960]  bombs in there Oklahoma City he's they had guy that covered that up I don't have
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.160]  to go over all the evidence of the inside job it's ridiculous so if even if he
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:35.200]  did it they're selectively enforcing on him for some reason maybe he's a good
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.160]  guy who went along with the cover up early on because it was so big and didn't
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.200]  know what to do in the moment and was speaking out I don't know I just know
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.320]  they don't bust Dinecore and Paul has it in his articles we have congressional
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.160]  testimony where they admit they kidnapped small children worldwide and and take
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:59.400]  them to Thailand Saudi Arabia and Israel those are the three big ones I mean
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:03.960]  stuff you can't even imagine I've seen mainstream articles about they've got
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.680]  pleasure ships with kidnapped women and children on board of them and it even
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.560]  comes out in the news that they have these yachts I mean big ocean liners
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.520]  that rich people go to international waters I always say at a whale wars group
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.840]  ramming that ship and stopping it oh I guess I'm being criminal now saying
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.720]  ram a ship okay let them torture the children the point is they they don't
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.520]  but the upper echelons are into this and other sick stuff you don't get in the
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.840]  club unless you are unless you're bent and twisted and evil and enjoy this I
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.280]  guess I'm already getting into this news but former FBI bomb investigator
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.720]  arrested on child pornography charges and even when he said not guilty they
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.240]  said a preliminary not guilty to make it sound like he's bad they don't even say
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:57.880]  he was the head guy over the entire system the head of their laboratory for
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.320]  explosives their head instructor that they're their head forensics
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:06.800]  investigator the guy they had run Oklahoma City in 9-11 cover-up and he's
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:15.280]  caught with kitty porn on his website or on his his email all they got to do is
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.600]  go into your email understand that public it comes out more than a third of
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.960]  the people on death row are innocent and it turns out the prosecutors right up
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.000]  in Williamson County it's a new famous case and I want to get that guy on they
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.800]  knew he was innocent and wanted to put an innocent man in jail and then when
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.000]  they found out he was totally innocent there was proof they worked for decades
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.840]  to suppress it I mean these people in joy hurting innocence really evil people
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:48.160]  enjoy hurting innocence now here's the big breaking news and when I saw this it
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.120]  just absolutely poleaxed me
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.720]  and I had Steve Watson's headline changed during the last break because I
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:07.520]  don't have time to call him up and do it see Steve Watson Aaron Kurt great minds
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.840]  wonderful people better than I am on so many fronts but they have the same
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:18.240]  problem I have this stuff so big real tyranny so wild and sensational we all
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.720]  have governors to cut back our headline and then we have the moles and people
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.920]  that say oh and the trolls that say oh we're exaggerating 99% of the time and
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.680]  I mean literally we are actually holding back and I've got to stop doing that so I
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.400]  saw the headline Ron Paul campaign the future belongs to us well I didn't go
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.520]  read that when I saw that headline I'm like oh great future belongs to us you
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.400]  know a play on words as Obama says winning the future and for tyranny as
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:50.360]  his new campaign slogan and then I went and read what Ron Paul actually said
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:55.280]  today all they said is we're not gonna fight and compete in those states we
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.840]  don't have the money but but we've won delegates and many of these others they
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.240]  really won main Iowa those got cheated that's all come out the media keeps
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.480]  lying and saying he didn't win even though they admit he did win in the fine
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.320]  print he says they're still gonna try to get the delegates and still try to
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:14.960]  contest things at the RNC which is great to inject issues you win either way and
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:21.200]  the media came out with a headline that he dropped out Christian science
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.640]  monitor Ron Paul effectively in presidential campaign no he didn't he
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.600]  said that we're not gonna go into debt and so we're gonna let the grassroots
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.960]  campaign move forward from here and Jesse Benton is quoted said let me be

[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:30.560]  delegates turn off the TV people we all know the media is nothing but lies now

[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.960]  be at the CNN Center June 24th you can look it up on Facebook my name is Daryl
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.360]  young from Loganville Georgia we already know the media will only broadcast
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.920]  what they want to they are the one that brings in the drugs sells the guns
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.160]  launder all this fake money but we are the one that are treated like criminals
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.720]  I am 27 I've dedicated six months six years in my life to the cause the good
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:10.520]  fight goes on power to the people thank you for your time sir God bless you hope
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:13.920]  folks get involved in that and as Ron Paul said in his letter yesterday we're
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.760]  they're just suspending fighting in those states with full bore media and
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:24.360]  everything is he's not going to go into debt look look if you just joined us
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:28.160]  you're a new listener we knew he won Iowa we knew he won Maine even the New
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.600]  York Times had to admit yeah he won but the Republicans won't count the
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:38.200]  precincts he won we had the proof they stole Iowa they stole other states like
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.160]  Nevada and so Paul says I'll go the electoral college way I'll get the
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:49.480]  delegates and so understand this whatever happens we win because at least
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.320]  Ron Paul's been there injecting issues and the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan puppets
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.880]  Obama and Romney have been heavily affected by this now and have been
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.040]  exposed I mean Obama is in the news today saying JP Morgan is one of the best
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:09.800]  managed banks I guess from a mafia perspective Al Capone was one of the best
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.320]  managed mobsters I guess Hitler was one of the best managed dictators I mean I
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.680]  guess brain cancers you know one of the best managed cancers I mean what what
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.880]  does that mean this this is the top of the New World Order of course it's one
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:31.000]  of the best managed and above-the-law groups Obama went on the view to say
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:38.960]  that he's paid for by them and so is Mitt Romney Obama's gotten double the
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.200]  money from Bain Capital guess he used to run that Mitt Romney then Mitt Romney
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:51.240]  has we'll see what happens with Romney but I think he's a complete ringer I mean
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:56.360]  he supported carbon taxes he supported open borders he supported gun control
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.080]  don't need to go on about Mitt Romney he wrote Obamacare and I've got all these
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:06.840]  Republicans saying you got to get behind Mitt Romney what's gonna happen and
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.440]  Mitt Romney gets in is everybody's gonna go to sleep for about two years if
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.520]  they were the Obama thing and he's gonna save us and then everybody's gonna wake
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.240]  up to that and the left's gonna attack all the police state again and then and
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.120]  then the right wing will think that if you're against the police state you
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.440]  must be a leftist I'm so sick of how they play that game I just want freedom

[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.040]  and and I want to be objective about everything so any of those trolls out
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:43.240]  there and in blogosphere I've pretty much vetted you on my own as much as I
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:48.400]  possibly could and the negatives are from mainly from wing nuts some of whom
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:55.040]  I've actually talked to nationally and I can just vouch for yours I'm mainly
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  attacked by jealous people but also they've got operatives they don't have
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:02.680]  people sitting in restaurants listening to people talk about you know their
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.120]  favorite football team I am just creating added that we're all terrorists
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:12.440]  tell us the story yeah and and and and real quick before that if you want to
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.880]  get into the mindset of the uber elite of the Royal Empire I everyone needs a
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.000]  little time off if you go back and watch basically most of Braveheart you know
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.720]  where he talks about the problem with Scott's what Scotland is there are too
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.600]  many scots and so they weed him out with prima note a well that's what's
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:35.120]  happening with the vaccines and GMOs and also watch the tutors maybe a series
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:40.080]  like that and you really get into the mindset of by any means possible not
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.120]  just any means available they're using every tool at their disposal so I'm
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:48.520]  glad you're staying in power by being trained to heart engineer the food to
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:52.560]  sterilize and kill them we will win I mean we're already deep into their
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:57.280]  extermination but I mean tell me the story yeah the subversion and obfuscation
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.800]  department anyway the story is that so there's a follow-up for someone that I
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:09.400]  know and they were out celebrating their their disabled and they have a hard time
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:14.840]  getting around they took a little spill off of their bar stool accidentally and

[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.140]  disabled person in there and then alone behold two young strapping young bucks
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:44.280]  step up and they said you know we're we're going that way without even knowing

[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.800]  he's explaining that and they go in this round about pattern and they basically
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.960]  said you know who we are and he said hopefully just some people giving me a
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.800]  ride home and they said well we're with DHS and we don't like what you've been
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:54.240]  posting and and they put in a monitoring station at our next to our state
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.760]  capital for all the protests and they said you if you know it's good for it
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.120]  basically if you know it's good for you you're not gonna keep doing that and you
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.920]  know kind of being imposing and you know you're at our mercy you're handicapped
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:13.200]  drunk in in our car and then they said beyond that he you know he was kind of
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:17.120]  freaked out of course but beyond that they started pressing him for names of
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:22.960]  local preppers so anyone who's got any sort of food water or other sorts of
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:28.520]  self-reliance they wanted to know about and I just thought these guys are such
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.720]  incredible terrorists and and they love it though I mean look you can't even go
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:39.920]  to the Texas seashore now where I've been going since I was born without them
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.240]  they're just harassing everyone and getting in your face and talking to you
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:47.280]  and at and bossing you around and it's like we're the government and we
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:52.840]  actually enjoy this can you imagine groping people all day or or constantly
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:58.560]  getting in people's faces I mean imagine they're shriveled little egos I mean
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.480]  imagine how shameful these people are the oh my gosh the country's gonna totally
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.680]  collapse so it I mean your friend needs to speak out I mean I mean did he shut
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.720]  up and get scared out of the story and I've been telling me telling the story
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:21.520]  to myself and other people who all have our library of DVDs I I loan them out I
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:24.720]  just write on the box that it came in from Info Wars I have your big
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.680]  collection and we we get the word out there probably time for local cable
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:34.240]  access like you say it's time to get really aggressive and call the local
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:40.480]  police on those guys so there's a record of it and I mean I'd love to see them in
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.080]  some bar restaurant and say what's your problem don't you understand this is
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:49.600]  America you think you can have a covert operation to intimidate people and to
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:54.520]  create a chilling effect underground you guys really are the bad guys and if they
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.560]  try to start intimidating you or something go oh so you're evil you I mean
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.520]  you think you think that you're gonna win acting like this just can you
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:10.360]  imagine how scummy somebody like that is so they want him to know we've been
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.040]  tracking you without a warrant we'll do whatever we want anything else they
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:19.120]  told him how did it in they just dropped him off at home they dropped him off at
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.440]  home and they were they were hesitant about they got him I think they got him
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.280]  out of the car and then we're slow to get his mobility apparatus out of the
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:36.800]  vehicle and just said why don't you want to tell us about the what preppers you
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.600]  know and he said I don't know anyone who's got more than a sink full of
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:46.160]  extra water so what you know someone has a bunch of extra TP at their house does

[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:54.880]  radio network if you just joined us we were hearing a story out of Wisconsin
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:00.800]  we're an older gentleman who rides around with those little rascal vehicles
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:05.960]  his arm was hurt and he didn't think he could drive home with it and he was
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:10.280]  asked his wife for a ride so two guys stepped forward and said two strapping
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:14.000]  gentlemen said we'll give you a ride and they started interrogating him saying
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.360]  do you know preppers we don't like what you've been riding on the internet about
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:22.160]  the government you better watch it and you know that could be a made-up story
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:29.040]  I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that every dentist my dad knows
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.200]  that he's talked to has been approached by Homeland Security to spy on their
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:39.880]  patients totally illegal and it's right out of the Soviet Union and I do know
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:46.320]  that we have a big report at info wars.com that Curt Nimo did with direct
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:53.000]  links to the Homeland Security documents where Homeland Security is taking the
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.440]  DNA of children without parental consent through the public schools they've
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:01.120]  already got several agencies doing it now they're expanding it Department of
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.200]  Homeland Security prepares to grab DNA from kids we went with that headline
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:08.680]  because the electronic frontier Foundation announced they're preparing to
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:14.320]  expand it but then you actually learn since 2010 they've already been doing it
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:18.800]  and they say your child has consent of course legally they don't have consent
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:22.560]  but it's what they're giving them vaccines in California and other states
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:27.120]  saying you're gonna get a bit $20 if you take the shot now do you sign the
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:32.720]  consent form well I'm only 11 years old my mommy's just my mommy mom we don't
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:43.320]  ask mommy anymore I mean again I had a guy on earlier using a fake first name
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.360]  he wanted to come into the show and I've known him for a while and tell a whole
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:53.040]  story I said no keep your sources don't burn bridges at this point and you know
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.400]  he was talking about how the police are finally going wow Alex Jones is right
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.880]  the military is like yeah this is real the contractors a lot of them are
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.080]  saying no because they're getting them out of these bases and they're saying
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:12.440]  alright the men the mission is shifting from Hodges this is word for word and it
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.240]  is a pejorative term but that's for documentary purposes that's what
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.360]  they're calling them we're shifting away from the Muslims and we're shifting
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:27.200]  over to the good old boys there's gonna be a civil war in America well you've
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.160]  heard all my other guests on this and seen the documents and we're gonna take
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:35.280]  them we're gonna get their guns are you ready for that and it's also a way to
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.800]  assess who's awakened who isn't and most of the people are saying no but see
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.800]  doesn't matter they're destroying the economy and it'll be Merck's leading
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.600]  foreign trips and that's in the NLEO 9 document all of it we're not in Kansas
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:55.560]  anymore you notice the euros melting down into globalist control you notice
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.280]  that they're gearing up here they're getting ready to have the derivatives
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.360]  meltdown and they're gonna sign us all on they already have but they're gonna
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.560]  tell you it's your fault you got to give JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs everything
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:11.200]  you got and the media is gonna say aren't we lucky we've got them
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.680]  member Nacky's a hero well you've already seen him saying that and they're
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:18.080]  gonna raise your taxes they're announcing they're gonna have forced
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.640]  brigade work you're gonna have to go out you know dig ditches like the Soviet
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:26.880]  Union and there's gonna be riots as the welfare crowd goes crazy because their
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.160]  checks will still come just with inflation they're not gonna buy anything
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.640]  and then you'll welcome the military coming to your area in the first wave
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.720]  then the terrorists are gonna hit the military oh the right wingers that or
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.680]  the patriot people that didn't you who said terrible things that were right
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.960]  about everything and actually were real Americans and then oh their leaders have
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:56.640]  to be arrested then the civil war starts then people don't have a choice and then
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:02.960]  the police and military will be defeated in most areas they will be sent into
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.360]  bunker type facilities they call it going to the mattresses they're gonna go
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:13.960]  into a fortress mentality only venturing out to revenue generate and make
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:18.400]  drug deliveries and there's gonna let the rest of the country rot and fall
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.760]  apart into civil war now that's the globalist plan I told you four and a
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:27.760]  half years ago that I ended up talking to one of the richest women in the
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:32.240]  world on paper she's actually poor compared to the real elite but you know
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:37.840]  she's in the Forbes list and she said I'm leaving the United States and I said
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.600]  why she said well there won't be a United States it's gonna totally collapse
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.240]  from derivatives and I said
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.160]  and she was telling me this at the time I didn't know who she was she said oh I
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.640]  own a defense company I own this and that and I'm looking at her she's talking
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.480]  to me you know I'm sitting there in this law office getting some paperwork done

[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:36.360]  fully imploded I go what is isn't gonna exist she goes you'll see I go what do
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:42.840]  you mean she goes everything you've been saying they want this country to go
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:49.960]  under and she said I'm getting out of here so I go home that day and type in
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:54.200]  her name the fed spy on me they know I went and googled her name that day they

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.480]  and the lawyer wasn't there yet all these big giant law firms and I guess she
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:25.240]  was just here locally dealing with a few properties I guess it was a high-rise
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:37.080]  building she owned or something but but liquidating US holdings I was just in a
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:44.640]  law firm because I thought I was getting messed around the lease that I'd set up

[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:49.920]  have to let all this happen I was talking to the gentleman we had on earlier
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:53.360]  and he was meeting with some police that are his friends and they're like yeah
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:58.480]  Alex Jones is right about a lot of this but he's still alarmist but yeah they
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.600]  asked us to do a lot of illegal stuff we don't like it
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:10.120]  I'm alarmist but you're being asked to do illegal things and every time Ardee
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:15.120]  Savetta comes in here with his silver tongue he just is so friendly and so
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:21.000]  nice and gee he doesn't know about any of this Jeepers Creepers Mrs. Haskell I
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.880]  don't know anything about that I want to go to David to Florida listening on

[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.200]  of Orlando where we're number one go ahead sir thank you for taking my call
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:41.200]  Alex thanks for calling what's on your mind first time caller long line
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.800]  long-time listener all right thank you for waking me up to the facts of what's
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:51.440]  going on with this country and my call today is pertaining to our elected
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:57.160]  officials here in Orlando mainly the sheriff yes if you're a citizen you and
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:00.800]  you elect these individuals you should be able to correspond with them either be
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:08.440]  email or phone calls we have corruption in our local sheriff's office in Orange
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:14.840]  County Florida no there's no corruption in Florida law enforcement come on next
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.040]  you're gonna tell me that the moon orbits the earth I mean that's ridiculous
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:25.280]  right I tried to call the sheriff office of the sheriff and I was denied
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:29.680]  access to his office so I guess the people that vote for him are not allowed
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:34.720]  to speak to our elected officials so you were denied access to his private phone
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:39.480]  or or into his general office into his general office well that's that's I
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:49.000]  think that's illegal all the reason I was calling was because I had a issue of
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.520]  drinking a beer in a public park from over 12 years ago I paid the fines 12
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:01.920]  years ago I even did a couple of days in jail for it and 12 years later I was
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:09.360]  arrested for it again and I questioned it and they said it was contempt of court
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.400]  and I'm like how could it be contempt of court when I've already did the time and
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:18.400]  already paid the fine oh yeah this was in the LA Times last month and a few weeks
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:22.080]  before that I saw it in another big paper I'm gonna remember where there's
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.440]  computer glitches everywhere that's like in the Terry Gilliam movie what a
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:31.680]  genius Brazil a bug falls in the typewriter and so it changes the name
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:35.920]  and they go secretly arrest and kill an innocent guy but but but again that begs
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:39.360]  the question a tyranny everybody's innocent because you can't trust it to
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:44.320]  carry out enforcement of anything because it it itself is bankrupt but
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:49.080]  yeah I saw some incredible number where it in just LA alone they arrest
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.160]  thousands of innocent people I think it's that every month I have to pull the
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:58.680]  article up because the computers are all fried and even if like it won't let you
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:02.520]  go to court or it just says you have tickets you don't and they just arrest
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:10.720]  you here's an example I've gotten two registration stickers where it's not
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:16.720]  printed right and is off the I got one like two years ago and I got one this
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:20.040]  year and I'm just waiting to get pulled over because you can't even see the
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.600]  numbers because all they are is just up on the edge because it was printed on
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:30.040]  the whole printout instead of the sticker itself you know what I want to
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:32.560]  hear more about this tell me the rest of story when we come back because this is

[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.560]  to the caller in fact guys I meant to talk to you during the break with my
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:37.320]  dad's actually here visiting and ended up talking to him will you type in
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:42.880]  something like innocent Californians being arrested under computer glitch or
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:46.960]  something like that that was the last article I saw but it's all over the
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:52.920]  country and they accidentally say you owe more property taxes as well and they
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:58.400]  accidentally say you haven't paid it and accidentally take your house and put it
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:02.000]  in a trust the government bureaucrats own and then they keep it because they're
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.600]  criminals I saw that in the news a few days ago and Bank of America takes
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:10.640]  houses they never had a deed to that are paid for in cash that people have lived
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:18.840]  in for 12 years that's CNN it's an accident though again this is a criminal
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.720]  group and as soon as we get that just because they have the authority because
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:28.120]  they're in charge doesn't make them legal or lawful show going back to David
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:33.240]  in Florida show you were saying it's 1011 12 years later how many years later
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.160]  you got arrested for drinking a beer in a park violent criminal that you are
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:42.240]  very evil taxpayer money well spent and now years later they've come and
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.520]  arrested you again for it yes sir that's correct 12 years later they
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:50.760]  arrested for arrested me for it I was actually making a complaint with the
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.200]  sheriff's office and they came back out to my while I was trying to get on my
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:59.400]  motorcycle and they said excuse me we need to talk to you we need to see your
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:03.360]  idea again and that's when I was surrounded by the thugs and was well
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.360]  they showed you who's boss boy you don't exercise your first amendment and
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:12.320]  don't exercise anything else because police don't worry it's not just that
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:15.600]  pesky first amendment you get to get rid of it's all the private property and do
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.760]  process and all the good things about America it's a good job oh yeah that's
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:24.360]  that's a classic show and I guess the judge is gonna go along with that
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:28.480]  everybody why not just plant child porn on your computer while they're at it you
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:32.880]  know what it ended up happening is when I went to court Alex I asked the judge I
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:37.280]  said I'm gonna slip by the system for over 12 years because I'm not bragging
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.520]  about it and I'm not proud of it but under Florida law we caught driving on a
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:45.480]  suspended license you go to jail well between that timeframe 12 years ago and
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:51.800]  this if we go 15 16 years into the future from that 12-year point I had been
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.640]  arrested for driving while license suspended or revoked I found it out
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:01.680]  when they do the NCIC or a seat that this this 12-year warrant never existed I
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:06.480]  was cleared to go and then all of a sudden a year a year a year and a half
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.120]  ago this warrant pops up out of the blue so what they're doing is integrating
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.640]  them all together and now they can just pick you up and claim you have a warrant
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:19.520]  and disappear you last time I checked Texas 11% of the population has
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:23.880]  warrants out that's who we are we're a joke we have the biggest prison
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:29.760]  population in the world because we're run by criminals and hey don't worry
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:33.320]  those of you that haven't woken up yet you're gonna get everything you want
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:38.640]  you're gonna get all the curses that come with tyranny so I hope you enjoy
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.760]  your petty power trips minions because it's not gonna last let's go ahead I
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.880]  thank you David evil person let's talk to Brian in Arizona you're on the air
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:53.200]  serve hey Alex how you doing just wanted to call in I have another unfortunate
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:59.200]  story of the growing police state for you oh really yeah and I got pictures to
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:02.120]  prove this one so I'm like the last story that we don't know if it's real or
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:06.360]  not this one's confirmed but I gotta give you a quick background in the
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:11.520]  situation so our college student at Arizona State University and at the end
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:16.920]  of each school year we have a students student run thing called the undie run
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:20.600]  and it's kind of a silly event but you know it's for the students and it's at
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:24.360]  the recreation field every year let me guess people are now being charged with
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:28.920]  indecent exposure for an underwear run not quite but they're getting you know
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:33.000]  grabbed to the ground and wrestled by potbelly pedophile cops so you know
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.120]  well you don't want to excite them like that well you don't want to get
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:40.840]  children around in front of me they'll go into piranha mode but so so what
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:45.120]  happened yeah so a quick background for the first three years I was here I
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:48.240]  graduated so I'm done there but you know it was great you know there were
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:51.280]  limited cops and the only reason they were there was to kind of stand around
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.960]  now it's the new economy so it's like cockroaches in an inner city kitchen at
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:01.360]  3 a.m. I mean it is it was so bad I just I was outraged and so there's so
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:07.120]  there's there's there's loving enforcers running around what happened well so I
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:10.800]  used to get the recreation field and you know this year was different you know
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:16.320]  we hear oh it's at the lot 59 parking lots everyone's a little confused so you
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:20.720]  know I'm not one walk in there and I'm just thinking oh they misdirected you

[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:41.040]  bow down and worship them I mean I it's the new class system like you're a
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:44.320]  bureaucrat you're God you work for the government you're God you're a citizen
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:50.920]  paying their salary you're trash I'm sick of it and I know I shouldn't be upset
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:54.240]  they admit they've set up reeducation camps for us and want to take our guns
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:58.040]  and want to secretly arrest us and kill us I mean I understand I'm radical and
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:01.560]  an alarmist that I've been absolutely on target and everything's coming true just
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:11.160]  like I said I apologize bad person let's go to John then Derek then Donald and
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:15.920]  others John in Texas you're on the air sir I hope you're not concerned about
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:19.600]  the state of the government because the founding fathers said you better watch
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:23.320]  the government and they were bad people you're not about to call in and support
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:29.840]  the evil founders are you will support them all away Alex oh I want to talk
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.520]  about the article you had on there on info wars about the Russian troops
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:39.680]  coming to America and on the picture you had left two pictures you had on there
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.680]  and various articles they had pictures of I guess Russian troops marching through
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:48.640]  Moscow and I guess there were recent pictures because they had the new AK-47s
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.640]  with a plastic stock but why would they march in in front of red flags in a
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:57.800]  background if communism is dead in Russia welcome they have the red flags up they
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:01.520]  never took them down they created that new Russian flag for state events and
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:06.240]  showed it to people the Red Star stayed on all of it and it's exactly what it
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:10.400]  is it's the same with China too they still got all their communist trappings
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.360]  up there when they have military praise they still have pictures a mile I mean
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:18.000]  nothing's really oh no they admit that I mean China is a hundred percent run by
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.200]  the Communist Party that's not debated and nothing I wanted to ask you do you
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:25.240]  think it's some kind of sick globalist joke that they brought those Russian
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:28.520]  troops into Colorado because that was where in a movie Red Dawn that was
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:31.960]  where the Russians first came in there yeah they know that's exactly what it is
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:37.200]  no it listen it's all psychological warfare to acclimate I mean I've gotten
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:40.680]  to where oh they're gonna put chips in the trips well I covered that was coming
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:45.320]  ten years ago so it's okay oh yeah they're training troops from 15 nations to
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:49.720]  do door-to-door gun confiscation here's the FEMA document it's no big deal
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:55.400]  reeducation camps oh they confirm it big deal so they're spying on all of us
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:59.800]  without warrants yeah they're taking the troops death benefits when they die they
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:02.600]  don't pay the widow even though they took money out of their check for 20 years
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:09.280]  oh that's no big deal yeah the foreign banks they run everything now yeah they
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:15.560]  got neighborhood spies now well you know that's just the way it is everything's
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:21.400]  fine though you know back in the early 60s I read a book called none there
[02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:26.480]  called treason by John Stormer and in the book he they said he laid out the
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:29.600]  plans just before World War two the World War two would just kick it in the
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.360]  high gear he said that the one of the dull brothers laid out the plans and
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.520]  he said they're gonna burst the communists in the capitalist system
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:38.840]  together and it's been done and they put everybody to sleep there by things that
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:41.920]  you know communism don't exist but while they're implementing inside the United
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.760]  States and they use the initial threat of communism to get America to get rid
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:51.360]  of its Bill of Rights and Constitution in the name of beating it and then they
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:55.960]  then come back and take our rights and then it's not for communism anymore it's
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.360]  for being a patriot just like they get you to okay take my rights away because
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.000]  of al-qaeda and then you're like but wait al-qaeda works for you now they're
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.040]  like al-qaeda is good you're the one that's bad Homeland Security get him he
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:14.000]  has a John Deere cap on I mean literally and a lot of these good old boys who
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:19.760]  love to grovel up to and and and and you know cram their noses up underneath the
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:24.600]  New World Order's patoot they they will they will sit there and denounce their
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.320]  families and cry as their son is taken away with an American flag out front the
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.600]  house made in China by slaves he bought at Walmart because their whole world
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.960]  they think patriotism is worshiping the foreign banks that have hijacked America
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:45.280]  they just can't get it I mean I watch the general public grovel to military and
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:48.960]  police and a lot of the military and police are good people but there's the
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:54.760]  specialized bureaucratic political police that they're now creating and in
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.320]  every level of law enforcement and people will just grovel and grovel and
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:06.680]  grovel and grovel and grovel and grovel and grovel and you'll be there like my
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:10.120]  parents it's not even groveling and they're just real polite and they would
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:14.240]  sit there while these while these agents were giving him 20 questions at the
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:20.400]  beach and the guy was getting off on my mother's submissiveness and my mother's
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.920]  a really nice aggressive smart person but she's a Christian and she's
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.960]  thinking you know she's willed into being calm and nice and ladylike and the
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:31.240]  more she sat there and the guy was assessing them and asking them questions
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:34.800]  and we're not here to steal turtles are we there's little kids sitting there you
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:38.280]  know with you know eating chips and we're just sitting there and lawn chairs in
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:43.520]  America and he's he's having this fantasy that we're bad and and and he's
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:50.360]  good and I and a certain point I'm like just get out of here leave me alone you
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:55.000]  America killing slug but I mean again this nanny state they have this
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.880]  delusion that they're keeping us safe and they're doing all this good and they
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.680]  love their little uniforms and their outfits and all these nanny state women
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.200]  they've gotten uniformed with little hats and their hair all done and they got
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.400]  something to prove and they're gonna show you lady the new old order has got
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:12.560]  something to prove you're gonna probably die young from what they've been

[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:36.320]  talk to Derek in New York that's therapy for me and Derek in New York you're on
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:42.440]  the air go ahead I don't know it's all coming true I'm I guess I'm doing all
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.360]  right at least we're at least we were here to head them off at the past maybe
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:49.920]  we can stop them I don't know yeah I don't quit
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:54.240]  for today I don't know if you heard about I thought a couple days ago about this
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:00.280]  woman in Florida who got arrested for this defending herself against her husband
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:04.240]  now the story goes that this lady her husband was it has a history of the
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.760]  message I was with her and she she got sick of it so he chased after her she
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:14.520]  ran into the garage grabbed a gun and shot it straight up into the air
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:18.800]  hey guys a woman arrested for a warning shot no no that's what they said they do
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:22.040]  with the Trayvon Martin deal that's why they hyped it up regardless what you
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:26.680]  think of that case is to now say if you do a warning shot which I think is
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:32.440]  totally reasonable I mean it was in her garage that you shouldn't get in
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  trouble for that I mean warning I'm on unfortunate I understand not wanting
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.080]  to kill your husband but if you're scared enough to grab a gun it's I mean
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:44.200]  funny thing is she probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble if she was
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:49.360]  shotting no I did see that I didn't even get to it give us your take on it yeah
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:55.360]  she got she got 20 years they gave her 20 years for shooting a warning shot at
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.480]  a guy who's no he even said later like you know I was gonna put my hands on I
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.560]  was gonna put my hands on the wife if you would think guys type that in woman
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.440]  gets 20 years for firing warning shot I think they even said in the news only
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:11.240]  scanned it for like one minute that that well that you know the judge and the
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:15.840]  jury are probably being real you know hard on her cuz of you know the frowning
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:20.600]  upon the use of guns and defense but I did see that just a few days ago you're
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:26.320]  absolutely right and that's the new America you know the kicker is that
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:30.600]  the same prosecute that prosecuted is a woman it's a property that's property
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:35.480]  drugs I can't tell you right it's no enjoyment right now the same lady yeah
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:41.880]  there it is new stand your ground case not for Florida woman given 20 years and
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.960]  let's us scroll scroll down more and it says right here the Trayvon Martin case
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:53.000]  in Florida stand your ground law have brought into sharp relief yet again
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.400]  this time in a Jacksonville courtroom where a woman who said she fired a
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.200]  warning shot to ward off an abusive husband was sentenced to 20 years in
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.480]  prison my gosh I mean how many people had a gun go off on accident cleaning and
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:08.920]  I mean I have them but I don't know people that have and it just goes on yeah I
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:17.520]  saw that article what do you think of that I'm so I'm beyond upset about that
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:22.920]  but I'm like wow she was in a medical relationship and she didn't even she
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:26.360]  didn't shoot the guy she didn't kill him or like that she put the shot in it and
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.320]  then she shot in the sky she can 20 years even the mother them her mother came
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:35.320]  on with our people TV and for her she came on and confronted the prosecutor
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:40.400]  is like are you serious and so many ways for sure you know are you serious my
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:44.720]  daughter's gonna get 20 years is that that's unbelievable that's no way she
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:49.960]  should get 20 years for something yeah it's Marissa Alexander 31 well I got to
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:53.640]  say statistically the courts are tougher on black people and I don't get into the
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:57.880]  whole culture of victimology and but it is true that there is walking while black
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:03.280]  driving while black and there's that idea that black people are somehow you
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:07.480]  know you know evil and deserve it and I guess because she's a black lady is why
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:12.120]  she's gonna get 20 years I tell you it's pretty sick 20 years for firing a gun in
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:16.960]  the area I saw that there it is and can I can I say one more thing one more thing
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.720]  about the police state in New York City sure all right I did have a couple days

[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.640]  the cops they have on the pants we all know we all know they're on the train
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:36.320]  now I'm listening to them talk and I'm hearing them talk and they're jumping
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:39.440]  in bar my life one of them one guy was Puerto Rican other guy was like you
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:43.320]  might have been Jamaican or whatever were they working in blocks or whatever
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:47.280]  and then some of them one I'm looking at city but anyway they were talking and
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:50.720]  they were just talking about and laughing about this how they choked out one guy

[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:18.800]  bunch of thugs they talk thugs to me they're like a bunch of thugs they want to hire
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:22.000]  they want to hire the criminal type and that's that's what they do in
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.840]  authoritarian societies clockwork orange Stanley Kubrick's films based on the
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:29.760]  novel you know based on a futuristic dystopia where they hire the criminals
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:34.680]  and the street gang that that that Alex little Alex has been part of when he
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.200]  gets out of prison they're now the cops and they beat him up and that's what it
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:44.120]  is and I've been in New York and I've never seen police because here in Austin
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:47.720]  I got to say the cops are pretty nice professional friendly people who
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:50.880]  complain about Austin cops and I'm and we should keep them on a short leash
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:53.360]  because that's how it gets out of control have not been around the rest of
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:59.080]  the country in New York I've seen women who are tourists go officers sir can you
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:04.240]  please tell me where this is do I look like a phone book lady and then I've
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:07.800]  even talked to an Austin cop that happened to he was up there visiting and
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.960]  I mean you see him and it's like the cops are all together out because I
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.360]  happened to run into a parade they were having last time I was there for the
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:23.200]  talkers a keynote speaker award or whatever and I was there as the keynote
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.880]  speaker point is I go let's walk to Central Park get some exercise before we
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.440]  go get in the cab and go catch your airplane so it was like a Puerto Rico
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.880]  you know day parade and they had thousands of cops out this little parade
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:38.120]  with all these kids and stuff but they were there just bugging their eyes out
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:43.400]  and acting like the most scummy games because I grew up in Dallas I grew up
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.760]  outside Dallas we went into Dallas all the time and by the time I was a
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.800]  teenager I went in with friends to buy bootleg beer and stuff I'll be honest
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:52.800]  I was in there like every three days because you you go into the worst
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.640]  neighborhoods about beer instead of a crack house it was like a beer house but
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.400]  the book was a liquor stores you could have a 10-year-old going there it's all
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.200]  to you and again that's because the law wasn't enforced there that was a zone I
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:09.800]  didn't understand that then you know when I'm 14 years old with you know my
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:14.280]  friends that were 16 going in and buying slits malt liquor or whatever you
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.520]  know to take it back to the party but I don't know why I started even telling
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:22.600]  that story oh but you know what gangs look like and how they act and you go
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:25.240]  down the wrong road and there's 20 gang members in the industry acting tough
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:30.800]  gangs don't even act like this these were like arrested development punks who
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:36.440]  were big wimps dressed up with huge pot bellies and their hats all gangster style
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:42.040]  and cops smoking cigarettes and cigars and and waving their arms around black
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:49.040]  white Hispanic didn't matter they looked like total filth and you're like my
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:55.920]  gosh this is a group of miscreant criminals and their union runs the
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:00.080]  city nothing can stop them except when they breathe deadly dust they're not
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:05.480]  going to get treatment but I mean what do you make of what I just said I saw
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:09.400]  true I mean oh my god I mean I know there's a cop that works in the six
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:15.720]  precincts up in New York City that he's a Italian guy he has a big the big pot
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.280]  belly thing he smokes cigars and you know every time you say you know it's him
[02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:23.280]  because he also had a big six cigar in his mouth all the time and he's a
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:27.160]  troublemaker he's one of those guys they're giving you a face you know
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:32.040]  because he got a little bad on his chest and he thinks that you're supposed to buy it out to him and I just don't do that
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:37.320]  I guess I've been missing people a long time and I take a lot of what you what
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:41.320]  you said already unless you teach on a radio and I put it to the to the youth
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:45.440]  on the street when these cops come on and just bug you because anyone knows when
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.520]  you go to the like the West Coast in New York City the six precincts is one of
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:53.840]  the most racist I have some good friends and what they're they're a lot of good
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:57.640]  cops but that's for the majority man there's a lot of racist cops that work
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:01.240]  that beat and they're they they'll come up to you and just start stuff with you
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:10.840]  and listen they had 203,500 stop and frisk warrantless searches in the first
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:16.120]  three months of this year that came out yesterday and the thing is I have
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:22.440]  experienced it I have experienced the New York police I've been in their jail
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:29.600]  before for protesting and you know at one point they took my handcuffs off and
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:32.720]  said do you want to do something as about six of them stood around with
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:36.800]  billy clubs and I'm just like man just put me in the jail cell no I don't want
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.680]  any trouble and it was all we're cowards do you want to do something big guy I'm
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:44.840]  like well number one I'm not I said I'm not a big guy and I'm just protesting and
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:50.440]  no sir I don't want to and they're like good then get in there and then I
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.000]  described the guy they had bringing McDonald's bags and an orange soda
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.360]  drinks to people that had been in there for days was like over a hundred degrees
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:02.200]  and sounds like 90 something in the summer 100 something degrees in there
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:06.000]  they put me in a jail cell with feces everywhere all they were laughing put me
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.960]  in one on purpose that was overflowed everything we're laughing and they had
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.080]  like a mentally retarded jail guard like out of a movie like Quasimodo going
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:18.640]  you want the burger you want the and there was these black guys begging for
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.160]  the food and they sounded like they could barely talk either I mean talk
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:26.200]  about dehumanized people and they're going please and after about an hour of
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:30.760]  off and on begging he gets all sweet and goes I give it to you I give it to you
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:35.400]  and he and it's the little white jailer is sitting there giving him a hamburger
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:39.240]  and an orange drink and guys begging and thanking him and I'm like my god I've
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:42.840]  entered the vortex of hell I almost wanted to stay in there just for the
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.440]  anthropology research of it but I'm telling you this is what they're done to
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:51.880]  us this is this is what tyranny is this is what they've turned us into and it
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:55.360]  was some corrupt cops brother or cousin I guess they couldn't get a job
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:59.880]  anywhere that's the new welfare is you just get your your dumb cousin the job
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:04.200]  and so he was getting the power trip of people begging for the food he wasn't
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:09.920]  evil and then giving it to him talking to him like they were a dog I just can't
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:14.800]  believe what we've turned into I just can't believe it and the cops laughing
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:20.040]  that I was in a room with feces all over the bench and on the floor and I
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.400]  didn't dehumanize me it made me it dehumanized them I just sat on one
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:27.960]  edge maybe think some crap's gonna hurt me got nothing coming and I just felt
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:33.600]  so sorry for them and I thought my god I come from a classy family I come from
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:39.720]  Christians I come from the founders of this country I am so blessed a little
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:44.400]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:47.920]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:51.960]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:55.400]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:51:00.080]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:00.920]  things about what's going on in the desert of Southern California here we've
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:07.400]  got the globalist preparing for a civil war in America just the other day my
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.320]  friend and I were out doing the usual thing we like to do shoot our 22s look
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:16.640]  for some jackrabbit and we hear some helicopters above our head we look up
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:21.400]  and no more than 150 feet above our heads in American airspace our two
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:31.720]  Mexican Navy helicopters flying with American helicopters together no that's
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.960]  admitted we ten years ago we'd hear about this from credible sources but
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.840]  now in the last three it's in the news they're allowed to go in US airspace
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:46.080]  furthermore there were hundreds of military vehicles out in the desert
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.440]  canyon as if they were being stored out there for some reason I've seen
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:57.520]  helicopters with weapons on them flying over urban areas in here in Southern
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:02.280]  California well sir you know an NLE09 and scores of public statements they
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:08.480]  plan to use quote Mexican and Canadian troops to suppress US insurrection this
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:13.320]  is a globalist for preparation is what I'm worried about Alex this is what I'm
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:19.400]  worried about there's only one way out in California and that's east and that's
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:22.760]  through that desert yeah through the desert and that's where all the
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:28.120]  equipment that you mean west only one way out of California no no that would
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.400]  be back towards back towards Nevada there's only that one highway there on
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.440]  the south the 80s is the only highway through the desert and that's the main
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:41.200]  highway that I've been seeing all the military equipment on furthermore
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:47.440]  there is a US border patrol station there called Cameron station that I
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:52.960]  believe is the front for a FEMA camp well of course it is they admit all those
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:57.640]  bases and areas are the staging grounds where you they pull up suddenly oh we've
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:01.600]  got a security risk on you mr. Jones we know all your wife's children they're
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.200]  gonna go with these people and they got the big potbellies rubbing their hands
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:08.600]  and then right at that point your kids are going with the pedophiles you're
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.640]  going to a torture dungeon and that's just how they are they say they're
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:17.600]  having budget problems but every time I drive by there's a new building there's
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:22.440]  a hundred and brand new SUVs and there's 30 guys standing around with their
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:26.240]  engines running and I've driven through these a hundred miles into the US if

[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:36.040]  they were just going to have them in Colorado but they are going to have some
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:40.680]  extra Russians around because if we will let TSA grab our daughters and sons and
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:44.400]  if we'll let Russian troops trained to take us on we'll put up with anything

[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:01.960]  to have to really get get really behind you behind this program and quit fooling
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:06.080]  around and really put their heart into this they can have to make friends with
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:11.000]  death and they feel will go away we got to think like soldiers like they do and
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.320]  if it wasn't for you we wouldn't even know where we are there's only a few y'all
[03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:17.840]  out here giving you putting your lights on line well let me tell you there are a
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:21.360]  lot of people who are awake people who aren't well you've told the stories of
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:24.320]  how when you handed out thousands of my films making copies and things over the
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:27.640]  years you went from the police threatened to arrest you to them buying
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:31.240]  your coffee and buying copies of the films you can make copies and giving
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:34.760]  you more money so you can make copies for others it's that process in the
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:38.600]  beginning of patriots a scarce man hated and feared and scorn but in time
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:42.560]  when a set cause succeeds the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:49.440]  a patriot and that's what it comes down to here is that I was being harassed by
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:54.520]  the feds at the Texas seacoast everybody else was to never been like this
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.160]  before I've been down there 20 something times probably or more probably more than
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:03.560]  that it's the new way to get us used to be in slaves everybody I talked to
[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:07.280]  literally cars driving by our listeners cars parked on both sides of us were
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:11.840]  listeners they were being harassed I left and went to Port Aransas people
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:15.680]  inside the condominium place where we rented a hotel room were listeners
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:18.560]  people at the pool were listeners the people at the fishing shack were
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:23.600]  listeners let me tell you our numbers are much greater than we know just from
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:28.880]  little old Alex Jones being known that's a radar ping the globalists know
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:32.400]  that they're spying on everything they ought to be scared they need to be
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:36.560]  scared that's why they're trying to flaunt all this in our face right now
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:40.720]  let's keep getting the word out in the info war so when they do stage terror
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:44.160]  attacks we all know who did it and so when they're sitting there posing as
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:47.480]  saviors and things will be able to expose them plus our people are everywhere
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:55.440]  Charles now watching them and yeah give it to the the loved ones a few dollars
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:59.960]  it'll make somebody save a life perhaps I ask people quit sitting down and being
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:04.320]  bench warmers get behind it we must get behind this program you are putting it
[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:08.720]  out we must get behind you in the name of Jesus Christ let's let's fight this
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:13.920]  with our hearts and souls and I just want to thank you so for being a man well
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:19.280]  I appreciate your call and God bless you Charles I think being a man just means
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:26.200]  that you are realistic there's no making a deal with this it's like learning you
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:30.880]  have horrible lung cancer you've got to get it removed or you've got it's not
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:35.000]  like man you've got courage going and having that cut out what do you think
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.080]  I'm gonna do here I mean it's like being mugged by somebody I mean you're gonna
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:45.000]  fight back and the cops pull up and go boy I can't believe you just beat up this
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:48.520]  big old mean guy with all these convictions it's like well that actually
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:53.240]  happened one time I looked at him I said what do you think I'm gonna do I mean
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:56.240]  somebody starts trying to beat me in the head with a club I mean I'm gonna fight
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.160]  back I mean I because it's harder to get on the ground and let him beat me I
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:05.520]  don't understand this I mean that's the thing about it folks being a man you
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:10.880]  also realize that it's your job to stand up against corruption for the innocent
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:16.240]  and every time I look at you look at what Nazi Germany did and other
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:20.080]  tyrannies the way they went after the poor and the sick and you know them
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:24.040]  beating old women on tape and stuff I mean you're like how do they do that this
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:29.560]  is a government went and hired scum went and found them you understand that
[03:04:29.560 --> 03:04:33.760]  that's happening now and there's a battle for the soul the police happening
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:05:00.920]  right now God bless you all my friends
