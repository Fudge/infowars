[00:23.080 --> 00:30.080]  Living life without the headaches.
[00:30.080 --> 00:40.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:45.160 --> 00:46.160]  You want answers?
[00:46.160 --> 00:48.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:48.160 --> 01:05.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05.280 --> 01:06.840]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06.840 --> 01:07.840]  Welcome.
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.640]  Thank you so much for joining us for this live Tuesday, the 6th of February, 2007.
[01:14.640 --> 01:21.040]  His once a month visit is coming up in the second hour, fellow GCN host and the head
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.760]  honcho over at www.whatreallyhappened.com.
[01:23.760 --> 01:28.480]  Michael Rivera will be joining us to give us his overview on the world, what's happening
[01:28.480 --> 01:36.160]  domestically and internationally, the intensifying war drums for an attack on Iran, bird flu,
[01:36.160 --> 01:42.920]  pandemic, fear-mongering, heating up, yet again and much more with Michael Rivera.
[01:42.920 --> 01:50.440]  Then, in that same hour, we have Mr. Wattata, who's being court-martialed.
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.440]  We have his father joining us, and those charges are going ahead right now.
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.200]  The trial is about to start, and we'll have him pop in and give us an update during the
[02:00.200 --> 02:02.840]  second hour on that as well.
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.680]  Then, in the third hour, we've got Nancy Kornke joining us.
[02:07.680 --> 02:15.680]  It's been many years since I had Nancy on, and one of the founders and one of the heads
[02:15.680 --> 02:21.760]  of the Michigan Militia, well-known to everyone across the country, is Mark from Michigan.
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.960]  He's getting out of prison here very soon on trumped-up charges.
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.160]  In fact, I even have the squad car video that we aired years ago, I was trying to look around
[02:31.160 --> 02:35.240]  for it last night, but the point is I have the squad car video where the police run him
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.080]  off the road and then claim that he assaulted them.
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.120]  They just drive right up, they run him off the road, and they charge him with assaulting
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.120]  them with the automobile.
[02:46.120 --> 02:52.320]  I'm in clear-cut case, and they still send him up the river, and when he's been in jail
[02:52.320 --> 02:58.320]  six, seven years, and of course as soon as he gets out of prison, we'll be having Mark
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.240]  Kornke here as a guest on the broadcast, but we do have Nancy Kornke to talk about, Mark
[03:03.240 --> 03:10.480]  Kornke, and some other important issues coming up in the third hour today.
[03:10.480 --> 03:14.040]  In the meantime, we're going to have wide-open phones in this first hour, I'm going to take
[03:14.040 --> 03:17.560]  a lot of your calls, we're going to go straight to your calls in the next segment.
[03:17.560 --> 03:31.320]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[03:31.320 --> 03:42.840]  ACLU alarmed that U.S. government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even if innocent.
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.720]  That's right, we've been telling you they've been planning that for a long time.
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.800]  They've already started it in England, and now it's coming here, we'll break it down.
[03:51.800 --> 03:58.000]  Also, why are Mexican congressmen from Mexico allowed to negotiate U.S. immigration policy
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.760]  in Washington, D.C.?
[04:00.760 --> 04:03.320]  Students from V-Dare and Allen Wall will break that down.
[04:03.320 --> 04:10.080]  Also, a great report here by Pastor Chuck Baldwin from his website, presidential front-runners
[04:10.080 --> 04:13.000]  would surrender America's borders.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.280]  Giuliani has entered the race, clearly involved, at least in the cover-up of 9-11, the inside
[04:19.280 --> 04:20.280]  job.
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.160]  What a monster, what a compromised individual, we'll talk about him as well.
[04:25.160 --> 04:32.400]  New Fort Detrick Biodefense Laboratory, part of Bush's overall germ warfare operations.
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.400]  We'll go through that.
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.320]  Senate Republicans have successfully blocked debate on Iraq resolution, or we'll just go
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.200]  on basically forever for all intents and purposes.
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.840]  A great article written by Paul Watson up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[04:46.840 --> 04:51.120]  No law to mandate dangerous, untested HPV vaccine.
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.000]  We'll go back over this monumental hoax that have people up in arms, folks are really getting
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.520]  angry in Texas and nationwide.
[04:58.520 --> 05:05.720]  Armed U.S. police could be on London's streets, London Telegraph, talk about internationalism,
[05:05.720 --> 05:12.800]  bird flu pandemic and profiteering quarantine USA, space shuttle astronaut arrested at OIA
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.360]  on kidnapping attempt, and much more.
[05:17.360 --> 05:20.280]  It's all coming up today.
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.480]  Wrap yourselves in as the information war intensifies.
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.520]  You don't want to miss the next two hours and 55 minutes.
[05:28.520 --> 05:35.520]  We'll be right back.
[05:35.520 --> 05:42.440]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[05:42.440 --> 05:44.680]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:44.680 --> 05:48.440]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[05:48.440 --> 05:53.360]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:53.360 --> 05:58.480]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[05:58.480 --> 06:00.560]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.560 --> 06:04.840]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[06:04.840 --> 06:11.200]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and
[06:11.200 --> 06:12.200]  much, much more.
[06:12.200 --> 06:16.280]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrors.
[06:16.280 --> 06:18.680]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.680 --> 06:23.040]  Terror Storm is a film of everyone who wants to be truly informed, must see.

[06:36.000 --> 06:40.360]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in U.S. are located?
[06:40.360 --> 06:43.920]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.120]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD-book, Throughton Places
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.120]  USA.
[06:49.120 --> 06:53.360]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster
[06:53.360 --> 06:58.280]  areas, brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.800]  and wind energy, and much, much more.
[07:00.800 --> 07:06.080]  Complete with 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000-plus counties in the U.S.,
[07:06.080 --> 07:11.240]  including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.200]  information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live, the ideal location
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.160]  for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.

[07:31.000 --> 07:37.480]  To order on the web or at burkeawater.com.
[07:37.480 --> 07:41.120]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.120]  glass?
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.800]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[07:43.800 --> 07:47.360]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of
[07:47.360 --> 07:50.480]  the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[07:50.480 --> 07:54.840]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.720]  using different resonant frequencies.
[07:56.720 --> 08:01.360]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[08:01.360 --> 08:04.400]  of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[08:04.400 --> 08:09.640]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[08:09.640 --> 08:13.520]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[08:13.520 --> 08:17.680]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.040]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.600]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[08:22.600 --> 08:28.200]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.

[08:31.920 --> 08:35.520]  1-866-885-6625.
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.440]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:41.440 --> 08:43.440]  a war on for your mind.
[08:43.440 --> 08:51.080]  All right, again, Michael Rivera with this monthly visit joins us also.
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.480]  We have the father of the military officer who's been court-martialed for refusing to
[08:57.480 --> 09:02.720]  go be part of a criminal war, Mr. Wanted joining us, and then we have Nancy Cornsey popping
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.720]  in as well.
[09:03.720 --> 09:06.920]  We'll talk about Mark Cornsey soon to get out of prison, and we'll tell you about that
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.600]  whole sordid story and more.
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.680]  We do have the Senate Republicans, quote, successfully blocked a debate on Iraq resolution.
[09:16.680 --> 09:20.480]  Now you have a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate, you have a Democratic
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.840]  majority that could overpower anything Bush wanted to do, but it doesn't matter.
[09:25.840 --> 09:27.520]  They're all for the war, too.
[09:27.520 --> 09:33.240]  We've got Hillary, we've got Barack Obama, we've got all of them out saying they want
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.240]  to attack Iran.
[09:34.240 --> 09:37.720]  I mean, it's not enough that we're in Iraq.
[09:37.720 --> 09:44.400]  They want to attack Iran, and, you know, Hillary says that she would have known what was going
[09:44.400 --> 09:45.400]  to happen in Iraq.
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.900]  She wouldn't have voted for it.
[09:46.900 --> 09:52.040]  That is nothing but politicking to neutralize her liberal base.
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.960]  This is the same lady that swore she'd never run for president in 2000 and 2002 and 2003,
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.400]  or five, six, and now she announces for president, and it doesn't matter.
[10:03.400 --> 10:06.840]  You know, the media constantly stacks the players up against each other.
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.560]  The Democratic candidates versus the Republican, the Republicans versus each other, the Democrats
[10:11.560 --> 10:12.760]  versus each other.
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.760]  It means nothing, anyone they're pushing, and giving attention from Newt Gingrich and
[10:17.760 --> 10:23.840]  Rudolph Giuliani on the Republican side and John McCain on the bridge between the two
[10:23.840 --> 10:30.320]  criminal groups, part of the Keening Five, Mr. Anti-Corruption as he's billed, and then
[10:30.320 --> 10:37.000]  you've got Hillary and Barack Obama and Edwards and the rest of them swirling around, all
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.360]  pushing socialized healthcare, open borders, gun control, the exact same stealth agenda
[10:43.360 --> 10:45.480]  that George W. Bush has been pushing.
[10:45.480 --> 10:47.360]  It doesn't matter.
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.440]  Notice they don't give any attention to somebody like Alan Keyes when he runs.
[10:52.440 --> 11:00.720]  Notice they don't give any attention to somebody like Ron Paul when he runs.
[11:00.720 --> 11:08.960]  I mean, even if they're still somewhat establishment, it doesn't matter.
[11:08.960 --> 11:15.240]  They still completely ignore them if they're not thoroughbred, global controlled.
[11:15.240 --> 11:17.800]  I know the listeners understand this.
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.840]  It's just time to start focusing more in on local elections where we can still have an
[11:21.840 --> 11:22.840]  effect.
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.520]  It's important to continue to discredit the electronic government-controlled touch screen
[11:27.520 --> 11:30.920]  and electronic voting machine systems, which is now happening.
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.840]  States coast to coast are moving to pull them out or to block federal funding.
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.200]  The feds quote, we're going to give everybody free funding with the Help America Vote Act,
[11:39.200 --> 11:47.560]  one of 2002, which spent over $6 billion giving these machines from three major companies
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.960]  to counties and cities and states all across the land.
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.840]  We've now got, what, nine states pulling out of the National ID card.
[11:56.840 --> 11:59.960]  We've got a lot of good things happening.
[11:59.960 --> 12:05.240]  We've got Governor Perry in retreat now with members of his own party, prominent Republicans
[12:05.240 --> 12:07.920]  in the state of Texas saying this is insane.
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.600]  It's a live, unproven virus, cancer virus.
[12:12.600 --> 12:17.360]  They want to give girls when it's one of the rarest forms of STDs.
[12:17.360 --> 12:19.080]  It doesn't stop them from getting on the news.
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.040]  Perry and all his minions saying it's the most common.
[12:23.040 --> 12:24.160]  I went and looked it up.
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.040]  It's way down the list.
[12:27.040 --> 12:28.040]  They're liars.
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.280]  Sorry, I'm already digressing.
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.760]  So we'll go over that.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.440]  There's just so much news here today.
[12:34.440 --> 12:41.200]  ACLU alarmed that U.S. government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even of innocent.
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.160]  Why are Mexican Congressmen allowed to negotiate U.S. immigration policy in Washington, D.C.?
[12:47.160 --> 12:58.920]  I'll tell you what, let's get into this news first, then we'll go to Johnny, Ken, and others
[12:58.920 --> 13:01.240]  that are patiently holding.
[13:01.240 --> 13:07.120]  ACLU alarmed that U.S. government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even of innocent.
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.880]  And the ACLU's got a lot of good members, but the leadership is there to lose cases,
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.040]  create bad presidents, pose as our saviors, and really their loyal opposition.
[13:17.040 --> 13:18.960]  There's no doubting it.
[13:18.960 --> 13:22.880]  They also go out and defend rights that don't even exist while not even defending basic
[13:22.880 --> 13:23.880]  rights.
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.360]  So they always put them out there as our savior.
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.880]  But when Democrats are in their butchering bill of rights wholesale, they just love it.
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.080]  The American Civil Liberties Union is expressing its alarm that the U.S. government may begin
[13:37.080 --> 13:40.800]  collecting the DNA of all suspects, even of innocent.
[13:40.800 --> 13:44.880]  In a press release, the ACLU criticized the Justice Department's move to collect DNA
[13:44.880 --> 13:48.800]  samples of individuals who are arrested or detained by federal authorities, even if they
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.640]  are not convicted or charged with a crime.
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.120]  See, they've tried to pass federal laws to do this, but it's so draconian and so corrupt
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.640]  they failed.
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.280]  Clinton tried it, Bush has tried it.
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.800]  They've been trying it now for about nine years.
[14:02.800 --> 14:05.160]  Three years of Clinton, six years of Bush.
[14:05.160 --> 14:06.760]  And so what does Alberto Gonzales do?
[14:06.760 --> 14:10.400]  He just says, you know what, it's not even an executive order.
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.760]  He'll just, as the Justice Department's chief, as the attorney general, he'll just say that
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.480]  this is, he'll just order federal agents and federal bureaucrats to do this.
[14:21.480 --> 14:23.920]  It's the same thing with Perry.
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.400]  They admit on the news, and in press conferences, in fact he's live at a press conference right
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.320]  now at the state house, down at the Capitol.
[14:31.320 --> 14:38.000]  And well, we couldn't get it passed as a law to put it on the list of mandatory vaccines,
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  which is a lie itself.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.440]  It's lies within lies, within lies, like Russian dolls.
[14:42.440 --> 14:45.920]  You've ever seen those with a little bitty doll, and a bigger one goes over and a larger
[14:45.920 --> 14:49.800]  one and an even larger one, and you've got like 20 of them inside each other.
[14:49.800 --> 14:56.120]  It's lies within lies, within lies, within lies, with propaganda and semantical deceptions
[14:56.120 --> 14:57.120]  and twisting.
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.840]  I mean, it's almost unnavigable.
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.680]  You just know the whole thing's a lie.
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.800]  And it's the same thing with the cancer vaccine, which is live cancer.
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.120]  He says, well, we can't get it passed, so I'm just signing in executive order, it's
[15:13.120 --> 15:14.560]  the law, you've got to take it.
[15:14.560 --> 15:19.160]  And you go read the executive order, and it says, oh, I'm just telling the state department
[15:19.160 --> 15:22.960]  that this is on the list of recommended, but then the health department, the schools,
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.920]  go out and lie, like they do with the 40-something other vaccines, and say, it's the law, you've
[15:26.920 --> 15:29.800]  got to take it.
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.400]  So we're seeing the hoax here, and everybody's real mad now at the liberal shows, the conservative
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.040]  shows, all the local shows, I hear national shows, I monitor them and scan through the
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.040]  dial.
[15:39.040 --> 15:44.040]  They're going, he's gone too far, yeah, this is crazy, to make somebody do something, to
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.680]  have a law that you've got to take this thing, why there's medical problems associated with
[15:48.680 --> 15:56.360]  it, again, even those that are, quote, fighting it are effectively still putting out the hoax,
[15:56.360 --> 15:58.920]  that there is a law you've got to take it.
[15:58.920 --> 16:02.160]  And they're not effectively attacking the fact, this used to be added by the way our
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.880]  article we wrote, The Prison Planet, that they say in a Fox News piece and in the Associated
[16:07.880 --> 16:17.360]  Press and other places that this is the second most common, and then in another newscast,
[16:17.360 --> 16:26.080]  these spokespersons for Merck, the paid politicians, including very former chief of staff, state
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.200]  senators and state legislators, who were openly on the payroll of Merck, some of them openly
[16:30.200 --> 16:38.480]  on boards of Merck, they say it's the most common STD, so we've got to give it to all
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.040]  of the girls.
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.400]  Folks, I went and looked at the local Austin Health Department, I went and looked at the
[16:46.400 --> 16:59.640]  federal health sheet, I went to the CDC, cervical transmitted cancer is way down the list, on
[16:59.640 --> 17:06.360]  some list it's like 15, on others it's 21, I even printed off one of those lists.
[17:06.360 --> 17:13.360]  So when you see a headline like Perry requires HPV vaccine for girls, it's a complete lie,
[17:13.360 --> 17:16.880]  and it's a lie that it's the most common or the second most common.
[17:16.880 --> 17:20.600]  I hate to go over gross things like this on air, but you can go look at the list, it's
[17:20.600 --> 17:26.400]  herpes, it's general warts, and then it just moves down from there, and there are a bunch
[17:26.400 --> 17:31.480]  of names of stuff I've never heard of, and I'm pretty well read on things like this,
[17:31.480 --> 17:36.360]  there's a bunch of stuff I don't even know what it is, all this wonderful new third world
[17:36.360 --> 17:42.000]  stuff spreading everywhere, and I mean there's things people get that I don't even want
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.800]  to, I mean like bugs, actual insects, I'm not talking about, oh this is too gross, I'm
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.160]  not just talking about mites folks, I'm not just talking about crabs, I mean stuff that
[17:54.160 --> 18:03.080]  lives in you, okay worms, and it's all above this thing, do they say a word about totally
[18:03.080 --> 18:08.520]  drug resistant and drug immune, TB, spreading and killing tens of thousands a year in the
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.920]  US, do they talk about having three cases of leprosy before 2004, and then in 2005 they
[18:14.920 --> 18:23.000]  had 7000 plus cases and opened a huge leper colony in each Texas, oh no, no, no, no, no,
[18:23.000 --> 18:31.040]  no, no, it's all, there's 9,710 cases of this last year, and of course a fraction of the
[18:31.040 --> 18:36.800]  people died, it's heavily treatable, let's just give every girl in America a 360 something
[18:36.800 --> 18:43.800]  dollar shot, and then lie and tell her it's the law, tell their parents it's the law,
[18:43.800 --> 18:47.920]  and then one of the bigger lies is they keep implying it's only these backwards religious
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.280]  kooks that don't want to protect our girls, so the left all hears that and thinks oh I'm
[18:53.280 --> 18:59.240]  not a kooky religious nut, and of course I believe those parents are sensible and smart,
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.760]  they know something other people don't know, but they're all making it a promiscuity issue
[19:03.760 --> 19:13.160]  of well 10 and 11 year olds don't need this, and the average age to contract it is 46,
[19:13.160 --> 19:19.760]  and they're making an old debate about these backwards people don't want to protect girls
[19:19.760 --> 19:26.080]  when it's nonpartisan, I mean I heard two liberal talk shows this morning decrying it,
[19:26.080 --> 19:31.000]  I heard conservative shows decrying it yesterday, and they're saying it's because it's their
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.680]  bodies, it's the parents have control over their children, it's not the state, so there's
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.840]  so many facets to this, when we get back we'll go directly to your calls as promised, and

[24:48.640 --> 24:53.120]  Jackson down a mighty Mississippi, we took a little bacon and we took the little beans
[24:53.120 --> 24:57.440]  and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans, we fired our guns and the
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.600]  British came for coming, there wasn't as many as there was a while ago, we fired once more
[25:02.600 --> 25:10.000]  and they'd forget the running, on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, we looked
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.080]  down the river and we see the British come and they must have been a hundred of beating
[25:14.080 --> 25:18.480]  on the drum, they stepped so high and they made them bugle strings, we stood beside our
[25:18.480 --> 25:23.240]  cotton fields and didn't say a thing, we fired our guns and the British came for coming,
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.960]  there wasn't as many as there was a while ago, we fired once more and they'd forget the
[25:27.960 --> 25:35.600]  running, on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, old Hickory said we could take
[25:35.600 --> 25:40.480]  them by surprise, if we didn't fire our muskies do we look them in the eye, we held our fire
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.080]  till we see their faces well, then we opened up our swirl guns and really gave them well,
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.040]  we fired our guns and the British came for coming, there wasn't as many as there was
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.760]  a while ago, we fired once more and they'd forget the running, on down the Mississippi
[25:54.760 --> 26:01.600]  to the Gulf of Mexico, yeah they ran through the priors and they ran through the brambles
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.040]  and they ran through the bushes where the rabbit couldn't go, they ran so fast that the
[26:06.040 --> 26:16.640]  brown spun cancer blew down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, we fired our cannon
[26:16.640 --> 26:19.200]  till the barrel melted down, so we grabbed an alligator and pulled another round, we
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.820]  filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind, and when touched the powder, all
[26:23.820 --> 26:29.600]  of the gator lost his mind, alright welcome back, lets start going to your calls now,
[26:29.600 --> 26:35.720]  lets go ahead and talk to jarney and awaij, jarney thank you for holding, oh thank you
[26:35.720 --> 26:41.080]  Well thank you Alex. I would give some information on this human papillomavirus. First of all
[26:41.080 --> 26:47.720]  I work for a hospital in Hawaii and I'm in the department of OBGYN. What we have here
[26:47.720 --> 26:53.640]  with this vaccine is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have gotten
[26:53.640 --> 27:01.440]  together with the pharmaceutical companies to create this whole condition with this vaccine.
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.800]  And I have a report on their opinion about the virus itself. A few little facts. First
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.480]  of all they want to unite females between 9 and 26 years old.
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.520]  Yeah that's how I've been saying 9. Perry says 11 and 12. The actual recommendation
[27:16.520 --> 27:17.520]  is 9.
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.880]  And they're also doing research to have this given to males in addition to the females.
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.360]  The P.X. Association is totally against this.
[27:28.360 --> 27:31.640]  Well I know the American Medical Association is saying you shouldn't take it but I know
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.240]  that subgroups that have been paid off are.
[27:34.240 --> 27:39.160]  Yeah well the P.A.T.R.C. committees say it's not good. It's not going to be good for the
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.840]  children. It hasn't been proven. You know just a whole number of things.
[27:42.840 --> 27:47.080]  And they've already given it to tens of thousands and it's causing massive health problems.
[27:47.080 --> 27:54.840]  Yes. And the problem with this virus is that in their report it says that the majority
[27:54.840 --> 28:01.920]  of people that have this are girls in the low income families that are underprivileged.
[28:01.920 --> 28:07.400]  So what does that mean? Illegal aliens mostly. Exactly what it boils down to.
[28:07.400 --> 28:14.920]  Plus a couple other things. The whole pharmaceutical industry is a rip off. They create diseases
[28:14.920 --> 28:17.080]  and provide drugs for them.
[28:17.080 --> 28:25.760]  These 2005 figures is the money they spend on consumers advertising their drugs to consumers
[28:25.760 --> 28:32.440]  $4.2 billion. And they do the same thing with doctors. They paid $7.2 billion to 2005
[28:32.440 --> 28:33.640]  to promote their drugs.
[28:33.640 --> 28:40.680]  Oh I know. Listen my dad doesn't do it but they offer him cruises, trips, money. I mean
[28:40.680 --> 28:41.680]  it is unbelievable.
[28:41.680 --> 28:48.680]  Yeah. It's an old boy network and it's like a big country club between the drug companies
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.680]  and the doctors.
[28:49.680 --> 28:53.600]  Well my numbers are a lot higher than the $4 billion. That's probably just TV advertising.
[28:53.600 --> 28:56.320]  Well this was 2005 figures too.
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.400]  My gosh the nightly news. Half the ads are drug ads.
[28:59.400 --> 29:06.120]  Exactly. But that's a little bit of information on this. This whole created scare. And that's
[29:06.120 --> 29:07.120]  all it's going to be.
[29:07.120 --> 29:15.480]  Well that's all this is with Perry is a huge PR stunt. I mean that's all he's doing. And
[29:15.480 --> 29:21.480]  you know the slogan of these vaccines is one less. And yeah one less person that isn't
[29:21.480 --> 29:22.480]  infected.
[29:22.480 --> 29:27.160]  I mean this is a live virus folks. And they've got all these other vaccines they want to
[29:27.160 --> 29:32.440]  make us take. Have you read about the vaccines that cure you of cigarette smoking? And also
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.800]  narcotics because it attacks the brain and creates plaques. Destroying those are receptors.
[29:37.800 --> 29:39.640]  Yeah. Destroying your brain exactly.
[29:39.640 --> 29:43.960]  Doesn't that sound wonderful? A live virus that attacks your brain. Boy give me some.
[29:43.960 --> 29:48.400]  But Merck is in the position to profit billions of billions of dollars. So they want to take
[29:48.400 --> 29:51.600]  this worldwide. Not just.
[29:51.600 --> 29:56.560]  But domestically it will be tens of billions if the majority of the girls and women take
[29:56.560 --> 29:57.560]  this.
[29:57.560 --> 29:58.560]  Exactly.
[29:58.560 --> 30:07.920]  Plus dollars per shot. Anything else you want to add working in and around this?
[30:07.920 --> 30:15.360]  Well just you should try some sort of alternative medicine. Anyways some holistic approach.
[30:15.360 --> 30:19.840]  But a pap smear is all a woman needs yearly to see if there's any beginning of cancer
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.320]  anyway. And they could be treated very easily.
[30:22.320 --> 30:26.360]  Absolutely. In fact they just will stay there. I want to hear what they medically do.
[30:26.360 --> 30:36.320]  Here on the march the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:36.320 --> 30:39.920]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness
[30:39.920 --> 30:44.400]  products. I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[30:44.400 --> 30:48.680]  According to the company they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[30:48.680 --> 30:53.320]  I was so amazed. I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light. Both my
[30:53.320 --> 30:55.360]  husband and I could tell the difference.
[30:55.360 --> 31:00.040]  Solay Wellness dot com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around
[31:00.040 --> 31:01.040]  the world.
[31:01.040 --> 31:05.840]  So I went back to the site and ordered their Solay simple natural cleaning products. Also
[31:05.840 --> 31:10.240]  made with Himalayan salt. I figured it would clean really well. And natural cleaning products
[31:10.240 --> 31:14.520]  worked wonderfully and there was no scent. This company has so many products my whole
[31:14.520 --> 31:18.480]  family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus the service was great.

[32:35.160 --> 32:41.760]  Hey Jane how's it going? Gosh I'm not doing so well even though I'm doing everything
[32:41.760 --> 32:44.800]  I'm supposed to do for blood sugar is way out of control.
[32:44.800 --> 32:49.680]  Oh Jane I'm sorry to hear that. I have to monitor my blood sugar again if there was
[32:49.680 --> 32:54.880]  only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar that really works.

[33:24.000 --> 33:29.800]  So Jane what do you think? I'm looking to call sucrablast to set up a free consultation
[33:29.800 --> 33:40.880]  right now. Excellent Jane. You'll be glad you did.
[33:40.880 --> 33:53.440]  From what I've read about this cancer causing virus and the infection it causes is that
[33:53.440 --> 33:58.120]  if it doesn't get into late stages and spread into other tissues that basically it's just
[33:58.120 --> 34:05.840]  scraped off and that it's very easy to deal with. But we're talking to Johnny in Hawaii
[34:05.840 --> 34:14.240]  who works at a hospital in this field. Fill us in Johnny on how common this cancer is
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.880]  and how it's dealt with. Well if a woman gets a pap smear and shows
[34:19.880 --> 34:27.960]  any cancer they can go through various treatments from just a very minor surgery to depending
[34:27.960 --> 34:33.680]  on if it has a metastasis being spread to the body or go through our oncology department
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.000]  and go through the chemotherapy and whatever else they want to use.
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.440]  But Texas is the second most popular state with 27 plus million people and only what
[34:43.440 --> 34:49.720]  412 people died last year from this and most of them I was reading were drug addicts, prostitutes
[34:49.720 --> 34:56.720]  had compromised immune systems. On average again we're in their late 40s and so 400 in
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.160]  a state of 27 million that is literally just microscopic.
[35:02.160 --> 35:07.960]  That's right. The immune system if it's weak it's more successful with cancer so if your
[35:07.960 --> 35:13.160]  immune system is strong with high dose of vitamin C the right kinds of food, you're
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.600]  not drinking, you're not smoking, you're not doing drugs, you'll be pretty much okay.
[35:18.600 --> 35:23.920]  But people that don't do that they don't have a chance of getting it but it's certainly
[35:23.920 --> 35:29.000]  not one of the top cancers. Breast cancer is very prevalent.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  Breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer is what's killing women and they get on the
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.240]  news and say no this is the number one cancer and the number one STD for women. Total lie.
[35:39.240 --> 35:43.560]  Oh I forgot that lie. It's not just that it's the number one STD, total lie, way down the
[35:43.560 --> 35:46.760]  list. They also say it's the number one cancer.
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.760]  Well this opinion I'm looking at from the ACOG, the American College of Obstetrics
[35:51.760 --> 36:01.280]  and Gynecologists. It says there's a hundred types of HPV virus and there's 15 associated
[36:01.280 --> 36:08.320]  with cervical cancer and out of that 15 there's only like four that have like a 90% possibility
[36:08.320 --> 36:15.200]  of even causing cancer. But there again if a woman gets her yearly checkup and you mentioned
[36:15.200 --> 36:20.720]  that scraping process so that's a common procedure too to remove the interliner of
[36:20.720 --> 36:30.080]  the uterus and the mucous and so forth which is a lot of that exactly what it is yeah.
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.200]  And there's a lot of minor treatments like that which are in office treatments that can
[36:35.200 --> 36:41.320]  be done and the women don't have to worry about after that they're good to go you know.
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.200]  No let's give them a live cancer virus that's causing them to bleed out and have seizures
[36:46.200 --> 36:51.720]  and fall over dead. Let's give nine-year-old girls this. Also with this vaccine that's
[36:51.720 --> 36:55.960]  going to solve that they don't know how long it's going to last and they're talking about
[36:55.960 --> 37:02.240]  updating the dosage periodically. And of course as you said really over 100 of these viruses
[37:02.240 --> 37:09.800]  so there's got to be lots more different variants yes. And just like any other virus this can
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.720]  develop into a resistant form which is the vaccine is going to help anyway you know later
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.400]  on. Don't worry there'll be a new vaccine for that. Yeah and more billions of dollars
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.640]  to be made by Burke. What is it in Hawaii? I know it's now over 40 vaccines that quote
[37:24.640 --> 37:28.520]  the state recommends to the state health department then they lie on the news and say it's the
[37:28.520 --> 37:34.600]  law. How many are quote recommended i.e. they lie to the people and say it's the law in
[37:34.600 --> 37:40.960]  Hawaii? I'm not sure how many it is but they have a requirement if people don't know any
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.760]  better let their kids get done. It may more shot you know measles month through Bella and
[37:46.760 --> 37:52.560]  they have to be. There's five or six triple and quad injections that they're giving. If
[37:52.560 --> 37:56.560]  you add them all up it's over 40 in the average state. Thank you so much for your time sir
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.000]  I appreciate that. Oh thanks Alex. Let me just finally ask you the other health care
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  providers where you work at the hospital what's their view on this controversy? Well they
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.280]  just found out about the ruling there in Texas and I'm not sure what their opinion is yet.
[38:13.280 --> 38:18.400]  I'm sure some of them aren't going to like it very much because you mean the imperial
[38:18.400 --> 38:24.960]  pontification of the governor. Yeah it's no ruling it's no law it's an executive order
[38:24.960 --> 38:29.280]  recommending this be part of the recommended vaccines and they hoax when they keep making
[38:29.280 --> 38:33.520]  this clear and lying say it's the law. Thanks for joining us. Thank you Alex. Thank you
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.280]  Johnny. Ken in New York we're going to hurry up now. Go ahead Ken. Good morning Alex. Hi.
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.760]  I don't know if you saw it or if you were told about it but last week I think it was Tuesday
[38:43.760 --> 38:51.200]  night on the O'Reilly fact that Congressman Charles Rangel was interviewed and O'Reilly
[38:51.200 --> 38:56.800]  was all hot and bothered over the anti-war demonstrations a couple weeks ago and that
[38:56.800 --> 39:02.320]  some of the people were calling for a push his impeachment and he was all foaming at
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.920]  the mouth almost at Rangel saying that you know how can you guys consider impeaching Mr. Bush
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.400]  when he has all these things on his mind he's fighting terrorism and all this and it's no
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.640]  surprise I guess but Rangel said something like well don't worry because it's not going to happen
[39:17.600 --> 39:23.040]  and I was kind of surprised that he was so blatant you know that we have no intentions of impeaching
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.000]  Bush. Well Rupert Murdoch last week was at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland with all
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.360]  the globalists and I've got the transcript here he openly said in front of international TV
[39:33.360 --> 39:40.080]  and print publications he just openly said that they do try to influence public opinion and they
[39:40.080 --> 39:46.480]  are pro-war but that they quote fail to convince the public. So I mean you've got Fox News Watchers
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.560]  and seeing it as just as bad as different flavor propaganda who will argue with you and say it's
[39:50.560 --> 39:57.040]  fair and balanced it's not propaganda when the owner of it says it's propaganda. I mean it's
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.120]  amazing but it's like Perry lying and saying that this is the number one cancer for women.
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.360]  And also a couple of things this guy I know told me that around Christmas time last Christmas
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.320]  he went to a large mall north of New York City but now a north well-known mall and he went into a
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.480]  Suncoast video store to get terrorism so the manager was behind the counter he asked him for
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.640]  it he says we don't have that maybe I can order it for you. So he went to the computer and he
[40:28.640 --> 40:36.240]  punched it in and this guy told me that a strange look came across his face and he couldn't really
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.720]  describe it but it was a reaction to whatever came up on the computer screen when he punched
[40:40.720 --> 40:48.720]  terrorism in the in the search and yes this guy I could get that for you if you give me a contact
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.520]  information you name an address and phone number I'll get back to you. Now I don't know whether
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.560]  some kind of red flag came up on the computer screen when he punched terrorism in or have you
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.160]  heard anything from other people who have requested that in any kind of major video chain and
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.920]  something negative has come up on the computer screen or. Sure let me just and I appreciate
[41:11.920 --> 41:18.640]  your call let me comment on that I happen to know exactly how the supply chain works I happen to
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.360]  have most people are fans of the broadcast at Barnes & Noble and other bookstores around Austin
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.120]  so I've been able to get around and look at the computer screen and a lot of these bookstores
[41:29.120 --> 41:33.200]  they have the computer screen right up in front of you at kiosk and they'll punch it in and say oh
[41:33.200 --> 41:42.160]  see and a lot of times you know they'll do that you know type of quizzling look when it shows
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.800]  that they have it but then it's not available or they show that they do have some in the store
[41:46.800 --> 41:53.680]  but then he doesn't have it in his main list so just because somebody gives you a look I mean
[41:53.680 --> 42:01.760]  when I go into the store to get some naval history book or to get some book on petrochemical industry
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.960]  or I go in to get some fiction book for my wife she wants you know they'll give you a look and
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.440]  then ask for your info and they call you when it comes in that's how they do it they say give me
[42:11.440 --> 42:16.880]  your name and number and we'll call you when it comes that is standard operating procedure
[42:16.880 --> 42:22.480]  and we have to be careful to not let the intimidation in America and the chilling effect get us to
[42:22.480 --> 42:31.040]  you know run at shadows now has there been blocking of terror storm in stores yes that's
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.400]  way up the corporate chain that's not some local thing and they don't you know from my knowledge
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.160]  have some notes saying get this person and then no that's not that's people superimposing fear on
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.640]  their own minds what happens is say barns and nobles or borders buys thousands of them and
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.360]  then people all over the country go into stores and they say well we're supposed to have it
[42:53.920 --> 42:59.120]  but it never was shipped to us from the distribution center or yeah we had three copies they all
[42:59.120 --> 43:03.840]  sold out or yeah we've got two copies but they're in the back let me go get them
[43:03.840 --> 43:11.120]  and it's strange because my distributor which is a large national distributor they put out
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.400]  outfoxed and on a robert greenwald big films and you know they published the book that got
[43:16.400 --> 43:21.520]  turned into the movie siriana with the c i age and robert bear something that they're big time
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.560]  and he said he's well you've heard gary badly here on air the owner of the company
[43:26.560 --> 43:34.240]  he said he's never seen such a blockage out there and such a uh because it was taken off
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.920]  in the stores now a lot of the independents and there's thousands of those they sold them
[43:39.360 --> 43:45.600]  they carried them there wasn't a problem uh but the big chains very badly basically gave
[43:45.600 --> 43:52.240]  terror storm for free uh to barns and nobles and that's how you do it you give them a bunch
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.840]  of your product free and then you get an end cap and in the documentary film section we were supposed
[43:57.840 --> 44:04.560]  to get an end cap and no end caps went in no one was so basically they gave it to barns and nobles
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.200]  and then barns and nobles didn't honor the deal and didn't end cap it and some barns and nobles
[44:09.200 --> 44:15.440]  didn't need have it on shelves others uh couldn't get it delivered from their warehouse another
[44:15.440 --> 44:20.960]  thing that amazon dot com they do have them in stock now did is they sold out in like a week
[44:20.960 --> 44:29.520]  it went to number eight on their charts which is amazing and then even for a week and a half they
[44:29.520 --> 44:34.240]  had it in their warehouse and gary badly knew their procedure and once it shows in their
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.400]  warehouse they have like five different ones in the country for you know to ship quickly
[44:39.200 --> 44:43.280]  it was supposed to show that it was there and this time they just for like almost two weeks
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.400]  didn't put it up on the website saying that it was available though people were still ordering it
[44:50.400 --> 45:00.240]  they were getting it like in two three days so there is a effort no doubt but that's at the top
[45:00.880 --> 45:07.280]  it's not at the bottom there is an effort to block people getting terror storm you can always get it
[45:07.280 --> 45:12.240]  at info wars dot com we'll ship it out to ups and get america freedom to fascism it's not available
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.280]  on amazon you can get it from us uh we've got a bunch of other suppressed books and videos that's
[45:17.280 --> 45:21.840]  why these are important i mean big brother wouldn't be trying to block these if it wasn't hurting them
[45:21.840 --> 45:28.880]  you want pure censorship google twice that we caught them that we got screenshots that we
[45:29.680 --> 45:37.440]  wrote articles about it that we totally proved it now it had clearly happened a couple times before
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.800]  that because then we had to get phone calls and emails and then we started watching and then we
[45:42.800 --> 45:48.800]  caught it but we know a couple times at least before terror storm when it first went on google
[45:48.800 --> 45:54.720]  video for free went into the top 100 and was surging towards number one and it would suddenly
[45:54.720 --> 46:02.560]  you know say have 600 000 views in two days and boom it'd be gone it'd be zero views the very same
[46:02.560 --> 46:09.520]  upload same tag and uploads we put up there and it would be still there but knocked down to like
[46:09.520 --> 46:17.040]  number 5000 and totally off the list and then it would build back up to 500 000 boom erased it again
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.160]  that happened several times what we were told before we went and looked at it and we started
[46:22.160 --> 46:27.280]  looking and indeed it happened twice in front of us hundreds of not thousands i know a lot of you
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.720]  sent emails and called them they put out a little press release and we posted it saying yes it's an
[46:32.720 --> 46:38.960]  accident we accidentally erased it's a rank and why is that important we don't care about having
[46:38.960 --> 46:44.720]  something of oh we've been number one on google video which we briefly once were before they
[46:44.720 --> 46:51.040]  knocked it out it's not oh we got the trophy you know we got the piston cup or we got the heisman
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.520]  it's that when you're in the top 100 that's where tens of millions a day
[46:55.520 --> 47:00.080]  go to do their tv watching there's now more people watching video online than television
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.400]  so they're trying to merge the two right now the old line people are desperate to keep control
[47:04.400 --> 47:10.800]  and so by being up there in the top 100 you get seen it's like being on tens of thousands of
[47:10.800 --> 47:16.240]  billboards in the country literally and so once you get up there that they found out
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.760]  would lose change second edition once you start getting to number one you can stay there for
[47:19.760 --> 47:25.600]  months and then tens and tens and tens of millions get to see it but they haven't stopped us with
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.520]  the 50-something versions that are up there and watching their ratios and everything they've done
[47:29.520 --> 47:37.200]  uh conservatively about 10 million people have now watched terror storm conservatively
[47:37.200 --> 47:42.000]  just on google video then there's all the bit torrents and the torrents and the downloads and
[47:42.000 --> 47:51.200]  the file sharing sites but 10 million we released that in late june the last few days of june
[47:51.200 --> 47:58.560]  and so how many months is that six seven eight months 10 million people in eight months
[48:00.400 --> 48:07.200]  i mean that is over a million people a month in one venue being able to see terror storm
[48:07.200 --> 48:09.920]  and i'm going to thank you the listeners for pushing it telling people about it
[48:10.480 --> 48:17.600]  blogging it emailing it out just keep it going keep it going so i feel good you know i made a film
[48:17.600 --> 48:21.680]  put it out on dvd if you want the high quality with the extras and to support us please get it
[48:21.680 --> 48:27.600]  but i mean we day one said here boom free because the goal here is to save this country we're not
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.240]  going to have a future if we don't uh let's go ahead and talk to who's up next year

[48:45.360 --> 48:52.960]  to mention is somebody had made a pretty um smart announcement on the 9-11 blogger site about having
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.800]  a bycott you had mentioned before about having the celebrities come out and you know actually come
[48:58.800 --> 49:04.080]  out to the open about 9-11 well if everybody would pledge say for instance don henley would come out
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.320]  you know he knows what's going on we'll come out and speak his mind all the 9-11 truthers would
[49:08.320 --> 49:13.280]  pledge to go buy his new album you know well let me take the dixie chicks we know they know about
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.560]  9-11 they live here in austin i'm going to leave it there they've known about 9-11 for four years
[49:18.560 --> 49:24.080]  i'm just going to stop right there and uh they got throttled for just saying they were embarrassed
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.640]  to bush because he's not really a texan but they took it out of context okay you know because
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.120]  texas get the blame for all this the guys from kenny buckport main not knocking main folks they're
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.200]  great hardy wonderful people i know some of them the point is that you wouldn't like it if i came
[49:37.200 --> 49:44.240]  to main and gave main a bad name or you know connecticut they're from both places and uh so when
[49:44.240 --> 49:50.400]  they got attacked they made triple the money when they got boycotted and shut down if you look it's
[49:50.400 --> 49:55.280]  been in the news the dixie chicks made triple their all-time profits right now i've been talking to
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.520]  one of the dixie i'm not going to get into it the point is is they're scared to go public and they
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.080]  need to just go ahead and go public they'll tell the truth and make a boatload of money you know
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.800]  what i wanted to mention was uh i have been a regular and i have a bunch of friends that are
[50:08.800 --> 50:16.240]  regulars on the msnbc message boards and recently about a month ago they started banning and deleting
[50:16.240 --> 50:22.960]  911 posts and the users they started banning their screen names so i'd advise everybody
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.560]  just to go to google and type in msnbc message boards and go there to the us message board
[50:28.560 --> 50:33.440]  and to the keith oberman message board and put links to terror storm everywhere oh yeah and
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.200]  tear it up because they keep i have like 15 different screenings i have to use just so i can
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.560]  get on their stupid site because they keep banning everybody's you know screen name off there i don't
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.360]  know what i mean about it there's been a second hit piece in a month and the london guardian against
[50:47.360 --> 50:53.280]  loose change second edition big one today the article came out yesterday and there were something
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.960]  like 200 to something pages of posts there were thousands of them i mean just within a day and
[50:58.960 --> 51:05.040]  and almost all of them are are attacking the hit piece so they're panicking they can't have the
[51:05.040 --> 51:10.240]  illusion that everybody buys the official story and everyone loves bush and everyone loves blare
[51:10.240 --> 51:15.920]  and everyone buys the fraud they know 84 percent thinker man lied to the scientific polls on 9
[51:15.920 --> 51:21.680]  11 they're panicking well every time keith oberman has a special comment you'll notice all his uh
[51:21.680 --> 51:26.880]  posts get erased and they put up a bunch of troll threads to spark interest on the the
[51:26.880 --> 51:31.600]  fight between the right and the left yeah that's got a big problem he's totally keeping in the left

[55:02.480 --> 55:08.080]  uh you know that the times sure are interesting aren't they may you live in interesting times a
[55:08.080 --> 55:14.800]  blessing in a curse yes um you know i've i've got two things i wonder have you and i'm serious have
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.680]  you ever considered running for governor of texas seriously no i'm not really i'm not gonna run for
[55:21.680 --> 55:28.400]  political office and unlike hillary clinton i mean that in the sense that you've got here i mean
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.280]  for example you know in the war protest they had the other week did i saw one brilliant sign that
[55:35.280 --> 55:42.240]  said impeach cheney first you know i wonder would you or or any of your listeners be
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.640]  supporting that an impeachment of cheney even polosi said she didn't want to impeach bush
[55:46.640 --> 55:53.440]  we supported an impeachment of them all but polosi's on the same payroll a tradition a pack
[55:53.440 --> 55:59.520]  and everybody else i know that but see we will celebrities won't say that you know 9-11 was
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.640]  staged by our government but a lot of celebrities actually have okay but our own representatives
[56:04.640 --> 56:08.640]  won't say it there i mean everybody was scared by that anthrax thing you know everybody's but
[56:08.640 --> 56:14.320]  everybody's normal which was clearly the government again what which was clearly the government again
[56:14.320 --> 56:20.000]  the anthrax right right so they're in washington to see they're they're they're there you mean you
[56:20.000 --> 56:26.160]  know brawl hasn't said it even percentage hasn't said it uh chuck hagel nobody in congress even
[56:26.160 --> 56:31.280]  has said but i mean if you just theoretically listen fantasy fantasy politics if you ran for
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.880]  governor you could say i'm here by running because i don't like that they're building a super highway
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.920]  into my state i don't like that they're running a prison camp north of osmond i don't like that our
[56:41.920 --> 56:49.920]  current governor is trying to inoculate our our our children i don't know if i'm from california
[56:49.920 --> 56:56.480]  originally do you have a recall process in texas to recall the governor at all yes you could start
[56:56.480 --> 57:02.320]  recall on the governor and the governor is is is the weakest of any 50 of the 50 states here in
[57:02.320 --> 57:11.760]  texas i appreciate your call number one a large portion of the state i know it's 30 plus per
[57:11.760 --> 57:18.000]  cent has the government controlled highly manipulatable no record of how you voted electronic
[57:18.000 --> 57:26.320]  voting machine so first we have to remove those number two i would have to raise about 30 million
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.800]  dollars to effectively run for governor and then all they would do is have three or four more candidates
[57:30.800 --> 57:37.200]  run so that rick perry would lose but he would still win because they would break the vote up
[57:37.200 --> 57:46.320]  so much and mindless neocon republicans who all they care about is having a republican in they
[57:46.320 --> 57:51.120]  don't care about conservatism they don't care about america they just they just got american flags made
[57:51.120 --> 57:56.320]  in china flapping in their yard all over their cars they just feel good everything's all right
[57:56.320 --> 58:04.800]  everything's going well we're doing good a lot perry sportsman for perry uh we need to go ahead
[58:04.800 --> 58:11.040]  and let the illegals in they work hard and and and that's their attitude they can't face up
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.640]  what's happened to this society they can't deal with it psychologically so they just
[58:16.640 --> 58:21.360]  tell themselves everything's fine as long as we kill a rags everything will be all right it's
[58:21.360 --> 58:29.600]  some brown people over there need to kill them i'm american and that's the end of it so
[58:29.600 --> 58:37.120]  so we need people to run for city council to run for water commissioners or to be on the
[58:37.120 --> 58:43.840]  water board we need good people to infest the entire structure of local government that's
[58:43.840 --> 58:50.240]  where you can get in that's where you can even keep your views quiet and slip in that's where
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.320]  you can you know they were always quiet and sneaky about being globalist and getting in
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.360]  now patriots are being sneaky and just telling the middle of the road and getting in and causing
[58:59.360 --> 59:05.360]  them all sorts of havoc oh yeah people are really getting smart out there so it's a process it's a

[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.840]  to you i called in last week to let you know that uh right after i witnessed 9 11 uh from my high
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.760]  school i went back to talk to some students uh to basically warrant them it was totally impromptu
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.400]  but uh i made it happen uh and after seeing such individuals as uh you know john connor yourself
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.240]  first of all i want to appreciate work due because uh you know for many years you know i
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.600]  thought i was crazy and i finally uh you know found the 9 11 truth movement and i'm proud of uh
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.920]  what we've been able to accomplish we're pushing them back well 84 percent of us are crazy and
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.200]  believe we're being lied to on 9 11 90 plus percent believe we're being lied to about kennedy we're
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.720]  all insane the government's good and loving and we should totally trust them yeah like i approached
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.840]  people uh commenters on the street and i talked to them about 9 11 and uh you know some really
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.400]  skeptical people will uh look at you and say what what kind of physics brought those towers on left
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.040]  wing physics and i'm like no sir i'm not a liberal oh yeah see see this is a left right
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.600]  paradigm it shifts off thinking oh you're you're pro gun you're liberal you're one of those right
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.240]  wing republicans one time i got told you know we got a compromise on the second amendment everything
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:52.240]  is left right and if you don't like to talk about the issues anymore they just uh attack at hominem
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.160]  they attack the character one fellow i talked to you last night made the point that they just
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.440]  he works in retail and he says that two generations of adults and their children
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.760]  because the retail store is across the street from a high school can't even count change
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.080]  they just push a pile of change towards you and and then and then he says well can't you
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:20.080]  count they say no and then adults can't count now and people are taught don't think just show up
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:27.760]  up just go to the football game just just wear what we say where now you've got that general group
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.400]  who's completely dumbed down doesn't know how anything works has no idea doesn't care they're
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.000]  thinking about their next uh thrill you know satiating their bestial level and then you've
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.840]  got a huge group of people that are waking up and getting smarter and more informed every day
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:48.640]  so it's it's a clash of civilizations i was well received at the high school i just wanted to let
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.600]  you know that the a lot of the kids were thankful they were grateful that they had someone actually
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.360]  come in and talk to them about this because let me get this right you're a graduate who then came
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.960]  back and spoke to school yes that's correct uh in my sophomore year of high school um and
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.080]  of course everyone remembers what they were that particular day i was in a room on the fourth floor
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:13.280]  the top level of my high school and uh i had witnessed you know basically that i heard the
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.680]  rumbling of the twin towers and i was like what did they just blow them up like a they just demolished
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.680]  the towers i mean people are so dumbed down that on tv you got you just said you just said that you
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.880]  uh were well received though oh yes most definitely but i mean the initial reactions the nation's
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.480]  initial reactions in 9-11 was so embarrassing you've got commentators on tv saying oh look the
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.440]  building collapsed when it's still not fully demolished it's still coming down you know
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.000]  symmetrically peeling away like a banana which only explosives can do and then you know people
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.440]  don't recognize the coup d'etat when it happens i mean i hear you i hear you we got a break thank

[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.960]  michael revero is our guest in this hour we have also a lot of folks holding online talk
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.840]  about any issue you wish you might can chime in on it because like info wars dot com what really

[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:19.040]  linking to important stories on the economy the war the police state the irs you name it
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.160]  mike so much has happened since we talked to you last month tell the listeners some of the
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:29.760]  things you think that are most important right now that you'd like to go over well i think it
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:36.880]  is very obvious at this point that we're headed into an invasion of iran and it is i think a
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:44.160]  little bit of a shock to a lot of americans how very much it is clear that president bush is
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.160]  simply not paying attention to his own experts his own advisors about the potential negative
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.080]  consequences of such an invasion and more to the point especially after the change of congress
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:02.240]  last november i think a lot of americans were expecting that the new incoming congress would
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.760]  basically obey the mandate the very obvious anti-war pro-peace mandate with which they were
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.120]  sent into office and yet we're seeing the congress especially the new democrats apparently just
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:20.720]  roll right over on this issue of the war in iran and we're seeing a lot of tough talk about iraq
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.480]  coming from the the presidential candidates and it does appear to be nothing more than talk
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.120]  because it's an important point to keep in mind congress has all the legal authority it needs to
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:38.960]  stop these wars dead in their tracks and yet congress is doing symbolic gestures around
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:45.120]  you've been doing that yesterday the republicans were able to even block discussion of a non-binding
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:52.080]  symbolic anti iraq war resolution and keep that from the floor all of the candidates including
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:00.000]  clinton and obama and edwards while they are very critical about our current situation in iraq
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.960]  they are not showing any indication that they are opposed to the coming invasion of iran
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.520]  we're continuing to see such a huge military build-up in there just a few days ago destroyers
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:18.880]  from right here in hawaii at pearl harbor were deployed to support the uss reagan so nobody
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.720]  sends this amount of hardware into a part of the globe without intending to use it and this
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.520]  does mimic the military build-up we saw in the region prior to the invasion of iraq
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:36.560]  so uh the war in iran is on they're just looking for an excuse that could be a false flag government
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.120]  sponsored terror event it could be quote a engineered accident you have the majority of
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:49.120]  the troops 70 plus percent wanting to come home you've got to 78 percent of americans in major
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:56.080]  polls repeatedly not wanting this war and instead bush just boost troops it's like rick perry in
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.800]  texas with a live cancer virus there is no law he just lies and says there's a law
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:09.040]  and says you've got to take a live cancer virus i mean why are we seeing just wanton abandoned
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.160]  where the government says we don't care what you want we don't care what's what's constitutional
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.440]  we're just going to be lawless basically well what we're seeing here is a government that is
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.560]  clearly more concerned with the agenda of a foreign government than with the american people and i
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.480]  think he is very telling as we watch the candidates for the 2008 presidential race line up the very
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.880]  first thing they do is go over to israel and stand up there and say we will back israel and we will
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.800]  do this and we will do that and we're not even seeing that kind of uh electioneering here among
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:50.480]  the american voters so it's very alarming that despite the uh the despite scandal apac is continuing
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.080]  to shake the american government for the benefit of israel and well it may have been denied that
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.840]  the first place they go is to apac meetings that at the marriott there in the time square the first
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.920]  place they go is israel and they just openly say you're our bosses tell us what to do i mean this
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.640]  is pathetic it is it is pathetic it's dangerous it's what got charles the first two trouble
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.600]  with its people and uh i think ultimately we're going to be headed to the same kind of an upset
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.680]  here uh which i don't like i don't condone or encourage violence but at this particular point
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.320]  i keep thinking about that quote that john and robert kennedy always used to say which is when
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.840]  peaceful revolution becomes impossible violent revolution becomes inevitable and i you know
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.680]  i i don't see any way to avoid it at this point now nothing happens at the oil companies and the
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.240]  big banks don't want and they're more than happy to have the u.s. military and israeli military
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:52.640]  uh nuke iran attack their entire military infrastructure and that's the admitted plan
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:14:00.560]  not strategic surgical strikes but um john edwards was on meet the press this weekend
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.680]  he did say now the european bankers are upset i mean i don't think that was a slip up do you
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.760]  really think that there is a split now between the new world order well i think what we're
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.880]  seeing in all of these events is there are multiple overlapping factions with multiple
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.480]  overlapping agendas and certainly anytime you're talking about one country invading another
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.640]  not all of the financial interests in the world are going to be that pleased with it
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:35.120]  um the other possible reason behind the comment is that most expert analysts are saying that
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:41.440]  an invasion of iran when iraq is already such a disaster is likely to fail it is likely to have
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:47.840]  a very negative backlash uh the european bankers may be seeing this invasion of iran as effectively
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.560]  raising on a busted flush it doesn't matter how hard they play it's not going to come out the
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.880]  way that they want it to and that's probably going to generate a lot of criticism right now
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.320]  so let's be clear about the the european branch once more once globalization
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.760]  once domination wants to seize those oil supplies to then artificially jack up the price of the
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  peak oil scam we know that they have the same goals there's just arguments about how to carry out
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.080]  the program how to implement the overall agenda but here we are michael revero waiting for the
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.520]  other shoe to drop the people don't want it it's going to cause a worldwide recession at the bare
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.920]  minimum it's going to shut down many of those central waterways in the middle east it's going
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.720]  to cause gas prices um conservative reports are saying to triple i mean this for the average person
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:49.440]  is going to be bad uh we really have a 97 trillion dollar debt obligation it's uh 4.9 trillion per
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:56.240]  year right now but if you count everything that we actually owe it's close to 100 trillion dollars
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.200]  that 97 trillion dollar numbers from last year and of course so it's grown now to actually over 100
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.880]  trillion but that's that's been in official governmental accounting office reports and
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.840]  then bush and the media come out to say we got a 240 million dollar deficit that's what we owe
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.640]  each day that's what's owed right now you want to talk about what this could do financially
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.960]  oh absolutely the uh the u.s. is over uh over leveraged and overextended but before i get back
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.120]  to i want to go back to something that you were just saying before about how the european bankers
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.360]  in the new world order want certain things but you also need to remember what they don't want and
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.880]  what they don't want is a massive failure that is going to basically rip the cover off the whole
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.080]  the whole mechanism uh of what's going on and if but you know we're looking at tony blair
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.720]  may take a major fall over the cash for honors scandal and i've uh written many times that
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.560]  tony blair is george bush's mind canary in other words when blair goes down bush will know that
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.080]  he himself is in immediate danger if bush goes down and the u.s. government suffers a major
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:06.640]  constitutional crisis a lot of hidden agendas and uh influence is going to be exposed we're
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.160]  already seeing it with apex influence on our our government being exposed and becoming very common
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.280]  knowledge that's the last thing that they really want so i think a lot of this hesitation to go
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.160]  into iran are a lot of people saying you know we we probably ought to like to stand out where we are
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.960]  right now rather than risk losing everything if it all comes unraveled in a botched invasion of iran
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:35.680]  now getting away from that back to this uh financial leverage situation uh yes there is no
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.600]  question that the united states government is in serious financial trouble and has been for a great
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.960]  many years going back to the rake and president but that's by the god and so that the globalist
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.360]  can create a financial situation where everyone's in debt they then control the currency and they
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.960]  get to come in and buy it all up the pennies on the dollar or even cheaper yeah and this game has
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.400]  been played with a lot of other countries and and now they're playing it uh with ours and if you go
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:07.600]  back again to the reagan presidency and and the the elder bush presidency followed it those years
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.600]  saw two phenomenon one was the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle to the upper classes in
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.800]  our nation's history and second the u.s went from being the world's largest creditor nation
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.760]  to the world's largest debtor nation and most of that money that was borrowed was borrowed
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.360]  to fund the star wars uh missile defense program which of course went nowhere but it did create
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.600]  the beginnings of this huge debt machine that uh you know basically has reached the point where no
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:42.000]  matter how hard we all work and how much we all pay the debt simply cannot be paid off and i think
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.120]  we're at a point right now where most americans are starting to wonder why should we go on slaving
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.320]  away literally giving half of everything we ever make to the government when it's a hopeless case
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:58.320]  anyway and uh you know that maybe the u.s government should go the same way as the ussr did
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.680]  and simply collapse and take its bad debts with it so that we all get uh you know a clean start
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.720]  because especially in a country with massive election fraud like we have it's very hard to sell
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.120]  the american citizens that they are really obligated to pay the debts run up by a government that
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.480]  may not have even been legally elected michael revero i think in the final analysis it comes
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:27.440]  down to this the elites and their management uh cultures their their their management guilds
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:34.080]  know everything spiraling out of control know that everything is driving towards crises and
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:40.560]  implosion and they'd rather set off the implosion themselves to at least have some semblance of
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:44.960]  control and so that's why you have the fema camps and that's why you have the open borders and
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.880]  that's why you have uh just the out of control spending it's like when you spray cockroaches
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.080]  with poison they start fornicating uh i mean really i think that all of this so-called
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:04.240]  arrogance and and and a plum and hoots barb whatever you want to call it is is really the death
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.640]  nail um i would agree we're seeing a lot of thrashing uh we're seeing a very high economic
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.760]  fever uh in all this deficit spending but the bottom line is there is nobody that looks at
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.360]  the current situation says things can continue as they are just fine for any protracted amount of
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.960]  time the longer it continues the worse the crash will be michael revero stay there more

[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.320]  behind this is the union of church and states nullifying our first amendment americans will

[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.680]  in 2005 president bush signed the real id act which goes into effect may 11 2008 many people
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.920]  believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.400]  which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of revelations 13 17 in revelations 14 9 speaking
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:14.880]  of the mark of the beast it says if any man worship the beast take notice it says worship the beast

[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:12.400]  welcome back my beloved is our guest your calls are coming up in the next segment also for about
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:20.560]  10 minutes we're going to have robert watata on the father of lieutenant watata who had already
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.760]  been in the military already been overseas and he said look i'm not going to be part of this criminal
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.240]  war and they said that's it we're court marshaling you so that's coming up uh michael revere also
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.720]  you've got a new show here on genesis that's doing quite well a lot of folks are tuning into it tell
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.440]  the listeners about that uh well let's see what really happened radio show it is on saturday mornings
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.800]  at 11 am central time you can listen to it over the gcn live website or you can visit the archive
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.080]  and pick up some of the shows and we're going to be covering the looming war in iran on this saturday
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.200]  show and certainly we'll be paying a great deal of attention to the influence that apac seems to
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:03.280]  have over the uh decision to go to wars in the united states now this is a conditioning process
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:09.680]  and i've been saying this since before the iraq war because pina told us so that they were just
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.080]  going to get into iraq and use that as a beachhead to go into iran and syria and then sew up the
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:20.160]  entire region and then balkan eyes and turn people along sectarian and religious lines suni
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.800]  um occurred against each other and now all that's happened wow they told us they do it
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.440]  man i got a crystal ball i don't know how to read uh everything they've said they'll do they actually
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.280]  do then they have their public pronouncements that are total lies you want to know what they're
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.160]  really doing just just turn it around backwards and more often than not that's the answer but
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.880]  mike it's a conditioning process i almost just expect okay when's the war when's the attack
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.680]  gonna happen because for two years they've been beating the drums to attack iran or longer
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:53.520]  and at a certain point it it it conditions us that it's almost a foregone conclusion
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.800]  and they did that with iraq for stringing it out for what two and a half years and of course even
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.640]  before bush got in office with clinton can you comment on that process well i think it's a
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.440]  propagandistic court it basically just get everybody so used to the idea that it's coming
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:16.480]  that when it finally happens that uh the anger and outrage is kept to an absolute minimum uh it is
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:23.680]  entirely possible that in their arrogance and hubris that uh israel and or the united states
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.320]  may simply attack iran without needing or feeling that they need any kind of a justifying cause
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.840]  certainly the u.s. is continuing to wave around uh february 21st and the end of the u.n. deadline
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.480]  uh as a major flag for a reason to invade iran but if israel couldn't even uh take southern
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.440]  lebanon uh what are they going to do with iran i mean what's you've been studying this what you
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.320]  give us your take on the the mindset of those currently in control i mean what are you going
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.920]  to say that uh well they know they can't win a ground war so they're just going to start
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:04.320]  heavy bombardments with conventional and nukes yeah that's exactly if israel wants to start
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.560]  this war all they have to do is fly over iran and start dropping bombs and then fly back to israel
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.840]  now if you look at the map of the region you know where does iran have to march through to counter
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.280]  attack retaliate against israel through right through iraq and all of our american men and women
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.840]  in uniform sitting there in the region and then they're going to get overwhelmed and overrun and
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.720]  oh my gosh we're getting beat and so now we got to have a draft in 500 thousands and americans can't
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:36.640]  get whooped and it's world war three yeah very much so the the potential for this situation to
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.480]  spiral out of control into a major global war was designed to be designed to spiral out of control
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:49.440]  as dr paul greg roberts yourself and many other analysts have said yeah very much so and the idea
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:56.640]  is that uh you know we're we're all the whole world right now is held hostage to whichever world
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.720]  leader is the least mentally stable and that's not a pleasant thought it's going to keep you up late
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.040]  at night because they're so confident with all these yes men and mistresses and living in ivory
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.800]  towers that they think they can manage this crisis absolutely one of the problems that we have is
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.640]  is there are so many levels of mid-management surrounding these these key decision makers
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.880]  they're really cut off from what's going on some of the statements that we have seen come out of
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:27.200]  washington dc and especially the white house seem almost absurd but they make a lot more sense if
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.960]  you realize that the people making them don't understand how much the american people have
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:38.800]  come to understand about what's going on well exactly how much they were lied to i mean it's
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:44.400]  almost insulting that bush and his people are continuing to use oh nuclear threat nuclear
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.600]  threat as a reason to go to war with iran as if they don't understand that the americans know
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:56.080]  they were like they just replaced a k they just replaced a k with an n with a propaganda yeah
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.880]  absolutely absolutely and uh... it's uh... like i said it's an insult they think that the same
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.760]  lines are going to work twice in a row uh... and they don't understand it's not working and to me
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.800]  it signals that we have a government that really is as much as they are embedded with apac and the
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.080]  israeli government they're totally cut off from what the americans uh... are are are thinking
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:25.760]  you stay here gotta break michael revero stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.560]  was started yesterday and this is your morning it was mostly uh arguments that uh eric site
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.960]  attorney put forth in terms of trying to um get the different witnesses on the stand but
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:10.240]  he was denied at every single stand uh every single person because of that person was going
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.120]  to talk about the the constitution they were going to talk about uh international law they
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.920]  were going to talk about what was going on in iraq the across the piece and uh they were all
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.560]  denied in other words the government here the army doesn't want to uh have any information
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:33.840]  that even hints to the fact that there might be uh an illegal invasion or an immoral occupation
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:41.680]  going on in in iraq after that uh they're going after your son saying that he basically bad mouth
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.520]  fell presidenta well he said that the president was deceptive and the military found those words
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.680]  to be offensive and he said that there are consequences going on in iraq and the military
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:59.360]  said that's offensive well people have gone to prison well i mean let me just add people
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.400]  have gone to prison for raping and killing innocent people abu gaib all of that is public
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.720]  it's public to the president lied to us to war michael revero you've got some questions
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.640]  there are comments for robert wattata joining us well bob and i have already talked about this
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.800]  a lot of times uh as bob's been interviewed on my show and i did a very nice youtube video of him
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.080]  that uh that is up there right now but i wanted to uh respond to a comment that was in the news
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:32.480]  coverage of the court marshal just today where one of the presiding charges said uh judges said
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.480]  there needs to be a limit on dissent in the military and my response to that would be
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.280]  where in the constitution of the united states of america which we all acknowledges the supreme
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:49.360]  law of the land doesn't say that people serving in the military may not avail themselves of the same
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.680]  rights and freedoms as ordinary citizens because if you look through the constitution it is not
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.240]  there so erin wattata does have a right to speak his mind and voice his opinion uh you know when
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.720]  he's he's not in formation when he's just uh you know out there socializing with other people he has
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:12.720]  as much right to voice his opinion as any other citizen in the united states now with regard to
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:19.600]  the illegal war the reason that the u.s. government is trying very hard to keep issues of the legality
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.840]  out of the courtroom is they can't defeat that argument because the u.s. has signed the geneva
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.600]  accords and under the constitution treaty obligations are the supreme law of the land
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.200]  and by the way under a soldier's court officer is even at a higher standards oath when they're
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.240]  sworn in uh to serve in the armed forces they have to say no to unlawful or illegal orders
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:52.880]  they have to say no to serve under a uh dictator and uh and i think this judge has prejudiced
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.280]  himself by coming out and saying they basically you know need to shut down dissent mr. wattata again
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:05.920]  the father of erin wattata would you comment on that for us well no they make up their own rules
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.440]  um they make up the rules to say that the actually the military can do anything they want to and you
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:18.320]  have to follow their orders um that's flat out wrong that's flat out wrong you know we have
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:23.600]  in our democracy we have to be and we have to have people say that things are going wrong
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:30.000]  we have to have soldiers say something is wrong um if you don't you're going to have
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.360]  you know a total total military dictatorship and that's something we cannot have how long
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:42.800]  until this uh court marshal plays itself out uh robert wattata uh it's expected to end in about
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:49.120]  thursday or friday of this week i think what's going to happen uh today is that the uh prosecution
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.440]  has got a protest case and then wednesday the defense of the protest case and then either
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.200]  thursday or friday they'll go into sentencing and that's where we'll be able to put in some
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:03.600]  arguments about why erin took the stand that he did well i tell you they're going to make a martyr
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.680]  out of him and they send him to the brig but he's he's ready to go isn't he he's ready to go he said
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:17.120]  that he said if that's what it takes to stop the killing then he'll do that um because what is going
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.040]  on as you said in iraq is just so wrong so terribly wrong uh killing innocent men women and children
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:29.600]  the plundering the torture the rape it's just wrong and we as a country cannot allow that to
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.840]  continue you know it just came out in major british papers that what we already knew
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.000]  ramah governor and others are on records and clearly our government the british and israelis
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  are staging terror attacks uh in iraq well now they caught a special forces group of british
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.600]  that are actually recruiting insurgents to carry out attacks i mean they want that place to be a
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.880]  civil war as a pretext to stay there gentlemen you want to comment on that well of course well
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.600]  i think they they shoot the sunnis and bring the shiites they they now have the courage going in
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:06.720]  there to fight the sir uh sunnis they want they want this civil war to go on absolutely that is
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:13.920]  a pretext for getting a hold of the oil exactly uh michael rogero uh well i think that the strategy
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.520]  is the u.s realized they couldn't uh deal with a united iraq they couldn't defeat a united iraq
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.240]  so they're just tricking the iraqis into killing each other off just to prevent them from uniting
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:29.200]  against the invader and it's a divide and conquer all over again and yes it's a pretext to conquer
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.800]  the oil it's a pretext to establish the beachhead uh for a wider war yeah the permanent bases and
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.320]  it's in the p-nag documents it's in the p2o g documents we know that brazil's he calls it the
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.480]  global Balkans and so feeding our troops in is just a pretext to stay there and keep the war
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:53.920]  going it's needless killing of iraqis and our troops mr watata comments that's exactly what i'm
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:41:00.480]  i've been saying is that there is really no need for us to be there other than for the um you know
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.600]  the the corporate greed of the oil burns wanting to get all hold the oil not for us but so that
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:12.240]  they can increase the prices and make larger profits and michael rogero what does israel
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:18.240]  get out of this i mean uh they don't want to deal with these nations they want to obliterate them
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:24.080]  well i mean is that all israel gets out of it no israel also gets access to oil because for
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.400]  for the longest time when the shop around was was still in control there uh there was a huge pipeline
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.520]  that went all the way across the mid-eastern wound up at hypha which was used as a shipping terminal
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.040]  and israel was basically able to take out all of its oil needs from that pipeline
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  and rebuilding that in iraq yeah they have been rebuilding it and you know israel is securing
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.520]  their access to oil in the region uh as well the other part of it of course is israel seeking to
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:58.000]  expand its territory uh and to basically render its neighboring nations incapable of resisting
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.320]  although as you point out last summer's war in lebanon was definitely an eye opener
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:10.320]  for the reality of israel's uh war fighting machine robert uh what are your son uh
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:18.240]  erin's spirit's like right now you know he's very strong um he continues to get a lot of support
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.480]  for supporters right here at fort lewis they're all telling him that you know thank you very much
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.960]  for doing this for us uh because it's the same thing that they want to do but you know they've
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.560]  got families and other things to be concerned about but they're really thankful that erin is
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:39.520]  taking the stand and they're hoping that he's taking this stand publicly will bring the war
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:47.280]  to uh uh close much sooner amazing uh they they threatened him didn't they that if he didn't shut
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:54.240]  his mouth before the trial they would just keep putting more charges on him uh and tell us about
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.160]  that they want they wanted to shut up they don't want him to say anything about what is going on
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:06.480]  in iraq but of course we all know what's going on in iraq now so we we should know by thursday
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:12.720]  or friday yes we should know by third year friday so hopefully maybe next week we can get back to
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.880]  talk to you again and again just to be clear and we're going to let you guys who know you're very
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:25.360]  busy um this whole process why did your son decide to say no i'm not going to iraq i mean what
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.600]  you told us last time it was just talking to those that had come back about how evil it was
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:36.000]  is is is that accurate to say well that's part of it of course he did his own research and he found
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.520]  out that there was not only deception but clearly lying by the commander not your boss lied to you
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.400]  and put you out on the line uh so that you can get killed what would you do you know you're
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:51.600]  sure you're not going to walk out there and this is what erin is saying hey look our commander lied
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:57.760]  and he's lying to the people and uh you know we the soldiers cannot go out there and put our
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:05.680]  light uh lies at risk for for the oil barons well we should all pray for your son we'll pray for you
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.840]  and your family as well it's thank you lt.org thank you lieutenant that or g we've got links to it
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.000]  up on info wars.com i know you're very busy but i'd like double to get you up for a five
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.240]  ten minute report in the aftermath thursday or friday sir okay thank you very much and uh thanks
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:28.480]  to michael also thank you bye now take care thank you bob good luck i wanted to get that update from
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:34.560]  him any any other closing comments on that subject before we go to some calls mike uh yeah basically
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.800]  one of the points that the court martial is trying to make is that it is up to the president to
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.840]  determine if a war is legal or not but that absolutely flies in the face of common sense
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:48.240]  because when hitler was ordering his troops to do all that they did he never stopped and said by the
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.920]  way what you're about to do is illegal in a crime but i want you to do it anyway so the oath to
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:59.360]  refuse an immoral or illegal order carries with it the implicit understanding that it is up to the
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.960]  soldier or officer to make that determination for themselves i just thought of another key facet
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:11.040]  to all of this remember two years ago a private interrogator hired and ordered to torture people
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:18.160]  tortured some people uh at bogrom airbase uh to death and there were cases in afghanistan similar
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.720]  cases in iraq and when he brought forward the documents that he was ordered to do it they
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.840]  used the patriot act to gag him we know that they ordered the individuals at abu graheb and the
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.000]  camp x-ray and other places to torture people that's now come out in the white house consolis
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.320]  and john ewin presidential memos but then the presidency uh basically ordered the pentagon
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.960]  to send people who followed criminal orders and i agree they're culpable but not as culpable as the
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.680]  mafia don that sent them out to do the crimes so another thing these troops need to know if you
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:53.600]  get caught doing this illegal stuff you're going to go to prison yeah there there is no loyalty
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:59.120]  coming back down that uh that chain of command absolutely not it's unbelievable i mean they
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.040]  were ordered to do that torture and then they send the people to prison that did it when they get
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.320]  caught i mean that is and then the president says we don't torture when there's a hundred speeches
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.440]  with him and his minions saying we torture well you need to look back about two years before all
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.520]  this started when the u.s was going to all these other countries and saying we want to be exempted
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:23.200]  from war crimes prosecution at the age they were pushing real hard for that and at the time my theory
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.520]  was if they're trying to get immunity from war crimes it's because they're planning to commit some
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:34.560]  crime no kidding uh i remember just months after 9 11 there was a cia section chief from the middle
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.280]  east in the washington post i put it in my film wrote the tyranny screenshot of it saying uh we
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.720]  aren't just torturing uh quote insurgents we're torturing their family members uh in front of
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:55.200]  them in third party countries like jordan and uh egypt and then now of course all that came out
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:02.160]  well yeah so this is just off the charts evil uh let's take calls here john and texas go ahead
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:02.880]  thanks for holding
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:12.640]  okay he's not there uh sean in mass you're on the air go ahead hey alex how's it going thanks
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.720]  for holding what's on your mind well i'm from uh bursary 9 11 truth up here in great barrenson
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:23.280]  mass and uh governor kane came to the local high school last night to speak and um we kind of embarrassed
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:29.840]  him uh i got thrown out immediately for coming in with the the sign that said white wash on it
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.560]  and um by the police because they wouldn't stand the free speech zone and they didn't appreciate
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:41.520]  the sign and uh then some people from our group um waited for him to start speaking and then got up
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.080]  and started yelling cover up cover up cover up and then they were escorted out so you know by the
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:55.840]  way everywhere keen goes the head of the whitewash commission that happens mike yeah it's uh it's
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.600]  important for people to continue to do this because uh yes you will get escorted out you'll be told you
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.800]  have to stay in the free speech zone but it does wreck that illusion that the government is trying
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.200]  to maintain that only a few people doubt the official story about 9 11 and how we got into the
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.320]  wars in iraq so when everybody is standing up uh at every speech and yelling bovine excrement
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.280]  for something similar at the people who are speaking it's getting to be a public embarrassment
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:28.320]  and pretty soon they're going to realize they have utterly failed to control uh the flow of
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:33.440]  information well she hand with with with with that one demonstration right after the democrats
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.080]  got in and didn't bring the war up or getting the troops out they you know they shut that press
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.120]  conference down and that got massive headlines and really illustrated to the democratic constituency
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.280]  that they've been sold out i mean i think that's one of the biggest stories is the fact that how
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.560]  utterly the democrats sold out they were already bought and paid for so i guess they didn't
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.400]  didn't sell out they were already on the payroll uh but you know some of the democrats i know have
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:04.320]  now gone back to sleep they think everything's fine world war three is about to start you know
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.880]  sometimes wonder about those congressional staffers that work in their office if these people are
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.360]  really doing their job to keep the congressman informed about what's going on or in fact those
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.720]  staffers are part of the problem and their their their real goal is to keep the congressman just
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.440]  sort of happy and and contented and taken care of and pampered so that they're not likely to get
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.120]  in the way of what's really going to happen well congressman written books about that a lot of
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.880]  the chief staffers are more powerful than the congresspeople and they're there being paid off
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.760]  of a lobbyist to wrap the legislation yeah absolutely and of course the uh getting back
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.880]  to the lobbies gets all the way back to that apex situation which donates millions of dollars to
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:46.320]  congressional candidates and carries with it that threat that if you don't tell the israeli line
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.800]  we will fund your opponent next election and you will be out of a job and that is why we have lost
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.280]  control of our country and if we don't get it back we're going to spend the rest of our lives
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.800]  fighting wars against israel's enemies shan you've got the last minute and a half here before we
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:05.680]  got a break and come back and take more calls anything else no that was all i'll take them here

[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:38.160]  media the governor and the whole country's media just lying uh let's go back to chris in florida
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:44.320]  finish up your point sir about black water and private mercs yes this is this is ch in florida
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:51.040]  alex and uh i was just i had seen author Jeremy scatio on a free speech tv and he was talking
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:56.560]  about his new book black water the rise of the world's most powerful mercenary army and he used
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.320]  that term the book was his private praetorian guard i mean this is such pure evil and i was just
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:06.720]  a calling to uh suggest him as a guest in the future and wondering if you've had him on as a
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.720]  guest in the past that's all yeah i might do that i've heard of him thanks for the call michael
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:20.160]  revero comments on the rise of mercs well the the danger there for uh americans is that private
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:25.920]  security is not held to the same standards of conduct as civil police or or even the military
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.960]  and it also gives uh the controlling authority a certain amount of deniability oh we didn't
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.560]  order those people to go in and burn down that church for the women and children they just
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:38.640]  got carried away and we're going to terminate their contract just to teach them a lesson
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:44.320]  and so it basically allows these kind of impressions or other repressions to continue
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.080]  with impunity and i think this is a real threat to the civil liberties of america
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:56.960]  well not only do we see a shift to mercs and a shift to private police now we also see 20%
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.760]  of the ground force in iraq not even being american citizens a major announcement to increase the
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:07.520]  recruitment from the philippines to mexico i mean this is all the classical signs of a
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:17.440]  very degenerate empire very much so and of course all of these uh uh uh uh non non citizens
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:23.280]  who are being recruited uh does two things first of all i think that it allows the governments
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:30.640]  more easily concealed the true numbers of uh of combat deaths uh in iraq which uh again we saw
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.040]  this during vietnam we didn't really find out how many americans had died in the war until after
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:41.360]  it was already over well they were dying from 59 to 64 before they met it more official and that
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:47.120]  was what like 7 000 troops died they kept that many secret yeah they absolutely did add the the
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:52.320]  real numbers did not become known until enough people had been killed that the family started
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.280]  networking and knew each other and said well if we all have lost somebody then obviously the
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.120]  numbers can't be right i mean is that a free country is that a good government where they've
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:06.720]  been lying to us this long and i mean how do we just accept lying by both parties like it's okay
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:12.560]  well i certainly don't accept it that's the whole reason for my website and for radio shows like
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:17.520]  yours uh my opinion is that since the constitution does not allow the government to lie to us
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:22.960]  that a government that lies is illegal and unconstitutional and that we are obligated as
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:30.400]  citizens to refuse to obey its dictates or even to pay its bills absolutely we're going to break
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.680]  here and have a final segment with you Michael Rivera will go to uh steven texas taught in
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:40.880]  Ohio and chris and texas i got john and california and many others but we do have nancy quarantine

[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.440]  so many other things happening uh it's just it makes the head spin and to and to witness this
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:57.120]  level of corruption and both parties colluding it's something's got to give sometime doesn't
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:02.480]  like yeah i think there's a crisis coming somewhere i don't know exactly where or when
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:08.000]  but it's nonsense to think that that things are going to continue as they are for any great amount
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.800]  of time we'll be right back with a third hour this broadcast is available on mp3 cd format

[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:30.480]  than any gravity filter element on the market these awesome elements are used in burky purification
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:35.840]  systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems they can purify
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:41.680]  raw untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria cysts parasites trihalomethane and
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:47.920]  chemicals such as chlorine atrazine styrene and mtbe these elements also reduce unwanted heavy

[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:04.880]  more economical than the standard disposable elements providing fresh pure water for less than

[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:28.720]  area there that was really cool um regarding iran uh and these what three battle groups are going
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:35.520]  over there now well there's there's four different naval task forces two mainline carriers and then
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:42.080]  two coronado class uh many aircraft carriers mike is that accurate i'm going from memory no that's
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.720]  that pretty much accurate uh they're they're considered assault craft they're they're short
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.920]  aircraft carrier decks but they also have uh deployment facilities for uh things like
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:59.440]  hovercraft and landing craft i've got a question um well a comment a question um i'm thinking about
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.040]  you know back to pearl harbor when they pulled all the aircraft carriers out of there and left
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:09.840]  those old ships to get bombed um i'm thinking with you know all this information about the sunburn
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:19.200]  missiles that uh iran has that uh i keep seeing all these um websites military websites that
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:28.080]  uh let's say that the sunburn can can go through uh the uh ship defenses yeah what happens if uh
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:34.560]  aircraft carrier and a couple support ships get hit by a bunch of sunburns uh or or silkworms and
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.480]  you know all these different arsenals uh then we're off the races of the uss main the lucetania
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:47.040]  the gulf of thomkin the uss liberty mike yeah very much uh a lot of people are saying that uh
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.360]  the thinking of an american warship uh would be the justification to declare war and go into iran
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:59.120]  that's another one of the scenarios that's been discussed and along with the uh the the various
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:05.520]  missiles of course iran is reported to have a russian development called the underwater rocket
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:12.560]  and this is a rocket powered torpedo that puts a heap of bubbles in the water around itself
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:19.920]  to cut friction and it's amazingly fast uh and our our current defenses can't really work against it
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.680]  so if a submarine were to get close to the us fleet and sink a ship that could very easily
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:30.960]  be blamed on iran as well can you imagine the news images of an aircraft carrier on fire with its
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:38.240]  magazine exploding it would be a very spectacular news footage and it would be waved all over so
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:43.200]  i'm very worried about all of our people we have in the region on those ships uh i actually have
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:49.760]  family on one of the destroyers that just departed hawaii for to support the reagan so uh you know
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:54.640]  we're concerned yeah thank you for the call i will give the other callers later michael vero

[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.720]  uh in the early 1990s he and others were involved in founding some of the first
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:56.080]  patria radio programs and networks and i learned a lot from mark quarantine i was doing a local
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:02.400]  show here weeknights uh and had mark and others on uh as guest and then i got hooked up with a
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.240]  little network that they were on and reached a lot of people and that really over time grew into
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:16.960]  what you hear and see uh today with our work and mark got set up uh with a uh little minion of the
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:22.480]  of the adl coming to his house threatening people they basically just from the story pushed him off
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:27.840]  the the steps of the house had to get out of here then the police came after mark someone told mark
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:34.560]  where his location was and then later bragged about it uh and we still deal with that problem today
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:41.360]  today and uh mark uh then a year or so later and i have the squad car video and i just thought to
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:46.160]  get nancy on yesterday i called nancy i looked around last night i can't find it i know mike
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:51.120]  hanson who's out out in gonzalez right now has it but in the future we're gonna dig it out if i
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:55.440]  can't find it nancy will send it to me again that needs to be put on youtube but what am i talking
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:02.960]  about there is a little bank that mark bank said he goes he's on the surveillance camera dropping
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:10.000]  in their deposit he'd been moving furniture around he dropped off the rental truck got his car
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  had one of his sons in the car with him this has been years nancy can fill me into my memories
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:23.840]  failing and filling in the other details and then we have over an hour of squad car audio as the
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:31.200]  sheriff's deputy is told to uh that mark cornkey's driving down a certain road
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.840]  and to get behind mark cornkey then it came out that it was someone who looked nothing
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:41.280]  like mark on the tape who did come in and supposedly robbed the bank a massive setup
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:46.560]  same thing that happened uh to fritz spring mire they admitted later that mark had nothing to do
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:50.880]  with the bank robbery that he banked there isn't that interesting that right after he dropped
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.360]  something off somebody goes in and robs the bank and the police are saying mark cornkey mark cornkey
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:01.200]  when when he just put it in a in a in the in the side drop box this individual went in and robbed
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.960]  the bank and the sheriff's deputy and this would have been better today if i would have had this
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.520]  had been powerful to play it it's going well you don't think it's mark cornkey then why am i following
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:16.880]  him and they say go to cell phone you hear the sheriff and mark had his son with him and thought
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:23.040]  that it was some kind of setup so he basically uh sped away down the highway down some side roads
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.960]  so all they could have got him on was speeding or maybe reckless driving but it wasn't reckless
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.440]  he dropped his son off uh got him out of there then the police cars come up and start ramming
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:40.160]  his car this is all on tape mark is not ramming them they are ramming him he gets out of the car
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:46.960]  and uh runs out uh into a river trying to get away from them they draw beads down on him and they
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:53.840]  get it and with the squad car video but i played many times on local access television uh wild mark
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:59.120]  trial was going on he they ran him and then it's the same thing you see with abby newman
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.880]  uh that happened in 2000 and this in road to tyranny where she goes with checkpoint state
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:08.000]  police are searching everybody they say we want your lives as we want to search she says no
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.880]  they jerk her out she doesn't even resist she has her hands on her sides and they charge her with
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:18.000]  resisting arrest of course that got she got a jury trial and defeated it because we had the squad
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.800]  car video then they get in the back of her car and find pay for the games of the movie i mean
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:27.840]  harrison ford and i think that's terrorist they find a pock constitution they think that's terrorist
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.840]  they say it may be illegal they find a police state 2000 and say this this must be illegal i mean
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.280]  this is their mindset so just like she didn't do anything didn't even touch him they still charge
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:46.480]  her with that they ran mark he gets and he already had the other absconding uh conviction before
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:52.240]  not for pushing the guy off the porch who was menacing them and his family uh but for then
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:58.160]  absconding they said he ran from police and and and so we already had that then they get him again
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:03.120]  a guy with no record until that time and they ram him off the road and then they say he assaulted
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:09.760]  them with the car nancy is that accurate pretty much pretty much well i mean pretty much fill
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:15.520]  us in i mean i mean we have what happened to mark well yeah how far back do you want to go here
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:21.680]  but uh no he just said the name that he will not give to himself as whistleblower and that's
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:26.000]  something everybody needs to understand when he left the military he had information that was
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:33.520]  given to him not truly through regular channels that he wanted to investigate and to expose
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:38.800]  had he been briefed or debriefed properly he would not have been able to come forward about
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:46.720]  the concentration camps in the united states and that is the root of everything here um that that
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:53.520]  uh the individual he signed out uh came forward at that time to quote unquote help him with something
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:15:02.160]  else uh as far as this latest around well with the first incident with mr daner uh daner was
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:10.960]  working with tom wane uh another talk show host but a man working with the abl and came with a
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:17.520]  dead subpoena meaning it was no longer any good the guy had confessed and punched mark with it
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:25.280]  literally um by the grace of god you know we had people come forward that were there that
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:30.640]  were witness to it that uh so they had to drop that but they still got him on the absconding
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.280]  they still got him on the absconding but i had to be able to prove that and had he gone to court
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:40.320]  when it was scheduled we would not have been able to prove it and and that was the bottom line
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:46.560]  they had they didn't it wasn't even an acquittal it was they dropped the case the um the prosecutors
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:53.760]  against and they wanted them but wanted him to um go to a misdemeanor on that and he says i'm not
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:59.120]  going to do that because it's not there was no underlying charge this was the first case in the
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:06.000]  united states when an absconding charge was upheld when the underlying case was dropped first one
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.640]  ever and now that's more and more commonplace where the underlying charge is dropped but then
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:15.200]  that gets you with the stack okay it's like the divinians found not guilty of murder within the
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.320]  judge says i find you guilty of using firearms in the commission of murder how you found guilty
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  of using firearms in the commission of murder when you were found not guilty of murder exactly
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.560]  and that's judge waltry smith now without going into too much detail of course there can be some
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:35.040]  exposition written about this in the near future uh when mark and others uh you know get out certain
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:40.640]  individuals inside the organization there later was able to be confirmed had even blown the whistle
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.000]  on where mark was at that's my understanding of it and i and i believe that because i had had
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.680]  a bug planted in my car when i was when i was over in battle creek that i was followed back
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:17:00.240]  across the state and i've talked about that before on air um got in my car and got on the expressway
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:07.040]  and i was i wasn't going slow um a good 90 mile drive back here and i was followed all the way
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:14.160]  across the state um 67 miles behind me was the state police officer and the reason i know that
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:19.040]  is they had my cb on and i was listening to what the truckers were saying i was expecting to get
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:24.880]  pulled over anytime but uh that never happened they were just busy following me to see if i would
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:31.680]  lead them to whoever marked that and and then for the evidence you have uh well we're gonna get
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:36.640]  into that later it's just it's just unbelievable let's fast forward to running mark off the road
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.960]  and then charging him with running into them well that was that was again this was total set up uh
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:49.120]  the man that actually robbed the bank only served two years uh in a minimum security facility with
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:56.160]  a list of priors as long as your arm uh this gentleman too uh by the way he was tall bald
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:02.080]  white hair looked nothing like mark he was he was really scruffy uh how did the police know though
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.240]  let's be clear about this mark drops money in the dropbox leaves this guy what 20 minutes later
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.080]  robs it and then and then even the sheriff's deputy on tapes going well if it didn't mark
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:14.160]  cornkey why why are you saying it's marked if people are saying it's somebody else
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.920]  and they just said go to cell phone well what happened here is that the robbery took place
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:25.840]  20 minutes later mark shows up drops it out okay i got it backwards and and an officer
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:35.360]  that didn't like him okay because i think watch the uh oh goodness the text and by the way mark
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.920]  had been on the rate mark had been on the again i'm going from memory here yeah mark had been on
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:45.920]  the phone and telling people i'm going to make a deposit no uh but we had been under surveillance
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:56.000]  we know that i have the fbi um report as well as the book trust me it's a book uh almost 700 pages
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.640]  i just remember that mark thought there'd been surveillance and it was a setup it was it was
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:08.560]  absolutely um with the evidence that i have now from the different reports from the police officers
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:14.880]  from the fbi um and the other information that we have that he was under surveillance
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:20.560]  they were watching the house because we had rented a truck to move some furniture and that's all
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:25.680]  we need now you know that that's it you know after after the Oklahoma City bombing which we all
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:33.440]  know the farce and in the story that they raised with that but uh that's automatically as soon as
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:41.360]  i rented rented vehicle that they flag the name and immediately are contacted by the rental company
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:47.600]  as to we're renting a truck or and then to make a long story short when we get back
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:54.480]  what then happened to mark um well this this officer that fingered mark did not even wait
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:20:01.280]  for the dispatcher to give a description um i i had hired Richard mac he went through the
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:05.760]  tape and i called back the tone that tone is there to tell everybody to shut up and listen
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:10.880]  because the dispatcher is giving out the description well stay there let me let's go over it slowly
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:16.000]  here it's important but imagine the i got it backwards from seven years going back in memory
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.640]  20 minutes after it's robbed mark just walks up and drops money in the drop box the cop's
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:25.200]  for there he sees him gets his car drives off oh there's our bank robber making a night deposit

[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:54.640]  he named names and exposing exposing the big leagues out there that that were involved
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:01.280]  and in all that nonsense but uh and it really is nonsense when you look at it what where we're at
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:09.760]  today because of greed um where he was going with with that um this officer uh i think he's
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:17.120]  honestly two days prior there had been the um oh goodness um texas walker ranger program where they
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.560]  had the the militia was robbing banks i think that was going through his head i really do um
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:27.440]  saw mark fingered him he was nowhere near the bank he was ordered to go to the bank and check on
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:37.680]  the people and secure it did not do that went downtown um next door basically like three doors
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:42.880]  down from the bank and stopped at the dairy queen instead and asked the pastor by if they saw any
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:48.960]  but things strange and went from there to chase things mark and whipping everybody up into just
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:56.160]  the horrendous frenzy uh there were there were officers from the county all across the county
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:02.880]  that raced here with lights off at 120 miles an hour guesstimation by other officers who
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:09.280]  saw and complained were being run off the road by them um to get here to get a piece of him
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:15.280]  it was it was just and i guess they feel good the guy that robbed the bank went to prison no
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.960]  connection to mark uh mark goes to prison for me and run off the road by him that you know and
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:26.880]  that's the curious thing like i told you two years minimum minimum security prison this man went to
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:35.600]  with a list of priors and the minimum sentence in michigan for first time bank robbery is 15 years
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:44.240]  that's kind of a red flag to me right away um we i sent a gentleman that that was a a real estate
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:52.640]  agent in the area where the man was from uh a good 200 miles north of us um up in the grayling area
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:28:00.640]  and to check and check this guy out check the property out um you know imminent domain information
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:08.160]  find out who financed the house and all that well he got there he well i can check that online
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:13.600]  went in and it was blocked the information was blocked so he went in person down to the township
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:19.440]  office uh got there gave him the address that information's blocked now anywhere else in the
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:25.120]  country you can go and you can get the name of the owner the mortgage company how much is how
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.760]  much taxes they they owe and how much is left on the mortgage that's all information that anybody
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:37.840]  can get at any time and they blocked it but this man also happened to have been a former senator
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.960]  he pulled out his credentials like you want to tell me why you are telling me i can't have this
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.960]  and they just looked at him said it's blocked now that tells me one thing this is government
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:55.040]  owned property probably probably either an informant witness protection program or this man is working
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:29:02.720]  with with directed with fbica someone within the federal government um and and and nancy the exact
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:08.160]  same type of problems that you had up in michigan uh you you've heard about and know about the
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:13.040]  things we're dealing with down here at austin and well i told you about it you said it's exactly
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:20.320]  what you've seen before it is um with the email that i received there is nothing in that email
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:29.600]  that i have not seen in person before from from the person in question all of it even even down to
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:35.200]  the point of a weapon and pointing at somebody who was in the office that has happened here
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:43.040]  and it was one of the reasons he was asked to leak um you know he he went kicking and screaming
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:51.280]  but but did leave unfortunately you know other people did not believe us that these things were
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:59.040]  going on but he continues on in the same vein so he hasn't changed one iota and i just you know pray
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:05.680]  to everybody wakes up and gets on board and understands who this person is and what he's doing
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:12.080]  yeah it sits incredible it's just off the charts it's what mark would call standard operational
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:16.560]  procedures for this individual yeah the latest thing is going to people's houses we'll be right back

[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.800]  nancy cornkey mark is getting out of jail uh unless they try to set him up and he's had a
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:06.400]  lot of attempted setups in prison has he not in the last seven years uh he has had one major one
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:12.800]  they were really really fine um after 9 11 and as you know both you and mark predicted 9 11 would
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:19.280]  happen uh something big was there and it was going to happen pretty quick uh on the east coast and
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:27.040]  sure enough there we go um and then after that of course with anthrax there and as we all know the
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:31.280]  u.s government certainly didn't give any information on how if you got something like that in the mail
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:40.640]  and personally at your home what to do uh neither did the red cross however the volumes and volumes
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:46.480]  of information available through the military if you've been prior military well with mark
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:54.640]  if you know being in the military part of his training uh he was a trainer for mbc the nuclear
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:00.240]  biological and chemical warfare so what happened well people started writing him in prison asking
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:06.400]  what do we do how do we decontaminate um what procedures what do we need so he made a list
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:13.280]  of different things necessary to decontaminate yourself decontaminate your home vehicle whatever
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:23.440]  from nuclear biological or chemical attacks and that included leach um antibacterial soap
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.440]  and laundry detergent but to make a long story short what are they claiming they're trying to
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:35.840]  build a bomb a bomb they they claimed he was trying to build a bomb and you know i i didn't
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.040]  know what it was initially i think swat teams pull people over off the news chopper and after
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:46.240]  they swat team them for a reason they hold up jumper cables and say look pipe bombs yeah i mean
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:51.120]  they'd probably take a can of spaghetti sauce and say it was a nuclear weapon but it was a
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:57.600]  ridiculous thing to claim actually in in the um what they had taken from him they had cut off the
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:03.520]  top of it which describes exactly what it was uh you know this okay so what happened long story
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:10.800]  short long story short i got a hold of ben pardon um general ben pardon and as one of the top people
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:16.320]  in the nation dealing with with bombs and former head of air force weapons development exactly while
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:23.520]  he's still one of the six people today that chooses our our armament um so using him as a
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:30.080]  reference point uh and gathering the information getting a determination from him that this was for
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:36.480]  uh sanitation purposes not for building a bomb so what have you done just written a letter and they
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:42.880]  claim that letters about two well he had written a list out of things that were necessary for for
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.240]  cleaning this up and so a guy in prison they claim is now involved in bombs uh well kind of
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:55.280]  smuggle it in smuggle stuff in to to create a bomb inside they they had they moved him to a level
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:01.120]  three and with uh ben pardon's information and his determination we were able to overturn that
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:06.240]  but good so so sure nancy we don't have much time yeah and i appreciate you coming on with us mark
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:12.000]  is scheduled to get out the 15th of march that's so he's serving all seven years all seven years
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.120]  that eyes of march i don't think that's any any mistake there um that they chose that date but

[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:47.520]  Todd in ohio Todd you're on the air go ahead yeah hi alex um first i wanted to say the 16-year
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:53.120]  military veteran i strongly support lieutenant watata and i wish him well i have a are you there
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:01.040]  yes i am sir okay i have two questions on monetary reform i agree with you as well as
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:05.840]  erin russo and ron paul that are privately controlled debt based money system is horribly
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:10.800]  corrupt and we don't really owe that money right it's it's a very complex system needs to be
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:15.760]  eliminated however i disagree that gold is the solution now there's an excellent documentary
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:21.520]  on this called the money masters my first question is are you familiar with the argument against
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:26.320]  yeah you're familiar with the argument against returning to with gold based money system well
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:30.720]  i know at the end i know at the end of the documentary they go through a plan to basically
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:37.280]  monetize it and uh you know and and that goes through a whole sophisticated program i'm not
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:40.320]  even saying particularly go back to the gold standard we can have a government issue the
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:46.720]  currency it just isn't debt based uh but there's also arguments for a gold standard and so you
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:51.360]  know that's open for debate the bottom line is this current system is a fraud right yeah because
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:57.200]  it's monetized debt it's not whether it's not what the currency is uh composed of it's how it
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.360]  comes in the circle it's been about eight nine years since i saw the money masters why don't
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:06.080]  you tell me about their plans at the end of the film well a long story short it basically
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.360]  advocates instead of a debt based free-out money system that advocates a debt free free-out money
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:15.920]  system yeah the government just issues it and then the money uses a mode of exchange the key point
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.840]  is that it has to and this is something similar to something molten-free been advocated which is
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:25.600]  it has to be tagged by law to objective criteria which would take it out of the hands of both bankers
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:30.400]  and politicians they would be demanded it by law but then that way you don't get hands and that way
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:34.800]  you don't get massive currency speculation right and the money fell to stand like three to five
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.760]  percent a year by law so that that way it couldn't be arbitrarily manipulated so i just wanted to
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.600]  mention that documentary and that you're not just holding physical gold are you all right
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:49.600]  story not but the thing is is that uh one of the things it mentions in the documentary is that the
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.760]  gold commission set up by Ronald Reagan in the early 80s found that none of that gold was even
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:58.320]  owned by the American people anymore even though it's confiscated from them it's all well yeah
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:06.720]  we know what happened i appreciate your call uh in 1933 martial law was declared they ordered
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:11.200]  everyone to turn their gold in for paper notes so you can bring an ounce of gold in you get 20 bucks
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:21.600]  paper it's really cotton you get a greenback and then you take uh then the globalist took that and
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:27.360]  sold it to europe at cost and then overnight once they had the gold supply they then doubled its value
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:33.200]  about manipulating the price of it and so what the caller brings up is true but but
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:38.720]  just because europe owns most of our gold that's where most of it you end up buying on a gold
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:44.320]  seller here in the u.s is where it comes from so you can still physically buy gold i want to make
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:49.680]  that clear i'm saying don't even trust in government things are so far gone once it all crashes we can
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.600]  try to rebuild it and get a better system and i totally support what the caller was saying
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:59.120]  i just uh i don't want it to confuse people that gold is not a good investment it's a wonderful
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:05.760]  investment uh let's go ahead and take another call john in california you're on the year go ahead
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:12.400]  hi alex i have three real quick things the first one is a few days ago i called up and you told me
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:19.840]  to uh take the line of code for the myspace page and make the code and send it to you i sent it to
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:26.000]  ryan at info wars today and the second thing is well let's fill people and then we'll know what you
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.880]  were talking about i called up and sure well yeah you said that there's a a piece of code that can
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:37.280]  be done where we can post the link to my radio show on the website i believe on my myspace account
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:42.720]  there is a link just to click and listen but you're saying some type of player and so uh great
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:47.760]  yeah i made that code and it's a little box that you could put in your listen page or whatever
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:52.720]  and people can just copy the code from it and paste it right to their myspace page right the
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:45:00.080]  second thing is that uh that i was just looking at netflix and i found erin russo's film freedom
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:06.400]  to fascism and your film nine eleven rise of the police state both on there and you mean terror storm
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:14.240]  yeah terror storm that's what i meant anyway and uh and the third thing is a couple days ago a caller
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:21.440]  called up that you falsely accused of being a cia uh this guy named rome roman from my hometown
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.920]  he uh i don't believe that's the case huh i don't believe that's the case you think he is cia no i
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:32.080]  don't even know who this caller is or this person is but i don't remember in the last week accusing
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:38.640]  a caller being cia i mean not last week i mean yesterday he called up talking about the freemasons
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:43.600]  no i did not in fact in fact and that's who i thought you were talking about and i appreciate
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:50.320]  your call sir okay uh if you listen to that call in fact i should ask you when it was
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:57.680]  was that the third hour yesterday that was in the second hour in fact i think it was a
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:02.000]  but i think he came on about 35 out for second hour in fact i like doing this sometimes going
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.600]  there and listen to a caller named roman i think it's like middle of the second hour and i want
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:12.240]  to play that because i'm tired of people calling in here with false accusations of this show
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:17.760]  all right and i'm not mad at you sir thanks for writing a code to get the show out and all that
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:24.800]  but people don't listen they don't listen every time i say you can download terror storm for free
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:29.840]  on google video i think at a bunch of calls and emails going you said your film's free send it to
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:37.280]  me i can't ship it to you for six seven bucks free and ship you the dvd for free i'm saying it's on
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:45.280]  google video for free and it's the same thing the caller called in and said why don't you say
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:50.640]  freemasons run everything and that 911 was a freemason job and then i went through people
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.120]  that attacked me who are in the government or involved with the government other and i said
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:01.360]  not you sir but other people not the caller but others that say he won't say it's just the catholics
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:05.760]  he's an agent he won't say it's just the jews he's an agent he won't say it's just the blah blah
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  blah and i said no it's evil people in every major group are part of this new world order
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:18.400]  and then i went on and then i even i even took time out knowing how people's brains work to go
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:27.280]  and i'm not saying you're bad i'm not saying you're the agent and then the next day you falsely accuse
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:34.480]  someone of being an agent john can you find that i'm going from memory here but i think
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:43.600]  i think it was in the fourth segment of hour two
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:53.120]  and uh i ended up doing like a five six minute rant off of it into that 50 after break
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:00.320]  but again folks it's not about me i'm just i mean frankly i'm sitting here with an incredible
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:05.040]  headache with a sinus headache right now with allergies i'm tired i'm just trying to cover

[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:47.360]  the same lies and same liars that dragged us into this catastrophe in iraq which will and using
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:52.160]  the same lies and liars which the democrats the republicans and especially the media are
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:58.240]  complicitant into an even more uh catastrophic catastrophic war with iran yeah we're sitting
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:04.320]  here on the edge of world war three it could mean millions dead and uh the history books are written
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:09.040]  yeah it's just we're in trouble man it's bad well you know there's a lot of people that are on the
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:14.320]  inside and i've been checking some of the websites and people even in the military and
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.480]  intelligence circles in the pentagon that are leaking stuff to see more of irish uh
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:23.840]  scott ridder and others who are absolutely considered this are this these people in the
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:31.520]  white house mad and crazy and a particularly uh stunning one i saw on wsws.org uh zebigno
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.640]  brzezinski now this man is a very sinister character himself who's been involved in
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:41.520]  provocations that when he uh started the war in afghanistan he's co-founder of the trilateral
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:47.520]  commission right and but and now he's declassified it well he admitted it and it was declassified
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:52.640]  that in 79 with carter to actually start of the war against the soviets the soviets were
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:58.400]  provocateur into coming into afghanistan and that was all meant to just bleed them but many historians
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:03.040]  now say it was actually to create the radical muzlamuzha hadeen to spread it and export it
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:09.280]  yes and coming from this man a man like that uh uh uh really a kind of a terrifying testimony
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:14.480]  last thursday before the senate foreign relations committee the media was totally silence about
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:20.480]  this uh uh plans for war by the uh bush administration he was absolutely appalled by it
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:25.600]  he says that it was a skating denunciation of both the war in iraq and this planned war
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:31.760]  uh catastrophe against iran and he says that the united states government is uh actually
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:38.400]  he strongly suggested i should say that they're capable of a provocation uh uh of a provoking
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:44.800]  a terrorist attack in the united states brzezinski said that he uh he came very close and strongly
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:51.040]  hinted at wsws.org what's the headline on the story and i'll i'll get one of my people to do
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:56.720]  an article on it uh well uh their headline is a political bombshell from zebigny virginity
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:01.360]  that's national security advisors warns that the bush administration is seeking a pretext to
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:07.440]  attack iran and he brings out that uh there's actually uh uh he cites other examples prior
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:13.680]  to the war with about uh the the administration well as you mentioned was planning to provoke
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:21.120]  uh iran into uh shooting at an american plane uh and at point wmd's we're out of time thank

[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:43.760]  two three minutes i don't have time to play it all here in a final five minute segment
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:48.800]  but here i am explaining that i cover all the different evil groups and how they all nexus
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:54.000]  together and then i say that the people that are attacking me they're out there with these websites
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.520]  are operatives and then i say but i'm not saying you're an operative caller and then i'm accused
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:07.440]  of saying he's an operative so here it is for you what i said i cover what i think are the most
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:14.320]  important facets and i bring guests on who cover all the others and we've talked about the israeli
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:20.080]  connections and they're clearly there we could talk about them every couple days and i'll get the
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:26.400]  calls and the big exposés are written that i've never once talked about it and i and i and i
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:32.720]  i didn't talk about 911 for years after it which is totally untrue talked about it before it happened
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:37.520]  the day it happened those are just operatives and just info people instead of it's just knowing it's
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:40.800]  an inside job they want to get us all fighting with each other instead of moving forward to
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:48.240]  educate the public but it was an inside job and i'm not saying you're an operative sir you sound
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:56:02.880]  genuine and you sound serious but quite frankly i don't believe that 911 was a free masonic job i mean
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:08.240]  you've got 911 the masonic numbers you've got the two towers used in masonic rituals where they
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:13.200]  you know have the river knocking down the two pillars who's the who's the next caller because
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:20.640]  i got a bunch here okay i just played that clip for you and there you go i did not say you were
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:27.200]  cia operative i said people attacking me in big exposés clearly are then i said no i'm not saying
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.680]  you are you brought up serious info i didn't disagree with you i didn't call you an operative
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:39.680]  and you just said i did i should probably hate me for proving you're wrong it's it's okay fine
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:46.480]  let's uh i just am tired of it frankly uh let's uh go ahead and talk to uh

[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:00.880]  what can you tell me about the organization that's called we the people uh that's a great
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:06.000]  organization effectively exposing the fact that the irs is a collection agency for the private
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:09.920]  federal reserve and i've interviewed the head of the group and been very supportive of them and
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:15.280]  they've run full page ads and major magazines and newspapers like us say today yeah they got a good
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:21.200]  website yeah and uh we support them fully it's all part of exposing the fraud just like there is no
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:25.440]  law you got to take this live cancer virus there's no law you got to pay the income tax it's not a
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:31.040]  real tax it goes directly to the private bankers even ronald reagan said that okay all right thank you
