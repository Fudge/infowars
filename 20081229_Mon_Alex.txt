[00:44.760 --> 00:50.600]  year will be ushered in thank you so much for joining us today coming up in
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.280]  two hours we have Kevin Ryan the engineer who worked at underwriting
[00:54.280 --> 00:57.460]  laboratories who found out that underwriting laboratories had done
[00:57.460 --> 01:02.320]  internal tests and found that tower 1 and 2 and 7 couldn't have fallen the way
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.700]  the government claimed he then wanted to go public with that information they
[01:07.700 --> 01:11.860]  told him that he wasn't allowed to but then he did he did go ahead and go
[01:11.860 --> 01:17.560]  public and so they fired him so Kevin Ryan joining us for a full hour coming
[01:17.560 --> 01:24.760]  up in two hours and then we have the young student joining us who was banned
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.280]  from wearing a 9-11 truth shirt at the school also his public school his
[01:29.280 --> 01:33.320]  government training camp has big chapters in his textbook about world
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.880]  government how wonderful it is but then when he said he was against world
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.680]  government he was told that the textbook in the article basically didn't exist so
[01:41.680 --> 01:48.760]  a classic mind control classic cognitive dissidents and double think and his
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.440]  YouTube videos have gotten hundreds of thousands of views as he resist within
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.140]  the reeducation camp known as the public school so believe you pronounce it
[01:58.140 --> 02:04.960]  Wannick Robert Wannick joining us coming up and then in studio Tommy Pallada
[02:04.960 --> 02:10.120]  Tommy was in town he lives over in the Netherlands now part of the year with a
[02:10.120 --> 02:14.680]  film company over there and he also lives in LA part of the year a good
[02:14.680 --> 02:19.840]  friend of mine you know he produced waking life a scanner darkly and quite a
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.760]  few other movies but those are two that I'm in and he's been working on some
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.520]  documentaries as of late I thought we'd have him in dealing with the new media
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.360]  and where he sees because he's he's a speaker around the world discussing new
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.240]  media and technologies so I thought we'd have a Tommy in here for 40 minutes
[02:37.240 --> 02:44.120]  today in the last 40 minutes of the broadcast in the next two hours though
[02:44.120 --> 02:48.040]  we are going to have open phones I've got a lot of news I'm gonna be covering
[02:48.040 --> 02:53.280]  obviously the India-Pakistan situation they almost went to war last week the
[02:53.280 --> 03:00.240]  two armies mashing on the cashmere border of course you know what started up on
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.240]  Saturday is the massive Israeli bombardment of the million and a half
[03:05.240 --> 03:12.440]  people living in the Gaza Strip I'll be going over that it's as if a switch was
[03:12.440 --> 03:19.160]  flipped and wars just mushroomed across the globe we're seeing fresh conflict in
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.040]  Somalia fresh conflict in Sudan fresh conflict in Asia many different areas not
[03:25.040 --> 03:32.040]  just Central Asia on 888 we saw the NATO US Israeli backs sneak attack on
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.920]  Russian forces in south of Saudi and Abkhazia why is this happening we'll go
[03:37.920 --> 03:44.400]  over it coming up in this hour and taking your calls on what you think the most
[03:44.400 --> 03:50.360]  important stories were of 2008 what the most overlooked stories were versus what
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.760]  was reported on and and your predictions for the first year of Brock H. Obama
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.400]  will be taking calls over the next three days into the new year and then into the
[04:02.400 --> 04:10.280]  first day of the new year here on this radio transmission we will also be live

[04:41.080 --> 04:45.320]  that with an even higher res download for members at prisonplanet.tv but in
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.560]  t-minus one hour 55 minutes 10 seconds will be live at prisonplanet.tv
[04:50.560 --> 04:55.000]  all right the radio transmission continues you found it the front lines of
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.800]  the info war
[04:58.600 --> 05:03.040]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:03.040 --> 05:06.320]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:06.320 --> 05:09.880]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.160]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.000]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.520]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:20.520 --> 05:24.160]  for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.480]  off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.480]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.280]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:36.280 --> 05:40.320]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many
[05:40.320 --> 05:44.520]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:44.520 --> 05:48.800]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.560]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.280]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:56.280 --> 05:59.880]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[05:59.880 --> 06:04.040]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:04.040 --> 06:07.560]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[06:07.560 --> 06:11.360]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[06:11.360 --> 06:15.560]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[06:15.560 --> 06:18.520]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[06:18.520 --> 06:21.720]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.280]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:25.280 --> 06:29.000]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.400]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[06:32.400 --> 06:36.200]  storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or
[06:36.200 --> 06:39.840]  Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery

[07:05.360 --> 07:12.840]  storeable food he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[07:12.840 --> 07:15.760]  radio network
[07:15.760 --> 07:36.880]  I told Aaron Friday that I wanted to get Ed Asner on the show to comment on
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.800]  Barack H. Obama who's flip-flopped on everything he said he'd do against war
[07:41.800 --> 07:48.560]  police state warrantless wiretapping NAFTA GATT and you know because Ed
[07:48.560 --> 07:54.320]  Asner is a big anti-war guy and so I was intending to have two hours of open
[07:54.320 --> 07:59.200]  phones but he just called at his house and Ed said today's as good a day as
[07:59.200 --> 08:06.720]  any I want to come on right now so Ed Asner is on in 55 minutes from now but
[08:06.720 --> 08:09.560]  we're still gonna have open phones you can respond to what he thinks coming up
[08:09.560 --> 08:13.400]  in the next year what do you think Barack H. Obama the puppet is gonna do
[08:13.400 --> 08:20.000]  we'll cover all of that obviously I will be talking next hour a lot about the
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.840]  war this is how I see what's happening between Israel and Hamas it's
[08:26.840 --> 08:38.000]  tribal warfare but Israel is going to anyway you slice it come out as the
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.400]  bad guy here because you know you've got people throwing rocks at tanks you've
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.600]  got the Gazans firing these Katusha rockets that are glorified Estes
[08:48.600 --> 08:54.080]  rockets they do kill people on average about a person a week but it's more of
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.000]  our harassment type situation you know more people die every week in Texas from
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.600]  hitting deer on the highway and then you can literally pull that statistic up
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.560]  and die in Israel from Katusha rockets being shot over the border and then you
[09:07.560 --> 09:12.920]  have to look at the way the Gazans live a million and a half Palestinians in an
[09:12.920 --> 09:18.600]  area about twice the size of the District of Columbia mainly desert and
[09:18.600 --> 09:27.400]  you know hilly kind of Badlands type topography and you've got them hurted in
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.440]  there with Israel for years shutting off food medicine water money and Israel's
[09:33.440 --> 09:37.040]  argument is well they use that money to get weapons systems or people are
[09:37.040 --> 09:41.120]  smuggling arms in and that certainly is happening but the image of all these
[09:41.120 --> 09:50.480]  tanks lined up and all this artillery lined up and of f-16s and f-15s and
[09:50.480 --> 09:56.440]  helicopters raining bombs and missiles down on crowded populations and the
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.040]  images of now over 300 dead over a thousand injured and that's last night's
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.200]  numbers every time the numbers come out a day later it's it's double that so
[10:05.200 --> 10:11.040]  probably probably 500 600 dead probably 2,000 injured nobody knows this is
[10:11.040 --> 10:19.040]  tribal warfare it is always going to be going on and the same thing is going on
[10:19.040 --> 10:22.680]  between Pakistan and India the difference here is that Pakistan and
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.280]  India both have nuclear weapons and they've been massing troops on their
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.560]  borders threatening to attack each other so why suddenly is this happening why
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.760]  suddenly Israel in the situation in Gaza why suddenly that the the the heat
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.560]  between India and Pakistan why did the United States through their puppet in
[10:43.560 --> 10:51.480]  Georgia launch this sneak attack on Russian forces and again ladies and
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.040]  gentlemen I'm just reporting the facts here you know I'm not on the side of the
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.360]  Ruskies I'm not on the side of you know the Pakistanis the Indians the Israelis
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.160]  the Palestinians any of these people because there is no side in this the
[11:06.160 --> 11:12.920]  New World Order is manipulating all of this chaos and this crisis and it's the
[11:12.920 --> 11:20.840]  same thing that we saw in the 1970s where the PLO was the dominant force and
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.800]  was having real political effects worldwide on Israel and pressuring
[11:26.800 --> 11:31.600]  Israel to give up land that it had taken during the Six-Day War and so what did
[11:31.600 --> 11:34.540]  Israel do they when this is in the Harats and Jerusalem post you can just
[11:34.540 --> 11:39.040]  Google Israel founded Hamas and you'll find the mainstream articles from Israel
[11:39.040 --> 11:46.360]  Israel founded Hamas as a radical Islamist counter to the quasi secular
[11:46.360 --> 11:54.200]  PLO because when you look at what the CIA and and MI6 and Shin Bet and Mossad
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.520]  have done as a policy for 50 years in the Middle East and Central Asia is to
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.440]  radicalize Islam and to use radical Muslims to go in and assassinate or
[12:06.440 --> 12:19.160]  overthrow or block secular Palestinian or Arab groups so I really don't shed
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.480]  any tears for Israel when their little creation Hamas is running around firing
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.560]  these tinker toy rockets and I mean militarily they are tinker toys they're
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.760]  unguided they have a small munition in them 99% of the time they don't kill
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.520]  anybody now if you're that 1% when it falls on your school and kills you know
[12:40.520 --> 12:49.960]  five kids it's not fun and it certainly is a serious issue but again why did
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.760]  Israel go out and create Hamas a bunch of wild-eyed individuals well because
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.760]  they didn't want am I saying PLO is legitimate we also are about you know
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.040]  this is a it was a real piece of work and clearly was assassinated the point is
[13:06.040 --> 13:11.640]  is that historically that's what's happening now they didn't just create
[13:11.640 --> 13:17.760]  Hamas to counter the PLO they created it mainly to counter I well later it
[13:17.760 --> 13:24.440]  developed the Shiite backed also found in the early 70s and then later backed by
[13:24.440 --> 13:34.120]  Iran by 1979 Hezbollah now Hezbollah is a serious fighting force though it is
[13:34.120 --> 13:41.120]  religious based Shiite religious based and in checkerboard formations swearing
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.240]  to fight to the death they defeated the entire IDF two years ago all the tanks
[13:47.240 --> 13:53.000]  all the nerve gas all the artillery all the cluster bombs couldn't defeat guys
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.720]  who were dug in the foxholes sworn to fight to the death with anti-tank
[13:57.720 --> 14:07.720]  weapons and Israel got defeated so why is Israel deciding to strike right now
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.960]  well because politically they got a bloody nose and the the aura of
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.800]  invincibility of Israel no army is invincible Israel has a surprisingly
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.120]  successful rate of winning but they lost against Hezbollah that's that's
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.640]  Iranian back that's Shiite and now the news is saying that Iran is backing
[14:29.640 --> 14:33.240]  Hamas that's ridiculous ladies and gentlemen those two grips are to each
[14:33.240 --> 14:36.560]  other's throats and are constantly killing each other that's like the media
[14:36.560 --> 14:42.200]  saying that that Iran is backing al-Qaeda when the White House publicly has three
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.360]  al-Qaeda grips attacking Iran continually their Sunnis ladies and gentlemen
[14:47.360 --> 14:53.920]  it's a Wahhabi is sacked out of Saudi Arabia look I'm not going to go on all
[14:53.920 --> 14:57.760]  day with a history lesson here it's just they're counting on the American
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.520]  people being ignorant in all of this and Israel is doing this because of bribery
[15:02.520 --> 15:08.040]  scandals corruption scandals they've had a bunch of things on the order of
[15:08.040 --> 15:13.960]  Lagojevic over there with people taking armaments bribes and bribes from the
[15:13.960 --> 15:19.480]  prostitution rings and rives from the ecstasy rings and you know it's all
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.320]  come out that about half the Knesset is on the payroll of the mafia over there
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.320]  just like our government's on mafia payroll and so they got an election
[15:27.320 --> 15:34.280]  coming up in a few months and this is an election event this is an election
[15:34.280 --> 15:42.960]  event I mean did they do precision strikes against Hamas and the
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.240]  Katyusha rocket pads no are they doing precision strikes up against their
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.040]  border you know are they killing you know a few of the rebels here and there
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.720]  no there are bombing the daylights out of the main infrastructure the police
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.880]  stations the government buildings they are further destroying that country the
[16:02.880 --> 16:08.760]  Gaza Strip that area that has been under siege for decades and that is the
[16:08.760 --> 16:16.120]  greatest and oldest form of total war is siege and so I have to say that though
[16:16.120 --> 16:21.120]  politically the hotheads of Hamas are playing into the hands of Israel
[16:21.120 --> 16:30.160]  firing their bottle rockets firing their their fourth of July souped up
[16:30.160 --> 16:38.040]  before the July rockets I mean if they politically would not be violent and
[16:38.040 --> 16:44.880]  would just speak out Israel couldn't get away with what they're doing but see
[16:44.880 --> 16:50.800]  Israel is is slick at propaganda compared to the Arabs I mean remember two
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.960]  years ago the images of the Israeli police going in and beating settlers
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.280]  Jewish settlers with Billy clubs splitting their heads open knocking their
[16:59.280 --> 17:06.600]  teeth out bulldozing their houses that image was sent worldwide out to make
[17:06.600 --> 17:12.120]  Israel look bad for not allowing the settlements to expand and then people
[17:12.120 --> 17:18.080]  said oh leave the settlers alone see how that propaganda worked I mean this is
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.960]  just classic propaganda and look I wish all these people would just live in
[17:21.960 --> 17:27.520]  peace but you know what since David killed Goliath you know the Philistine
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.760]  who is that that's the Palestinians of today these people been killing each
[17:32.760 --> 17:37.440]  other for 3,000 years it isn't going to stop okay they've been killing each
[17:37.440 --> 17:43.600]  other for 3,000 years because when the Israelites came out of Egypt folks the
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.880]  promised land was not empty and there were their their their genetic cousins
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.400]  running around all over the place there and they've been killing each other
[17:53.400 --> 17:59.240]  ever since and it just isn't going to stop and it's a real shame but that's
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.080]  all I can really say on that issue we'll talk about it with that asner
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.160]  coming up in about 40 minutes I want to come back and take phone calls at 800

[33:57.440 --> 34:01.960]  in the mail but none of that matters because I'm a white devil well because
[34:01.960 --> 34:07.680]  I heard that guy on the show before because I have pink skin like some type
[34:07.680 --> 34:14.720]  of mole rat I am like some type of cave creature I am of the devil and it's the
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.600]  same thing if your dog's got pink skin you know on his belly he's of Satan sir
[34:19.600 --> 34:23.880]  and and and you know and according to the white groups if your dog has black
[34:23.880 --> 34:28.680]  skin he's a devil dog too you know it's a dog ladies and gentlemen I don't care
[34:28.680 --> 34:32.600]  if it's got white skin or black skin and if it's got white skin or black skin and
[34:32.600 --> 34:37.440]  it's a human it's a human but you can't tell that to these jackasses I believe
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.640]  these people are missing the point of this whole fight that we're involved in
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.680]  right now not about this or that or who you are what color your skin is it's
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.280]  about the freedom for everybody but the question I'd like to ask you are an evil
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.400]  white person so shut up the question I'd like to ask you right now is amongst
[34:56.400 --> 35:01.880]  all this chaos is going on in the world where is the North American Union and
[35:01.880 --> 35:06.960]  a marrow going at this point is there is it going to be is it going full steam
[35:06.960 --> 35:09.960]  ahead and is the marrow going to come in are they going to skip the marrow and go
[35:09.960 --> 35:16.320]  to a cashless society okay the a marrow and the Phoenix and I appreciate your
[35:16.320 --> 35:21.720]  call it's a it's a big question so let me answer it Randy the a marrow was
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.960]  proposed in a paper by the council on foreign relations and then they've had
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.080]  some pundits on television the last five years proposed going to a North American
[35:32.080 --> 35:38.160]  currency called the a marrow in Forbes magazine and in money magazine back in
[35:38.160 --> 35:43.280]  the late 80s they proposed in two different issues a Phoenix currency
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.840]  worldwide whatever it's named the point is the big private central banks that
[35:48.840 --> 35:53.520]  are orchestrating the collapse we're seeing they want to get rid of local
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.680]  sovereign governments setting their own currency values and rates they want an
[35:59.680 --> 36:06.640]  international body to set the standards and the rates now we've seen the big
[36:06.640 --> 36:10.080]  central banks orchestrate the world crisis we're in and then they propose
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.960]  out of that crisis as we said they would a private group of banks at an
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.520]  international level under treaty agreements setting the price and value of
[36:21.520 --> 36:29.720]  the world's dominant 10 currencies every single day to a global set unit but
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.160]  that doesn't mean it's fairly set you know set at one level or raised or lowered
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.520]  together it means that the private central banks who by the way are in the
[36:39.520 --> 36:44.680]  stock markets and in the derivatives markets manipulating currencies and
[36:44.680 --> 36:49.560]  making profits off of it it allows them to rig it all to their benefit and
[36:49.560 --> 36:54.200]  their benefit only so see everything's a rigged game they don't have to follow
[36:54.200 --> 36:58.920]  any rules on investment everybody else does they get to you know have fractional
[36:58.920 --> 37:03.400]  reserve leveraging 30 to 150 to 100 to one the citizenry can't do that it's
[37:03.400 --> 37:07.840]  called money laundering or it's called counterfeiting and it's the same thing
[37:07.840 --> 37:15.400]  where and then on top of it you will buy your carbon taxes from them so to
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.280]  explain how globalization happens we are under the North American Union right
[37:21.280 --> 37:27.440]  now it's what degree of it you know they signed a deal back in the early 1990s to
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.800]  expand the hemispheric trade agreements then they signed after and gotten 94
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.560]  which clearly is is a European Union style agreement if you look at how the
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.040]  European Union started in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome when they signed that
[37:42.040 --> 37:48.000]  agreement they said well really under the Treaty of London 1949 we've already
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.200]  been in a European Union and then now they brag 50 something years later they
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.480]  say oh yeah it was secret all along and we didn't admit to the public that it
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.900]  was really a union to the late 90s and then now that you're up France and the
[38:02.900 --> 38:10.440]  Netherlands and Ireland and other countries keep voting to one out of the
[38:10.440 --> 38:13.800]  European Union European Union says no you're not allowed to get out in fact
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.240]  we're going to expand it on you whether you like it or not so it's the same
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.360]  thing just like they denied there was a European Union till about 98 and they
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.320]  said you know what these trade deals really were bringing you into a union
[38:28.320 --> 38:33.320]  and then people argue well a union is just the next step in society no it's
[38:33.320 --> 38:39.280]  not you know the argument goes well first we were hunter-gatherers in bands
[38:39.280 --> 38:45.440]  that were just migrating around and then we were a grarian and then we set up
[38:45.440 --> 38:48.920]  city states and the nation states and the empires and now it's global
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.160]  government well you can argue you know that's the next step kind of the
[38:52.160 --> 38:58.400]  predictive programming of Star Trek and things along those lines where well
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.840]  global government's just the next step well is there a debate about do we want
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.440]  a global government no there's not even a debate about what kind of global
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.280]  government do we want if we decide we want one they just say sit down and
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.040]  shut up it doesn't exist while they openly announce it and openly set it up
[39:16.040 --> 39:24.400]  I mean it's just complete mind games that they're playing so the reason they
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.320]  want global government more than anything is so there's nowhere to run
[39:27.320 --> 39:30.960]  nowhere to hide where they have complete control well there's not quote tax
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.520]  havens the big private banks don't like people running to Luxembourg or running
[39:36.520 --> 39:45.480]  to Monte Carlo or running to the Bahamas or running to Dubai they don't want the
[39:45.480 --> 39:49.640]  commoner to do that they haven't set up where they can they call those tax havens
[39:49.640 --> 39:53.440]  they want to come in and with global government force the U.S. to have an
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.120]  eighty percent tax rate that's what the XM Bank wants international bank of
[39:57.120 --> 40:04.800]  settlements the OECD they all call for that but more importantly they want to
[40:04.800 --> 40:08.160]  be able to set up the new rules you see when you set up the new global
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.000]  government you can set it up where you're the boss and where your
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.680]  institutions are in control and so they said back in 1974 the Trilateral
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.040]  Commission public documents set up as a big number Zinski Jimmy Carter and David
[40:20.040 --> 40:28.200]  Rockefeller they stated in there that that they would by the year 2000 there
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.040]  are few years behind as you can see have these global currency battles and have a
[40:33.040 --> 40:37.600]  world economic meltdown and out of that meltdown they would then bring in ten
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.400]  regional currencies under ten kingdoms it's also in the club of Rome and CFR
[40:42.400 --> 40:49.400]  documents but then in within those ten regions those would be divided into three
[40:49.400 --> 41:00.480]  super regions above the ten sub regions and now they propose just exactly as they
[41:00.480 --> 41:10.600]  did 34 years ago they propose they proposed this the year I was born 34
[41:10.600 --> 41:18.000]  years ago how to be 35 but the point is 34 years later they come right out in
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.120]  hundreds of publications and say to the world well we've got this global banking
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.400]  crisis there wasn't enough regulation so we need these big private central banks
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.760]  have governmental power when they are the private central banks that engineered
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.120]  this and orchestrated all of this I mean on its face it's a fraud and they
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.040]  openly say in in in Pentagon and Ministry of Defense documents that they work
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.320]  for the private banks and that Wall Street and the Bank of England and the
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.520]  City of London openly rules the earth and that they are going to take
[41:51.520 --> 41:54.760]  everything that people own your land your parks your roads your infrastructure
[41:54.760 --> 41:58.000]  everything and that they are going to deploy troops in the streets of America
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.560]  and England that they will use mercenaries and foreign forces it's all public now
[42:02.560 --> 42:06.440]  and that you will pay your carbon taxes and have regulators in your home in your
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.320]  office micromanaging every fastest of your life and they're going to hire
[42:10.320 --> 42:17.200]  millions of these lazy do nothing no nothing near do well moron bankrupt
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.120]  slobs to come in like parasites and enforce on us and suck everything out
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.280]  of the productive who have always been the enemy of the parasite elite because
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.560]  we rival them because they know a challenge to their hegemonic monopoly
[42:32.560 --> 42:36.840]  and power always springs from the middle class so they are engaging in
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.000]  predatory actions to dumb us down break up our families destroy our capital
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.880]  base just like a male bear will come into the females cave come into the
[42:46.880 --> 42:53.600]  females den and will smell the babies and will kill the any male cubs that's
[42:53.600 --> 42:56.080]  what the government does when they target boys to put them on riddling in
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.600]  prozac they have handbooks it's declassified we've covered it here with
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.320]  top educators former head of policy department of education where they said
[43:03.320 --> 43:07.600]  60 years ago we've got a drug and target leadership males who are they
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.200]  they're aggressive they raise their hand a lot they talk a lot they're popular
[43:11.200 --> 43:17.280]  drug them hurt them sterilize them get them because real eugenics isn't up just
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.440]  about killing the the low IQ or the genetically inferior and all that other
[43:22.440 --> 43:28.200]  bull it's really about targeting the rivals to the elite and just like a bear
[43:28.200 --> 43:33.200]  comes in and grabs that baby bear and kills it he comes up he smells the male
[43:33.200 --> 43:39.480]  and he's just gonna that's what they're doing to America right now and it's the
[43:39.480 --> 43:45.280]  same thing what does a male lion do why do the females stay in those prides and
[43:45.280 --> 43:51.360]  protect the babies because the males will rush in like any big predator mammal
[43:51.360 --> 43:57.840]  you know some species of predator whale will kill baby males or injure baby
[43:57.840 --> 44:01.880]  males because they know he's gonna grow up big and strong that's what the
[44:01.880 --> 44:05.640]  government's for that's why they put fluoride in your water they savage you
[44:05.640 --> 44:11.400]  with wanton abandon they savage military attack military military military just
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.280]  like they're attacking Gaza right now the New World Order military attacks you
[44:15.280 --> 44:19.560]  every day when the food and the water you drink and they do it with wanton
[44:19.560 --> 44:23.600]  abandon and nobody's stepping up to stop them
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.600]  you look at wolves which of course is our favorite domesticated animal because
[44:32.600 --> 44:42.240]  they're very similar in their troop or pack psychology to primates to bipedal
[44:42.240 --> 44:53.880]  creatures and what does a dominant wolf do especially when the pack gets large
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.360]  it goes in and it picks out the little male puppies that look strong that look
[44:58.360 --> 45:05.600]  big that have a lot of energy and it tears their guts out so America you're
[45:05.600 --> 45:13.280]  having your guts torn out right now you understand that you understand that's
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.480]  what's happening to you right now I want to say something and I'm going back
[45:17.480 --> 45:25.080]  to your calls to the FBI the CIA to police to all of you you work for a
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.440]  system that loves betrayal you work for a system that is anti-American and is
[45:30.440 --> 45:35.440]  sworn to destroy our sovereignty our way of life our free market and everything
[45:35.440 --> 45:43.560]  that's been good about this nation and all those years that the law enforcement
[45:43.560 --> 45:53.880]  publications hundreds of them saw one issue what six seven years ago of law
[45:53.880 --> 45:57.480]  enforcement technology and weapons believes the name of the publication we
[45:57.480 --> 46:03.120]  covered it showed it on air and it said in there oh police if you see somebody
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.360]  with a get us out of the UN sticker they're probably a terrorist go ahead
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.800]  and arrest them and police chiefs support your officers going ahead and just
[46:09.800 --> 46:13.520]  arresting this person for no reason try to find something on them because
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.000]  because these people are terrorists and they believe in a false conspiracy about
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.640]  a new world order and none of this exists and and and they're lying
[46:21.640 --> 46:29.120]  anti-American scum basically and you've got the FBI memos and training manuals
[46:29.120 --> 46:32.680]  that say gun owners those that make frequent references to the US
[46:32.680 --> 46:38.000]  Constitution superpatriots we're terrorists then we have FEMA training
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.040]  videos of them teaching police and firemen and sheriff's deputies at the
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.760]  founding fathers were bad and that gun owners are bad
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.680]  I mean that's in my film road to tyranny firefighter sent me that video out of
[46:49.680 --> 46:55.840]  Kansas City and then I was sent slack training by separate federal officers one
[46:55.840 --> 47:02.200]  of them FBI the other guy was federal marshal all the same crap so here we
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.760]  were reading public UN documents reading public announcements we have videos of
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.280]  Walter Cronkite and Hillary Clinton calling for world government hundreds of
[47:10.280 --> 47:15.480]  these videos we play them here on air the audio you know they get up on C
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.920]  span and say it every day now and then you go around with training manuals
[47:19.920 --> 47:27.120]  saying we made it up and it isn't real I mean as if it isn't obvious enough that
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.520]  we're the good guys we're the patriots we're the people defending the Republic
[47:31.520 --> 47:34.680]  and defending the Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment and Constitution and
[47:34.680 --> 47:38.400]  property rights and that all of that's under attack and then America and the
[47:38.400 --> 47:44.000]  West itself is turning into an Orwellian police state and then you've got the
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.160]  nerve to talk about how you're the pro-us patriots and how we are bad and that
[47:50.160 --> 47:56.080]  we're liars and that none of us exist and then now simultaneously hundreds of
[47:56.080 --> 48:02.000]  newspapers come out and announce world government is good new world order is
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.160]  good yes we secretly set it up but it's for your own good and now you're going
[48:06.160 --> 48:11.600]  to pay carbon taxes to the private bankers I mean you could be lazy in the
[48:11.600 --> 48:14.360]  past and not go look up your own government documents and find out we
[48:14.360 --> 48:17.760]  were telling you the truth but now it's all over the Wall Street Journal and the
[48:17.760 --> 48:24.560]  Financial Times of London and the London Telegraph and AFP and Reuters and the
[48:24.560 --> 48:30.080]  LA Times and and and and then you're telling me I'm still a liar as they
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.160]  openly take over the ports and the roads and the infrastructure and as they
[48:34.160 --> 48:42.640]  openly steal 1 trillion 300 billion a month excuse me a week and I as a
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.680]  taxpayer have to pay it back and suddenly the IRS is auditing and sucking
[48:47.680 --> 48:51.280]  money at everybody there's cops writing tickets and they're passing new
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.920]  business taxes everywhere and 88 new taxes in New York and whole bunch of
[48:55.920 --> 48:59.800]  new taxes in Texas and raping and robbing us and cops and black uniforms
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.160]  running around and openly announcing the army is going to be on the streets you
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.160]  know all those years I talked about how the army was training to confiscate our
[49:08.160 --> 49:13.280]  guns and then they put out government manuals saying we were liars and it was
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.560]  a conspiracy theory and now it's on the news that it's for the American people
[49:18.560 --> 49:21.680]  and you took the guns in New Orleans and you're taking them in Illinois right
[49:21.680 --> 49:26.240]  now using the army and you know about it a lot of FBI people are involved you're
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.720]  not all compartmentalized and you still sit there and say you are the good guys
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.520]  you are the good guys you are the patriots you are the people that I'm
[49:35.520 --> 49:38.720]  supposed to bow down to and lick your feet and just turn the whole damn

[53:27.120 --> 53:32.160]  hey Alex how's it going good sir I just wanted to say that most people who are
[53:32.160 --> 53:35.440]  just starting to listen for the first time may not know how all of this is
[53:35.440 --> 53:38.640]  possible how they can get the money for this kind of thing and it's all in the
[53:38.640 --> 53:42.920]  comprehensive annual financial report I watched that last night it blew my mind
[53:42.920 --> 53:46.640]  there's no doubt that they're doing this that they're in collusion both the
[53:46.640 --> 53:50.200]  Democrats and the Republicans together simple you had private bankers took
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.080]  over 1913 declared martial law over the states in 33 with the War Powers Act the
[53:55.080 --> 53:58.560]  Federal Reserve in Bloomberg two weeks ago admitted that the US is now under
[53:58.560 --> 54:02.840]  war powers the private Federal Reserve has hijacked the government publicly
[54:02.840 --> 54:07.400]  it's a private corporate takeover and this isn't like some nice corporation
[54:07.400 --> 54:12.240]  took us over they're totally tyrannical eugenicists and the FBI and the police
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.040]  are gonna follow orders they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna carry it
[54:15.040 --> 54:20.240]  out for the crooks because the crooks are wrapped in an American flag and for 40
[54:20.240 --> 54:23.440]  years neither the Democrats or the Republicans ever brought to life these
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.600]  annual financial reports because they didn't want people to know that both
[54:27.600 --> 54:31.800]  sides are stealing massive amounts of money let me go forward I mean he's a
[54:31.800 --> 54:36.520]  nice guy in all city manager down by Houston you know he's the guy fighting
[54:36.520 --> 54:40.520]  the trans-Texas corridors and I but I brought up to him I said what about the
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.320]  comprehension financial reports and he turned red on TV because we were
[54:45.320 --> 54:50.080]  videotaping it for prison planet TV and smiled real big and and wouldn't get
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.280]  into that see I mean that's the big dirty secret every water district every
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.840]  city every county every one of them has this double set of books I could be
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.440]  wrong but this is the majority of the wealth in this country no no no it's
[55:02.440 --> 55:08.960]  it's it's about 80% of it now they've been taking 65% on average of school
[55:08.960 --> 55:14.640]  district water district every fund city county state federal all the agencies
[55:14.640 --> 55:19.680]  and investing in it offshore banks and and by the way that's not for your
[55:19.680 --> 55:25.360]  pension funds city workers county workers this is separate this is what the
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.000]  national security state is all about robbing you taking everything you've
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.800]  got and then now we're to the point of the Ponzi schemes over but instead of
[55:35.800 --> 55:39.920]  Ponzi running off to the hills with a bag of gold he's now going to bring in
[55:39.920 --> 55:46.080]  the next phase total domination anything else sir no that's about it
[55:46.080 --> 55:50.320]  that's where it's at absolutely absolutely and all the spooks out there
[55:50.320 --> 55:53.800]  there's a story up on info wars.com I've been asking the guys do a story about
[55:53.800 --> 55:56.440]  this for a few weeks they finally got around to it and I appreciate Curtin
[55:56.440 --> 56:03.160]  Emma writing a story about it first person to point it out was was Derek
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.800]  one of our sales guys here at the office he said hey I'm getting emails on
[56:07.800 --> 56:15.280]  YouTube when you when you YouTube Alex Jones CIA.gov pops up as an ad so we
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.720]  typed in every other thing you can imagine other Patriot leaders nothing
[56:19.720 --> 56:24.640]  if you type in military or you type in Alex Jones the only two searches you
[56:24.640 --> 56:34.880]  type in that get it you get a CIA ad why are they trying to recruit people that
[56:34.880 --> 56:40.640]  watch my videos or is it a PSYOP to associate me with it or something you
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.280]  see folks they want to tear me down because they know that I'm an archetypal
[56:45.280 --> 56:50.240]  meme or archetypal image now of resistance and liberty and so they can
[56:50.240 --> 56:56.640]  destroy my name and destroy my image they can then make people not feel like
[56:56.640 --> 56:59.840]  they can be leaders or that they can take action they're afraid of you
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.120]  modeling yourselves after our info war which I'm not claiming is perfect but
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.960]  is the most effective out there and becoming even greater than we are and
[57:08.960 --> 57:12.920]  so they want to muddy the waters and make it all about Alex Jones I think
[57:12.920 --> 57:16.840]  that's part of it too just to like intimidate people to create a
[57:16.840 --> 57:24.840]  controversy but there it is ladies and gentlemen you not just YouTube ads owned
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.160]  by Google we're now noticing with Google ads if you search Alex Jones or you're
[57:29.160 --> 57:37.920]  on a page about Alex Jones there's CIA ads in Google ads unbelievable so just
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.520]  amazing all right we're gonna come back with Ed Asner and more of your calls

[58:10.720 --> 58:18.160]  responders a platform to tell their story Whitman EPA director on the 18th
[58:18.160 --> 58:24.120]  made a statement that the air was safe to breathe this film follows the growing
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.600]  momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against
[58:28.600 --> 58:32.400]  their global masters he had his hand over the radio while he was getting a
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.120]  countdown he takes his hand off and you hear three two one and it was boom boom

[58:52.520 --> 58:57.600]  terror they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[58:57.600 --> 59:06.880]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[59:10.960 --> 59:18.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[59:18.760 --> 59:26.240]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[59:26.240 --> 59:39.400]  Alex Jones well for the next 30 minutes we're joined by screen legend of movies
[59:39.400 --> 59:47.240]  and television Ed Avner then in the next hour Kevin Ryan is joining us he worked
[59:47.240 --> 59:50.760]  for underwriting laboratories and of course found out they had an internal
[59:50.760 --> 59:54.040]  report about the impossibility of the collapse of all three of the towers and
[59:54.040 --> 59:57.960]  then when he went public with their internal report he was fired so that is
[59:57.960 --> 1:00:07.000]  coming up as well it's sad timing but it is apropos timing to have Ed Asner on
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:14.600]  today because we've now had the Israeli bombardment start two days ago of Gaza
[1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:19.120]  entering over a thousand killing more than 300 and that's sad escalation we've
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:24.800]  had India and Pakistan almost coming to blows over the weekend we've had the
[1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:29.720]  United States running this NATO sneak attack on South Ossetia against Russian
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:34.200]  forces it's like somebody flipped a switch is this what Joe Biden talked
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:40.960]  about that that would be so unpopular once Obama got in he's got his ear to
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:44.760]  the ground there in Hollywood maybe he knows also the former head of the screen
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:49.800]  actors Guild the list goes on and on he really needs no introduction and Asner
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:54.400]  thanks for coming on sir thanks for having me so much is going on what do
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:01:01.040]  you want to talk about first well I wasn't as aware of the news headlines
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:06.880]  that you've been giving for the last few minutes so I'm kind of reeling and
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:16.040]  shocked I wouldn't know where to begin you name it let's get into 9-11 truth
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.760]  first and then when we come back we'll get into the situation in Israel and the
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:25.720]  situation with India and Pakistan building up troops on their borders and
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:29.880]  why this is suddenly all happening in your opinion but 9-11 truth itself why
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:39.360]  did you take the plunge and get involved with 9-11 truth Ed well the the
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:50.360]  impossibility of it all consternated me and I could not accept the the the
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:57.040]  media truth about it and this was later substantiated by the fumbling
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:04.640]  9-11 Commission which even admitted that it did not have all the facts it
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:10.600]  certainly did not take the witnesses that it should have taken and did not get
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:18.160]  testimony from high official them in Washington either so I you know I I
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:24.280]  questioned myself and the rest of the 9-11 movement at how much there is a
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:35.080]  standing alone and trying to present some of the facts to unaware observers
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:42.480]  and watching their disbelief at hearing me espouse anything besides what is
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:49.200]  printed as the official truth so you're challenging the official orthodoxy and
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:54.760]  now we've seen people like Heath oberman cover what cyhurst reported on three
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:59.400]  months ago the fact that dick cheney planned to stage attacks on us ships
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:07.120]  with navy seals dressed up dressed up like Iranians and fake patrol boats and
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:12.840]  and and now we see the term false flag where was that where was where was that
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:18.440]  published that was covered by cyhurst in a speech he gave and then it was
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:24.880]  covered by Keith oberman on his news program but then it got almost no
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:29.760]  coverage after that but I mean my point is is that finally finally we're seeing
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:33.360]  that the public and even the mainstream media start to understand that false
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:38.960]  flag terror is a real part of statecraft well if they didn't learn it after the
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:47.400]  truth about Vietnam then they'll they'll never learn and I I I think that
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:56.280]  Americans who have lived in this bubble of of the city on the hill find it so
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:01.920]  impossible to believe that anything that kind of skull duckery could take place
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:08.160]  within this great people's democracy stay there mr. asner hello friends this
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:12.040]  is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:15.640]  and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:19.160]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:22.920]  own bread you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.440]  of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected
[1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:30.000]  representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.720]  ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:38.240]  voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.000]  owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.800]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.600]  necessity particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.560]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:58.960]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:02.840]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:06.040]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:09.720]  shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:13.800]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:17.800]  zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and
[1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:21.800]  paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:25.440]  self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important
[1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:28.560]  for you understand that by having a supply of storable food the government
[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:32.080]  the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:35.560]  mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:39.840]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still

[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:47.600]  American actor known for his Emmy winning role in Lou Grant and the Mary
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:52.840]  Tyler Moore show the spinoff series Lou Grant he also appeared as a recurring
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:59.760]  star as Wilson White the television series studio 60 on the sunset strip and
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:06.760]  it just goes on and on in countless films I love the role he played in JFK with
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:11.080]  Oliver Stone just fantastic and he is with us but he's also an activist an
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:15.440]  activist against mercury and vaccines decades ago and really nobody else was
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:20.280]  covering it he's an anti-war activist and he's just done a lot of great work
[1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.920]  that's why the mainstream corporate media is attacking you know overall at
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.000]  asner a lot of Democrats a lot of liberals a lot of progressives had
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.440]  hoped and I am obviously people couldn't vote for McCain they couldn't
[1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:35.520]  validate eight years of George Bush a lot of people said well we'll we'll give
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:40.800]  Barack Obama a shot he's now appointed a guy who is for expanding NAFTA and GATT
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.040]  so he he has flip-flopped and in his and you know as his advisor said a few
[1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:50.200]  months ago he said don't worry he's just that's just rhetoric about ending NAFTA
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:55.720]  and GATT he's continuing the warrantless spying on the American people he's
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:00.800]  saying that he is basically going to keep the Secretary of Defense on that
[1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:06.520]  they're going to beef up troops in Afghanistan that I mean just everything
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:11.760]  he's doing is a betrayal of what he said he was going to do and it appears that
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.800]  all of this naked imperialism is actually going to continue Ed Asner
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:24.840]  your response to that well I missed your question I was busy asking you one
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:32.280]  what what was what's Obama's statement on the continuing warrantless spying well
[1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:36.680]  you know he's saying that saying that they're going to continue it
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:48.720]  oh I wasn't aware of that and I'm shocked and horribly disappointed and what
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:55.280]  else can I say except that that's not who I was voting for well what about
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.920]  Barack Obama when it comes to the military he says he wants a bigger U.S.
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:04.760]  military and wants to go into more nations like Afghanistan I would call
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:13.480]  upon him to read Eisenhower's last speech and hear what a general had to say
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:21.880]  about involving us in the military-industrial complex and how this
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:29.760]  country won't be free until we break free from that imposition of the military
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:36.720]  industrial complex it probably continues to what will feed the warrantless spying
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:44.840]  on Americans it will continue having us shed lives both foreign and domestic in
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:53.400]  outside our our national territory and if it it's going to be war as usual then
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:10:01.040]  I wasted a vote again well mr. Asner have you seen the reports about how they
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:05.760]  plan to put 20,000 combat troops on the streets of America to quote deal with
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:15.360]  insurrection and economic collapse yeah I realize that came under George Bush and
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:24.360]  does President Obama plan to maintain that facility oh yes he says he's going
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:33.920]  to expand it expand it put more troops on American streets yes sir well then once
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:40.040]  again another disappointment I look at it sounds like a twilight zone episode it
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:50.400]  does it does and I I read a comment the other day that I think sums it all up
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:11:00.320]  that when white men as usual have screwed up our country that the people in a
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:10.000]  silent mass think they will resort to trying an outlier such as a woman or a
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:20.960]  minority race to see if the cards can be shuffled again and I think in this
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.240]  particular case as we've seen with Colin Powell as we've seen with Condoleezza
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:38.640]  Rice I believe Harry Bellafonte referred to Colin Powell as a plantation type
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:50.120]  person so did Ralph Nader he said he said I hope that that Barack Obama will be
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:55.080]  this great leader and and do the right thing but if he doesn't he's going to
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:58.800]  be an uncle Tom and then he was attacked for that but that's that's just a
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:04.400]  historical term you know going back to a novel written about that as you know so
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:14.120]  and the media sure piled on to to Ralph Nader well you know as well as I know
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:20.320]  that when you speak unconventional truth the media will come in like a pack of
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:27.960]  hordes Ed Asner that brings me to my next question the the newspapers are
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:34.760]  imploding television ratings are imploding the people in every major
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:40.200]  poll do not trust the corporate controlled media anymore how long can the
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:47.240]  establishment go on doing things that are unconstitutional and 180 degrees away
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.920]  from what the people want I mean the parlor trick of a black president if
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:55.600]  there's no substance as you were saying that's going to wear off very quick so
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:01.320]  where is this crisis of confidence going when Congress has in a 9% approval
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:07.960]  rating but just continues to go against the people well I think what we're
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:15.800]  witnessing Alex is the end of the American Empire it it affects your average
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:21.720]  American with the unemployment and the and the collapse of the security of
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:28.840]  security the financial sector in our in our country with with the the gross
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:36.920]  unemployment the the balance of trade the the dollar still being maintained as
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:49.000]  the world's currency but it's a lie while it's being maintained I think that the
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.040]  American people in general are in a state of shock and awe not knowing where
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:14:00.880]  to turn how to develop resources to combat this they've they've lost the
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:08.280]  ability to organize and to march and to demonstrate and to protest because they
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:16.000]  are in in in many ways scatter shop thinking some will be fascist some will
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:22.920]  be communists and finding unity in the people is probably one of the most
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:28.160]  difficult objects to pursue right now because of all the creature comforts
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:35.040]  Americans have enjoyed up until this point I guess when we suffer enough maybe
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:41.920]  out of that will come a leader who will point out the fatal flaws of this
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:50.080]  structure and set enough people a fire to try to correct it we'll never have a
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:57.040]  perfection no country can possibly expect perfection because it's dependent
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:03.040]  upon man but this is the opposite of perfection I know I know it is chaos
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:08.680]  well exactly it's a bunch of people will wander around trying to find their ass
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:19.080]  with either hand and until finally inspiration if we're lucky settles
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:26.600]  upon us so that we can find some unity some some some concerted thinking some
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:33.040]  concerted action my fear is that with this chaos what comes out of chaos
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:40.080]  generally a dictatorship and the steps that you elicited before are certainly
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:45.680]  initial steps towards dictatorship and if we find that dictatorship and more
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:50.680]  than likely will be a fascist dictatorship well sir you just stole my
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:55.440]  thunder that was my next question generally when an empire implodes the
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:01.720]  paramilitary criminal forces that enforced its empire implode back like a
[1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:08.240]  dwarf son back to the original nation and then and then engage in predatory
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:12.320]  activity at a higher level against their domestic population and that's what I
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:17.120]  see Obama as a puppet of Marionette just like bush was the military
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.600]  industrial complex and that's why the corporates put him in as a bait and
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:26.440]  switch believing that they can carry out a dictatorship of the plutocrats of the
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:33.640]  elite with this quote liberal face as a window dressing and and and the I I
[1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:37.840]  believe you're right I believe that nine times out of ten unless we really speak
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:43.600]  out now that this is going to turn into a something really nasty I know I know
[1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:48.760]  and the next year will be the most important year of all I would say
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:57.840]  because we'll see we'll see how the the the dice roll and I don't have a great
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:05.960]  deal of confidence and they're coming up seven well let's pray for it but but
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:09.760]  like Hunter S. Thompson said you know pray to God but row away from the rocks
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.280]  with the old better one saying trust in God but tie up your camel what can we do
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:22.200]  to stop this from unfolding well keep keep supporting people like you who
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:31.400]  create the contrary views of what mass media covers us with keep trying as
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:36.720]  individuals to seek the truth to find the truth to find the sources of truth
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:47.160]  thank God for email where we can fall privy to unconventional thinking and
[1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:52.680]  until they find the way to make it conventional we should take advantage
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.760]  of it as much as possible that was my next questions like you're pressing it

[1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:24.960]  guests at asner I appreciate coming on the show and I wish him a great new
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:31.320]  year coming up 2009 and you brought up the internet in their attempt to
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:37.280]  restrict it as you know I'm sure they want internet to where the internet is
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.200]  given to private corporations and then the old internet is allowed to basically
[1:22:41.200 --> 1:22:45.440]  be phased out that they're then going to have a government rating system over
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:48.800]  all the websites that's the end of it right there they're going to tax and
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:55.360]  regulate it how important is it to keep the internet free it's it's the first
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:23:03.320]  bastion of freedom of speech at this point in time and if the people allow
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:11.560]  it to be taken from them then we can look upon Congress as a bunch of Roman
[1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:19.040]  senators and Julius Caesar is at their head but Julius Caesar was really
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:23.400]  running something I mean do you think Obama is a puppet because I mean
[1:23:23.400 --> 1:23:26.520]  certainly they're bringing their legions into Rome they've crossed the Rubicon
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.600]  and they're physically deploying troops in the US but it just looks like Obama
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:38.520]  is literally just some little puppet well at this point in time after what
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:44.200]  you've told me today I will tend to agree with you but at the same time the
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:51.240]  man hasn't even taken office yet so I'm I'm waiting to see what the first bill
[1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:56.960]  of fair will have to offer well I think he's gonna get understand is is is my
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.400]  biggest problem and and if he sucks himself into Afghanistan as he says
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:08.600]  then I I I think we're beyond hope well I'm sure you know they just announced
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.680]  last week they are sending an additional 30,000 troops that's doubling the
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:18.400]  number yeah yeah while our European allies are doing everything possible to
[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:24.040]  expedite their departure well why would we want to be in Afghanistan I mean what
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:29.520]  is the point I suppose to prove to the Islamic world that we are still number
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:34.680]  one I mean if you're gonna prove it anywhere it's not gonna be in Israel or
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:39.760]  or the West Bank it's gonna be in Afghanistan and of course with our
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:45.560]  bombing attacks both on the Pakistani border and in Afghanistan itself
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:50.600]  innocents are killed constantly while they're doing that and that merely
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:57.520]  increases geometrically the number of potential Taliban well that's it I had
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:01.320]  General Hamid Ghul the former head of the forces against the Russians with the
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:06.400]  CIA and he said that he said that the CIA knows that when they bomb every week
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:11.160]  weddings on purpose that's the biggest insult that that's meant to stir the
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:22.920]  jihad he's up well then then I guess when what is the old expression let
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:30.200]  everybody kill everybody and the last man alive is king exactly ruling from a
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:36.440]  dung heap man so where do you I mean I where do you see this going I mean
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:42.560]  Obama he's keeping gates on I mean what does that say right there I don't get you
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:51.400]  know you're gonna get a military man in he's not gonna be a a a Jehovah's Witness
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:26:02.320]  preacher so that I expect a military man at least his hands aren't as dirty as
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:08.320]  the previous secretary of defense I agree with you there oh Rumsfeld was so
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:12.280]  evil is so evil you know in closing at as you're I want to get you back up in
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:16.760]  the sometime of the new year for four hours we can take calls I grew up but
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:22.200]  you know being such a big fan of you and I was watching old Mary Tyler Moore
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:28.480]  videos online the other day as you now get them off iTunes and I saw I was
[1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:32.640]  watching Ted Knight and I mean obviously that was a character he was playing but I
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:36.240]  just love Ted Knight can you say something about the late great Ted
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:45.680]  Knight well the delight in working with Ted Knight was seeing how he differed
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:54.400]  from Ted Baxter and and he created that role believe me he was the
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:59.520]  embodiment of that role and the best story I can tell you is that in the
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:06.360]  second year so he came into one of our producers Alan Burns and he was griping
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:10.920]  and groaning and he said he just didn't want to keep on doing it because he he
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.480]  couldn't stand the thought of people thinking that he was as dumb and as
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:25.320]  vain and egotistical as Ted Baxter and the Alan our producer spent a half hour
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:31.920]  convincing him how respected he was and how admired he was and how people did
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:37.320]  not confuse him with the character and finally he had him convinced at that
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:42.720]  point the other producer Jim Brooks walked in he said hey Ted I don't feel to
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:47.160]  be thought of as the biggest schmuck in the world

[1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:58.560]  shell revelations and research dealing with who blew the towers up and how
[1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:02.560]  people are like all that seven years ago that's what operatives say they've
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:07.120]  built the entire new world order police state empire agenda on those stage
[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:11.600]  terror attacks and if we don't expose it those were staged and if we don't at
[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:16.480]  least convict the enemy in the court of public opinion the corporate raiders the
[1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:20.320]  corporate raiders that are taking over the United States are going to get away
[1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:24.840]  with it and they're gonna be able to stage more terror attacks this is life
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:30.480]  and death this has got to be done now and we are gonna continue with the new
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:34.640]  evidence and the investigation and we are never going to surrender and we are
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:37.880]  going to bring the people to justice and carried out these attacks there's been a
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:42.160]  lot of new big developments like firefighter commanders on tape saying
[1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:46.440]  yeah the government was preparing to bring the building down building seven
[1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:51.640]  yes you know we had a plan to bring the building down of course they blew up
[1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:54.320]  building seven but the point is we're going to continue with the evidence of
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:33:01.240]  that interesting to get Ed Asner on today I wanted to get him on to talk
[1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:06.160]  about Obama and his sellout but we're gonna have him on a few months after
[1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:10.560]  that's even more obvious because Ed's a you know leader in the progressive
[1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:13.840]  movement as they call it and that's gonna be important because I know he'll
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:18.960]  tell it like it is when Obama completely shows himself as a treasonous
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:22.760]  larcenist traitor and a frontman puppet of the New World Order we'll have

[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:08.480]  possible and I want to thank all of you now on the financial end of the news
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:20.800]  before I take some of the calls from Brian Betty Matt Don Jim and others you
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:25.800]  know I hate to get up on air and say see I told you so over and over again
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:29.800]  because I don't take any pleasure saying see I told you they were getting the
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:37.520]  military ready to basically bring in martial law in the United States I don't
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:43.200]  take any pleasure in being right about that now it's all over the news I didn't
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:48.720]  take any pleasure being called a cook and a nut and a liar I mean I had so many
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.800]  other radio hosts and I do interviews and newspapers call me an idiot call me a
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:59.960]  liar or say I was crazy it wouldn't matter how many government documents I
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.000]  had how many police chiefs or sheriffs or emergency managers I interviewed how
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.800]  many times I got footage of urban warfare drills how many times I got
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:16.200]  threatened over it or beat up over it and now it's all happening this long
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:23.480]  strategic plan is coming to a head and it's horrifying because it's just gonna
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:29.520]  get worse and worse until people grow up and deal with what's happening I mean
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:32.880]  remember FBI remember police when all your training manual said we were crazy
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:37.240]  none of this existed and now it's just all it's all admitted and they've been
[1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:41.600]  setting it up covertly for years and you knew all about it and you you've
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:46.720]  decided to go with the New World Order well maybe I'm your conscience that's
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:53.240]  what the show acts for you know that's our job access just so you were put on
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:58.360]  notice that consciously that you were reminded of your oath and reminded of
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:02.840]  what you were part of so some of you can be on the side of good and some of you
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:06.480]  I guess will make the conscious decision listening to this to serve evil or to
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:12.320]  rationalize what you're doing but that little voice in your gut a little voice
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.920]  in the back of your mind it's telling you that I'm telling the truth but you
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:22.800]  don't have to trust your gut anymore it's all out in the open now in hundreds
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:26.360]  of third world countries sometimes over and over again in the case of Argentina
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:33.280]  was first world now third world or Brazil or in the case of Nigeria or
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:38.160]  former first world nations like South Africa this is done over and over and
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:43.240]  over again the IMF and World Bank come in they buy off the government they have
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:48.480]  the government sign loan sharking deals with the private IMF and World Bank who
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:55.080]  then issue them currency loans on currency that's out of thin air they in the
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:40:00.280]  secret IMF World Bank agreements that have now been public been in the BBC one
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:04.520]  of many places it's been documented they make a deal they say we'll give you
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:08.000]  this two billion this four billion this five billion bucks backed up by US
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.400]  taxpayers predominantly we're about 60% of IMF World Bank investment but private
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:19.640]  banks get the money to loan you will be given this money you will be given this
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:24.720]  cash but you can't pay it back and you've got to sign an agreement that when
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:28.480]  you don't pay it back at 30% interest so a billion bucks can turn into 50
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:31.360]  billion in the case of Nigeria it's like a billion and a half dollars it's over
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:36.480]  50 billion now 20 years later that everything your mind your roads your
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:41.000]  land your government buildings everything is owned by us and that the IMF and
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.440]  World Bank will control your country's curriculum what your children are taught
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:51.160]  what your Planned Parenthood operations are that's all in State Department
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:41:01.240]  memorandum 200 well now I mean now it's happening here and we knew all of this
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:04.720]  globalism all of this militarizing the police all of this building up the
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:09.160]  prisons all of this was getting ready to bring down the big prize and that was
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:15.280]  the United States of America and folks almost every port is Chinese Arab
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.960]  German Dutch French owned almost every water district in the country is now
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.080]  foreign owned because they it's foreign banks that own our private Federal
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:29.600]  Reserve they own the money machines and the globalists want to conquer this
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:33.960]  country and they're doing it economically but they know that it's
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:37.400]  illegitimate fraud so that we try to rise up and say no to the corporate
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:41.880]  takeover they'll then sick the paramilitary police on us it's real
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:45.560]  simple police and military you work for offshore criminals and of hijacked the
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:49.160]  nation it's a corporate takeover do you understand that you get that through
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:56.840]  your pea brain and they're going to take your pension funds cash-strap states
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.200]  way selling roads and parks and I've got a New York Times article about handing
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:07.000]  over city buildings to them Minnesota is deep in the hole financially but the
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:13.640]  state still owns a premier golf resort as sprawling amateur sports complex that
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:18.080]  citizens get to use that we paid for a big airport a major zoo and land holding
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:23.800]  the size of Central American country of beliefs valuables like these are in for
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:30.240]  a closer look as 44 states coped with deficits and see they they wrote this
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:35.200]  where it sounds like oh they don't get a golf course you know I love how they'll
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:40.040]  bitch and gripe all over us news about
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:47.680]  about a $250,000 renovation of the legislative lounge at the Texas
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:52.920]  Capitol that's nothing they need to have a nice lounge world leaders go there
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:58.520]  and I'm actually all four historic buildings being kept up but see they'll
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:01.920]  have everybody obsessed over 240 something thousand or whatever it is
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:06.720]  instead of trillions sucked out through the comprehensive annual financial
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:11.280]  reports out of Texas in the last five years alone to offshore banks oh go ahead
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:15.760]  and steal trillions from Texas go ahead and go take state lands and give it to
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:21.000]  oil companies go ahead and just loot the state Treasury and then they'll have
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.320]  cops go out and squeeze money on a little old ladies were going five miles
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:29.880]  over the speed limit to then give that to the Texas Treasury which then goes to
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:33.880]  offshore banks by the way you know before the cops if you're going ten
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.400]  miles over the speed limit they would give you a ticket and that's reasonable
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:42.840]  you know that's to be dangerous now they wait on 360 for when you go down the
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:47.320]  hill on the hills and they wait it you know parked in the bushes for when you
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:51.600]  go downhill and they're waiting giving people tickets for going five miles over
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:55.440]  the speed limit it's about squeezing money meanwhile the government has
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:00.360]  completely been seized by private corporations and is engaged in mass
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:06.400]  crime in front of everyone and nothing's happening I digress it doesn't
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:13.120]  matter I want to go to your calls but valuables like these are in for a
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:17.880]  closer look is 44 states couple deficits yeah don't cut back on the size of the
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:22.280]  stinking government or don't go get all the real investments in the in the
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:27.120]  comprehensive angle financial reports God forbid that let's just continue
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.120]  sucking our thumbs here and allowing this to expand just hand everything over
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:39.600]  then it goes into roads water districts schools in New York Democratic
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:43.880]  governor David Patterson who's just passed 88 new taxes appointed a
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:49.640]  commission to look into leasing state assets including the tapin Z bridge
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:56.480]  north of New York City the lottery golf courses toll roads parks and beaches
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:01.080]  recommendations expected next month so see it's a fire sale you see these are
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:06.040]  key infrastructures and there's been studies done with Indiana and Texas and
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:10.200]  New Jersey where they'll take a toll road that's worth $20 million in one
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:16.520]  case and they'll sell it for 500 million so see this isn't even selling assets
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:21.880]  this is just basically acting like they're allowed to rob the bank oh you
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:26.760]  paid me a dollar I'm the bank teller so I give you a million you know they're
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:30.200]  just acting like there's a transaction going on here the people that put them
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:33.680]  in office are now saying okay give me everything and they're going here's the
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:37.240]  roads here's the water districts here's the power plants here's everything for
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:44.680]  one penny on the dollar and it lists everything it's just it's just everything
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:50.840]  just roads schools government buildings just total thievery and that's why
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:54.320]  they're shifting over to mercenaries because you've literally got just king
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:59.320]  pens private corporations with their own private armies who are above the law
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:04.920]  and above the military and police I mean this country is literally turning into
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.600]  Mad Maxville and the public hadn't figured this out yet they're still and
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:11.560]  again I'm not bashing football ladies and gentlemen people keep thinking that
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:16.320]  I'm against sports itself I'm against that people cry and yell and scream and
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:20.800]  get upset over football or baseball or basketball but they don't care that their
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:26.400]  whole birthright has been stolen from them and and they think it's manly to
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:31.000]  be into sports it's manly to care about liberty and freedom and not be a schmuck
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.080]  and be involved and informed and stand up for your nation and your people and
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:41.160]  not be a slave it's manly to be involved in humanity and standing up for the
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:46.560]  innocent it's manly to stand up against the CPS kidnapping children outside due
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:51.200]  process it's manly to expose the government is illegitimate and ships in
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:47:05.680]  narcotics into this nation it's manly to fight the new world order I want to go
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:11.480]  to Ted Anderson right now Ted all over the world the head of the IMF the head
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:14.360]  of the World Bank the head of the Canadian government the head of the
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:18.160]  British government I watch CNN this weekend they had all these financial
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:24.000]  advisors on the show that billerberg group reporter on there and it's they're
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:27.280]  the ones fear mongering they're the ones nine ten weeks ago that said we were
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:31.000]  gonna have a depression if people didn't pass the banker takeover that killed
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.920]  all final confidence the economy has had its blood supply turned off and still I
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.400]  don't think the public realizes how serious this is Ted they they I agree
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:43.720]  with you I don't think they really do I mean even I mean everybody that's
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:46.720]  listening to this know this because they've been at the relatives house over
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:50.560]  the weekend and they know that the subject matter is coming up and
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.800]  everybody's concerned about the economy but they don't understand the concept of
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:48:00.240]  how serious this really is you know it's it you watch like you are reading all
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:04.000]  these different solutions to the problem let's sell off the golf courses and sell
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:08.360]  off the lot reason do you know I you know just have a fire sale a big garage
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:12.160]  sale of all the assets of the United States of America so we can bail out our
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:17.200]  problems and nobody you know in the mainstream media is willing to address
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.920]  the real problem that is a that's causing us and that's those bankings the
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:27.160]  this banking economy that we have the Federal Reserve system and the and the
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:32.200]  foreign ownership and the IMF just like you're saying Alex is that the well for
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.760]  some reason they want to it's like there's a big elephant in the room and
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:38.360]  they want to tiptoe around it that they don't want to they don't want to go
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:42.200]  okay this is I mean this is classical looting when you've got a 20 million dollar
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.680]  road over the 50 years and they sell it for 500 million this is like selling a
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:51.880]  house for $10 when it's worth a million they're not this is just looting and
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:55.880]  thieving and stealing as private interests that have gotten all their
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:00.320]  goons in power hand over all the infrastructure to them just like when
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.720]  Russia collapsed in the mid 90s and the oligarchs came in and you know one guy
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:09.680]  for ten million dollars would buy a trillion dollars worth of oil he was
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:15.560]  just given it they the Rothschilds are looting this country stay there the
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:20.960]  headlines are clear the worldwide economic collapse is here the military is

[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:26.800]  you understand folks they're taking infrastructure that will pay money
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:32.280]  generation after generation and irrevocably the many cases are just
[1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:37.440]  selling it to foreign interest and they're the foreign interest that took
[1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:41.040]  all the comprehensive annual financial report money that took the tens of
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:44.880]  trillions that took the it's got to be well over 10 trillion eight point five
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:49.000]  trillions last number we got three weeks ago of banker bailout money and the
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.920]  bankers are just telling congress sit down and shut up we own and run
[1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:55.680]  everything and then meanwhile they're taking that money and there's so many
[1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:58.800]  different levels of fraud number one they own the government so the
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:01.000]  governments are giving them the infrastructure for pennies on the
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:05.080]  dollar but then the money they've got to buy it up was stolen from us to begin
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:09.880]  with and we've got to pay that money back in taxes I mean these people run
[1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:17.600]  scams that Ted I mean these are quadruple scams it makes it makes a it
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:22.640]  makes a Ponzi look like a look like a saint is what it does I mean the United
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:27.840]  States of America for whatever reasons handed over the power to create its own
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:32.960]  currency to this group in 1913 and now they've just gone completely wild I mean
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:36.880]  now they're now they're just but Ted I'm gonna shut up because we're almost out
[1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:39.400]  of time and I want to come back and take a few calls and get our guests on and I
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:43.640]  just keep foaming at the mouth of this subject bottom line you've got gold and
[1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:47.920]  silver at prices that no one's gonna find it because gold is up over a hundred
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:51.760]  eighty dollars the last three weeks it's up fifty bucks from last week forty
[1:53:51.760 --> 1:53:55.400]  five dollars from last week last time I checked it's up at like eight seventy
[1:53:55.400 --> 1:54:02.160]  something today but Ted you bought gold when it was low now you were selling it
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:05.760]  a few weeks ago at seven hundred dollars price when it was seven fifty now
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.200]  it's eight seventy something and you're selling it at what level well here's what
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:14.600]  I have I've got I've got the Franks are at two oh five which is only two dollars
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:18.280]  higher than they were when I was when I was you know when I was talking about the
[1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:23.360]  Franks last time so what level was that factor well that gets it 75 yeah 775 right
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.960]  around that range because you know it so you have you have gold priced in one
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:33.600]  hundred dollars cheaper than it's being sold for right now British sovereigns
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:38.120]  again just two dollars more than what they were two fifty four I mean the thing
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:41.400]  about it is Alex is that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that you got
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:45.600]  to buy in these dips and I'm buying as much as I can and I just you know how
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:49.640]  long will that hold out that will hold that up until tonight for sure and then
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:52.800]  maybe who knows I mean let's be clear people didn't listen when he were
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:57.920]  selling it for 704 when it was seven fifty now it's you know 880 and you're
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:02.120]  selling it at a 775 level it's only gonna go up ladies and gentlemen that's
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:06.000]  what all the smart money's on because they're debasing the dollar they're
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.360]  destroying the United States at least you can hurt the banker bastards by not
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:14.040]  letting them catch you individually with your pants down what do you got on the
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:18.520]  silver front Ted well the silver again same coin I was offering before the
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:23.640]  the walking Liberty half it's at 840 and I can't say it enough Alex gold or
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:28.720]  silver went up over $11 today and that price hasn't changed so you still got it
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.000]  factored in from when silver was a lot less how long can you hold on the
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.240]  half dollars well the half dollars gonna be good I picked up about 10 bags of
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:39.480]  those and as soon as those are sold then I'm done and then you got one more you
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:45.560]  got 50 more of the buffaloes which you can't find anywhere except for huge
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:51.080]  premiums there is no premium on these Ted is selling you these for what he got
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:56.320]  them I was talking to Ted this weekend Chad has some deals I'm not gonna say
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:00.360]  the name of the deal where it's actually under but the point is I'm afraid to
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.880]  even plug it we can't offer that one deal can we Ted well we I don't have
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:08.440]  enough to go around I mean I've got a few small little coins here and there we
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:12.480]  advertise them on the on the commercials people call they get them well the
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:16.360]  bottom line is folks you cannot beat the deal on the buffaloes they have 50 of
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:22.040]  them 800 686 2237 the brokers will be there until midnight tonight give them a

[1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:40.080]  Alex Jones you know what I've got to do I just got to have a day this week or
[1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:45.640]  two where there's no guest we already had Ed Asner on we've got Kevin Ryan
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:50.480]  coming up for 50 minutes we've got the young man in high school fighting the
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:56.800]  New World Order Robert Wannick we got Tommy Pallada in studio Hollywood
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:01.720]  producer anti-New World Order guy he was in town right now
[1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:07.800]  who's in the Netherlands now over there working with a film company and I thought
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:13.040]  why not have you in studio orbit through town once a year might as well have you
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:16.080]  in studio so that's coming up the last 40 minutes today we're gonna live at
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:22.760]  prisonplanet.tv in about five six minutes starting the next segment for
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:26.320]  the prisonplanet.tv viewers but Ted I'm you know you try to get on the air and
[1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:30.640]  then I end up hyperventilating and talking over you I cannot describe how
[1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:35.560]  unbelievable it is as everything is handed over to private corporations who
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:40.080]  then operate as governments not only do the bankers get all the roads the land
[1:59:40.080 --> 1:59:43.560]  everything they then are given government power and then I guess this is
[1:59:43.560 --> 1:59:47.360]  too complex for the general public to figure out I mean this this is this is
[1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:51.400]  off the charts Ted they're looting us worse than a third-world nation they
[1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:55.880]  are beating us like a red-headed stepchild well it that that's the
[1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:59.520]  that's the sick part of this whole thing I mean the first of all the money
[1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:03.280]  itself the paper currency that we trade in our pockets is really made out of
[2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:07.960]  cotton we grow that cotton with that money that that cotton that's grown and
[2:00:07.960 --> 2:00:12.000]  turned into a fabric it's sent over to Washington DC right through the Bureau
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:16.080]  of Engraving the government does print the money but they can't even use the
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:18.920]  money they have to send it over to the Federal Reserve and then they have to
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:24.720]  take it back on loan and we have to pay that interest in taxes to service the
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:28.560]  debt on that loan I mean it's crazy it's our labor that created it in the first
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:32.480]  place why do they get it for nothing and then why do they get to lend it to us I
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:37.140]  mean it from and then and then you take it a step further than that I mean these
[2:00:37.140 --> 2:00:41.600]  people are siphoning off the very wealth of this entire nation and now we're
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:46.160]  turning to them for help I mean my god what we need to do is get rid of them we
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:50.240]  that's why I say it's like having an elephant in the room I watched this all
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:53.760]  the mainstream media talking about solving the problem this way now you're
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:57.200]  talking about having a garage so who you think we're gonna sell these assets to
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:01.840]  they're gonna own us they already do we work for them when you pay your taxes
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:06.600]  you're working 40 you know you're working when you pay your taxes you write
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:12.640]  Federal Reserve it is a private bank we are conquered and and they still say the
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:16.280]  new order doesn't exist they're not putting troops on the streets while they
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:19.760]  announce it see that's psych warfare we're putting troops on the streets it's
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.320]  for your own good it doesn't exist anyone that says it exists is crazy I
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:28.280]  mean this is such an insult and and and you know Ted I of course I'm pitching
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:33.400]  gold and silver here but I believe in it passionately I told people buy it when
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:39.200]  it was $300 an ounce six years ago you know it's been up to a thousand one
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:43.160]  hundred it's headed that way again regardless at least it's got some real
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:49.120]  value that's what this is all about ladies and gentlemen and I just hope
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:53.640]  that people will protect themselves Ted and they certainly do need to protect
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:57.280]  themselves because the institutions they've relied upon all these years are
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:01.760]  not protecting them they need to get themselves on a gold standard they need
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:06.520]  to put their own money into a gold standard because the nation is not
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:10.040]  going to do it for them which is what should be we're not getting the nation
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:14.000]  back to we admit we have been totally conquered by an offshore banks they've
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:18.320]  used corporate takeover tactics to take over that's why the Federal Reserve has
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:22.360]  their minions at every public school every college and on media telling
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:26.120]  everybody that we're the government we love you we're gonna fix the banking
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:30.440]  crisis when they have engineered the whole stinking thing because they know
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:34.400]  they either take the whole world they either go for broke or they're gonna go
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:38.200]  to prison they have passed the point of no return it's like they've already robbed
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:43.880]  one bank why not rob ten they are going for broke they have nothing to lose and
[2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:47.960]  they're using north com to hold the American people hostage it's not our
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:52.640]  government it's not our military and our and the military needs to realize that
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:56.920]  and realize they've been hijacked because they're only destroying their own
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:03.800]  future give Ted's brokers a call at 800 686 2237 at for gold $100 below what
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:07.400]  it's currently selling for that's the price it's factored in that Ted thank
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:12.120]  you so much for coming on with us thanks Alex for having me up 800 686 2237
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:17.000]  we'll be right back hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.880]  time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:23.320]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:26.560]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.080]  you'll never have to go to the super go and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:34.000]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.520]  wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:41.360]  screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:46.240]  $850 billion at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:50.440]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:54.400]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:59.120]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:07.360]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:11.200]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:14.800]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:18.920]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:22.960]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:26.640]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:31.000]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.720]  of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:42.040]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:45.360]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know e
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.160]  foods direct comm is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:53.000]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half

[2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:25.920]  step is getting storeable food from his central Texas command center deep
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:32.200]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:51.880]  radio network
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:56.960]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are live here at prisonplanet.tv for the
[2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:01.600]  next hour and 51 minutes of the four-hour radio show we do live every
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:07.960]  weekday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time four hours live but again
[2:06:07.960 --> 2:06:14.920]  we go live in the last two hours of the radio show at prisonplanet.tv for all
[2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:18.560]  the folks watching out there on the internet we're also developing this
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:25.800]  show for cable and satellite television in the next few months as well as
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:32.000]  another TV program that we are developing here out of the same studios we're
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:37.760]  joined for the next 50 minutes by Kevin Ryan Kevin Ryan of course was an
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:41.360]  engineer working in underwriting laboratories and discovered internal
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:46.040]  studies that had been done by the underwriters which is underwriting
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:51.200]  laboratories of the towers that clearly showed that fire could not have brought
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:55.760]  those buildings down the way that the government was claiming so he tried to
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:59.440]  get them to go public they wouldn't he wrote a letter to them publicly about
[2:06:59.440 --> 2:07:02.480]  it and they fired him so I think it's better for Kevin Ryan to introduce
[2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:07.320]  himself some of his background the saga he's been through and the amazing
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:13.480]  research he's done not just in a thermite and thermate and explosives and
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:19.040]  the testing of that but who at NIST is involved in the cover-up they just so
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:24.600]  happen to be thermate experts in their own right with NASA and other groups for
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:31.280]  missile coupler separation seals and a lot more so we'll it's been about six
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:35.640]  months since he dropped those original bombshells here on air he of course works
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:39.120]  with architects and engineers from 9-11 truth and other groups and we are very
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:44.080]  very honored to have Kevin Ryan on the show with us today Kevin good to talk
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:49.160]  to you again hi Alex it's good to be with you again you bet you got the floor
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:54.120]  describe a little bit about yourself kind of a recap of this quest you've
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:08:00.520]  been on and what it's led you to today and the latest developments okay I was
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:05.240]  as you said fired from underwriters laboratories and that was over four
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:11.400]  years ago in 2004 and I had been questioning them for about a year or so
[2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:19.560]  about the fire resistance testing that they did 40 years before for the World
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:23.200]  Trade Center towers they had done fire resistance testing of the steel
[2:08:23.200 --> 2:08:28.880]  components used to build the World Trade Center towers and the CEO had told us
[2:08:28.880 --> 2:08:35.240]  about it and I had spoken with the fire resistance testing manager at the time
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:41.800]  about it and they were reluctant to share that information publicly so we
[2:08:41.800 --> 2:08:49.960]  were asking myself and one or two others in the UL about that testing and why
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:56.560]  the towers could possibly have failed from fire as a result and couldn't get
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.960]  any answers from the upper management so I went ahead and wrote a letter to the
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:05.240]  National Institute of Standards and Technology after I saw one of their draft
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:10.560]  reports which I think we've seen now over the years that leave a lot lacking
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:16.480]  and this reports are completely false each one of them has been false and
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:20.280]  they've contradicted each other but when they first put out a draft report in
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:25.360]  October 2004 I wrote them a letter that got me fired from underwriters
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:29.760]  laboratories where I was laboratory manager in the top manager for one of
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:35.960]  their divisions I've since done a lot of writing and research on 9-11 become the
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:41.840]  co-editor of the Journal of 9-11 Studies with Steven Jones a few years ago I am a
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:46.440]  member of architects and engineers for 9-11 truth we also have a local group
[2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:50.760]  here where I live called the 9-11 working group and so I do a lot of writing
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:55.800]  research presentations around the country and whatever I can to get the truth out
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:03.240]  about 9-11 why did you first question the collapse of the towers as an
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:07.440]  engineer and then let's walk through you know the evidence of cover up trying to
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:11.120]  suppress you and others and the end and kind of a recap of the evidence that has
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:16.080]  come out that continues to make a compelling case for control demolition
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:23.000]  and then the new research that's been developed that is well in a who done it
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:28.600]  since bombshell but then this isn't a who done it this isn't you know some
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:34.640]  PBS mystery theater this is the real world this is inside job material and
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:42.160]  and this shakes the very foundation of our world to its core well yeah and the
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:47.240]  reason I first started questioning it was for I think a number of the reasons
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:51.680]  that you do what you do Alex and trying to get the word out getting people
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:58.600]  prepared for a pretty big transition here in society and you know it's coming
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:03.200]  there's nothing we can really do about it but it is important to be aware of the
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:07.960]  facts of what has happened over the last few years and try to prepare ourselves
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:15.080]  for the future and so you know the first things that I noticed were if this
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:19.760]  steel has been tested for fire resistance for for a number of hours in
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:24.600]  fact in furnaces at temperatures that exceeded the temperatures that we all
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:30.880]  agreed actually existed in the towers and how could the towers have failed
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:35.560]  from fire those questions were not answered and they still have not been
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:42.360]  answered and this group has done a lot of tap dancing about the issue and they've
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:45.720]  given us a number of false stories I was about to say they're constantly
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:49.120]  changing their story it's always something new and now they are admitting
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:54.680]  freefall of building seven they're having to admit molten steel I mean the
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:12:00.040]  laws of science are against them if you know absolutely they are and so you
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:03.160]  know ultimately they do have to admit all those things but there was a
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:09.800]  presentation that was occurring you know you since 2002 when they started their
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:14.560]  report their investigation and then you know this year when they finally put out
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:18.680]  the World Trade Center 7 report it was always kind of a piecemeal presentation
[2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:22.280]  almost as if they were asking us do you believe this they'd have a they'd have a
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:28.160]  public media presentation they say what about this trial balloons yeah you know
[2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:32.120]  and some of us like myself would speak up and say hey that's not going to work
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:37.600]  and then they'd come up with something different and with World Trade Center 7
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:42.040]  is nothing more blatant than that and they came up with the diesel fuel story
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:46.680]  it was certainly the diesel fuel and and all of the major media reported this
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:52.520]  over and over again or it was the scooped out theory the the towers had
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:56.160]  fallen and they've now reversed themselves on all of that yeah then it
[2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:00.120]  was shoddy construction when the building was overbuilt as you know have you
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:06.040]  seen the new video with Brian Williams on there interviewing the deputy
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:09.920]  fire chief one of the commanders who says well we were ready to bring it down
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:16.120]  you know there was talk of us bringing it down ourselves I mean how many videos
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:19.800]  does it take a police environment saying the feds were getting ready to bring it
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:24.480]  down I mean not just Silverstein I mean do we have to have like a footage of
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:31.560]  Bush with a plunger right the extent of the coverup is is really so incredible
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:35.480]  and and I think that's part of the value of 9-11 truth you know I'm
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:42.320]  interested in how this much deception could have been carried on for so long
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:48.000]  and how each of us as the listeners of this story you know kind of participated
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:55.960]  or some of us in allowing it to to be just a huge lie for so long so I'm
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:59.320]  interested in that sort of thing as well but mainly the physical research that
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:04.040]  we're doing now has to do with the alternative hypothesis and now really
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:08.840]  the only not only hypothesis but theory since it's got so much evidence the
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:13.000]  demolition theory or what I call the deceptive demolition theory so that
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:17.520]  people don't forget that there was it's really based on deception now this is
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:21.600]  like the theory of gravity it's been proven but it you know they kind of call
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:25.560]  it a law but but but it started out as a theory you know the public thinks
[2:14:25.560 --> 2:14:29.720]  conspiracy and theory the number one there's no government conspiracies though
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:33.920]  history is full of them and you know Nixon got in trouble for government
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:38.040]  conspiracy and then they said there's no such thing as theories well we know the
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.280]  official theory of why these towers turned into matchsticks and dust we know
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:47.440]  that's a fraud so we set about going okay what is the evidence show is the
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:52.560]  most probable hypothesis and there you have it right and it's going to be it's
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.440]  not going to be extremely simple it's not going to be simply the question of
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:01.160]  whether planes brought the buildings down or somebody just decided to do a
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:05.080]  typical demolition of the World Trade Center towers that's not the question
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:09.840]  the question is what did the parade planes bring the buildings down which we
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:14.000]  know is not true or did somebody fly planes in the buildings in order to
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.600]  present the idea that the planes brought the buildings down while doing a
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:23.360]  deceptive demolition and so if we keep all that in mind part of the deception
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:31.280]  is having fire exist where it would not have otherwise existed other parts are
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:37.080]  creating fire in the elevator shafts that is so extreme that would weaken the
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:41.880]  core of the buildings and also very likely from what we've heard from
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:46.800]  testimony explosions in the basements as well so it's a complicated process which
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:50.280]  by the way were preparatory those are way before the main collapse was
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:55.760]  initiated with the towers with the top down demolition versus the classical or
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.560]  more classical bottom up as a situation with with the building seven I want to
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:03.920]  come back with Kevin Ryan and Kevin have you walked through that and then all
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:09.000]  the new thermate thermite information that you have but I mean stepping back
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:14.160]  from this you wake up at 3 a.m. at night sweaty like I do or freaked out you
[2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:18.360]  know consciously we know it's an inside job the evidence shows that but to like
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:22.000]  come to grips kind of you know when you're not conscious and awake and
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:26.360]  psychologically dealing with it when it kind of floods in of oh my god people
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:30.560]  run the government that really killed 3,000 people and I mean these are
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:36.680]  wild men to to to pull off something of this daring in front of everyone I mean
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:43.400]  these people what what else are they capable of yeah that's a good question
[2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:46.680]  but I'd like to think that we're still in the majority Alex and this the
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:50.440]  American people and the people of the world who are generally honest and
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:54.680]  interested in survival still have a chance in my opinion so we need to get
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:58.920]  the word out well I know this I mean about every few weeks I'll wake up 3
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:02.520]  4 a.m. covered in sweat thinking about 9-11 and I'm like oh my god I'm this
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:08.080]  prominent person fighting murderers who will just kill 3,000 people like that to
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:12.520]  get power to be able to launch wars and it's real I mean they really did it just
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:17.040]  it just hits me like a ton of bricks and I've got to just literally cry out to
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:20.840]  God for support or I couldn't continue on stay there Kevin Ryan we appreciate

[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:40.320]  truth government sponsored terror you name it coming up the next segment at
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:46.880]  1-800-259-9231 I see Betty Don and many others that want to speak to our guest
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:51.320]  Kevin Ryan formerly with underwriting laboratories and engineer who found out
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:56.720]  about all this stuff and look I mean you can't dealing with reality you can't
[2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:00.440]  just say well it's too scary to know it's an inside job I'm just gonna say it's
[2:22:00.440 --> 2:22:05.560]  not true I mean that is a lot to deal with and I've had to deal with it you
[2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:08.400]  know I had to tell you about the attacks before they happen so they're gonna the
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:12.800]  feds are gonna go after the World Trade Center I could see them on TV preparing
[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:17.320]  the public I mean it doesn't take a mathematician to understand this stuff
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:24.920]  but here we are so Kevin continuing with your awakening the evidence NIST is
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:30.240]  all over the map now and then that really key research you've done on the
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:36.040]  thermate with the Dr. Stephen Jones and others right so Dr. Jones came on the
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:44.160]  scene in 2005 and was just a very strong scientific credible scientific speaker
[2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:51.240]  in terms of what he was finding and since then Dr. Jones and myself and
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:56.080]  others have proven beyond question I think and others before us that the
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:00.120]  the towers and World Trade Center seven were brought down with explosives there's
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:06.640]  no question about that the additional information was the development of the
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:12.040]  thermite or thermate theory from Dr. Jones and that's because he was able to
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:17.920]  find residues and test them and show that they were chemically identical to the
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:23.680]  residues from thermite explosions and not always separately the government's
[2:23:23.680 --> 2:23:28.560]  own reports buried in the data was the sulfidation and and in other chemical
[2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:32.600]  interactions that he had separately found in his own research so a lot of
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:36.920]  what you guys have done is seconded in the real government research not just
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:42.200]  the official spin they put out absolutely it's supported by official
[2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:47.320]  reports of various kinds but then we started looking into what are called
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:53.720]  nanothermites and these are more explosive versions of thermite that are
[2:23:53.720 --> 2:23:59.800]  built around components that are on the nanoscale so nanoaluminum and
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:06.440]  sometimes also nano metallic powders metallic oxides that are mixed with the
[2:24:06.440 --> 2:24:12.360]  nanoaluminum and they there's one reason that these are very useful in my view
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:18.000]  and they ignite at much lower temperatures they are explosive and very much so and
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.360]  also they create fire as I suggested where fire would not otherwise have
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:29.160]  existed they're also applicable to this situation and that if you look at where
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:34.120]  the fireproofing upgrades and the elevator work was done in the two years
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:38.760]  before 9-11 you find out that the floors were fireproofing upgrade was was done
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:45.320]  match up very very well almost exactly if not exactly with the floors of impact
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:51.280]  and fire and failure or so so-called failure in the towers and so that shows
[2:24:51.280 --> 2:24:57.080]  massive forethought and and just sickening premeditated nature really
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:01.320]  and so that just you know it becomes an easy path almost when you look at that
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:06.520]  and you say well very strong part of the theory now is that nanothermites were
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:12.960]  which are sprayable can be coated their their coatings and the workers even
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:17.960]  think they're putting on new fireproofing I think it's very possible that the idea
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:21.560]  is that they be they could be told that it's intermittent paint which is a
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:26.000]  fireproofing type of paint or other types of fireproofing materials and even the
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:31.120]  the Port Authority's consultant Burl-Happel an engineering company from
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:37.040]  from the British from the United Kingdom suggested to them at the time when
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:41.120]  they're doing these upgrading that they use alternative materials so they
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:44.600]  didn't explain what those alternative materials are it would help if it was a
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:48.440]  spook building with every major federal intelligence agency in it and it
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:55.120]  magically was the government's command bunker yeah World Trade Center 7 was had
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:26:01.600]  some very interesting tenants that's for sure CIA FBI defense intelligence yeah
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:06.920]  so we look more into these nanothermites and I've been making them actually been
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:10.600]  making them now I made a couple of formulations that were published by
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:15.400]  Lawrence Livermore National Labs and I've been examining a lot of the World
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:22.440]  Trade Center dust samples and looking in surprise I guess at how similar these
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:26.840]  materials look when you look at them under a microscope and then and then
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:30.040]  NIST just and we're gonna come back in a long segment and I want you to break this
[2:26:30.040 --> 2:26:33.800]  down slowly sir it just so happens that NIST has been acting like they don't know
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:38.360]  what you're talking about but they happen to have some thermate nanothermite
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:44.920]  experts working there yeah absolutely and it's amazing who the president
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:49.800]  appointed to the head to lead NIST during the investigation we can talk
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:54.120]  about that when you're ready yeah well since there's such explosive thermite
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:59.880]  experts with NASA why don't we I mean have you had a chance to talk face-to-face
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:04.320]  with these nice people because I know you go to some of these events I want to
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:07.880]  hear about this with Kevin Ryan the engineer who's bringing down the new
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:12.480]  World Order lie stay with us this is so important folks call your friends we're
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:21.000]  on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:26.400]  now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off ready

[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:32.520]  before the election the inauguration not the election is the deadline given by
[2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:36.760]  the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies Joe Biden and Colin
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:41.000]  Powell stated that shortly after the inauguration possibly the 21st or 22nd
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:45.840]  January the new president would be forced by an international incident to
[2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:50.720]  make some unpopular decisions this functions as an important deadline for
[2:29:50.720 --> 2:29:55.480]  getting any food you intend to have the unpopular presidential decisions will
[2:29:55.480 --> 2:29:59.520]  likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food
[2:29:59.520 --> 2:30:04.160]  distribution order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:08.480]  the inauguration to allow for shipping late orders cannot be guaranteed

[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:45.720]  Jones and others several different organizations will put up some of the
[2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:49.520]  websites on screen if you want to learn more you're trying to give out some
[2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:55.520]  websites for went to break Kevin Ryan for people to look at the explosive
[2:30:55.520 --> 2:31:00.920]  nano thermite you've made that mirrors the government programs we know the
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:04.920]  pentagon's worked with this NASA's worked with this and the folks at nish
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:08.080]  should know all about it because just so happens of only maybe 10 experts in the
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:12.120]  world you've got a couple of them they just so happened to be of given the
[2:31:12.120 --> 2:31:15.880]  investigation so I would imagine they want to work with you since this is
[2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:20.320]  their line of their specialty their signature we know they want to help
[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:25.920]  America capture the terrorist so Kevin continue with the spheres themselves
[2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:31.280]  and then lo and behold top experts in the world involved running the cover up
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:36.080]  I mean investigation Kevin Ryan please continue because we're really getting
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:42.720]  close now aren't we I think so and if you go to the Journal of 9-11 studies I
[2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:47.560]  published a paper one of my own papers was published there called the top 10
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:52.480]  connections between NIST and nanothermites and it steps through the top
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:56.240]  10 connections give that side out for folks we're gonna put it on screen it's
[2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:00.640]  the Journal of 9-1-1 studies.com Journal of 9-1-1 studies.com
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:05.040]  all right we got it on screen please continue and I think the paper is from
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:09.560]  July of this year but it it steps through an explanation of nanothermites and it
[2:32:09.560 --> 2:32:14.280]  talks about how NIST was working with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories
[2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:20.960]  as early as 1999 believe earlier than that but that documentation is important
[2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:24.440]  but you can get all the references from this paper you don't have to take my
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:29.240]  word for it step through it and see that NIST is very closely working on
[2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:35.360]  nanothermites and they had people like Foreman Williams who is their lead
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:39.840]  engineer on their advisory committee and also was the biggest engineering
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:45.840]  expert for popular mechanics and he is an expert on just these sorts of
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:51.440]  materials. So he's the Hearst Publishing Expert. Yeah I suppose that's popular
[2:32:51.440 --> 2:32:55.520]  mechanics is a Hearst publication. The same folks that said you supply the
[2:32:55.520 --> 2:33:02.720]  pitchers also supply the war. Yeah yeah the yellow journalism so I mean you know
[2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:06.320]  we always joke and say in the encyclopedia next to the word dumbass
[2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:10.720]  there's a picture of you but I mean literally in the encyclopedia next to
[2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:16.880]  yellow journalism is a picture of them. Yeah yeah so well a lot of people still
[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:21.800]  believe it what they say and that's that's just a matter of being able to
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:25.360]  close your mind enough to buy what you were already going to buy. Well they're
[2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:29.720]  clearly operative please continue. Well you know there's science applications
[2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:33.720]  international which is a very large engineer consulting and
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:39.080]  other defense consulting company that was very heavily involved in the NIST
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:44.360]  investigation and their experts on this sort of material. They also first
[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:49.800]  investigated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and it was their analysis that
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:54.480]  kind of produced those responsible the official story. They were also
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:59.280]  responsible for helping out with the security upgrades at the World Trade
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:04.280]  Center in the late 1990s. So this science applications international SAIC
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:09.840]  company is connected in every possible way. They're connected through their
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:14.240]  former employees Jerome Howard and Stephen Hatfield to a number of things
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:19.320]  like the anthrax incidents and the Rudy Giuliani administration. But these
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:24.400]  directors of NIST are most interesting to me. One of them is Arden Beemant who is
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:29.760]  a materials expert and metallurgist. So I mean this is right up his alley is a
[2:34:29.760 --> 2:34:35.040]  former secretary deputy secretary of defense and former director of DARPA's
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:41.360]  materials office former executive at TRW and there's just all sorts of
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:47.080]  connections. Batel is a director of Batel which is an organization that manages the
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:51.680]  national laboratories including Fort Dietrich and Lawrence Livermore and all
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:58.440]  these all these thermate experts they're just directing giant companies but
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:01.880]  they are coming in to help with the 9-11 investigation. Isn't that nice of them?
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:07.000]  Absolutely October 2001 right after the attacks is when George W. Bush nominated
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:14.560]  Beemant to be the head of NIST. When Beemant was ready to move on which is a
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:19.800]  few years later they nominated Bush nominated Herach Somerjian to be his
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:24.480]  replacement. He was the director of NIST chemical division and he is somebody
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:30.280]  who is a nanothermite expert wrote 10 papers with the world's leading
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:34.160]  nanothermite expert Michael Zachariah used to be a NIST employee as well. Wow
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:40.920]  you'd think that this is like a you know class get-together of world thermite
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:45.040]  experts. Well I don't know but there certainly are enough of them that you
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:49.880]  could make. Is this a thermite or thermate convention going on? I mean you
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:54.360]  know Alex to be serious it's really apparent that that these people were
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:58.280]  hired and brought into the investigation because they knew what not to look for.
[2:35:58.280 --> 2:36:04.640]  They knew what to avoid looking at and they certainly did that. There was
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:08.800]  no testing for the national standard for fire investigation. But it's more than
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:11.880]  that. I mean who are you gonna find in government who you can bring in to
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:15.520]  investigate something that's clearly an inside job. I mean who do you bring in?
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:23.640]  You bring in people you know you can trust. People who were... Yeah. Yeah. Very
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:25.920]  possibly. I mean have you been around I mean I know you go to some of these
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:29.160]  events. I mean do you ever have a chance to come over and get a hold of
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:33.560]  their hand and look in their eyes? Yeah I haven't spoken to any of them
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:38.040]  directly but you know I sent a very polite professional letter to them back
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:44.160]  in 2004. Never got a reply other than being fired. And they have made several
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:50.360]  polite requests for discussions and have been turned out multiple times by
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:55.560]  this. So you know I don't want to go to their homes or you know go to their
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:37:00.440]  offices necessarily. Oh maybe I do but I haven't done that yet. Are there any
[2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:06.400]  other thermate experts that are all crowding around the investigation? Well
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:11.760]  I'm really interested in also people who were interested who were working on
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:17.320]  novel fireproofing right. So we're talking about what alternative fire
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:21.760]  proofings may have been involved and how they could be related to nanothermic
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:26.480]  coatings. So Richard Gann who was the guy who actually did the final editing
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:33.280]  for the NIST report. He was one of the top people was working on a novel
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:37.880]  fireproofing project for a couple of years before 9-11 and he involved some
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.160]  of the world's leading experts on nanothermites. Oh you're working with
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:47.600]  fireproofing you go out and hire nanothermite explosive experts. That's
[2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:54.120]  how you coat the towers to make sure they don't burn. Well it's a very strong theory at
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:38:00.280]  this point and if your listeners go to 9-11 blog or I put up a blog
[2:38:00.280 --> 2:38:06.360]  piece that has a slideshow of 26 micro micro photos they're from a
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:11.680]  microscope and you can see that half of them are nanothermite residues from
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:17.480]  materials I've made and ignited and then the residues look identical or very
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:22.800]  nearly identical to the magnetic portion of the World Trade Center dust. So
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:28.280]  there's these red-orange chips, there's all these spheres, there's other types of
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:34.520]  molten formations, there's these vesicular formations, clearly the
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:40.920]  remnants of an explosion. The slag? Yeah the slag material. So if you look at this
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:46.080]  slideshow at 9-11 blogger I think it'll be, you know people like pictures so
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:50.560]  we're unfortunately to some extent becoming a almost an image-only society.
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:54.760]  Soon we won't even use our thumbs we'll just eat of a McDonald's
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:59.200]  feedback. So I'm trying to reach out to the people who are more compelled by
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:04.480]  images than all the writing I've done which is something for people who do a
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:08.360]  lot of reading. These are long essays that I write but they are interesting
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:12.040]  and but the photos are just really compelling if you take a look at those
[2:39:12.040 --> 2:39:18.600]  I think you'll see what I'm trying to say here and apart from the photos and
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:23.480]  the writing there's a large group of scientists now around the United States
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:27.960]  and in Europe and in several laboratories in Europe that are doing
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:32.440]  chemical and physical tests on the World Trade Center dust particles that we're
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:40.240]  finding and you know there's some fairly well-conclusive papers being written
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:46.160]  led by Stephen Jones at this point and others some newer younger research
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:49.680]  scientists and some in Europe. Well Kevin Ryan I want to get into that and take
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:53.080]  some calls but I'll tell you what really let me know two years ago that you guys
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:57.440]  were on to something the way the media attacks you and the way operatives who
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:01.960]  I was already watching in the 9-11 Truth Movement savagely went after you and
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:08.320]  Jones they really showed who they were the establishment is scared to death of
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:14.320]  this thermite-thermate research and then now as you dig deeper in and the who's
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:20.160]  who of explosive thermite and special fire coating are all bivouacked you know
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:24.720]  cloistered around this acting suspicious and the NIST reports are all
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:29.040]  frauds I mean my god we're dealing with some hardcore individuals here and I
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:32.480]  just want to say from bottom my heart you've got a lot of courage my friend
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:37.840]  and and the people involved with you do because because I mean this is the
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:42.920]  biggest who done ever and you I mean we know now I mean this is I mean they're
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:45.960]  in the grand jury out there that wouldn't call for a further investigation of
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:51.760]  this I mean these people are just wicked I mean I mean to I mean to know that you
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:56.240]  guys have done the research that's got you one step away from having your hands
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:01.520]  on the perpetrators that has got to really be bracing yeah just take a look
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:08.400]  at a three-way crossroads and that is the who had access to the buildings who
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:14.120]  had access to the technologies and who was involved in the cover-up you look at
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:19.200]  those three groups and try to find connections and you'll find a good deal
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:23.480]  of connections oh my god I think what we'll start to find our culprits well I
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:28.360]  mean what's so incredible folks we're on the air right now giving you just proof
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.120]  on a silver planner and this is just the scientific evidence and then you know
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:36.720]  these former deputy defense heads and you know all these spooks in a spook
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:41.480]  building building seven all of this going on then you've got the firefighters
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:44.440]  and police saying get back we've been told they're bringing it down and
[2:41:44.440 --> 2:41:47.840]  Silverstein slipping up and saying we gave the order to bring it down and gave
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:51.600]  the order watch to come down to pull it you know we have all the you know the
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:56.680]  videos of cops live saying get back not just the eyewitnesses now saying yeah I
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:00.360]  was a copper I was a firefighter I was an emergency worker and they said it was
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:04.680]  on the radio a countdown and then I remember hearing on the news they were
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:08.840]  gonna blow up seven they go no we never said that it fell on its own I mean I
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:15.920]  mean this is incredible Kevin Ryan I mean this is a may we have them we we have
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:20.600]  them and I guess they're just counting on the public not being able to deal with
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:23.760]  the horror and believe me in horror fights I mean how did you deal with this
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:26.680]  I know you're a scientist and engineer but how did you deal with it is the
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:30.760]  evidence just piles on the evidence and and and then you know you're dealing
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:35.360]  with mass murderers here it was an incredible shock for me in 2003 when I
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:42.000]  when I got it and yeah I worked started working very heavily on investigating it
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.360]  myself and asking a lot of questions of people I knew and and of course it was
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.120]  a serious blow to me to get fired from my job and I had to take some time and
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:57.760]  and take care of my family first before continuing but it's been recently in the
[2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:03.400]  last year or two just something that I know needs to be done okay we know we
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:06.640]  have to figure out what happened we have to communicate as much of it as we
[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:11.800]  possibly can and that's what we can do and okay you know like you said you
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:16.440]  ask God for help and if that if that helps you and it does help me then
[2:43:16.440 --> 2:43:20.400]  that's what you do and you just you just continue on doing the best you can
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:24.320]  no literally I would collapse if it wasn't for the higher power and people
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:27.080]  can laugh at that out there but I guess they haven't been in this type of
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:32.160]  psychological adversity to be coldly looking at the facts I mean I mean Kevin
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:37.680]  as you know there's over 200 declassified examples where elements of the
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:41.440]  government have admittedly staged terror so I mean they do it over and over
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:45.800]  again they just did it so big on 9-11 and people say well let's just forget
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:50.800]  about it it's too horrible if we leave these people in power they're
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:56.600]  unstable you know they're unstable what are they gonna do next right so
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:44:00.400]  ultimately there has to be a transition has to be a great change in our in our
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:04.000]  society so we have to take responsibility for that first of all we
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.600]  have to take responsibility for the deception in our lives that's what we're
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:11.040]  trying to do here we take responsibility for that then we start
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:17.760]  building a new society that has to happen I'm afraid it has to happen so you
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.000]  know the most positive approach we can take but definitely moving forward for
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.200]  ourselves and not expecting the government or whoever powerful entities
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:31.600]  to take care of things for us because they're going to take care of things
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:36.640]  for us but there as you say they're not necessarily on our side well I mean you
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:41.120]  know 8.5 trillion stolen by offshore banks they tell Congress you're not
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:44.680]  allowed to look at it Bloomberg reports war powers has been declared by the
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:49.240]  Federal Reserve is now running the country we've got open announcements of
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:53.520]  20,000 combat troops to be used against the American people I mean we're not in
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:45:00.560]  Kansas anymore right yep so what can we do I mean the things that I can do or
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:07.080]  investigate the events of 9-11 develop new technologies as possible for a new
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:12.880]  society those are things I'm interested in doing absolutely we commend you I
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:17.480]  you know people need to go get you guys have now done peer-reviewed studies as
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:21.480]  well by major scientific journals have looked at your findings and found them
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:25.480]  to be accurate and more now being reviewed you put a lot of work into this
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:29.760]  you and Steven Jones and and and other physicists and architects and engineers
[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:34.360]  I guess it's now up to the listeners to get these scientific reports and give it
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:39.720]  to other engineers friends and family you know that are are are in these fields
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:46.560]  because I really think it's the fact that this scientific debate is is what's
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.760]  going to lead to really this being forced out into the open yeah it has made a
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:58.200]  difference it's it's changing minds in areas that that we haven't seen ready to
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:02.220]  change yet and that's that's what the peer-reviewed scientific articles in
[2:46:02.220 --> 2:46:06.600]  meet and what we call mainstream journals can do so we can send those to
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:13.840]  any mainstream scientists and they will be usually ready to look at that sort of
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:17.520]  stuff because it is published in a mainstream journal it doesn't make them
[2:46:17.520 --> 2:46:23.000]  feel as if they're taking a risk to read something like that so it does help do
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.640]  you think the perpetrators are scared of you guys I mean obviously they are but
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:30.120]  I mean I mean they've got to know that they're in trouble they've got to know
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:33.320]  that even if they don't ever physically get arrested that the words getting out
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:38.600]  about them I don't know if they're afraid or not sometimes I wonder I think Alex
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:42.480]  you've used the word endgame before and so some of these folks think that it's a
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:46.880]  game they're a little bit unconscious I think and they're not making decisions
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:50.560]  that if they're living in the real world with the rest of us so I don't know
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:54.960]  really what they think well that is what Rove said he said we are history's
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:47:00.520]  actors we control reality and you know he told the press corps this and said
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:04.440]  and we'll just change reality one day and we'll change it again and you'll
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:08.400]  respond accordingly well I got news for Carl Rove I'm not gonna go along with
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:18.040]  your phony reality buddy right reality is what it is and it's our opportunity to
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:22.480]  find out what that is on our own and Carl Rove doesn't make reality I'm sure of
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:27.760]  that well I mean look at Israel they got repulsed in Lebanon and now they're in
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:31.920]  Gaza and I'm not getting in you know debate here about whose side my point is
[2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:37.000]  is that look at Napoleon look at Hitler the hubris comes to an end the problem
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.360]  is a lot of times it it crushes little people in the process I want to come back
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:44.040]  and I'll keep you five minutes after in the next hour of weekend so we can take
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:48.560]  a few calls are you game to do that a stay another 15 minutes total sir sure
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:51.600]  okay we'll have you till five after next hour we're gonna come back and go to
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:56.200]  Betty Don Dan and a few others specifically or Kevin Ryan he's an
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:00.720]  engineer he saw their internal reports about the towers he tried to go public
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:05.240]  and they fired him well thanks to this hero we're very close to identifying
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:10.160]  those who were involved in the master planning of a 9-11 attacks the
[2:48:10.160 --> 2:48:14.160]  investigation continues stay with us
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:26.480]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:30.040]  is going to be the most important message you will ever hear solar power
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:33.840]  generators are now available from solutions from science one of GCN's
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:37.600]  oldest and most trusted sponsors these emergency backup systems provide
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:41.600]  life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:46.120]  solar generator runs quietly in its no fumes and produces electricity for free
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:50.000]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.680]  some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:58.760]  it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:02.440]  through painful power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:06.960]  with a solar power generator from solutions from science go to my solar
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:13.000]  backup calm and get off the grid today that's my solar backup calm today or
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:23.840]  call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today a day unlike any other in
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:28.240]  the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:32.880]  country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:37.120]  bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:41.680]  Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:45.800]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States some
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:49.720]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:55.320]  spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:50:00.120]  detained london's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the
[2:50:00.120 --> 2:50:03.760]  Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network warnings and war

[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:34.440]  car are your kids safe when they go out everyone needs something to give that
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:40.240]  extra edge in case of an attack you need DPS pepper spray from mr. defense com
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:44.920]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:49.200]  hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world need something more
[2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:54.080]  the Stinger keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker mr. Defense

[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:29.720]  that's 1-800-313-6400 today
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:35.240]  Devin Ryan before I talk to Betty Don Dan and a few others any other points you
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:39.560]  haven't added any other key information that we haven't gone over here with the
[2:51:39.560 --> 2:51:44.800]  audience today I just wanted to remind people that the nano thermite theory is
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:48.840]  only part of the demolition theory and that the world trade center is only
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:52.640]  part of the 9-11 truth movement so there's a great deal of information
[2:51:52.640 --> 2:51:57.160]  people need to continue to investigate and there's a lot of good books and
[2:51:57.160 --> 2:52:02.600]  movies out there that help us with that well it's classic black ops to have
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:08.480]  different teams different operations overkill they certainly had multiple
[2:52:08.480 --> 2:52:12.800]  types of explosives in the towers they did both the operations
[2:52:12.800 --> 2:52:18.360]  unconventionally but but but seven is closer correct as an engineer sir
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:23.120]  closer to the classical yeah it's definitely it looks very much like a
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:29.720]  classic demolition so it was done differently I would be sure of that and
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:34.000]  we need to just get to whatever clues we can find so when I'm looking at the
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:38.320]  intersection of people involved in the people that access to technologies and
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:42.680]  the buildings and nano thermite residues we're looking for clues and we're going
[2:52:42.680 --> 2:52:47.800]  to dig those out and expose them as much as possible and then move on I think the
[2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:52.640]  bigger issue here is to psychology people don't understand a military mind a
[2:52:52.640 --> 2:52:57.680]  commander level mind we're going back thousands of years ago a general would
[2:52:57.680 --> 2:53:02.800]  put you know 500 of his cavalry or his ground troops to be captured to bring an
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:07.200]  enemy in so they could then destroy the larger force knowing that the pawn's
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:12.440]  sacrifice would be killed and you know that's how back in the 40 50 60 70s they
[2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:16.360]  had operations like Shad and others where they would nerve gas our own trips to
[2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:19.960]  death and they found a group of doctors who would do that because they believed
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:27.240]  it the injustice the means and so out of that mindset they they've created a
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:32.960]  military cadres that that will do this well America needs to get tough and we
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:36.400]  need to stage a terror attack to get the people straight I'm sad we got to kill
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:41.960]  3,000 but it's for America and what's for Israel and you know that's really how
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:46.000]  you get this type of thing going on you know they tell me got a nerve gas our
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:49.240]  own troops because the Russians may use it and the knowledge we gain here may
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:53.600]  save millions and so they'd kill our own troops but really the test was about
[2:53:53.600 --> 2:53:58.600]  creating cadres of army doctors that would do this type of crap so let's go
[2:53:58.600 --> 2:54:04.120]  to the calls here Betty in Wisconsin Betty you are on the air welcome
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:10.800]  hello Betty hi thanks for Alex Jones show and the info wars and prison plan
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:17.760]  for being there I got myself a subscription for Christmas um my
[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:23.000]  question is I'm reading this on the website for Kevin Ryan a former UL
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:29.120]  manager was fired for publicly questioning the NIS T report was that
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:33.080]  NIS T report well that's what we've been talking about it is this baloney
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:36.960]  report put out by explosive thermate experts from the Defense Department go
[2:54:36.960 --> 2:54:41.440]  ahead Kevin yeah the NIS T is the National Institute of Standards and
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:45.480]  Technology so it's a government agency the reports through the Commerce
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:50.640]  Department therefore it's directors are Bush appointees or presidential
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:56.200]  appointees and they work directly for the president in that sense but they are
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:55:01.680]  repository for standards they do investigations and in scientific ways
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:08.000]  of building failures and many other things when Congress gets involved
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:13.200]  nothing much happens yeah well Congress had a better investigation 9-11 then
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:16.880]  they had the whitewash Commission appointed by Bush and they had the
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:20.640]  nerve to say when they first had Henry Kissinger that it was independent your
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:26.280]  comments on the independent Commission Kevin yeah I think that the 9-11
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:31.080]  Commission is a great thing to look into who were these people I know one of
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:36.280]  them James R. Thompson is a former governor of Illinois we know how honest
[2:55:36.280 --> 2:55:43.040]  the government in Illinois has been but he was also the chairman of the law
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:47.880]  firm that UL hired to defend themselves in my lawsuit against them that was
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:53.720]  interesting there are other people like John Layman who owned an explosives
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:59.600]  company in late 90s so a lot of these people oh very nice people stay there
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:08.920]  we'll be right back in 70 seconds you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:16.320]  today now from the makers of loose change the most downloaded film in internet

[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:07.960]  his name losing his job to blow the whistle on the 9-11 inside job Kevin
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:13.360]  Ryan Don from Texas you're on the air with Kevin Ryan yeah Kevin Alex God
[2:58:13.360 --> 2:58:18.080]  bless and keep you both for what you're doing I saw the Trade Center collapse
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:22.360]  live on television knew it for what it was by virtue of my military training
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:30.120]  into in demolitions and Kevin you just asked what we can do as individuals you
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:35.680]  know and you and Alex you're doing it well we're all called to be therapeutic
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:42.440]  messengers and we have the individual power to visualize at a cellular level
[2:58:42.440 --> 2:58:49.080]  and resonate what we know to be truth beyond technological means well we've
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:52.520]  just got to get the word out period and there is that whole hundredth monkey
[2:58:52.520 --> 2:58:56.320]  that's been proven scientifically where you'll have a research island with
[2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:00.320]  monkeys and as soon as a few of them learned on this island they spontaneously
[2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:04.600]  pick it up 20 miles away but you know regardless we're physically getting the
[2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:09.560]  info out and I appreciate your calls Don Dan in New York a final call for
[2:59:09.560 --> 2:59:14.640]  Kevin Ryan go ahead hey Alex I was wondering what would be the reasoning
[2:59:14.640 --> 2:59:18.680]  for the 9-11 attacks like what were they planning I know one of them is
[2:59:18.680 --> 2:59:21.800]  imperialization of the Middle East actually is a big New Brzezinski in the
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:26.360]  Grand Chess Board in 97 that was then plagiarized by the PNAC document
[2:59:26.360 --> 2:59:31.360]  September 20th 2000 rebuilding America's defenses pinned by Dick Cheney and
[2:59:31.360 --> 2:59:35.040]  Donald Rumsfeld they they're attributed to a writing it on their own website
[2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:41.560]  says trillions in no-bid weapons contracts trillions in oil unifying
[2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:45.880]  the people behind a Pax Americana or global empire there's got to be an
[2:59:45.880 --> 2:59:50.760]  outside threat on the order of Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor killed 2,890
[2:59:50.760 --> 2:59:55.560]  something people so did 9-11 coincidence and then we have all these
[2:59:55.560 --> 2:59:58.380]  other government documents like Northwood's where they explained we
[2:59:58.380 --> 3:00:02.080]  staged terror attacks we blame it on foreign enemies as a pretext to take
[3:00:02.080 --> 3:00:06.920]  control of society even declare martial law in America Kevin Ryan comments yeah
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:10.480]  I think you're right Alex and I think we just have to recognize although it's
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:15.200]  difficult to believe that there are people whose greed and whose thirst for
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:20.400]  power is just more than anything that they can than they can deal with and
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:25.720]  that they ended up just destroying everyone else around them so that
[3:00:25.720 --> 3:00:29.720]  appears to be part of this the situation with 9-11 yeah they have a raw
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:35.880]  thirst for power the raw exercise of power and we have to have a desire and
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:39.280]  a thirst for justice and that's what I have that's what Kevin Ryan has and
[3:00:39.280 --> 3:00:43.340]  again Kevin I'm telling you people like you are my heroes man I just you are
[3:00:43.340 --> 3:00:47.400]  such a hero such a hero to my whole family and and and the millions of
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:51.520]  people out there listening I just salute you hey back at you Alex keep up
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:54.840]  the good work well if it wasn't for people like you and we they would have
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:58.240]  already staged more terror attacks and you do shake them up buddy I mean they
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:02.440]  did they expected us to buy their whole fable and people have it and we're gonna
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:08.600]  get them in the end anything else there Dan what rights do you think Barack
[3:01:08.600 --> 3:01:12.120]  Obama is going to attack I know what I'm gonna be the second amendment but what
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:15.880]  other rights gonna be the whole same agenda more wars police state look
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:19.800]  Bush just passes the baton right now they're passing the baton Obama's I
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:24.600]  mean that he's a puppet Kevin you want to comment on that well I would guess
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:28.880]  that Barack and his administration senator Obama is probably not going to be
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:35.480]  much different than senator McCain or senator Biden or the Bush family and
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:38.960]  they're largely I think the same people they appear to be nominating the same
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:45.240]  types of people as have been in power before so exactly go ahead no no no
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:50.640]  let me go ahead I don't expect I don't expect much change from the path we're
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:55.120]  on unless we take charge of it ourselves I mean exactly Congress has been
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:58.920]  physically threatened with martial law senator in hoff two other congressmen we
[3:01:58.920 --> 3:02:03.800]  talked to on record Bloomberg reports were under war powers fellow reserve I
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:07.080]  mean if they're telling Congress they don't run anything you better believe
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:10.400]  the the president's been told he's a puppet that's why he was chosen he's
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:15.680]  like a front man a CEO he's definitely a fellow traveler Kevin Ryan thank you so
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:19.560]  much for all you've done we'll check out the websites and your great info thank
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:23.880]  you there he goes have a good night hello friends this is Alex Jones I've
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:27.440]  told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:31.320]  more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:34.720]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line you have your own bread you'll
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:38.400]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:46.200]  old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:49.720]  it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:53.520]  and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:57.320]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:01.120]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:06.240]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:10.080]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:14.280]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if
[3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:18.240]  there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:21.600]  refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:25.680]  stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:29.640]  America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:33.080]  one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:37.600]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:40.880]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:44.160]  that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.960]  lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:51.720]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:55.120]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:47.800]  producer artist writer director Tommy Pallotta in studio with us for just 40
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:51.600]  minutes I want to have this young man back for a full hour to talk about
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:57.000]  activism in the future we've only got him with this one segment today Robert
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:00.160]  Wannick is a 15 year old high school student in 911 Truth Activist he has
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:03.920]  fought against indoctrination and censorship in his schools and runs the
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:08.600]  website know neocons.com I love that website I I didn't know that was his
[3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:12.400]  and a Robert's YouTube videos have received tens of thousands of hits more
[3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:18.080]  than that and not only did his principal telling me couldn't wear a 911 Truth
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:22.960]  t-shirt well then they blacked it out in the school annual censored it when
[3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:25.880]  everybody else you know was allowed to have messages on their on their shirts
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:30.000]  then their textbook tells them that New World Order is good World Government's
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:34.160]  good but then when he complains about it they tell him it doesn't exist but then
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:37.480]  he has videos with the textbook and we've checked out the textbook it it does
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:41.640]  have that chapter so classic double think they're taught psych warfare oh it
[3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:45.200]  says that but you're not seeing that Winston so I want to play a little clip
[3:05:45.200 --> 3:05:51.960]  of him from YouTube up on screen and we're gonna go right to him here it is
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:06:00.680]  cool the teachers and the faculty laugh they literally call it a conspiracy
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:06.000]  even though it's been admitted it's a conspiracy but now I'm taking American
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:12.760]  history here's my book American history and as I was looked through it today in
[3:06:12.760 --> 3:06:25.040]  class I came across something that we will be learning about America in the
[3:06:25.040 --> 3:06:39.760]  New World Order you can see that I hope 1970 to the present they talk about how
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:43.280]  NAFTA is a big part of the New World Order the one thing they should talk
[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:46.880]  about is the NAFTA Super Highway but they don't dare mention that in our
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:53.200]  history books they also try to promote the already failed war on drugs by
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:58.440]  saying it promotes extreme violence and we all know that the war on drugs is a
[3:06:58.440 --> 3:07:02.440]  massive failure but they're trying to drill it into kids heads that it is
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:09.800]  being a success meanwhile he sticks info wars.com and GCN stickers everywhere
[3:07:09.800 --> 3:07:17.120]  for somebody does in the school I love it fighting that brainwashing camp
[3:07:17.120 --> 3:07:20.640]  oh there's one of our bumper stickers I love was an inside job that goes out in
[3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:25.960]  all our orders by the way I want to start a program if you want free bumper
[3:07:25.960 --> 3:07:31.680]  stickers to stick at your school we'll mail them out to you under punishable
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:36.880]  school rules rule 14 reads respect yourself and be proud to be a cowboy or
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:42.920]  cowgirl that's the mascot we're being forced to be proud to be a cowboy we
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:47.960]  must respect and be proud of our school be proud of our principal no matter how
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:55.240]  fascist he is now what kind of rule is that no matter what be proud to be part
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:08:02.400]  of that school they're constantly telling you to respect your authority figures
[3:08:02.400 --> 3:08:07.960]  no matter how they treat you and no matter what's wrong with your school it
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:17.000]  is a rule to be proud to be a cowboy or you will be punished our school has so
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:22.120]  many cameras inside and outside they're tracking everything you do just like a
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:28.680]  police state although we have low low violence at my small-town school low low
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:35.920]  theft and basically no serious crimes but here's one of the rules personal
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:41.840]  phones with photographic capabilities used as a photograph used as photographic
[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:46.480]  instruments are not allowed in the school building persons using these phones
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:50.560]  in the school as a photographic device will be subject to suspension for a
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:55.320]  period of time designated by the administration so you're not allowed to
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:09:01.120]  have a camera phone in the school personal phones with photographic
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:05.760]  capabilities are not allowed in the school building they don't want you to
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.320]  catch them saying something they don't want to catch that you to catch them
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:16.960]  doing anything give us some personal freedom it starts with synchronizing
[3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:21.880]  your day to get you ready for the New World Order everything you do is planned
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:28.920]  out and you have no choice then it goes on to banning any photographic devices
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:37.320]  from entering the school no freedom of press no personal phones at all the
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:41.600]  final step is brainwashing you with chapters in your history book on the
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:46.920]  New World Order trying to promote it is a good peace-keeping movement there's more
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:51.160]  there and he was also told you know basically that you you could have any
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:55.160]  nonviolent message you wanted on your shirt but his 9-11 inside job was
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:10:02.120]  allowed so that got that got censored as well let's go ahead and go to Robert
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:06.320]  Robert it's great to have you here with us my friend yeah thanks Alex I
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:10.760]  appreciate you bringing me on today well I mean obviously you're using their
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:14.400]  censorship their attempted censorship to wake up and rally the youth there in
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:19.640]  their in their Shawshank prison tell folks a little bit about yourself in
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:25.240]  this saga in this indoctrination camp that your parents have you in so how are
[3:10:25.240 --> 3:10:30.760]  you fighting back inside the the reeducation center yeah well I'm a
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:35.720]  15-year-old sophomore and I go to breakfast high school and school operates
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:40.080]  with no respect for the Constitution they literally tell the students that you
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:44.360]  leave your rights at the door to keep it as a safe learning environment you're
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:47.800]  not allowed to bring cameras into the schools there is no freedom of the
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:52.080]  press you are not allowed free speech and they can designate whatever they
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:57.440]  want inappropriate they can dedicate whatever t-shirts they want if they do
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:02.440]  not like the message that t-shirt can be censored according to them and
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:06.920]  basically they they don't want any alternative theories and you can be
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:11.640]  punished for bringing them up 9-11 truth is a punishable theory in our school
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:15.880]  you're not allowed to mention the New World Order they don't let me talk to
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:20.360]  recruiters when they come to the school when I see a Marine recruiter I can't
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:24.400]  even get near him without a teacher hassling me asking me well I'm very
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:28.000]  I mean look you're not allowed to talk to other people in prison you're there
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:31.400]  to be indoctrinated learn how to get on Prozac Ritalin or how to go into the
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:35.120]  military or how to go to prison it's to institutionalize you we have their own
[3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:40.920]  documents tell folks we're tell folks where the government reeducation camp
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:46.880]  is located that you attend well I go to school in Breckenridge Minnesota it's a
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:52.440]  smaller on small town in Minnesota about three hours away from the big twin
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:56.680]  cities and that's why they think they can get away with this these this
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:02.480]  unconstitutional indoctrination of the students this brainwashing when they
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:04.960]  know that it's just a perfect opportunity for them to drill the New
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:08.760]  World Order into our heads well you need to create a student group if they
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:13.120]  refuse to all to accredited you need to sue them for that and I would make a
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:15.920]  huge deal out of it and I would take that school over through the First
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:20.960]  Amendment and I would you know create a student union which is your God-given
[3:12:20.960 --> 3:12:25.480]  right to basically let them know that you do have value and that you do not
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:28.120]  leave your rights at the door and then you're not going to be taught that you're
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:33.680]  a slave or a prisoner absolutely because schools are really in place any any
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:38.280]  person that's thinking creatively knows that schools are really in place to keep
[3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:42.240]  you from learning about the real issues no alternative theories when you bring
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:45.720]  one up they're just gonna go out of their way to shut you up claim you have no
[3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:50.160]  right it seems like I saw no it seems like I saw no neocons.com years ago
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:54.520]  how long have you been involved in the fight against the New World Order I've
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:59.680]  been involved for about a year and a half now started off with 9-11 truth
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:05.800]  when I was just your average kid not involved in any politics and it didn't
[3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:10.560]  it wasn't hard for me to see that the lies don't head up and that on the
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:17.320]  science it's it's proven when did you finally wake up okay I
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:24.160]  waked up when I woke up when I was about 14 years old young 14-year-old now I'm now
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:31.840]  15 years old so about a year ago I mean what was the thing that triggered it well
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:36.440]  the thing that triggered me waking up was when I was in science class we watched
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:42.240]  a video on the physics of 9-11 and I noticed that things don't add up I
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:47.440]  researched 9-11 came across films like 9-11 the road to tyranny 9-11 loose
[3:13:47.440 --> 3:13:51.720]  change so wait a minute they were they were brainwashing you with the official
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:57.920]  story they were giving us the official conspiracy theory and so that's
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:01.160]  what backfired on them that's why I love these hit pieces they do on us that's
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:05.560]  where we're getting all our converts I love it exactly they think they can
[3:14:05.560 --> 3:14:09.880]  they think they can feed us the propaganda and then they think that we're
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:13.000]  not gonna do anything about it and just because we're youth doesn't mean that
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:16.800]  we're not gonna stand up against them they're the so-called superiors well
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:20.500]  last time I checked it was we the people well see it's a new religion they're
[3:14:20.500 --> 3:14:24.680]  indoctrinating you the hating your rights is good men in black ski mask is
[3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:28.200]  good FEMA camps is good it's all attacking other countries is good it's
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:31.920]  all for your safety because the evil terrorist attacks you on 9-11 the
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:34.920]  PNAC plan all over again in closing I want to have you back up in the next few
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:37.920]  weeks for a full hour we're really impressed with what you're doing I
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:40.800]  commend you I was gonna have you on longer today but what a special guest
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:45.760]  was in town but in closing a lot of schools they tell young people do not
[3:14:45.760 --> 3:14:50.680]  talk about 9-11 do not visit info wars.com you're saying you get
[3:14:50.680 --> 3:14:55.680]  reprimanded similarly if you do at your government training camp
[3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:00.560]  you get reprimanded what you're asking is that we have specifically you were
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:03.720]  saying you're not allowed to talk about 9-11 truth there in the prison I mean
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:08.200]  school yes they did exactly you you're not allowed to talk about it if you do
[3:15:08.200 --> 3:15:12.400]  they'll give you in school suspensions where you're sitting in a room the whole
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:17.800]  entire day without contact they'll give you detention and when I mentioned free
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:21.160]  speech last year this video has almost a hundred thousand hits when I've
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:24.520]  mentioned free speech last year they called the police into the school and
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:29.720]  they detained me for explaining my rights to them they had the police come in
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:33.800]  and detained me and that's where the police they start some schools oh my god you
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:37.280]  know let let me do this let me set you up this week or because you're still out

[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:48.840]  to come on for a full hour because I wasn't aware it was this bad I've seen
[3:15:48.840 --> 3:15:52.920]  well well it was another case of youth getting in trouble in Austin schools for
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:56.840]  for even mentioning 9-11 truth and then they threatened to take him to jail and
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:01.120]  then actually suspended one young man so I mean they call the cops on you for
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:06.560]  this now huh well I tell you detain me don't don't read me my rights nothing
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:09.840]  has that backfired on them though with the other youth now wanting to know what

[3:21:11.840 --> 3:21:18.560]  here in the new studio Alex you bet my friend so much is going on let's get
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:22.760]  into the alternative media I think it's got the establishment worried yeah well
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:25.920]  I mean I'm pretty excited about it all I mean there's there's more and more ways
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:30.120]  to disseminate information every day and it seems like people are taking
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:32.840]  advantage of that more and more it seems like the sort of traditional media is
[3:21:32.840 --> 3:21:36.960]  becoming more and more fractured that audiences are the audiences can find
[3:21:36.960 --> 3:21:42.000]  more things that they want to find you know be informed about now well I agree
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:45.800]  with you you were just telling me about a particular little widget you use to
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:49.960]  listen over your iPhone to the show the the widget is for free but it's funny we
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:52.520]  had dinner last night we're telling me about it that was the very day the
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:56.400]  Kurt Nemo added it to the listen live page tell folks about that particular
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:02.360]  widget well flycasts for my iPhone I downloaded a little app called flycast
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:06.320]  that allows me to listen to your show streaming every day so it's I think it
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:10.320]  uses shoutcast do that and my my idea for you was that you create your own
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:14.400]  little application or one of your listeners creates an application for
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:18.120]  you that would allow you to to stream just your show because you still have to
[3:22:18.120 --> 3:22:21.440]  search through that application to find your show and I thought it'd be great to
[3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:26.920]  have an info wars application where you can kind of look at the New York Times
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:30.520]  application as well that they're able to push articles and stuff like that on it
[3:22:30.520 --> 3:22:35.760]  but also to stream your show volunteer to make us that application will put it
[3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:39.520]  up and I would add for Kurt on the flycast to try to add a link to their
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:44.600]  subdirectory not just their main page so folks can find us on there but I mean
[3:22:44.600 --> 3:22:48.560]  that's the great news now your iPhone your cell phone any of them people can
[3:22:48.560 --> 3:22:52.160]  listen to the radio show again that further destroys the monopoly of the
[3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:57.240]  establishment that's why Barack Obama has now announced internet to to openly
[3:22:57.240 --> 3:23:00.880]  take over the internet and kind of kill the old web and force us on to the new
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:05.080]  one where do you stand on that Tommy you know I think we got to be really
[3:23:05.080 --> 3:23:08.960]  careful and I and one of the the main problems is that there's so much
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:14.600]  disinformation going on and you know I have hope that technology or the people
[3:23:14.600 --> 3:23:17.600]  who really understand these new technologies are going to work much
[3:23:17.600 --> 3:23:23.680]  faster than anybody trying to destroy that sort of flow of information so you
[3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:27.760]  know the levees been open and that information is coming out and they can
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:30.960]  make it harder but it's hard to stop it completely about to say they're trying
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:34.920]  to eat around the edges with taxes or regulation internet rating where the
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:39.040]  government runs you through their servers to put a rating up Australia is
[3:23:39.040 --> 3:23:42.520]  proposing the same system but admitting its Chinese style censorship that's the
[3:23:42.520 --> 3:23:46.360]  headline right so just the filter itself they're predicting will slow the web
[3:23:46.360 --> 3:23:50.680]  down by 75 to 85 percent and then you'll go through a government server which
[3:23:50.680 --> 3:23:54.760]  also snoops on everything you do now they're already doing right but but but
[3:23:54.760 --> 3:23:58.360]  now they're being public about it right well echelon and things like that I'm
[3:23:58.360 --> 3:24:02.040]  sure it's always been exactly the name of a web rating there admitting they're
[3:24:02.040 --> 3:24:05.800]  going to pass you right right the web rating and then I guess info wars dot
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:09.840]  com will be ready for extreme like a lot of corporations already ban us right
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:12.560]  and that's their business but it's different whenever governments do it
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:16.200]  yeah but again there's I think that there's always gonna be a way around that
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:19.440]  and I think the great thing about your show is that I've seen many different
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:23.400]  ways I mean that's on bit torrent is on YouTube you know however much they're
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:27.240]  trying to stop it you have redundancy even within your own websites so they
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.360]  can try to you know stop info wars dot com but people are going to take that
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:35.800]  information you know and in disseminated in other ways which is always good no
[3:24:35.800 --> 3:24:39.920]  that exactly that's why we asked listeners to go and copy all the stories
[3:24:39.920 --> 3:24:43.120]  we write and then post them everywhere else because they'll even lock us on the
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:46.960]  search engines now but then it still gets on other people's sides but enough
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:49.640]  about me we're talking about the alternative media you've been kind of
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:54.400]  an alternative outside the main Hollywood system film maker on your own
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:57.720]  right what's going on with film right now and you know freedom and film or is
[3:24:57.720 --> 3:25:01.480]  that still controlled by the big boys well more and more I mean you know I
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:06.160]  started with independent film and now the sort of independent boutiques have
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:11.080]  all pretty much shut down so again it's you know it comes and goes in waves I
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:17.200]  think that right now it's pretty much else just a studio type way to make
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:20.440]  films in America only but I think more and more I'm looking at the European
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:23.760]  model of making movies where you're actually coming together financing from
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:27.320]  multiple sources multiple countries and things like that and I think that
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:32.680]  everybody's gonna be gonna have to get really creative and how to finance and
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:35.960]  distribute movies in the past there was always kind of a one-stop shop you get
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:39.240]  money from one source you go to one studio they distribute it and they
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:43.200]  pretty much had a cookie cutter way to get that film out those days are over I
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:46.680]  mean I think that now you just have to be creative not only in the filmmaking
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:51.000]  aspect of it but also in the distribution aspect of it the financing
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:56.520]  and you know just the marketing of it absolutely again folks in stores you
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:26:03.760]  can get a scanner darkly you can get you know films like waking life I was in a
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:08.080]  best buy last week and happen to see somebody literally there you know
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:11.440]  getting a copy of scanner darkly and then right next to it I saw a copy of
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:15.640]  waking life so those both have serious political messages we'll be back with a

[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:40.280]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the
[3:27:40.280 --> 3:27:46.000]  enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to his home of Bin Laden.
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:54.520]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:59.160]  believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the
[3:27:59.160 --> 3:28:04.920]  US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:09.400]  to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:13.000]  Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and

[3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:34.440]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:38.120]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:41.680]  when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:46.160]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.400]  filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead,
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:55.600]  mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:00.200]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:04.280]  year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:08.640]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you?

[3:29:57.920 --> 3:29:59.920]  Some of the other films that he's directed
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:05.320]  Or if you'd like to talk to him about you know the media the alternative media what it's like making a
[3:30:05.840 --> 3:30:10.360]  Really independent film with you know that big of stars like he did with a scanner darkly
[3:30:10.360 --> 3:30:15.960]  You're welcome to call in the phone calls about the new media the attempts to censor the alternative media
[3:30:16.400 --> 3:30:24.520]  1-800-259-92 31 Tommy specifically, you know, you're into futurist ideas and you've worked for some other big corporations
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:26.920]  You know just on the futurist angle
[3:30:26.920 --> 3:30:33.240]  With nanotech and technology and all of this genetic engineering. This doesn't just threaten the people
[3:30:33.240 --> 3:30:39.720]  There's also a lot of opportunities there and we see the the system and the establishment may have all this innovation
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:44.840]  But they've got old dinosaurs running it and I mean take 9-11. That's an operation from the 60s
[3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:50.040]  Thinking they could control the media when they didn't and they're not omnipresent. They're not God
[3:30:50.040 --> 3:30:54.040]  What type of opportunities do you see in this revolution of technology?
[3:30:54.040 --> 3:31:02.040]  I'm not sure, you know, I mean I think that that there's a lot of questions that are floating around right now and whenever those questions are out there people are going to search for answers
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:05.040]  Some are going to be close to the truth. Some might be really far off
[3:31:05.040 --> 3:31:11.040]  So it's going to be hard and hard to sort of sift through that information and it's going to take people to
[3:31:12.040 --> 3:31:18.040]  Really organize and get together like it that always has been people that's always been the challenges organization and getting people to move
[3:31:18.040 --> 3:31:24.040]  You know in a movement towards a common goal
[3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:33.040]  Do you agree? Well, I mean I know you agree as we've talked. I mean the system is in crisis. I mean the new order is attempting to take over
[3:31:35.040 --> 3:31:38.040]  You know, they've got that avarice, you know, they've got that propulsion system
[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:41.040]  But at the same time the more they try to grab the more slips through their fingers
[3:31:41.040 --> 3:31:46.040]  I mean it does I mean all the evidence shows the new orders in crisis. Where do you see all this going?
[3:31:46.040 --> 3:31:49.040]  You know, it doesn't seem good. It seems like they're opening up Pandora's box
[3:31:49.040 --> 3:31:55.040]  And the the weird thing I think for us and maybe most of the listeners is that we're not really
[3:31:56.040 --> 3:32:01.040]  At the same morality level as these people that are they're doing these crimes
[3:32:01.040 --> 3:32:08.040]  I mean that the kind of morality that takes to swindle billions of dollars is kind of foreign to me and I bet most people
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:15.040]  And how they can go ahead and do these things and and they're just they're working on different moral principles
[3:32:15.040 --> 3:32:21.040]  I think and so that's a really difficult thing to sort of combat against because it's really hard for me to understand
[3:32:21.040 --> 3:32:24.040]  The psychology behind the kinds of crimes that these people are doing
[3:32:26.040 --> 3:32:32.040]  Well, I agree with you but I mean you see the criminal mindset. I mean they love big heist they love complex operations
[3:32:32.040 --> 3:32:39.040]  They love to fool the the public and if you study the psychology of criminals then you look at the New World Order
[3:32:39.040 --> 3:32:45.040]  I mean, isn't it the exact same mindset? I mean, it's the same people. Yeah, and I mean the the one thing that always kind of
[3:32:45.040 --> 3:32:48.040]  Shocks me. It's just the lack of value for human life
[3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:54.040]  You know, I think you go out in the street you talk to people and people have a certain value an inherent value on
[3:32:54.040 --> 3:32:56.040]  On life and these people don't seem to have that
[3:32:56.040 --> 3:33:02.040]  I agree. I mean projecting forward into the future. What do you see happening with the media itself?
[3:33:02.040 --> 3:33:08.040]  You know this war between the alternative and the kind of old dinosaurs because you know really that is how the people
[3:33:08.040 --> 3:33:12.040]  Communicate with each other. That's what sets the cultural parameters
[3:33:12.040 --> 3:33:17.040]  And I mean you're you're a you know invited guest in Tokyo Austin, Texas L.A. all over
[3:33:17.040 --> 3:33:22.040]  Particularly to speak on the future of the media because you know you've been cutting edge in one of areas there
[3:33:22.040 --> 3:33:26.040]  I mean here on there right now. Where do you see things going in the next five ten years?
[3:33:29.040 --> 3:33:35.040]  You know you always hope for the best you always hope that that people are going to educate themselves more and more
[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:41.040]  I mean unfortunately right now I would say that television is one of the the main culprits for my control
[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:48.040]  But that doesn't mean that it's inherently evil. It's just that for the most part it's being used in a really negative way
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:52.040]  And the great thing about the Internet is that the potential is really great
[3:33:52.040 --> 3:33:58.040]  And all these other things like Twitter and ways to communicate and sort of organize people
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:02.040]  I hope that it's going to be used more and more
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:06.040]  Well absolutely and again that threatens the system in just a year
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:10.040]  Twitter is now starting to rival YouTube and things for you know for communicating people worldwide
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:15.040]  I noticed last week somebody created an info wars dot com Twitter and it had you know
[3:34:15.040 --> 3:34:18.040]  Thousands of people visiting it so we just created one Saturday
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:21.040]  And you know it's already got a few hundred people on it I haven't even plugged it yet
[3:34:21.040 --> 3:34:24.040]  Yes go to info wars dot com link through to our Twitter page
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:29.040]  And you can get those updates of you know text articles on your cell phone again
[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:31.040]  How is the system going to deal with this?
[3:34:31.040 --> 3:34:36.040]  We know that DARPA invented the World Wide Web to surveil and control all commerce
[3:34:36.040 --> 3:34:41.040]  We know they designed it to try to control people but it's backfired on them Tommy and I agree with you
[3:34:41.040 --> 3:34:45.040]  I don't see them putting it back in Pandora's box
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:49.040]  Yeah so I mean again it all comes down to the people though
[3:34:49.040 --> 3:34:52.040]  I mean there's no piece of technology that's going to save us
[3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:58.040]  There's no you know golden solution it's going to come down to people educating themselves
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:01.040]  Communicating with each other and organizing
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:06.040]  And I also think being more cynical I mean I think after world war two we won the war
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:09.040]  We were the good guys we beat the bad guys we can do no wrong
[3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  And then the evil just it was already there just exploded
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:17.040]  I think we have to come to grips with the fact that we really do have a corrupt evil empire
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:20.040]  You know it's hard I mean I wake up in the morning I read the news
[3:35:20.040 --> 3:35:23.040]  And it's hard to sort of find some sort of hope or optimism and all that
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:27.040]  I think you do a really good job of instilling that into the people in your show
[3:35:27.040 --> 3:35:29.040]  But I think a lot of people feel the same way
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:32.040]  And it's hard not to look at it and feel hopeless
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:35.040]  You know I'm glad you're coming to South by South West this year
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:39.040]  I know you're a speaker there that hadn't been announced yet so we won't get into any of the details
[3:35:39.040 --> 3:35:42.040]  But I look forward to seeing you when you're actually here in town
[3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:45.040]  There's some other exciting things I won't be announcing as well
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:48.040]  But when is South by Southwest Tommy?
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:50.040]  It's in March, mid-March
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:53.040]  Tell us some of the things you're working on right now that you can
[3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:57.040]  I know a lot of stuff is in embryonic phases so you don't want to
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:03.040]  Well right now I'm doing a sort of series of portraits of people that are documentaries
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:09.040]  And one that I'm doing on is on Stephen Prince who was a friend of Martin Scorsese
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:12.040]  And Scorsese made a film of him in the 70s
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:15.040]  And I'm kind of visiting him 30 years later
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:22.040]  And another thing that I'm doing is I'm developing a Philip K. Dick short story called Electric Ant
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:27.040]  I'm working with some comic book writers to make a graphic novel out of it
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:29.040]  And it's also going to be called Electric Ant
[3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:31.040]  It's going to come out Marvel's going to distribute that
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:33.040]  And then we'll see a film I bet out of that
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:34.040]  Hopefully, we'll see
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:37.040]  And you're working on some other big films but you can't get into those
[3:36:37.040 --> 3:36:38.040]  Yeah
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:39.040]  Some very exciting stuff
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:44.040]  Yeah, it's all, you know, I'm really interested in science fiction and thrillers for the most part
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:50.040]  And I'm always kind of amazed at how a lot of these big mainstream movies almost have interesting ideas
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:53.040]  And you're kind of skirting around these things like Eagle Eye, I don't know if you saw that
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:54.040]  No, it's good
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:56.040]  No, it's not that good
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:37:02.040]  You know, it kind of deals with surveillance and artificial intelligence and, you know, computers to
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:05.040]  So the idea is interesting because it's not executed well
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:08.040]  Right, they definitely skirt it
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:09.040]  Eagle Eye
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:10.040]  Yeah
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:15.040]  You know, Philip K. Dick so much of what he wrote about and thought about came true
[3:37:15.040 --> 3:37:17.040]  It was almost like he was pressing it
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:18.040]  Yeah
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:19.040]  I mean, I think about that
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:22.040]  I think that some people are just really open to what's happening around them
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:26.040]  And that Nixon era that when he was writing, you know, that's sort of kind of the Bush era too
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:29.040]  You know, there's a lot of the sort of there's parallels to that
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:33.040]  And I think that, you know, some people are just more sensitive and they're more open to what's around them
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:38.040]  And in retrospect, it seems like they're pressing it, but they're really just sort of reflecting those times
[3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  Hey, what do you think of the new digs?
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:42.040]  I love it, man, it's amazing
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:44.040]  So it's really cool and it's an honor to be here
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:45.040]  Oh, come on
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:46.040]  In studio
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:51.040]  It's an honor to have you here, but we're going to build another TV studio out there, you know, just for television
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:53.040]  So it isn't as crazy, but we're doing the web thing
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:55.040]  We're doing everything live right now
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:37:59.040]  I'm going to take the best of each week and boil it down for a one hour TV show
[3:37:59.040 --> 3:38:01.040]  I think we're going to do another TV show that's a live news program
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:05.040]  But I really miss you, man, I miss going on those bike rides and hanging out and stuff
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:06.040]  But I
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:07.040]  Boat
[3:38:07.040 --> 3:38:11.040]  Yeah, going out boating on Lake Travis, but you hop around
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:14.040]  I mean, you always kind of move back to Austin every five to six years
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:15.040]  Yeah
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:16.040]  You know, I've known you for about 10 years now
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:17.040]  I circle
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:18.040]  Time sure flies
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:23.040]  When are you, and now do you want folks to know where you're living now?
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:27.040]  Yeah, sure, you know, I'm living in Amsterdam currently
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:28.040]  You're living in the Netherlands
[3:38:28.040 --> 3:38:29.040]  Yep
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:31.040]  And you're working with a film company over there on some stuff
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  Yep, a film company called Submarine
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:38.040]  And it looks like I'm going to be doing a project in Abu Dhabi next for a museum there
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:43.040]  If folks want to find out more, what's the Submarine website?
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:45.040]  It's Submarine.nl
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:48.040]  Netherlands, Submarine.nl
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:50.040]  So you are just global
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:54.040]  Well, let's get to some phone calls, or we'll never have time to take them
[3:38:54.040 --> 3:38:57.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to Betty in Wisconsin
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:38:59.040]  Betty, you're on the air with Tommy Pallott
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:03.040]  Okay, who's up next here?
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:04.040]  Because I've got a big...
[3:39:04.040 --> 3:39:05.040]  Mark in Oregon
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:08.040]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air, then Bryant, Arning, Leo and others
[3:39:08.040 --> 3:39:10.040]  Go ahead, Mark in Oregon
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:13.040]  Yeah, hey, Alex and hey, Tommy
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:14.040]  Great to speak with you
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:17.040]  I've got a suggestion I'd like to make to both of you
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:25.040]  And it's an idea I've had solely to further the cause of exposing the truth of 9-11
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:30.040]  And the other truths which are directly or indirectly related to it
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:34.040]  And that is actually a movie
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:38.040]  And I would call the movie, perhaps, Alex Jones, the movie
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:41.040]  I would call the movie A Day in the Life of Alex Jones
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:45.040]  Maybe starting out first frame on the treadmill
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:50.040]  And basically, Alex, it would require perhaps a speaking tour
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:53.040]  A global speaking tour to promote the movie
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:55.040]  And you've always been interested in doing that
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:39:57.040]  And I know times of the essence these days
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:00.040]  And you have to, both of you gentlemen, have to allocate your time
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:05.040]  To the greatest effect toward exposing the truth that needs to be exposed
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:10.040]  But I wanted to suggest that I thought it would be something you could ponder on in the future
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:14.040]  Both of you and Alex knows enough people that are associated with it
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.040]  No, no, no, let's make a movie about A Day in the Life of Tommy Pilota
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:20.040]  No, no, no
[3:40:20.040 --> 3:40:23.040]  Alex, you'll go a long way if there's a movie about you
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:25.040]  It'll make millions
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:27.040]  I don't even care about the money thing
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:30.040]  I don't have any future to spend any money if we don't turn this around, man
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:33.040]  Listen, filmmaking takes a lot of time, a lot of energy
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:37.040]  Even if you're like Steven Spielberg, it's hard to get the very film you want made
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:42.040]  I mean, Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas almost had that taken away from him
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:46.040]  Tommy, explain this to people that it's hard to do things like this
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:50.040]  Well, it also changes, I mean, it's a very fluid business
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:54.040]  And right now, Waking Life was a movie that Alex was...
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:56.040]  It's evergreen, by the way, bigger than ever now, right?
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:59.040]  And Alex has one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie
[3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:02.040]  But that movie at that time was made completely independently
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:05.040]  And we sold it to a distributor and it got some distribution
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:08.040]  But, you know, now the way that things are
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:11.040]  I don't think that that same movie would sell the same way
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:13.040]  And I don't think it would get seen the same way, you know
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:15.040]  It's really a lot to do with timing
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:18.040]  Exactly, as they say, the planets have to align
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:20.040]  And I appreciate your call
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:23.040]  I hate talking about myself, this is ridiculous, Mark
[3:41:23.040 --> 3:41:24.040]  I appreciate it
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:26.040]  Trying to explain this
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:28.040]  Look, Discovery Channel
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:32.040]  And I'm not going to get into it because they asked me not to say too much
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:34.040]  But some of it's been in the news now so I can talk about it
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:37.040]  Made a three and a half million dollar film
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:42.040]  Because Discovery was going to go the way of, you know, kind of a BBC or an HBO
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:45.040]  You know, they wanted like a name for real filmmaking
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:47.040]  So one of the top filmmakers in the country
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:49.040]  In documentary, he's like the number two guy
[3:41:49.040 --> 3:41:52.040]  He, you know, he spent a three and a half million dollars
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:41:54.040]  I was one of the main characters
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:41:59.040]  And then he wouldn't make it a hit piece on me
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:01.040]  And so it was shelved
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:04.040]  This is the first film he's ever made that just went in the toilet
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:06.040]  I mean, it's on the Discovery channel
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:10.040]  And then the person, the new person they brought in to totally change Discovery
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:12.040]  They got sacked over it
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:15.040]  So you have to understand, folks, bomb makers own Hollywood
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:18.040]  Bomb makers, you know, private banks, people that run wars
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:22.040]  And so you can even have the president of a company wanting to put you in a movie
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:25.040]  Tommy, explain this to them, the crap people have to go through
[3:42:25.040 --> 3:42:30.040]  Well, I mean, like anything, you're making something with somebody else's money
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:34.040]  So that automatically gives them a great influence on what you're making
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:38.040]  And very few people have directors cut
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:41.040]  Whatever they make, the studio has to show
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:42.040]  Very, very few people
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:43.040]  Rick gets that
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:47.040]  Yes, we've gotten that on the movies that we've made that you've been in
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:49.040]  You got that, you're the only guy
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:42:51.040]  So, you know, it's a difficult thing to achieve
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:54.040]  And usually you have to trade off
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:42:56.040]  You have to take less money in order to get that
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:42:59.040]  So a lot of people aren't willing to do that either
[3:42:59.040 --> 3:43:01.040]  Yeah, that's the big issue, they said, I mean
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:04.040]  And then you've got to go convince all the stars to do it for almost nothing
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:05.040]  Yeah, that's the same thing
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:07.040]  I mean, has anybody, I mean, that's a rarity
[3:43:07.040 --> 3:43:12.040]  What you did with Scanner Darkly, that is, I mean, that's really hard to do, isn't it?
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:15.040]  Yeah, I mean, it takes a lot of good will from a lot of people
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:18.040]  And a lot of people getting on board and luckily
[3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:22.040]  Kanna Reeves and Robert Downey Jr. and actors of that caliber
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:25.040]  Really were attracted to the script, the book that it was based on
[3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:28.040]  And also Richard Linklater, the director
[3:43:28.040 --> 3:43:30.040]  And it's a totally different film
[3:43:30.040 --> 3:43:31.040]  Yeah
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:33.040]  The establishment did not like it though
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:36.040]  You know, it's hard to say, you know, I mean, it's...
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:39.040]  The great thing about it is that once the movie's out there, it's out there
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:43.040]  And I mean, I actually really love what's going on with BitTorrent
[3:43:43.040 --> 3:43:46.040]  And how the movies are getting out there and I've traveled, you know, all around the world
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:52.040]  And movies, even movies that I've made that haven't been distributed in those countries
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:54.040]  They are developing a fan base
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:43:56.040]  And I went to Korea recently
[3:43:56.040 --> 3:43:59.040]  And we showed Scanner Darkly
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:03.040]  And I asked the audience how many people, you know, have seen the movie already
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  And, you know, BitTorrent's really big in Korea
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:09.040]  And over 80% of the people, Rosa, raised their hands
[3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:10.040]  So it's big
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:14.040]  Yeah, but the thing about it is that they still came, they still paid for the movie
[3:44:14.040 --> 3:44:16.040]  They still came to see it with an audience
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:21.040]  So that shows me that, like, piracy necessarily doesn't mean that people will stop paying
[3:44:21.040 --> 3:44:22.040]  To have that shared experience
[3:44:22.040 --> 3:44:25.040]  In fact, it gives some alternative art a shot at actually being seen
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:27.040]  Right, so I mean, I'm always happy to see
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:30.040]  Well, you don't like to whine and bitch, but there was some pressure that was bucked
[3:44:30.040 --> 3:44:32.040]  And you guys didn't go along with it with Scanner
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:33.040]  But I guess you don't want to get into that
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:34.040]  Well, I mean, I think
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:36.040]  They didn't want the cop blowing the guy's head off
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:41.040]  Yeah, I mean, you always get these studio notes when you're making a film
[3:44:41.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  And you always are kind of wondering, are they even watching the same movie that you're making
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:47.040]  And, you know, it's a process
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:52.040]  And you have to sort of argue passionately to keep the things in that you want to keep in
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:56.040]  And you have to justify it, which is alright, because most of the time I feel pretty
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:45:00.040]  Firmly about what I believe, and I'm willing to argue about that with anyone
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:01.040]  Absolutely
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.040]  Folks, we're playing a YouTube clip of Scanner Darkly up there
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:07.040]  Does not do it justice by the DVD
[3:45:07.040 --> 3:45:09.040]  We have a link by the way on jonesreport.com
[3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:11.040]  Where you can go over there and by the DVD
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:15.040]  I recommend you do that and support alternative, you know, media information
[3:45:15.040 --> 3:45:19.040]  I talked to a lot of folks in Hollywood who want to make films like you're making, Tommy
[3:45:19.040 --> 3:45:24.040]  They just, I guess, don't have the, I don't want to say skill
[3:45:24.040 --> 3:45:27.040]  Things don't line up for them to ever get, I mean, even big names
[3:45:27.040 --> 3:45:32.040]  To get to make something that's truly independent like you've been able to do over and over again
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:34.040]  Well, I mean, part of it's luck too
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:39.040]  I mean, it's not that it's a, you know, it's sometimes it's being in the right place at the right time
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:43.040]  And sometimes it's just being able to go with opportunities, you know, at the time that you see them
[3:45:43.040 --> 3:45:45.040]  You see those opportunities
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:50.040]  Yeah, a lot of folks do kind of prattle around and flim, you know, kind of just bumble around with opportunity
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:52.040]  You got to seize destiny in your jaws
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:55.040]  Let's talk to Bryant in New Jersey
[3:45:55.040 --> 3:45:59.040]  Bryant, you're on the year with director and film producer Tommy Pilata
[3:45:59.040 --> 3:46:01.040]  Hi guys, how are you today?
[3:46:01.040 --> 3:46:03.040]  Good, go ahead
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:05.040]  Yeah
[3:46:05.040 --> 3:46:10.040]  Well, there's everything about them in media
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:19.040]  It's almost amazing to see how they're eyeing to everybody like every day
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:25.040]  And yeah, people watching Obama, they still support him
[3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:28.040]  And it's amazing to see this happening every day
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:33.040]  People still, you know that they're being lied to, but yeah, they still believe
[3:46:33.040 --> 3:46:40.040]  And some of the media is making them think it's true
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.040]  Yeah, let me comment on that and it sounds like you're a bit nervous there, don't worry, we all are
[3:46:44.040 --> 3:46:47.040]  And we'll come back and have Tommy come on it
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:50.040]  Look, this is what's happening
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:53.040]  That's why the establishment gave people the novelty of a black guy
[3:46:53.040 --> 3:46:57.040]  I love it was a black guy, he was for liberty and anti-war or whatever, you know, pro-freedom
[3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:01.040]  But they, again, it's form, it's packaging over substance
[3:47:01.040 --> 3:47:07.040]  And so Obama lied to everybody and said he was anti-surveillance, anti-naftime, anti-war
[3:47:07.040 --> 3:47:09.040]  Now he's flip-flopping on all of that
[3:47:09.040 --> 3:47:14.040]  And folks are getting upset, but so many of them wanted to believe, wanted to be sold on that
[3:47:14.040 --> 3:47:19.040]  But now they'll be even more cynical and more sophisticated in understanding what's happening
[3:47:19.040 --> 3:47:21.040]  I want every minute with Tommy and the time we've got left
[3:47:21.040 --> 3:47:24.040]  So for PrisonPlanet.tv, we're going to skip this break
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:29.040]  The rest of the network will be back in three short minutes, please stay with us
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:33.040]  Tommy, you want to comment on that? We're going out right now on PrisonPlanet.tv
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:36.040]  I don't want to waste any time, I want to answer that caller's comment
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:41.040]  Well, you know, I was just thinking, you know, was there really a choice for a presidential election?
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:47.040]  I mean, we had two candidates and I'm, you know, I was in Amsterdam during the elections
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:53.040]  And I think like 90, 85 or 90% of the people were for Obama in Amsterdam
[3:47:53.040 --> 3:47:56.040]  And are the Netherlands, Holland, you know, total
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:47:58.040]  I saw the report, it was 90%
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:02.040]  And, you know, I found myself really sort of biting my tongue while I was there
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:05.040]  Because people had so much hope that something was going to change
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:07.040]  And it wasn't that you were for McCain, people were so simple-minded
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:10.040]  It's that you knew it was a selected false choice
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:16.040]  Right, and just as far as, you know, the damage that the Bush administration has done over the last eight years
[3:48:16.040 --> 3:48:21.040]  There was no other choice other than Obama, I mean, the Obama thing
[3:48:21.040 --> 3:48:24.040]  And the way that he really positioned that or whoever positioned it was that like
[3:48:24.040 --> 3:48:26.040]  Yeah, you had to repudiate Bush
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:28.040]  Exactly
[3:48:28.040 --> 3:48:35.040]  And so, you know, you hope for the best and you prepare for the worst, you know, as the saying goes
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:38.040]  Yeah, but I mean, the betrayal is so over the top
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:41.040]  Yeah, the cabinet members were, you know, just right off the bat
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:43.040]  They all were bad choices
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:46.040]  But I mean, obviously gay marriage, marriage, all that's a football issue
[3:48:46.040 --> 3:48:50.040]  But then he goes and appoints the big anti-gay guy to give his inauguration
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:53.040]  I mean, it's like, and he appoints the warmongers
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:57.040]  And I mean, my whole point is, regardless of where you are on those issues
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:00.040]  He's going 180 degrees from his base
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:02.040]  He's kind of bitch slapping them, you know
[3:49:02.040 --> 3:49:06.040]  Yeah, it's a weird thing and you have to really wonder what the psychology behind that is
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:08.040]  It's bitch slapping
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:10.040]  He's pimping the hose
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:12.040]  I'm sorry
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:15.040]  Um, yeah
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:17.040]  What else?
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:20.040]  No, but I mean, how bad do you see this getting?
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:23.040]  That's what I was asking Ed Asner
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:25.040]  God, man, how bad
[3:49:25.040 --> 3:49:29.040]  You know, I think economically there's only, it's only going to get much worse
[3:49:29.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  And I'm sure that you're talking about that all the time here
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:35.040]  And you know, it doesn't, you don't need a crystal ball to see that
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:38.040]  And I think as soon as, but I mean, on the flip side
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  I think once people really start to suffer
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:43.040]  Then they'll start to become much more proactive
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:45.040]  And they'll start to educate themselves
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:50.040]  I mean, I agree, but then he'll act again as a diversion as people realize he betrayed him
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:53.040]  They're going to think he's actually running something and blame him
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:54.040]  When the guy's a puppet
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:56.040]  So in a way, I'm even defending Obama
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:49:59.040]  I'm saying we need to depoliticize him
[3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:02.040]  Just like I said with Bush, as bad as he is, it's Rumsfeld
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:05.040]  It's these other people, I mean, it's like Zbigniew Brzezinski
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:09.040]  I mean, this is a guy that wrote the Neo-Conn handbook and then they just stole it from him
[3:50:09.040 --> 3:50:11.040]  I don't know, Tommy
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:13.040]  I just envy you in the Netherlands, because my parents were just over there
[3:50:13.040 --> 3:50:15.040]  And they said that's their favorite place in Europe
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:16.040]  I've never been there
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:18.040]  You know, it was really important for me to get out
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:20.040]  And sort of gain some perspective from here
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:23.040]  I mean, it was just sort of driving me crazy and reading the news every single day here
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:27.040]  And I found a certain piece, not that I think that Europe is going to be immune
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:29.040]  From any of the things that's going on
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:31.040]  I mean, it's a global crisis that's happening
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:33.040]  It's going to affect everybody around the world
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:35.040]  But it was nice to sort of get away for a little while
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:37.040]  Let's go back to the full audience, here we go
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:43.040]  Tommy Belotta is our guest
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:45.040]  And it has been really fun having him here in the studio
[3:50:45.040 --> 3:50:50.040]  We'll make a few final calls from, I guess, Arnie, Leo and a few others
[3:50:52.040 --> 3:50:55.040]  Fox News is reporting that Rahm Emanuel just resigned
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:51:00.040]  See, the military industrial complex is blackmailing Obama with all this news
[3:51:00.040 --> 3:51:05.040]  So, will you guys check that and confirm and see if that's true?
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:07.040]  John, did you confirm that?
[3:51:09.040 --> 3:51:11.040]  Okay, well, we'll see if that's true then
[3:51:11.040 --> 3:51:13.040]  Somebody may have talked about he may resign
[3:51:13.040 --> 3:51:15.040]  I've heard they're saying he may resign
[3:51:15.040 --> 3:51:19.040]  But again, people are all, look, they're all crooks, resco, and Chicago folks
[3:51:19.040 --> 3:51:22.040]  They are surveilling every governor in the country
[3:51:22.040 --> 3:51:24.040]  They're basically, most of them are corrupt
[3:51:24.040 --> 3:51:26.040]  I'll put it to you that way
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:28.040]  Especially Chicago, and then they burn you
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:31.040]  Look, Spitzer went after Bank of America and the brokerage firms
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:33.040]  Boom, the Hooker News comes out
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:37.040]  This guy was selling Senate seats, of course he was
[3:51:37.040 --> 3:51:39.040]  I'm not saying it's okay, I'm saying
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:41.040]  What is the FBI doing surveilling all these people?
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:44.040]  They're using it where if they want to hammer them, they can, Tommy
[3:51:44.040 --> 3:51:49.040]  Right, well, I mean, I think more and more, we're moving into that surveillance state
[3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:53.040]  And it is the way, and we've talked about it many times, that that is the prison planet
[3:51:53.040 --> 3:51:57.040]  You no longer need to put people in cages if you have all this information on them
[3:51:57.040 --> 3:52:00.040]  You introduced me to the Panopticon in full cults
[3:52:00.040 --> 3:52:02.040]  Discipline and punishment
[3:52:02.040 --> 3:52:04.040]  Discipline and punishment, that is a heavy read
[3:52:04.040 --> 3:52:06.040]  Yeah, it is, it is
[3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:08.040]  And you know, I'm also thinking about making a documentary
[3:52:08.040 --> 3:52:13.040]  That sort of goes down to the history of the prison systems and torture
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:15.040]  And how that relates to sort of modern day
[3:52:15.040 --> 3:52:17.040]  Well, it's awesome, Tommy, you're doing so much
[3:52:17.040 --> 3:52:18.040]  I want to make our NASA documentary
[3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:21.040]  Yeah, yeah, that's, you know, again, that's the dream
[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:26.040]  I think after these next couple of films, we'll look at NASA and see what they're doing
[3:52:26.040 --> 3:52:29.040]  There's so many projects, it's a little time here
[3:52:29.040 --> 3:52:32.040]  Long way to go, a short time to get there
[3:52:32.040 --> 3:52:35.040]  Arnie, in California, you're on the air worldwide
[3:52:35.040 --> 3:52:36.040]  Hello?
[3:52:36.040 --> 3:52:37.040]  Yes, sir
[3:52:37.040 --> 3:52:40.040]  This is Ari, and I go to school in Washington
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:43.040]  And I just wanted to sympathize with Robert, who you had on earlier
[3:52:43.040 --> 3:52:44.040]  Yes
[3:52:44.040 --> 3:52:47.040]  And I know how it is, we have cameras everywhere
[3:52:47.040 --> 3:52:53.040]  And it's insane how, if you think outside of the box, especially with regards to drugs in 9-11
[3:52:53.040 --> 3:52:57.040]  Then immediately the group think kicks in and they shut you down
[3:52:57.040 --> 3:52:59.040]  Yeah, they're training you how to be a prisoner
[3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:02.040]  I don't know how you, any parent, it'd be better for your child not to go to school
[3:53:02.040 --> 3:53:04.040]  Than to be in a public school, folks
[3:53:04.040 --> 3:53:06.040]  Yeah, sorry, what?
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:10.040]  It would be better for your child to not even be in school
[3:53:10.040 --> 3:53:14.040]  Oh, yeah, definitely, self-education, like Thomas Shaffer's been just
[3:53:14.040 --> 3:53:16.040]  Never let schooling get in the way of your education
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:19.040]  And freely think, not the group think
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:22.040]  Absolutely, Ari, anything else?
[3:53:22.040 --> 3:53:26.040]  Yeah, I just had a question, how do we overcome this?
[3:53:26.040 --> 3:53:31.040]  Like, how can we, oh, yeah, like is there any methods that you have thought of
[3:53:31.040 --> 3:53:33.040]  Or that people have shared with you?
[3:53:33.040 --> 3:53:37.040]  People expect everything to be like out of a hamburger window at McDonald's quick
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:42.040]  No, it's a process, we've gotten decadent, evil, corrupt, you know, out of shape
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:45.040]  Mentally as a nation, we have to get back in shape, but Tommy?
[3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:49.040]  You know, again, you just gotta educate yourself, you gotta educate the people around you
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:51.040]  You know, it'll start small, but it'll spread
[3:53:51.040 --> 3:53:54.040]  And then you have to organize and then you have to act
[3:53:54.040 --> 3:53:57.040]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call, I hate to cut you off, Ari
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:54:00.040]  Leo and Mass, you got one minute, take us out of here, go ahead Leo
[3:54:00.040 --> 3:54:05.040]  Yeah, hi, I've been looking forward to somebody coming out with a basic template
[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:09.040]  It's done in the format of a movie maybe, just for entertainment
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:15.040]  But basically to stop Web 2.0 and expose it worldwide
[3:54:15.040 --> 3:54:21.040]  And offer us ways of combating it and then translating it into a bunch of different languages
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:25.040]  Keeping it simple, stupid, basically, so that it's easy to translate
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:29.040]  Well, you know, I've done some little presentations, not respected, many others have done it
[3:54:29.040 --> 3:54:33.040]  I appreciate your call, Emmanuel to design house seat on Friday
[3:54:33.040 --> 3:54:38.040]  This is Fox News, it is confirmed, and I will be back tomorrow
[3:54:38.040 --> 3:54:44.040]  11 to 3 p.m. Central time to cover the aftermath of, maybe he's resigning to go join the IDF
[3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:47.040]  You know, he's an Israeli facade agent, publicly
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:49.040]  I mean literally, he was in the IDF
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:54.040]  So, and we want to pray for all those folks dining on both sides over in Israel and Palestine
[3:54:54.040 --> 3:54:58.040]  Tommy Pallada, you are super brother, there, ah
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:54:59.040]  Alright, it's good to be here
[3:54:59.040 --> 3:55:03.040]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are out of time into transmission, rebroadcast starts now
[3:55:03.040 --> 3:55:06.040]  At one place on the streams, infowars.com
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:20.040]  Get out there and take on the new world order, God bless you all
