[04:20.680 --> 04:25.680]  conspiracy they actually said on the news it's a conspiracy theory that we're
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.040]  looking at blanket amnesty outside of Congress and they do that so that you

[09:43.720 --> 09:49.080]  we'll continue with calls until the middle of the next hour when dr. Paul
[09:49.080 --> 09:55.080]  Craig Roberts joins us here is the Washington Times today and this is also
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.640]  being reported by other publications memo outlines backdoor amnesty plan
[10:00.640 --> 10:06.800]  remember a month ago this was first being warned about in the US Senate nine
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.680]  different Republican senators put out a public letter saying it is being
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.720]  discussed by the DOJ the Senate is being told that we'd better go ahead and pass
[10:15.720 --> 10:22.480]  total amnesty or the federal bureaucracy outside of law is just going to
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.640]  legalize the illegals now they've already done that in 860 plus cities
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.400]  sanctuary cities you get pulled over drunk driving or an illegal alien they
[10:30.400 --> 10:40.400]  let you go 95% of the murder warrants in LA County are free legal aliens it's
[10:40.400 --> 10:45.120]  because the criminals of Mexico that are fleeing the law there and that collapsed
[10:45.120 --> 10:49.920]  society come up here and just get away with murder especially against the
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.920]  illegal alien community the immigrant community is the group that they feed on
[10:53.920 --> 10:59.160]  the most because they've got countless IDs consul matricula cards the Mexican
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.160]  government will give them matricula cards with no ID and major banks then
[11:04.160 --> 11:09.800]  accept these so it's a double set of rules because as the SPP North American
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.400]  Union documents have stated especially the ones that judicial watch soon got
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.440]  three years ago from the Banff Canada meeting it states that this is part of
[11:19.440 --> 11:24.160]  the North American Union move and it's designed to drive down wages and to
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.160]  create a giant voting block that will vote for gun control and further open
[11:29.160 --> 11:33.400]  borders so this is how they're breaking down the United States but here is the
[11:33.400 --> 11:39.120]  Washington Times now confirmed memo outlines backdoor amnesty plan
[11:39.120 --> 11:44.360]  immigration staff recite tools available without reform reform of course
[11:44.360 --> 11:51.560]  meaning total and complete amnesty with Congress gridlocked on immigration bill
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.800]  the Obama administration is considering using a backdoor to stop
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.240]  deporting many illegal immigrants what a draft government memo said could be a
[12:00.240 --> 12:07.160]  non-legislative version of amnesty now that's that's the just department memo
[12:07.160 --> 12:15.640]  right there so a non-legislative version of amnesty stroke of the pin law the
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.880]  land kind of cool like Bogala said in the Clinton administration so here is
[12:21.880 --> 12:26.640]  that article right there no longer a rumor and it wasn't a rumor when nine
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.320]  senators came out and said we've been told this is about to happen it wasn't a
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.280]  rumor two months ago when Arizona said we're gonna be sued the just department
[12:34.280 --> 12:37.120]  has already told us that if we don't back off we're gonna be sued you now
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.160]  know that suits happened and the judge is now kicked it into the night circuit
[12:41.160 --> 12:48.960]  striking down the main provision of that law that Arizona passed so
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.800]  continuing but why do they always lie because the White House had said we're
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.840]  not planning that that's not true in the last month because they don't want to
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.080]  give you time to launch opposition to it they will just militarily and that's a
[13:01.080 --> 13:07.000]  military psi-op tactic just say we're not doing it until they do it because they
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.880]  don't want you to be able to get the jump on they want to get the jump on you
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.400]  and I before the break pointed out that we had David de Rothschild on the show
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.080]  three years ago and a clip of that is actually an in-game blueprint for global
[13:23.080 --> 13:27.600]  enslavement really my preeminent film on the whole eugenics you know global
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.040]  system what makes the controllers tick what their master plan is and he had
[13:32.040 --> 13:36.400]  written books he'd been on TV calling for a global carbon tax but when I had him
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.400]  on he said there's no carbon tax planned even though it already had
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.960]  congressional hearings three years ago he just said that doesn't exist that's
[13:43.960 --> 13:48.200]  preposterous and laughed at me then I said well if carbon dioxide is heating
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.280]  up the earth when the government's own studies show that carbon dioxide goes up
[13:52.280 --> 13:56.280]  after the earth heats and has little to do with heating and that it's been up to
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.080]  14 times higher in the atmosphere in the last million years they know that from
[14:00.080 --> 14:07.520]  soil and ice samples I said if SUVs are causing global warming on the earth and
[14:07.520 --> 14:14.480]  humans exhaling are why are the ice caps of Mars melting because at that time the
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.520]  Sun had been heating up and then it cooled down the last three years to in
[14:18.520 --> 14:22.600]  the last hundred years record lows of heat radiation being put off now it's
[14:22.600 --> 14:30.120]  heated back up and he just said well that's easy Saturn and Jupiter and Mars
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.480]  are closer to the Sun than the earth and I said sir that's not true it's Mercury
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.560]  Venus Earth Mars and then on out to Pluto and he just laughed and said that's
[14:41.560 --> 14:47.320]  not true that's preposterous and he was laughing with enjoyment it's enjoying I
[14:47.320 --> 14:53.040]  mean it's a great enjoyment for them they enjoy saying there's no carbon tax as
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.080]  they try to pass it they enjoy saying there's no amnesty plan as they launch
[14:57.080 --> 15:03.760]  it they enjoy saying there's no amnesty lawsuit they enjoy at Waco with the
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.080]  Bradley fighting vehicles ramming the building running over people it's all in
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.920]  the flare footage shooting people with bull horns announcing PA system saying
[15:11.920 --> 15:17.200]  this is not an assault you are not being assaulted this is part of their
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.560]  scion because even if you know it's a lie that tanks are ramming and killing
[15:21.560 --> 15:30.600]  you you'll still kind of hesitate the best parable or parallel that I could
[15:30.600 --> 15:35.160]  use to illustrate this is in the movie Mars attacks that came out 10 or 12
[15:35.160 --> 15:40.480]  years ago where the Martian aliens land in Las Vegas we even had this as a
[15:40.480 --> 15:46.660]  liner years ago we had to dig it back up put it back in a rotation and the
[15:46.660 --> 15:50.500]  aliens are running around the airport in the city shooting people with their
[15:50.500 --> 15:55.120]  ray guns and disintegrating them but they have a PA system announcing don't run
[15:55.120 --> 16:02.920]  we are your friends and a lot of citizens of Las Vegas stop and go okay I
[16:02.920 --> 16:09.120]  want to be friends and they go and shoot them with the ray guns don't run we are
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.480]  your friends don't run we are your friends and this is what they do there's
[16:13.480 --> 16:18.120]  no plan to have an executive order or just have the Justice Department
[16:18.120 --> 16:21.920]  legalize all the illegals well don't listen to those nine senators there
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.720]  they're liars here it is from the White House public memo this is what they're
[16:26.720 --> 16:33.840]  planning there's no plan to put toll roads on Mopac the second most used
[16:33.840 --> 16:39.320]  road not just in Texas but the United States the second busiest road in the
[16:39.320 --> 16:47.280]  country is Mopac in Austin number one is the stretch of I-35 from San Antonio to
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.200]  Dallas which runs through Austin that's number one is I-35 number two just a
[16:51.200 --> 16:57.280]  few miles west is Mopac and five years ago they said we're gonna put a toll
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.400]  road on it and people pointed out that's against federal and state law to put a
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.480]  toll road on an existing road and the regulations and laws say that you can't
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.520]  just restripe it and claim it's a new road and so they backed off oh okay we
[17:08.520 --> 17:12.480]  were never planning it then two years ago they were back and we exposed them
[17:12.480 --> 17:15.840]  and many others fought against it and exposed them so they backed off and said
[17:15.840 --> 17:19.400]  we were never planning that even though they made the announcements and now
[17:19.400 --> 17:23.520]  they're back saying they're gonna put a toll road on it don't run we are your
[17:23.520 --> 17:30.880]  friends as they fire their political ray guns at you bankrupting the nation don't
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.760]  run we are your friends in fact we use search search YouTube and say Mars
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.920]  attacks don't run we are your friends it might actually be online John we had
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.240]  that as a liner about 10 years ago was that still in the network computers yeah
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.720]  we had it as a liner that we had Braveheart when we went out to the 30

[17:56.440 --> 18:00.840]  one I don't know why they were taken out the other one is we're on the March the
[18:00.840 --> 18:03.920]  Empire's on the run that's the one that's still there and then the third one
[18:03.920 --> 18:10.560]  was don't run we are your friends I get constant emails what what is that what
[18:10.560 --> 18:19.720]  what does that mean well that's the entire methodology of the controllers they
[18:19.720 --> 18:24.720]  still have ADL Southern Poverty Law Center media matters demonization pieces
[18:24.720 --> 18:28.720]  every week or so one of those outfits puts out a report saying there are
[18:28.720 --> 18:34.400]  dangerous insane people that believe the Federal Reserve is private well it's
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.560]  admittedly private not accountable to Congress they still have reports coming
[18:39.560 --> 18:43.560]  out saying there are insane people who want to kill police officers they give
[18:43.560 --> 18:48.760]  no evidence that believe there's a world government run by banks being formed
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.280]  you can read the Financial Times of London AP Reuters any given week if
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.360]  there's news announcing it as the new solution to all our problems but they
[18:57.360 --> 19:01.360]  say it doesn't exist you're insane if you talk about it and again this is a
[19:01.360 --> 19:08.200]  psychological warfare tactic pointed at the dumber sheeple out there it's
[19:08.200 --> 19:11.520]  pointed at people that just want to be trendy and they hear oh you think the
[19:11.520 --> 19:15.960]  government's corrupt how kooky Alex Jones says we shouldn't trust the
[19:15.960 --> 19:19.800]  government we should keep it small what an extremist nut job of course that's
[19:19.800 --> 19:24.080]  total common sense what the founding fathers said what the United States in
[19:24.080 --> 19:28.960]  America is all about but to the average yuppie who's just trendy I mean every
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.200]  year a new style comes out no matter how ridiculous they go out and buy it
[19:32.200 --> 19:37.000]  whatever sports teams most popular their fans for that and if the government
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.760]  says there's no world government there's no toll road CNN says there's no
[19:40.760 --> 19:43.800]  trans-Texas corridor even though there's signs up everywhere for it and
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.840]  taking over the roads yuppies will say I don't see that billboard I don't see

[24:06.360 --> 24:14.200]  heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show well the
[24:14.200 --> 24:18.120]  Justice Department memo reads in the absence of comprehensive immigration
[24:18.120 --> 24:24.240]  reform the USCIS can extend benefits and or protections to many individuals and
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.920]  groups by issuing new guidance and regulations exercising discretion with
[24:27.920 --> 24:35.240]  regard to parole in place deferred action and issuance of notices to appear the
[24:35.240 --> 24:39.600]  staffers wrote in a memo which was obtained by Senator Charles E. Grassley
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.720]  Iowa Republican the memo suggests that the in-depth discussions have occurred
[24:43.720 --> 24:47.880]  on how to keep many illegal immigrants in the country which would be at least a
[24:47.880 --> 24:51.920]  temporary alternative to the proposal Democrats and Congress have made to
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.080]  legalize illegal immigrants so they're just going to order the government to
[24:56.080 --> 25:00.360]  start giving them all green cards and to leave them alone and to just stop all
[25:00.360 --> 25:07.720]  deportions and they already just have showed events where they'll go raid a
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.840]  meatpacking plant or a factory and they do it four or five times a year and
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.240]  they'll arrest a thousand people and then deport a few of them remember last
[25:16.240 --> 25:23.880]  year when Obama on record gave green cards and federal jobs to people within
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.560]  an hour of them being arrested at a plant in Washington state that people
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.040]  won't believe that search the term homeland security gave jobs to illegal
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.560]  aliens or illegals hired to build border fence which they just built 50 miles of
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.240]  the 2000 miles as a show they've already legalized them they're already left
[25:43.240 --> 25:47.200]  alone and when sheriffs arrest illegals committing crimes the Houston
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.560]  Chronicles reported hundreds of thousands of illegals are released after
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.900]  serving prison sentences for violent crime and they're just released the
[25:55.900 --> 26:00.360]  feds won't pick them up won't deport them this is high treason and so here it
[26:00.360 --> 26:05.800]  is memo outlines backdoor amnesty plan immigration staffers site tools
[26:05.800 --> 26:16.200]  available without reform to legalize illegal aliens and this is what they
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.120]  have basically already done they're not just talking about doing it what do you
[26:20.120 --> 26:26.040]  think the Justice Department support of 800 plus sanctuary cities does let's go
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.080]  ahead and jam in a phone call here let's talk to Ryan calling from Texas he's
[26:31.080 --> 26:37.680]  listening to 13 30 a.m. out of Taylor Ryan you're on the air hey how's it going
[26:37.680 --> 26:43.040]  here Alex this is Ryan I'm actually out of Waco Texas and I'm calling to give
[26:43.040 --> 26:46.720]  you a heads up on a situation that I made it's kind of off subject of what
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.440]  you're going through but actually it's going to affect us all right now I'm
[26:52.440 --> 26:58.480]  fixing to go into a big legal battle against the state of Texas and against
[26:58.480 --> 27:04.320]  the CPS because I give my daughter colloidal silver and they're trying to
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.120]  take my daughter away from me because I gave her colloidal silver but but
[27:08.120 --> 27:15.400]  excuse me they sell colloidal silver at Whole Foods they sell it at HEB here in
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.800]  Austin they sell it at stores in Waco I mean they sell it I mean it's an
[27:19.800 --> 27:28.000]  admitted government approved for sore throats and cuts and so I but but look
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.080]  I mean we saw the case out of Williamson County where they took the man's son
[27:32.080 --> 27:40.120]  because the man quote was Barry Cooper was teaching his son that you can't
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.200]  trust the government so sir you're saying in your case they're trying to
[27:44.200 --> 27:48.480]  take your daughter I mean who ratted you out for giving her something you can
[27:48.480 --> 27:55.040]  buy at Whole Foods well let me explain my situation here I have two daughters
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.520]  and one my daughter's got hurt in my house I didn't know that she got her
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.080]  sheet that she had broken her collar bone falling broke in her collar bone
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.040]  but she acted fine afterwards and so it happens a lot with collar bones I mean I
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.320]  had my arm dislocated one time for four days and didn't get really painful till
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.240]  a couple days later and my dad took me to the hospital and and he's a physician
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.080]  and he was scared he said look if they ask you if I did this which I've been
[28:21.080 --> 28:24.200]  wrestling at the neighborhood pool playing chicken you know where you get on
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.000]  somebody's shoulders and that's how it happened and I didn't understand why
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.240]  when I was like ten years old my dad was so scared but sure enough at the
[28:31.240 --> 28:36.760]  Mesquite hospital they they said did your daddy or mommy do this to you and
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.520]  and so now I know people whose child at school falls off the merry-go-round and
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.520]  breaks their hand and even though there's witnesses they try to take the
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.840]  child so so so so that's how this started and now they're trying to use a
[28:48.840 --> 28:55.200]  colloidal silver as a reason yeah well that's how it started and I didn't know
[28:55.200 --> 28:58.760]  it was the day before Father's Day when she fell broke her collar bone we went
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.280]  out and had a good time on Father's Day didn't even know anyway I didn't know
[29:03.280 --> 29:06.600]  it's the next day that her collar bone was broken until that fall on Monday when
[29:06.600 --> 29:10.280]  her mother showed up at my porch while I know how her collar bone was broken she
[29:10.280 --> 29:16.240]  called CPS on us and reported me to CPS said that I give him colloidal silver
[29:16.240 --> 29:21.760]  and vitamins I'm a manager and I'm in store here at Waco actually and I'm
[29:21.760 --> 29:27.640]  all into holistic medicine we don't do any pharmaceuticals and so anyway well
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.960]  that's incredible you know jaren I don't know I'm allowed to tell this story he
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.920]  told me the story jaren had a cop for no reason slam up against a wall and then
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.160]  his collar bone didn't fully break till a day later so I know that happens a lot
[29:41.160 --> 29:46.200]  you know I've got this key video audio coming up but after I play it I'm gonna
[29:46.200 --> 29:50.480]  go back to you stay there Ryan we'll be right back
[29:50.480 --> 30:00.000]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.920]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:08.240 --> 30:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.480]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:16.480 --> 30:20.360]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:20.360 --> 30:24.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.800 --> 30:33.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:33.120 --> 30:36.840]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.840 --> 30:41.000]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.360]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[30:44.360 --> 30:48.080]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[30:48.080 --> 30:53.640]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[32:04.840 --> 32:10.440]  the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[32:10.440 --> 32:14.920]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[32:14.920 --> 32:17.960]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land

[34:14.840 --> 34:18.960]  didn't even have time to cover in this special report and we shot this two
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.560]  weeks ago and Aaron and I did two weeks of added research to add all the links
[34:23.560 --> 34:27.760]  the news articles the government documents that are in this video that
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.840]  we're about to play here for the radio and TV audience and of course the
[34:31.840 --> 34:37.240]  prison planet dot TV viewers so here it is ladies and gentlemen food the
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.080]  ultimate secret and I know some people on the YouTube channel were commenting
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.440]  saying hey I already knew this okay great I'm glad it's not a secret for you
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.480]  the point is this is the big issue we need to warn more people folks need to
[34:51.480 --> 34:57.760]  understand how real this is so here is the video piece
[35:01.240 --> 35:07.440]  my friends the information that you are about to witness from all of my years of
[35:07.440 --> 35:14.560]  research is the most important it's been hidden in plain view the entire time
[35:14.560 --> 35:26.600]  this is the ultimate secret and it's about to be exposed I have hundreds of
[35:26.600 --> 35:31.880]  government documents textbooks white papers where for over 80 years the
[35:31.880 --> 35:38.360]  elite of the Western world have talked about adulterating food and water to
[35:38.360 --> 35:44.600]  sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics it's all covered
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.440]  in the book eco science written by the White House science are John P. Holdren
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.240]  where they talk about a planetary police state to carry out the forced
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.440]  sterilization they also talk about covert systems in the water and food to
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.280]  sterilize the population now this was written decades ago before he was White
[36:01.280 --> 36:05.120]  House science are now suddenly the stuff in this book is all over the news
[36:05.120 --> 36:11.240]  they're selling it to the public as if it's a good thing you see here before
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.000]  you what an average person would buy when they went shopping at the store not
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.760]  everything here is bad for you but much of it has compounds and artificial
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.600]  chemicals that have been added that are extremely toxic and bad for your health
[36:26.600 --> 36:32.280]  and they have known this the entire time and they have approved them for use
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.840]  let's start with aspartame
[36:39.240 --> 36:44.640]  you cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar
[36:44.640 --> 36:51.480]  gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it in the 1970s Searle tried to get it
[36:51.480 --> 36:54.880]  approved and they couldn't it took them three separate times because in their
[36:54.880 --> 36:58.920]  own studies with monkeys large portions of them that were fed it died and
[36:58.920 --> 37:04.080]  contracted cancer now we have mainstream news articles in the EU has done a
[37:04.080 --> 37:10.040]  major study finding lower birth weights early birth and yes miscarriages from
[37:10.040 --> 37:16.800]  women that drink aspartame laden soft drinks like coke zero what is aspartame
[37:16.800 --> 37:21.960]  it is the fecal matter of the E. coli bacteria they took it and genetically
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.560]  engineered it they can feed it toxic waste and then it defecates aspartame
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.600]  and it has so many bad health effects it's just unspeakable
[37:31.600 --> 37:57.200]  this is being done by design it's also very very addictive but let's just go
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.600]  ahead and move away from aspartame and talk about McDonald's and chicken
[38:02.600 --> 38:08.520]  McNuggets now I remember a decade ago or so reading health advisories claiming
[38:08.520 --> 38:14.280]  that a form of plastic that's using silly putty basically a type of silicone
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.600]  was in the chicken McNuggets but also in many other TV dinners and other foods
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.600]  it is illegal in every other nation in the world to add these chemicals of the
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.120]  food but it's not in the United States the big secret is all of this was done
[38:28.120 --> 38:32.720]  by design by the FDA look at all the drugs they've approved and then it
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.080]  comes out later that they knowingly approve them when these drugs are
[38:36.080 --> 38:47.160]  causing heart attacks and cancer in the Nuremberg trials it came out that the
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.480]  Nazis were adding sodium fluoride to the water supply in the labor camps and
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.440]  death camps to make the population more docile and controllable there had been
[38:56.440 --> 39:00.200]  hundreds of university studies before Hitler even came to power this is a
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.600]  form of forced medication they admit that one part per million of sodium
[39:05.600 --> 39:11.640]  fluoride more than doubles the chance of bone cancer in boys and men as the
[39:11.640 --> 39:14.960]  public became educated in the last few decades the government industry's
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.720]  response was to not just put it in water but to start adding it to thousands of
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.480]  products like children's water that's mixed with their formula or with their
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.880]  cereal they started adding as much as 900 parts per million in things like
[39:28.880 --> 39:36.040]  powdered eggs it causes reductions in IQ it increases sterility or lack of
[39:36.040 --> 39:42.440]  fertility and it's being added to so many of the daily staples that we consume
[39:42.440 --> 39:47.120]  we'll get back to food additives in a moment but first I wanted to look at
[39:47.120 --> 39:50.760]  genetically modified organisms
[39:53.680 --> 39:57.920]  did you know for many years the American people have been eating clone beef and
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.720]  pork and now they're expanding out into other forms of meat let's look at salmon
[40:02.720 --> 40:08.600]  first major university studies conclusively have proven that the type
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.560]  of genetically modified salmon that is actually a cross species they've mixed
[40:12.560 --> 40:17.840]  other animal genes in with it that when this fish is introduced with wild
[40:17.840 --> 40:25.360]  natural salmon within 40 generations all the natural salmon are extinct and the
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.640]  FDA approved this and they're going to allow it to be released into the wild
[40:30.640 --> 40:38.520]  that isn't even a salmon it is a cross species chimera it is a mixture like
[40:38.520 --> 40:43.880]  something out of the island of dr. Maru something out of a nightmare
[40:46.440 --> 40:52.960]  more than 85% of the corn now consumed in the United States it's also starting
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.400]  trend that way in Europe and Canada is genetically engineered it grows its own
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.840]  pesticide within the corn kernels so that insects won't eat it if the insects
[41:04.840 --> 41:08.920]  can't eat this and live what do you think's gonna happen when lab rats or
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.440]  humans eat it we have literally hundreds of studies showing that not just
[41:14.440 --> 41:19.240]  Monsanto's but other major GMO companies corn that's the majority of corn we're
[41:19.240 --> 41:24.480]  now eating today in the United States has been linked to organ failure in lab
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.200]  animals the studies also show massive increases in sterility in rats and
[41:30.200 --> 41:37.040]  guinea pigs that are fed not just GMO corn but GMO cotton seeds studies in
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.440]  India Germany and the United States have conclusively shown that when they feed
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.960]  the cotton seeds left over from the cotton crop from these genetically
[41:46.960 --> 41:51.800]  modified varieties that the cows are having miscarriages they are having
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.680]  low birth weights or in many cases they're simply dying and what is in most
[41:56.680 --> 42:02.680]  processed foods genetically modified cotton seed oil major studies are also
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.000]  showing that genetically engineered crops are killing honey bees and monarch
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.160]  butterflies but they don't stop there now they claim they're coming out with a
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.840]  genetically engineered mosquito that's malaria proof they're gonna release in
[42:13.840 --> 42:19.600]  the open biosphere the very genetic code of the planet is being butchered in a
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.920]  hostile corporate takeover many years ago an executive from Monsanto was
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.760]  quoted a National Geographic is saying that that is their program that they
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.960]  want to basically have their crops and their organisms take over the entire
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.640]  biosphere of this planet and the major genetic engineer companies have focused
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.560]  mainly on eight major food crops now they're expanding out into hundreds and
[42:42.560 --> 42:47.400]  hundreds and hundreds of other plants literally changing the genetic code of
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.360]  the planet this is a genetic dictatorship this is genetic vandalism and
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.960]  that's why the Rockefellers the United Nations and others have built these
[42:55.960 --> 43:00.760]  giant armored seed vaults all over the world not just at the Arctic Circle and
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.720]  they admit they're doing it in case all of this gets out of hand that they'll
[43:04.720 --> 43:08.800]  have a type of Noah's Ark so all these fake environmental groups they never
[43:08.800 --> 43:12.680]  complain about this they never talk about true environmental degradation they
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.920]  want to put a tax on carbon dioxide that humans exhale that plants
[43:16.920 --> 43:22.480]  respirate from and carry out photosynthesis with as a way to shut down industrial
[43:22.480 --> 43:27.840]  society and control every facet of our lives that's the big secret this is a
[43:27.840 --> 43:37.120]  population reduction program it is an epidemic the sperm count has dropped in
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.040]  the Western world exponentially even the government has been predicting within
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.680]  another generation almost everyone is going to be sterile this is the globalist
[43:46.680 --> 43:52.640]  religion this is their philosophy they want the planet for themselves the UN
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.000]  has said that their stated plan is an 80% population reduction you've heard
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.400]  Ted Turner haulish useless eaters and feeders and say that 80% of us need to
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.120]  be killed you've heard Prince Phillips say he wants to come back as a virus to
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.360]  kill the majority of the world population Dr. Eric Pionka Peter Singer it's all
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.520]  over the news where they tell us that we should only have one child because more
[44:13.520 --> 44:17.280]  than one is bad for the environment and that the recession is good for lowering
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.560]  our carbon footprint this is the big secret we live in a scientific
[44:21.560 --> 44:25.520]  dictatorship and the United States and England are the epicenter of this and
[44:25.520 --> 44:30.280]  it's expanding worldwide remember all the secret testing all the secret
[44:30.280 --> 44:33.560]  sterilization that went on in the United States and Europe remember what
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.800]  Hitler did he learned all of that from the eugenicist and the Rockefeller family
[44:37.800 --> 44:43.400]  in the United States this is a culture of death being pushed on you and your
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.280]  family and even if you think the world is overpopulated you need to understand
[44:47.280 --> 44:54.800]  that you're being targeted by this as well targeted by design
[44:54.800 --> 45:01.600]  recombinant bovine growth hormone in your milk making eight-year-old girls go
[45:01.600 --> 45:06.920]  into puberty and they should be going into puberty at 12 or 13 silicone in
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.560]  chicken McNuggets and hundreds and hundreds of other processed foods as
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.080]  pertain that is the feces of genetically engineered bacteria that has
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.600]  incredible health problems that have been proven think for yourself it goes
[45:20.600 --> 45:26.080]  on and on ABC news this goes back four years ago viral meat spray advancing
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.680]  food safety they spray a live virus on the meat to supposedly kill the
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.720]  bacteria this is a live vaccine they spray on most the meat you're consuming
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.640]  that you're buying from the store it gets even worse the petroleum distillates
[45:41.640 --> 45:45.720]  or toxic waste that's left over from petroleum refineries that refine oil
[45:45.720 --> 45:50.480]  into gasoline they take these tens of millions of pounds of toxic waste that's
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.480]  left over the fluoride the mercury the lead and they dump it on crops as
[45:55.480 --> 46:00.200]  supposed fertilizer and what a crops like tomatoes and corn and potatoes do
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.680]  they pull in all of those toxins out of the ground in fact scientists for many
[46:05.680 --> 46:09.760]  years have used plants to actually detoxify areas that have been
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.680]  contaminated and those plants are pulling all of this up and then you are
[46:14.680 --> 46:22.240]  eating it that's why the Washington Post reported in January of 2008 that a
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.680]  major study found that nearly a third of the 55 popular brand-name foods and
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.960]  beverage products were filled with mercury despite the fact of the people
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.360]  of Europe for over 20 years have fought off all the genetically modified wheat
[46:36.360 --> 46:40.520]  and corn and other crops being planted in their nation now the EU is buckled and
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.040]  is accepting it the United States is literally a testing ground for all of
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.400]  this it's just automatically approved and the people that work for these
[46:49.400 --> 46:52.680]  corporations they're compartmentalized they don't know what's going on the
[46:52.680 --> 46:56.280]  people that work at these stores they haven't no idea what's happening this
[46:56.280 --> 47:01.240]  is affecting all of us this is hurting everyone many different forms of cancer
[47:01.240 --> 47:06.840]  are growing by thousands of percentage points diabetes all these different
[47:06.840 --> 47:12.080]  diseases and in major studies it's all been linked to the toxic additives that
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.640]  are in our food our water and I haven't even time to get into MSG I mean I've
[47:16.640 --> 47:20.480]  interviewed brain surgeons neurologists scientists I mean it just
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.680]  devastates the brain it's an excitotoxin it destroys the liver and it is in
[47:25.680 --> 47:30.520]  tens of thousands of products we can say no we can stand up but if you've got a
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.560]  neighbor given fluoride water to their baby please go over and warn them if you
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.680]  got a neighbor that's sitting there eating MSG filled chips one after the
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.080]  other warn them you've got a responsibility if you know people that
[47:43.080 --> 47:48.720]  are feeding processed foods filled with GMO warn them and for God's sakes don't
[47:48.720 --> 47:51.720]  give it to your own children if you want to kill yourself that's your own
[47:51.720 --> 47:59.160]  business but don't hurt your children don't do this ladies and gentlemen in
[47:59.160 --> 48:03.040]  closing I want to talk about some positive things just 15 years ago or so
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.600]  you couldn't find organic food anywhere on store shelves and now about half of
[48:08.600 --> 48:14.720]  what you see is organic just a few years ago all the milk had the growth
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.760]  hormone in it now it's hard to find milk that has the growth hormone in it
[48:18.760 --> 48:23.480]  because the consumers have spoken and said no a few years ago you couldn't
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.880]  find toothpaste that didn't have sodium fluoride in it now toms of Maine is
[48:27.880 --> 48:32.640]  starting to you know take over the aisle space and displace the other mainline
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.600]  toothpaste makers where it says on the back if you swallow this haul poison
[48:36.600 --> 48:42.400]  control immediately even Colgate is now putting out fluoride free toothpaste
[48:42.400 --> 48:47.920]  people are demanding that they not be poisoned and they're finding out about
[48:47.920 --> 48:51.760]  what's going on and so industry is starting to respond and at least give
[48:51.760 --> 48:57.160]  people who want a choice an option to not be forcibly medicated through the
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.680]  food and the water you know cigarettes are bad for you but just 20 years ago the
[49:03.680 --> 49:06.960]  cigarette makers were getting up before Congress and saying it was a conspiracy
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.680]  theory that it was killing people and then later it came out in their internal
[49:10.680 --> 49:14.240]  documents they knew it was deadly ladies and gentlemen I've seen the studies
[49:14.240 --> 49:17.600]  much of what they're putting in our food and water is far worse than even
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.520]  cigarettes as bad as they are one of the biggest killers in this country this is
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.280]  a covert soft kill operation we'll put a lot of links beneath this video so you
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.200]  can check out the facts for yourself and I'm just begging you to do your own
[49:30.200 --> 49:34.240]  research and find out that one of the most dangerous places in the world is
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.720]  your grocery store and the tap water in your house
[49:42.840 --> 49:51.280]  food the ultimate secret exposed up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and I
[49:51.280 --> 49:58.000]  want to add now an addendum to this 15 minute piece that we're also posting in
[49:58.000 --> 50:06.840]  the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv right now. Maryland Bands Chemical BPA
[50:06.840 --> 50:13.480]  linked to medical issues and it says not only is it linked to impotency but
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.640]  it's more serious side effects were highlighted Thursday as a ban on the
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.560]  substance came into effect in Maryland. Maryland was the fourth U.S. state to
[50:21.560 --> 50:26.520]  ban the chemical by Sphenol A commonly known as BPA which was linked to early
[50:26.520 --> 50:31.080]  puberty, childhood obesity, autism, reproductive problems, breast cancer and
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.960]  other medical issues like sterility. The chemical is often found in baby bottles
[50:36.960 --> 50:41.000]  and is common in clear plastic food and drink containers BPA is thought to leach
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.160]  into the container contents when heated. Thousands of different formulas of
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.720]  plastic this was the one adopted in the last 50 years worldwide will finish up
[50:50.720 --> 50:57.320]  with this get into food irradiation, meat, produce, you name it when we come
[50:57.320 --> 51:03.000]  back this is key information stay with us. This is Alex Jones with five good
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one new
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.800]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two
[51:10.800 --> 51:15.160]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[51:15.160 --> 51:19.520]  you to have. It's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.960]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country the
[51:23.960 --> 51:28.720]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:28.720 --> 51:32.520]  compounding the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:32.520 --> 51:36.160]  local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[54:07.680 --> 54:12.360]  surface in that special 15-minute presentation food the ultimate secret
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.000]  revealed. Now a lot of you already know this information but we've presented it
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.920]  with the documents with the mainstream news articles with images of what is in
[54:21.920 --> 54:26.280]  these different foods and what's being put in your water and we show images of
[54:26.280 --> 54:31.480]  the large packages of fluoride that says deadly poison on it that's being put
[54:31.480 --> 54:35.840]  in your water supply. Everyone needs to see this because the general public is
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.840]  not aware of just how serious this is. It's not just that oh junk foods bad for
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.600]  you or too much fluoride is bad for you. This is being put in there by design. We
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.400]  have the government white papers and corporate and university and UN
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.720]  documents. We cover it in my film Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[54:54.720 --> 55:01.600]  This is the major issue and here's Fox News. Maryland Bands Chemical BPA and it
[55:01.600 --> 55:09.480]  goes on to say that it's for only babies. Well fluoride hurts children and babies.
[55:09.480 --> 55:14.880]  The studies show a lot more than it hurts adults but you don't hear that being
[55:14.880 --> 55:19.560]  banned. No they push it on children. In fact we have government documents that
[55:19.560 --> 55:24.080]  Aaron showed me last night that I intend to do a piece on next week where
[55:24.080 --> 55:30.280]  they're actually at many public schools in England and the US have fluoride
[55:30.280 --> 55:35.840]  systems hooked up not making it one part per million but four parts per million
[55:35.840 --> 55:39.640]  and you know they come into the schools with those little red fluoride pills. I
[55:39.640 --> 55:42.560]  remember when that would happen to me in first and second grade I would take it
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.160]  and then get sick and have a headache and be throwing up by the time my mom picked
[55:46.160 --> 55:51.120]  me up after school and no one ever put two and two together and the teachers
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.120]  and dentists think they're helping you but this is an IQ reduction. Fluoride
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.800]  also attacks and sterilizes you. Fox News goes on meanwhile Berlin based
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.440]  urologist Professor Frank Somer told the London Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that
[56:05.440 --> 56:12.120]  men could ingest enough BPA from its use in receipts alone. It's commonly
[56:12.120 --> 56:19.160]  used as the black ink to suppress male hormones in the body and reduce
[56:19.160 --> 56:26.080]  fertility or even sterilize you. That's Fox News. Here is the Baltimore Sun.
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.640]  Senate passes BPA ban and bottles cups for small children. There's no reason.
[56:31.640 --> 56:37.120]  This has been chosen and adopted because it's meant to sterilize you. Now
[56:37.120 --> 56:43.480]  continuing if you just search the term food irradiation you'll learn the EPA
[56:43.480 --> 56:49.080]  approved this in the last decade and they're irradiating beef, poultry, fish,
[56:49.080 --> 56:56.440]  produce and it destroys the food value. It breaks the ring structures in the food
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.360]  and it's basically dead food you're now eating and it loses most of its
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.280]  nutritional value. That's another issue that we didn't even get into in this
[57:05.280 --> 57:11.840]  piece and the list just goes on and on and on. There are hundreds of petrochemical
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.640]  distillates, the leftovers of oil refining that are put as quote flavor
[57:17.640 --> 57:24.800]  enhancers and things to preserve food as preservatives that are highly toxic and
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.200]  that's that processed food taste that you become accustomed to but once you've
[57:30.200 --> 57:34.320]  stopped eating a lot of processed food it tastes like crud. I remember when I was a
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.360]  kid eating processed food going hmm what's that kind of dirty taste that spicy
[57:39.360 --> 57:45.280]  toxic taste that you eat in processed foods well it's it's things like the
[57:45.280 --> 57:49.560]  chemical in city of silly putty and that's not Alex Jones saying that that's
[57:49.560 --> 57:57.040]  seeing and admitting oh silly putty plastic chemical a type of silicone is
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.200]  in all these different processed foods these different TV dinners chicken
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.800]  McNuggets Taco Bell shells what came out a few years ago about Taco Bell they
[58:05.800 --> 58:09.960]  had on their store shelves what they were selling people at the fast food
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.880]  restaurant the Starlink corn that wasn't even approved for humans and they had
[58:14.880 --> 58:19.320]  to recall it because the violent reactions people had were so bad they
[58:19.320 --> 58:24.440]  couldn't cover it up and the government approves it these corporations are
[58:24.440 --> 58:30.160]  advised to use it it's cheap and they do please investigate this for yourself and

[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.840]  i've seen this a lot playing didn't know it for a few days that's happened to a
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.320]  lot of people i know but cps didn't come over that they came over finding out
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.080]  that he gives her colloidal silver turns out he works at a health food place and
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.720]  my point is they sell colloidal silver it's it's fda approved for topical and
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.640]  for sore throats they sell it at all major food stores they sell it at heb
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.200]  at central market here in austin at Whole Foods i know they sell it in in
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.640]  places like waco they sell it everywhere and it's well known as a
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.920]  antibiotic and antiviral so so you got about two minutes finish up what's
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:31.640]  happening to you oh yes ryan go ahead and finish up turn your radio off that's
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:38.760]  gonna be delayed okay i just want to let you know that we have to go back and
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.000]  get silver test done they want to drop blood from my daughter and we're
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.920]  refusing to get silver test done we already had it done one time they drew
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.040]  blood said that her silver levels were danger dangerously high and they wanted
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.440]  us to stay away from any type of silver they basically the doctor told us to
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.600]  report thing our daughter if we give her colloidal silver and so now that we're
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.440]  refusing to go back to get another blood test done on my daughter
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.280]  now they're calling cps on us again well sir i mean all you got to do the court
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.080]  is going there and with a bottle of it from the health food store and say this
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.600]  is sold in at at h e b here in waco so i mean i now i have said that if you just
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.840]  guzzle it all the time you know too much of anything is a bad thing that there
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.040]  are some evidence that people that just guzzle it every day can get toxic levels
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.200]  of it but in small amounts it's good that's why they sell it in stores but i
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.920]  guess they don't they're not worried about fluoride for babies though they're
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.800]  not worried about bisphenol a but keep us abreast of the situation ryan god
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.800]  bless you will pray for you they're in waco but it just sounds like a bunch of
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.040]  ignoramuses and you know i've seen cps take people's kids because you know it
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.320]  says in the cps order the father tells his son that you can't trust the
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.840]  government the government says you're not allowed to tell your children what

[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.760]  to talk to you I wanted to ask your question Wednesday night of this week
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.120]  I was you know flipping through the TV and this guy Chris Matthews I believe
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.200]  it's hardball he was on there talking about the immigration law there in
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.720]  Arizona that they're going through right now I swam and he right he come out and
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.160]  said right over TV you know he was talking about we need a national ID card
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:23.520]  so we can you know if you're legal or if you're illegal and I wanted to ask you
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:30.240]  Alex your take on that and how that is going to affect the American people well
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.080]  that's been the plan for a decade Bush tried it three times Obama tried it
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.120]  once he's trying it again but he can't get the House and Senate to pass it and
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.480]  so let me explain what's happening have you seen the TV ads for the North
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.160]  American travel initiative where it looks like a driver's license but it says
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.880]  now accepted in Canada and Mexico yes sir that's unlike the real ID act yes I
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.920]  yes but it's North American Union they have identical ads but in Spanish and
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:06.080]  identical ads in Canada and we played the ads here before and it's it plays
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.600]  America the beautiful in the background and it says you're now don't need a
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.720]  passport to travel in North America you get one of these so they always start
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.240]  the spying without warrants before they announce it they always prepare for a
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.960]  war before they announce it they always set up the national ID card and
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.280]  standardize it with the states before they announce it and so it's not just a
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.320]  real ID North US ID card it's a North American Union ID card and that's in the
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.000]  security prosperity partnership documents from the BAMP Canada meeting in
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.680]  September of 2006 judicial watch got them in 2007 it's in my film end game
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.160]  blueprint for global enslavement and we show the documents and they say we're
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:55.280]  going to use flu crises economic crises and border crises to pass total
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.800]  amnesty and to create a North American Union security perimeter around from
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.000]  Alaska down to southern Mexico on their border with Guatemala and so they're
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.320]  merging our military our police the training all of its being standardized
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.880]  the highways are being standardized the barcodes are being standardized the IDs
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.800]  have been standardized and so that's what amnesty is you're gonna have to have
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.200]  a federal ID to travel or to have a job and so will the illegals but it ends
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.320]  illegal immigration because it's stated in the last amnesty that we got when
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.840]  senator sessions remember they said it's not an amnesty in 2008 but we won't
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.000]  let you see the bill and then senator sessions leaked the bill he almost got
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.440]  censured but it was his right to do it and I believe the headline from senator
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.000]  sessions was the 20 smoking guns in the amnesty bill and it said violent
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.560]  felons are allowed to become citizens it said that illegals can bring in
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.040]  unlimited family members that they instantly get green cards through this
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.160]  national ID card and so that when you hear amnesty it's not just amnesty it's
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.600]  a national ID card but still the illegals will be selectively enforced on
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:16.360]  they won't have to have it and so yes that is exactly what the plan is really
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.680]  let me ask you this Alex just one more quick question sir does this mean that
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.920]  say I don't get this ID card does this mean I can't buy anything does this
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:33.280]  mean I can't work I mean this is just unreal yes sir I mean they've already
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.040]  announced million dollar fines if you have a garage sale and don't tell the
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:42.440]  feds that's Fox News AP headline they're already announcing that everything
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.080]  you're paid will be watched in real time via computers at any job you have
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.560]  they're announcing under the national health care already law the government
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.040]  will track how much you weigh on a monthly basis through your employer I
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:00.640]  mean it's the total nanny state tracking everything we do total control so they
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.640]  let the illegals operate outside the law then they bring in is the answer a
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.280]  super law where we've all got to have basically Nazi papers to have any type
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.960]  of job I appreciate your call in fact I forget the exact name of the initiative
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:20.520]  but I try North American travel ID in YouTube North American travel ID you'll
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.120]  see the Mexican ads the Canadian ads and the US ads they're almost identical and
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.120]  it shows the ID and you can go get the ID instead of a passport now and be able
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.560]  to travel anywhere in North America so it's already happening but but let's go
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.160]  back five six years ago Vicente Fox came to Austin gave an award to the police
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.720]  department and Wells Fargo for accepting consulate matriculas to get car loans
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.880]  housing loans as a citizen you got to show three IDs under the Patriot Act
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.800]  legislation but as an illegal you can show the matricula carding basically get
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.520]  out of a crackerjack box and so I'm sure you've all seen the TV ads for the
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.400]  North American Union ID travel pass so it's already here it's already beta
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:10.640]  tested that's what this is and they are now saying yeah there it is Western
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.720]  Hemisphere travel initiative commercial it's like the six length down guys they
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.440]  just put it on screen I'll go back to that please so there it is Western
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  Hemisphere travel initiative commercial go ahead and play that as soon as it

[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.200]  hello Alex yes sir great talk to you um
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.480]  I have two things to say um you know on Monday I watched
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.000]  the road and uh really it worked me up to a new
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:35.360]  level of understanding about you know how we're supposed
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.320]  to be and really how we have lost our
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.920]  not completely lost our humanity but the general public has
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:53.600]  as you said they have um they they're not connected to reality and um
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.520]  I don't know what it uh Thomas Jefferson that said something about
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.920]  moving to the city and um then losing something
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.000]  yes he said that when you're no longer on the land you lose your connection
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.240]  to reality and you become domesticated and that was 200 plus years ago that he
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.040]  wrote about that he talked about the educated
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.400]  yeoman farmer someone who's a mix of intellectual but also farmer and warrior
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.280]  you know the the the the true human who's fiercely independent
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:30.080]  uh and so obviously you watched my video about the road and allegory for life
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.760]  of course yeah really I mean I think it's the
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.840]  similar phenomenon like Thomas Jefferson said but
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:44.000]  the elites have um through all the different
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.680]  ways and in the media they have distorted us from
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.280]  reality and no that's it they distorted reality and the people to ask what I
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.080]  stand for is it libertarian is it patriot I am somebody saying tune into
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.320]  reality look around you don't just accept whatever you're told
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.480]  learn what it is to truly be a human people are always trying to become
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.800]  something instead of discovering what we already are
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:16.160]  yeah and the people are like they're all very self-centered and they have no
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.840]  sense of something greater you know I think this
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:29.840]  like yeah um atheism and uh this thought that only the thing that you can see is
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:35.920]  what exists and it uh it's prevent it prevents us from
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:43.520]  really just sacrificing ourselves to freedom and what we're supposed to
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.280]  reach for yes the globalist want us to be selfish
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.680]  and teach us that that's how we get ahead so we're all atomized and disconnected
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.640]  from each other so the corporate board can come in
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.360]  and re-engineer society into a literal hell they are patenting life
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.120]  they are taking over the biosphere they are corporatizing
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.240]  everything they are changing what human society is
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.560]  from something wonderful to something hellish and they teach people to be
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.200]  rudderless not because the controllers don't have
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.920]  rudders they don't want you to have a rudder so they can control you
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.600]  yeah but maybe we're entering through this age where
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.440]  no adversity makes man and in fact what is the victor hugo quote
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:35.280]  adversity makes men and uh plenty makes monsters that's right adversity makes
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.240]  men prosperity makes monsters victor hugo
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.200]  beautifully said from sweden thank you james we're going to go to julio evan

[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.200]  none of us are perfect but if we reach for something better
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.240]  then we'll tune in to the magic of the universe
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.160]  and we'll become more enlightened and it's all part of that process
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.600]  that's what life is all about not satiating our bestial levels

[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.920]  brother of the freedom movement quickly i saw a commercial
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.600]  yesterday homeland security continuing their propaganda
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.080]  campaign telling us to buy blood insurance of course we don't want to
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.440]  you know our house is to get on with the flood so we got to get for those that
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.480]  don't know they've passed a new regulation
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.560]  where 42 of the country that didn't have to buy flood insurance has to and
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.440]  you're buying it this time from fema so it's a tax they're now making people on
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.880]  mountain tops that never flood buy flood
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:57.040]  insurance it's a total scam uh secondly in the north american
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.640]  union front you know it just i keep reading watching the old clips from
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.840]  you and now reading documents where they they state
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.720]  that they want their north american union by 2010
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.400]  it's 2010 right now so folks we need can you press
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.640]  don't say no to the north american union say no to nafta as you said yesterday
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.040]  algor told us it was a great deal on mary king live with ross perot
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.680]  obviously if that liar said it's true never listen to algor
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.600]  thirdly on the world war three front i'm going to say this very quickly i have a
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.120]  friend who i woke up someone who he works with has
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.120]  knows someone who is in the uh intelligence agency
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.120]  and date he the romanian station out in afghanistan in afghanistan city 10 miles
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.440]  from the iranian border and from what my intel was telling me
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.840]  he noticed uh patriot missiles with uh being sent by the us army going
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.800]  towards the iranian border so once again world war three is looming
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.280]  and again you see all those training exercises being done by the uh
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.200]  by the national guard all around the country they know
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.360]  some that we could get attacked by a nuclear weapon in false flag
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.000]  or uh deliberately oh yeah they're going to use starting the war to let the
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.120]  federal reserve take over even more to sell us on i mean you think 9 11 got
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.080]  naked body scanners in place and 854 000 private spies and clergy response
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.080]  teams in infraguard imagine what a real war with iran will do
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.560]  and if iran doesn't strike back the the globalist will stage events
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.400]  as a pretext to take over even more we are the target
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.040]  julio great points evan in wyoming you're on the air evan
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.320]  hey there alex thanks for taking my call thanks for calling i've been a with
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.280]  an activist since high school and before 9 11 with some of your
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.640]  pressure predictions i'm so glad you're again breaching the food
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.760]  subject since it's one of the key things the new order is exploiting to take
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.880]  aware of freedom i recently watched a documentary film
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.000]  simply rob reversing diabetes in 30 days have you heard of it
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.680]  no but i know that a lot of these additives are directly linked to diabetes
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.720]  it's not even denied with so many people that suffer
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.840]  suffering musically because of these highly refined and processed food this
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.760]  film gives people the tools needed to reverse the so-called uncurable malady
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.080]  of both type 1 and 2 diabetes um if you have diabetes i do suggest you watch
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.360]  this film quickly a crock or a car as well got
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.120]  got it over 30 years ago and he's a top globalist and he admits it's all diet
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.840]  and he got rid of his diabetes yeah it crackles six americans with diabetes
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.080]  who switched to a diet considering entirely a vegan organic uncooked food
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.520]  to reverse diabetes what's the name of the film i'll look it up called simply
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.240]  rob reversing diabetes in 30 days and they really had tremendous results
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.480]  it's kind of in the same spirit of a spurlock film so 30 days
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.640]  it's the same spirit so it's kind of like 30 days uh with the uh film made about
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.920]  the guy eats mcdonald's for 30 days and almost dies
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.600]  but it's the reverse of that get off the stuff for 30 days and see what happens
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.440]  yeah and these people were suffering of high infant independence and
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.280]  many of them were able to reverse it uh in fact all of them
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.120]  were off well look i mean medical doctors are told by the american medical
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.720]  association if somebody has diabetes drink aspartame
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.640]  when i've had medical doctors on top experts saying
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.400]  it accelerates diabetes and so the average doctor isn't evil
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.840]  they're just believing what they're told i appreciate your call very interesting
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.120]  points anything else haven't uh fight for freedom with your food choices

[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.440]  because they're growing the crops with fertilizer that is filled with heavy
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.000]  metals and poisons and in the piece we put together the video piece we show
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  mainstream news admitting the crops are grown in poison

[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.560]  father reaganomics wall street journal editor syndicated columnist
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.160]  and we really appreciate him coming on the show
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.480]  to talk about the clouds gathering for war with iran the fact that that is
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.400]  becoming green-minded we had uh rey mcgovern high-level former cia
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.320]  analysts saying that he believes they probably are gonna attack and he said
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.400]  in august he said that uh everything's pointing at that
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.840]  there's still a chance they may not i want to get into the developments in the
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.920]  economy uh with dr roberts but first i wanted to talk
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.480]  about what inspired him to write this piece that's gotten so much
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:45.280]  attention 2017 the year america dissolved uh dr roberts good to have
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.840]  you on with us thank you alex so what inspired you to write this
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.400]  piece well i thought alex is sometimes hard
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.040]  to reach people with facts and in sound analysis and sometimes fiction works
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.000]  better uh so i decided to tell them what it would
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.920]  be like in seven years now reading this piece i mean
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.800]  are you saying this is a possibility and if so on a scale of one to ten ten
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.680]  being road warrior collapse uh a a road level collapse
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:25.040]  you know versus a two or three being what we're living under right now
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.520]  i'd say it's a much higher than a two or three i'd put it over five
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:35.440]  um at least six alex look alex it comes back to what we've discussed
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.920]  you and i so many times um the government's liabilities now
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.800]  exceeded its ability to deal with them when the budget deficit was uh
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:53.040]  400 billion dollars a year which it was two years ago in 2008
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.040]  the trade surpluses of china and japan and opac
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.960]  it could finance it but for the last the last two years
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.800]  the budget deficit has been not 400 billion
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.480]  but 1400 billion and that's a thousand billion more
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.640]  than the world has to lend us and so there's no way to finance
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.000]  these deficits now initially they financed them by giving the banks all
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.920]  that money loading up taxpayers with more debt
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.920]  and then the banks used all the money to buy treasury bonds
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.000]  at which they exchanged for their worthless derivatives and that
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:44.480]  financed the uh deficit but they can't bail out the banks
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:50.640]  by a trillion dollars every year so they only leaves printing money
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.680]  so the minute they print money two things happens
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.320]  that is what happens is when the government takes its debt
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.760]  to auction there's nobody to buy it the federal reserve
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.600]  buys it by creating demand deposits so the treasury rights
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.800]  checks well that's new money that's just like
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.640]  printing money so what happens when that occurs
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.200]  on a massive scale two things one the dollar ceases
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.200]  to be the reserve currency so the united states can't pay its import bills
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.760]  and you start getting hyperinflation domestically
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.320]  so prices are driven up for two reasons one all import prices
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.120]  rise because the dollar is gone and domestic prices
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  rise now what happens to the power here what is the power of a country
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.360]  really depends on it depends on its finance its ability to
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.560]  finance itself we already dependent uh 50 percent of the annual
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.360]  operating budget own foreigners to pay for our wars
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.640]  so what happens when nobody will finance the government and this printing
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.880]  money and prices are rising and there's no jobs
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.480]  it looks to me like washington essentially loses
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.680]  control and because it won't be able to meet its
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:19.600]  responsibilities to the people and so what would the people do
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.880]  well local people will have to organize
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.720]  in some way to take care of themselves
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:31.600]  to the extent that it's possible and i said i predicted that the first
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:35.680]  american warlords will be the local police forces
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.680]  so the first clans will be the local police force
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.080]  their relatives and their friends and anybody who can
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.720]  hook up with them who has something to offer and then
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.840]  you will see this type of local organization trying to provide
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.760]  protection and food for its members and that will
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.120]  that will be the future that's the gist of the piece
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:11.680]  please continue well um when you when you have these
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.440]  local clans they first organize around the police
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.840]  then they organize around whoever has stocks of food stocks of
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.600]  gold and silver guns and ammunition anyone who has
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.920]  something to sustain a community in some way
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:34.320]  and and the reach of washington over the country will evaporate
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.960]  the government will of course try to control fuel it'll
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.880]  it'll seize the the oil fields and refineries
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:49.440]  but when it tries to move the the gasoline across the territories of the
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.640]  clans it'll have to pay tribute to get across without being blown up the way
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.360]  we have to pay the afghans now we can't move
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.200]  fuel to the troops without paying off all the warlords
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.560]  along the way well there's payoffs in iraq as well
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.240]  that's right and that that'll happen here too
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.320]  they'll have to pay in the form of fuel because nobody will want the worthless
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:20.560]  paper currency and so that's the way the local communities will get
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.000]  fuel by taxing the movements of of the of the federal
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.160]  government's efforts to supply itself in washington and
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.160]  its troops and i said the most likely effect is that
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.840]  the troops we have abroad most of them will simply be abandoned
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.960]  because they won't be able to get them home
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.440]  and they'll the troops abroad will have to then make alliances with the people
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.200]  that they're currently fighting or trying to occupy and then you'll
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:59.680]  just see a general breakdown so you have to ask yourself
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:06.800]  how can a country have a world empire that can't finance
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.360]  its domestic government budget it's not possible well it's going to start world
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.720]  war three with iran and and i want to get into that with you
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.760]  but but but dr roberts i mean you're highly respected
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.320]  uh economist and and i mean i put a lot of stock in what you have to say and
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:26.720]  so many other experts are pointing out who do know history
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.160]  that it can happen here north korea is a failed state
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.720]  mexico is now basically a failed state run by
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.400]  regional governors and warlords battling it out
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.960]  uh with the drug cartels over that money and already many areas of south
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.040]  texas and arizona look like what you describe
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:51.280]  in your piece that you wrote uh the year america
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.680]  dissolved uh 2017 and so on this spectrum
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.800]  the question is how far will we go down that road
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.320]  but if you have studied rome or if you have studied even more modern
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.120]  civilizations uh wealthy nations do collapse in the
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.520]  third world squalor uh when they allow their currency to be
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:15.280]  debased i mean thomas jefferson uh talked about this
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:19.520]  but the feds have been strengthening their federal grip quietly federalizing
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.640]  police they've put their top secret usa 854
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.520]  thousand you know private spies in place
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.720]  they believe that that they're going to use this collapse to actually
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.560]  cement federal control as the great arbiter
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.640]  during this crisis uh that they've created but but i i guess you're saying
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.560]  from studying history
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.160]  alex if that's their intention you know all politics is local
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:53.440]  and the local police are not going to desert their communities to serve some
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:59.280]  foreign occupying power anymore than the the Taliban or the or the warlords
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.160]  are doing afghanistan so i think you're going to
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:07.040]  see that if that's the plan of the central houses
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.600]  it's not going to work because uh it wouldn't it would imply
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.920]  that the people locally would simply be
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.520]  prepared to be done away with and they won't be
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.160]  and the government it won't have any resources so you're saying sir
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.840]  because they get the resources from us at the local level and again
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.800]  historically you're right look at third world nations
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.000]  it once argentina was even more wealthy per capita than the us
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.760]  hundred years ago but they allowed this manipulation of currency and debt
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.920]  and so many of their cities one sector is controlled just like brazil
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.760]  by the gangs the other by the police i mean this is the norm
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.720]  now what you're saying not the exception but i'm getting from this
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.480]  uh that that you're saying you believe that this is going to happen
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.440]  i i don't see anywhere around it um what washington would have to do
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.040]  to avert that would not be accepted to the private oligarchies that rule the
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:06.080]  country so it looks to me like it's
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.080]  inevitable right now you see it everything works for the private
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.120]  oligarchies because they have a very short-term
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.320]  time horizon they're all getting rich from
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.040]  offshoring jobs from running up debts with military wars it puts money in
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.040]  their pockets and so on so what benefits them is
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.000]  destroying their base and but as long as they're
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.240]  individually benefited they won't see the net effect
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.120]  of of the action they'll only say oh i'm getting
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:42.320]  more money so it doesn't seem to be a way out keep your mind too alex
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.520]  the soviet union collapsed instantly it was just it was here one day and gone
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.920]  the next and the cia right down to the minute collapse was denying it
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:55.600]  whatever collapse oh this powerful government they
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.520]  control everything um they have total power everywhere
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.240]  well look at romania i mean chelchescu that happened within a matter of hours
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.680]  matter of hours and uh nile fergusson just uh the other week
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.880]  he's a historian of empire and he was speaking in aspen to the group where
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.240]  they go to think big faults and he said the american collapse could be very
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.800]  sudden because of the massive debts there's
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:31.680]  really no way you can be the reserve currency
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.240]  when you have this sort of debt explosion
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.760]  and there's no way we as i've already said that you can
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.440]  finance a deficit that's so large you can't finance
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:50.320]  deficits that are 1.4 trillion dollars it's just it can't be done and so it means
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.960]  massive money creation and so there goes
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.960]  there goes washington's power there they won't
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.040]  and and all their puppet states will abandon them what about
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:10.000]  another sure sorry go ahead sir that's that's that's it
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.480]  uh don't i'm just saying the puppets we're having a little bit of digital
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.160]  break up with you we we may reconnect when we go to break with dr roberts
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.680]  because there's a bit of a delay uh dr roberts
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.760]  going back to states rights though if the states recognize this collapse is
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.040]  inevitable according to economics and societal
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.600]  algorithms and analytics then if they start moving
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.600]  to reorganize themselves and to be honest and to cut their budgets
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.000]  and to cut off the money to the federal uh cancer
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.880]  then don't we have a chance to avert the complete collapse
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.880]  i don't know i think the state will be too large
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:58.320]  to organize and then um various communities will dominate the state
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.840]  to the expense of other communities so i think
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:05.840]  if this type of collapse which is fictional
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:13.120]  uh occurs it'll be mainly local warlords or local communities that can defend
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.520]  themselves make alliances with other local communities
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.960]  for mutual protection or to bow off the task let me put it this way because
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.680]  again i respect your analysis in your opinion
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.040]  you're saying it's a fiction piece we know that but then i said well what's the
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.440]  chances of this happening scale to one to ten
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:37.040]  you said at least a six yeah i mean you know running the scale
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.880]  then what do you believe is going to happen because it's clear the oligarchs
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.400]  running our nation as you said aren't going to stop their full pedal to the
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.040]  metal with a direction that will bring the
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.760]  collapse well i i don't see any way they can
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.840]  continue to finance 1.4 trillion deficits and i don't see
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.280]  any decline in those deficits uh and the reason i gave it seven years is i
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.640]  think um they can get some time from simply cutting
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.800]  social security and medicare they'll simply stop providing
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.440]  social security and medicare to the people who are dependent on it
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.160]  and then the next thing they will they'll and so they'll get another year
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.600]  or so out of that and then the next thing they'll do
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.880]  they'll confiscate the remains of private pensions
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.000]  and and that'll fund them for another year or so
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.600]  if they don't confiscate the pensions they will order the pension fund
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.240]  managers to use the funds to purchase treasury bonds well
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.040]  that's already happening stay there dr roberts
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.560]  because i happen to have the london telegraph reporting
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.800]  that they're already slashing basic medical care to the british
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.880]  for their budget so you know what you're talking about is already going on they
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.400]  still give you the social security it's just watered down to nothing
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.160]  we'll be right back with dr paul craig roberts i'm alex jones

[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.600]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:16.880]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:19.200]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:22.960]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.720]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.760]  gold grime
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.640]  government control of health care written by the insurance companies is so
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:24.720]  they can federally lower the standard and they're now admitting this so that's a
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:30.080]  way to kind of covertly by stealth start degrading the quality of care
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.640]  we see major police departments all over the nation announcing they're not
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.040]  going to respond to major crimes like armed robbery uh car theft
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.080]  home invasions oakland's one of the more
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.600]  visible examples but this is i'm seeing these articles every day now
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:47.120]  where they're laying off half the sheriff's deputies 60 percent of the
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.000]  police some towns getting rid of police all together
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.560]  so unfortunately dr roberts things are starting to trend in the way that
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.680]  that you're saying that things would go yes that's right that's that's why you
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.800]  know the fictional story has uh has resonated with
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.360]  so so many people and it's it's gone all over the world
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:14.240]  early this morning i was on a long skype interview from germany
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.760]  and of course the germans are or at least some of them are hoping this happens
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.360]  they want to be rid of us they're tired of being
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.680]  mercenaries and fighting for us in afghanistan and they're tired of being
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:31.280]  american puppet state so yes things are going this way that's why
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.520]  there's some there's truth in in the fiction that's why it resonates
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.920]  with people and that's why they're interested in in your reality of it not
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.480]  just in the storytelling part of it so
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:50.080]  you're right things are happening um the uh you're right the the medical
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:56.480]  uh reform which creates new patients for the new customers for the private
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.880]  insurance industries uh they're gonna use as excuse to
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:07.440]  cut medicare but in in in the end there just won't be
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.520]  anything provided to the people from the government
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.680]  because uh they're too busy stealing everything and then whatever they can get
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:20.320]  they'll need to keep themselves going and that's why i think the the
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:24.960]  organization will be local and people won't trust anybody that
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.480]  that's not one of them not part of their clan
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.840]  his newest book is how the economy was lost
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:36.000]  the war of the world's uh paul
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  craig roberts available at amazon.com we have it posted up on screen for
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.840]  folks that want to read his latest book or get a copy of it
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.960]  did you see the big bloomberg a 15 page report
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.280]  about insurance companies swindling the the widows
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.600]  of dead veterans tricking them to steal their
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.760]  their in some cases millions of dollars of insurance money
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:06.080]  i'm aware of it i haven't studied it but it doesn't surprise me
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.800]  because uh you know i think the opening chapter in my book if i remember
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  correctly is called a new robber barons
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.920]  and that's that's what the the capitalist corporations have been turned
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:24.320]  into their robber barons but it's so bold
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.200]  to i mean even bloomberg says it's criminal and they just steal their money
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.880]  and just take it but they got the regulators to change the rules so they
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.240]  could do it and the insurance companies it says all major insurance companies
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.360]  are doing it just said we're allowed to we're going to do it i mean
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:45.280]  they're so brazen right that's right so maybe it's a
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:48.160]  higher than a six
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.280]  i gave it a six maybe it's close to a ten well you know
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:56.000]  we're going to break with the final five minutes and i want to get into iran with
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.640]  you and uh what you think about the acceleration
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.800]  towards war but i know a lot of really wealthy people
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.960]  that i've run into or met at events and i talked to one lady who's
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.400]  listed as one of the richest women in america i'll just leave it at that
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:14.160]  four years ago she left the country and said it will not be here
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:18.160]  within five years and she said it's derivatives and this was before
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:22.000]  you know the 2008 stuff and she said that all the other big money's leaving
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.960]  and now there's been mainstream news articles about the rich
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:29.680]  basically all leaving uh so it it seems they know they've killed america
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:34.240]  and i want to come back in 70 seconds have dr roberts briefly comment on that
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.000]  and then on the iran situation then we've got
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.080]  bob shatman coming up stay with us

[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:58.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:07.840]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.040]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:22.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:25.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:28.960]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:31.840]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.960]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.680]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.240]  okay alex keep in mind that there are two kinds of rich people
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:51.760]  they're the rich people who live off of fortunes that
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.440]  are not in the corporations or on wall street
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.120]  and they're different from the people who are building fortunes who are the
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.760]  CEOs of corporations or the wall street
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.360]  hedge fund managers and investment bankers who are building the fortunes
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.000]  they are the ones who are running things in the ground the people who have the
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  money are just living off of it and they can see it they don't have a stake in
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.480]  it and they're getting out while they can and uh so that makes sense
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:24.640]  now iran and the you know i've been expecting them to attack iran for
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.320]  some time and if you look at everything they
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:31.120]  say and everything they do that's what it points to
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.080]  it doesn't point to anything else and every time somebody
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:42.080]  resolves the situation for them like uh brazil and turkey did recently
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.240]  the united states government gets mad so i think
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.000]  they want to have a war and they're not quite sure
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.240]  how to go about it the consequences they got to have some excuse
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:57.760]  they keep talking about the non-existent nukes
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.400]  that but they keep getting contradicted by the u.s intelligence agencies and by
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.360]  the international atomic energy agency which is on the ground in iran
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.480]  and reports no diversion of uranium and they don't know
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.360]  what the impact could be on russia or china or how they'll see it
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.680]  and so they want to do it but they can't really
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.640]  see how exactly they're going to get away with it so as soon as they can
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.560]  convince themselves that they can get away with it and that they have some way
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:34.240]  to justify some false flag event or just some
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.800]  happenstance maybe just something happens that uh that
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.280]  iran doesn't mean to happen or so they can blame around once they see a way
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:50.160]  uh then they will probably uh make this attack unless of course
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.080]  enough of them in washington start to realize
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:03:00.880]  that uh they're bankrupt and they have no way to carry on these wars and that
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.680]  it's undermining uh their power and if they were to come
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.600]  to that realization they would back off i don't know what the chance
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.680]  is of them coming to that realization as you know the neoconservatives are
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:17.200]  screaming every day takaran takaran is a
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:21.440]  a new screed and the weekly standard now
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.800]  um the the push for the from the military
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.560]  security complex to keep the war profits going
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:33.600]  all of that's driving them so it's hard to know
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:37.360]  how they will finagle it what will happen that will let them
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:43.760]  unleash it and this this leak of this wiki leak
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:50.720]  uh of all the afghan material this this may be undermining them
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.360]  in some way uh so they have they'll have to make a judgment
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.920]  they want to do it but whether they can
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.800]  decide that they can get away with it that remains to be seen
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.880]  well rey mcgovern and many others including akmed energiator saying they
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.920]  believe it's in the next three months if the attack is going to be launched in
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:16.800]  this phase the last big danger zone uh it was late 2007
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.040]  but the aftermath and the repercussions of this uh
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:24.880]  i mean have you ever in your research seen a more dangerous time in us history
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:30.320]  than what we're entering right now uh no and the danger comes from washington
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.560]  it's not from the outside world that the enemy
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.720]  come is in washington i the threat we face is our own government

[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:17.440]  and the gcn radio network yeah 14 years ago people thought that liner was a
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:21.200]  joke we are in an occupied global corporate system
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:24.640]  we need to take america back and restore the republic
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.520]  or we'll be bankrupted like all the other third world slaves
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:31.120]  these crooks have sucked dry we're going to finish up with dr paul
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.080]  craig roberts because i didn't want his point to be cut off during the break
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.240]  but then he made a big announcement to me and we're going to make the
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.480]  announcement here he's going to be now working with trendsresearch.com
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:44.000]  and gerild solente gerild's on a week from monday for an hour and a half by
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.840]  the way with an extended interview so i can't think of two better guys
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:51.520]  teaming up trendsresearch.com's the website
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:55.200]  dr roberts tell us a little bit about that and finish your point
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.440]  i well i suppose i got myself into it when i stopped doing the column because
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.280]  uh solente said hey you don't have anything to do why don't you
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.840]  join up with us and so i've agreed to to do some writing
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:12.080]  for their trends journal now the point i was making and i'm very
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:15.520]  pleased because you know solente is a guy who's not afraid
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:21.280]  he speaks his mind and he has a lot of important valuable insights so i'm
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:26.960]  delighted to have teamed up with such a personality
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:30.480]  now the point i was making is you know as i said
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.760]  earlier the constraint on the united states government is
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.720]  its ability to finance itself its financial position
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:41.040]  and i explained reasons that's getting weak and now what happened last week was
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.640]  the head of the major chinese credit rating
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.560]  agency declared that the united states is insolvent
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:53.440]  and has the debt burdens of a bankrupt third world country
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.760]  now when your largest creditor makes a public announcement
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:04.000]  that they have no faith in you that is a constraint on your power and that may
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.680]  that may be what blocks the attack on
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.480]  iran if anything does to hear from your creditor
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.280]  that they see you as insolvent and bankrupt so they're trying to buy a war
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:20.960]  they go to their creditor the communist chinese and they say you're bankrupt
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:23.680]  i mean is that along the same lines as two weeks ago
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.080]  their head credit rating agency uh getting rid of the triple a rating for
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.920]  the united states in europe i think that was an opening
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.200]  god yes they downgraded it see they're serving themselves
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.720]  because we think we're the superpower but
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.000]  they're our creditor so who really is the superpower
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.440]  last point i'm gonna let you go sir we appreciate your time
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:50.880]  the problem is what 40 000 50 000 nobody knows
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.280]  nukes high-tech weapons that are in the control of the neocons and the crooks
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.400]  that run our government so it sounds like they're
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.880]  just going to go ahead with whatever it takes i mean remember cheney launching
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.440]  the georgian attack uh on the russian herald harry i mean these people are
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.600]  nuts they're nuts they can use that for nuclear blackmail to
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:16.800]  force countries that are not well armed to supply them with resources
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:20.160]  and and that's another way they could continue longer
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:25.120]  uh than our forecast but they would still lose control over this country
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.520]  and so at some point the other countries would realize there's only one target
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:35.280]  in america and that's washington and once they realize that that's the end of
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.840]  washington dr roberts uh after one city to get rid of it
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:46.080]  then it's an easy thing to do well the criminals there on the potomic the
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.720]  district of criminals dr paul craig roberts thanks for your
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.320]  insights we appreciate you coming on pleased to be with your hikes great
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320]  happening all right we'll talk to him again in the near
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:57.200]  future god willing if they don't start world war three in the next month like
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.800]  ray mcgovern said is a distinct possibility he said more
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.080]  than a 50 chance by the middle of august
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:07.680]  that it's going to start and most analysts say it is going to lead to world
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:11.760]  war three the media is also saying venezuela is giving weapons
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:14.800]  which is asinine uh it's the other way around
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:19.200]  to iran when their weapon systems are much more high tech than venezuela so
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:22.800]  they've got us fleets and forces moving into columbia
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.640]  around them and we're going to be talking to bob chatman
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.640]  about what he just heard dr paul craig roberts saying bob chatman
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.760]  is is an uber patriot he's been fighting for near half a century
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:39.600]  and is really one of the only living granddaddies of the patriot movement
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.480]  so we're always honored to have him join us and he'll be with us for the balance
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:48.320]  the hour for the next 47 minutes today but before i go to him
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:52.240]  i shot this video two and a half weeks ago
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:55.840]  and happened to be wearing the same shirt though it's funny the guys pointed
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.480]  out you know you're airing that video today you're wearing the same shirt
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:01.760]  people say he did the video today it'll be a big conspiracy about that
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:06.080]  the point is uh we shot this video two and a half weeks ago or so
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:09.440]  erin and i to make sure everything was documented with hundreds of documents
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.600]  video clips you name it put this 15 minute video together
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.880]  it's now gone up to prison planet dot tv if you want to download it
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.640]  in the highest quality but it's also on the alex jones channel at youtube is
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.200]  this is a public service emergency announcement where we just prove
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.800]  that people are being poisoned and killed by design through the food through the
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.520]  water aspartame msg gmo it's a devastating 15 minute
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.200]  piece and i'm asking everyone to go to info wars dot com

[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.360]  the ultimate secret exposed that's the name of the article
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.960]  that's the name of the video i want you to send that link out to everybody but
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:58.640]  i haven't done this in about a week and a half we had five search terms
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.000]  in a five day period showing the mainstream media our power
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.040]  when they were censoring the obama deception were the number one search
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.240]  terms on youtube uh google yahoo and a lot of other places
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.480]  we can do it again now the headline is food the ultimate secret exposed
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:17.760]  we need to use some term out of that that will then make
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:22.160]  this article that has the video the top link the top
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:25.440]  link so that when people see this top search term
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.200]  then hundreds of papers and blogs will then write about it we discovered not
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.560]  only do people link to our story other people then write about it and we
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:38.160]  reach millions at one bang you know i mean this is a
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:42.000]  powerful info war weapon in our arsenal
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.920]  and so i don't know i mean i said earlier just search the term food the
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.040]  ultimate and that will bring you to the article
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:52.160]  and we can have a secondary search made up of that term to have the second
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.160]  search or depending on what goes up the rankings
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.640]  one will be on top one will be number two the ultimate secret that's probably
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:03.920]  even a better search term than food the ultimate but
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.040]  i know how search engines work it needs to be simple no more than three words
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.920]  so search the ultimate secret three words the ultimate secret do it over and
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:16.320]  over again and google and yahoo in the search engine
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.680]  click on the article send it out to everybody tell them to pay it forward
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:24.400]  to to to send the link on to others and and we will warn people about what's in
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.840]  their food what's in their water you may know all about this
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.320]  but a lot of people don't i mean they've heard aspartame's bad or msg's bad or
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:35.600]  gmo crops are bad but most people have no idea
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:39.680]  just how serious it is this is highly produced powerful video

[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.800]  all we did was make the video and write the article and that's important that's
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:10.400]  its genesis but if it's going to grow and have a huge
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:14.640]  effect that is up to you and this is your mission if you choose to accept it

[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.120]  joins us to break down the economy what's happening in the world
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.800]  bob good to have you here with us well thank you very much
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:48.160]  and i saw the video this morning and jr and i viewed it
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:52.240]  and it's number one on the hit parade in my link section under the u.s. section
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:55.440]  for tomorrow morning thank you sir i need everybody's help and i really
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.120]  appreciate you what do you think of the video itself then we'll talk
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  about robert saying he believes it's a six on a
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:08.640]  10 that we're going to completely collapse like mexico
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.640]  well first of all as far as the film is concerned
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.640]  i'm one of those souls who's been doing and reading about
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.920]  and exercising the things that i should be since
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:25.200]  i guess 1964 you know vitamins minerals herbs eating the proper thing it's
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.760]  probably one of the weak reasons that i'm as healthy as that i am that this
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:35.280]  you know advanced age and you know work 16 18 hours a day and it doesn't even
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:38.880]  phase me so uh people please listen
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:41.760]  because that's the way you should be living and you should be eating those
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:45.760]  kind of foods and you get a bolster your immune system so
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.080]  the program is extraordinarily important it's something you know we have a
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:54.960]  health section but i don't get into it that that deeply i let others write
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:18:00.000]  because i just can't cover everything but uh alex it's great it's a wonderful
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.480]  program and everybody should jump on the bandwagon well thank you let me just
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.960]  have the caveat you know the message isn't just that all this poison is there
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.400]  but that it's being done by design we have those documents
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.080]  in the piece i mean this is so diabolical now now
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:20.560]  any comments on roberts and the pieces that he's been putting out lately i know
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.880]  you follow his work well uh in reference to what you
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.480]  were talking about that prior to his just leaving
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:34.400]  i agree with him and rama govern too um but you know your comment was these
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:39.920]  people are nuts and they are and they think they're above everything
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:46.640]  and even if they cannot justify a war a new one wherever it may be
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.480]  they're going to do it anyway you got to go back and look at the history of
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.960]  these people and we only have written history probably back to
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:59.840]  the the year six or seven or eight hundred uh but this has been going on for
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:03.840]  a long time and they habitually and perpetually
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.280]  every time they get in the squeeze and they want to
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.760]  blame somebody else for what they're doing they they have a war
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:15.360]  and that's why i was able to project
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.160]  the uh invasion and occupation of iraq and afghanistan
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.800]  because i knew they were going to do something like that
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:26.160]  they look like the suspects and they were
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:33.280]  and that's the way it turned out so uh they they're trying to use every option
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:37.520]  and i've had this conversation too on a program which i do
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:43.040]  with active and retired military people which i really love doing because uh
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.280]  they don't know anything about finance per se and so i've been very helpful to

[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:29.040]  dot com all right bob we've got china
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.800]  lowering the credit rating for the u.s government and the eu
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:36.240]  we've got open buildup for war with iran
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:39.600]  i've got this bloomberg 15 page report where
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:42.880]  every major insurance company has had the government rules change where they
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:48.000]  can take dead veterans insurance money and not give it to people
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.360]  i mean it's like we're living in the twilight zone bob
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:55.360]  it certainly is and it just shows you that there's nothing there to protect
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.520]  the american public within this new financial regulation
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:04.880]  bill that they passed the sec is no longer subject to the freedom of
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:08.800]  information act the foya is it's known
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:12.960]  that means that everything they do is a secret
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:17.120]  now in there the sec only brings
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:21.360]  civil charges against people for whatever uh within the
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:27.200]  usually within the brokerage and uh in the uh industrial and service industries
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:32.720]  and they have always had secret testimony that they wouldn't divulge
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:39.200]  but now it will be probably like a court that was held
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:43.760]  during the 12th century uh before the magna cotta
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.320]  and it's a very very very bad but it just is an example
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:53.920]  of people not having any rights and and this is what this is propelling
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:58.080]  towards well i've got that headline and you and ron paul and judge napolitano
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.280]  have read the bill that's now law and you've stated it gives the fellow
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:04.320]  reserve total control over the economy with a private
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:07.280]  board made up of the very leaders of the banks
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:10.480]  that robbed us and there's the fox news headline from fox business
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:15.200]  will put that back on screen sec says new financial regulation law exempts it
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.440]  from public disclosure that way next time somebody warns them about burning
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:23.200]  made off or kin lay for 11 or 12 years they don't even get
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.880]  criticized no one ever even knows because they are literally all the
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.400]  former people of these criminal groups and so that's why the insurance
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:34.240]  companies say we'll just stop paying the death benefits on dead soldiers
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:40.880]  haha diabolical and you know i gotta give you three
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:46.480]  instances because i've been in the brokerage business and close to the
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:49.120]  financial market for over 50 years
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.680]  number one about four months ago uh the berkshire hathaway
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.600]  uh was found in guilty of accounting fraud
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:02.160]  300 million dollars and i think the the fraud was against the u.s government
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:05.360]  but i'm not sure i didn't read the internals
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:08.480]  and they will find a hundred million dollars
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:13.120]  so it was worth it for them to do that because they kept 200 million
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:18.000]  and then along came uh goleman sacks and they sold five billion dollars
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.920]  or more worth of collateralized debt obligations which are bonds with
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.720]  mortgages inside them they uh were called before the
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:31.440]  sec uh for for a number of violations in that
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:36.240]  the genre and they pay to find a 550 million dollars
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.040]  so they they stole essentially five billion or more
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:46.560]  and paid a fine of a half a billion and they kept 4.5 billion dollars
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.800]  now the third one is today which happened yesterday
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:57.040]  city group was fined 75 million dollars now they sold 50 billion dollars with
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:02.000]  the cds which are now worth about 15 billion dollars
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.920]  and that's all they get fine with 75 million dollars and we have all their
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:10.160]  own internal emails and documents they knew it was pure worthless crud
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:13.680]  they had fake insurance companies certified as triple a
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:17.760]  undermining the entire financial system and they get away with it
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:22.320]  and nobody goes to jail and they're all interconnected
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:28.320]  they all belong to the illuminati they control our government from the
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.400]  behind the scenes they control and own the fed reserve
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:36.160]  and that's why dr rovitz as well as ron paul and myself
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.040]  and you as well have said that this is tyrannical
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.520]  people who don't have any idea yet what's going to happen and it's going to
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.880]  be very nasty because they've committed millions
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:52.240]  of crimes why not commit millions of even beggar crimes
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:56.320]  they've shown that have you ever seen fraud in history that he gets anywhere
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:00.720]  close to this no they're not on this uh colossal
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:05.680]  basis so to speak and it's ongoing and again i come
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.000]  back to what you're speaking of earlier uh with another war
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.320]  let's say with it with iran and mcgovern and uh and
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.000]  dr rovitz and myself and you agree that there's an excellent pop
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.840]  possibility of it happening but the justification and the money isn't there
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:27.280]  they're going to do it anyway these people are crazy
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:32.800]  and all of us are in the middle i i want to come back and get into gold how
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:35.600]  they're manipulating that what you see happening in the short
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:38.320]  mid-long term of the economy and then phone calls

[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.920]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:09.760]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:13.680]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:17.040]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.360]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:23.280]  they think they're on our water children our education our money
[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.360]  we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:31.440]  somebody's going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising you have
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:34.480]  been warned we have the facts we have the constitution

[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:20.000]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:28.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:32.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:12.560]  the gcn radio network
[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:17.600]  your phone calls are coming up with bob Chapman but before we go any further
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:22.080]  two and a half weeks ago when the obama deception got censored on youtube
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:29.280]  got removed and then unprecedented action by youtube they put it back up
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:34.240]  i made the decision to offer the dvd with the expanded extras and the highest
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:37.520]  quality for five dollars a piece or a little under
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.440]  five dollars you can get four of these films until
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:43.120]  monday we're going to get rid of the special monday
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:48.560]  evening for 1995 you cannot meet that special
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:52.720]  you can go to info wars dot com we've got two different shopping carts

[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:09.040]  you can also get 10 copies for 39 95 so that's
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:12.880]  under four dollars a piece when you get 10 copies and believe me
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:16.800]  you give this to a liberal a conservative they'll think it's
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.160]  in the control left right paradigm this film has been so successful
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:25.280]  so many callers so many people on the streets so many talk show hosts
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.400]  say that this film that's evergreen released a year and a half ago
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:32.800]  is what finally woke them up i think my most powerful film is in game blue
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:35.440]  blueprint for global enslavement but this one
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.680]  has been the most effective and it's it's riveting power packed
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.280]  describes the entire paradigm for people to understand what the banks are
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:46.240]  doing the design collapse of society how they
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:48.800]  were going to promote austerity and cutting benefits
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:51.600]  year and a half ago they weren't talking about that it's all in the film
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.320]  people see this and they say this was made a year and a half ago this is
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:58.320]  what's happening today and of course part two of it is fall of the republic
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:01.920]  which i think is even more powerful of a film at the point is this is the film
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:04.160]  that's the most effective at waking people up
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.000]  the obama deception ten copies thirty nine ninety five and your purchase
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.280]  and the meager profit funds this entire operation
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:15.040]  we also have a lot of other big specials at info wars dot com on books t-shirts
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:17.680]  ball caps all of it about spreading the word can

[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:31.760]  upgrading the site it's all in the works right now i want to thank all of you in
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:35.680]  the six plus years of support of prison planet dot tv
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:39.200]  you can sign up in about 30 seconds just a username passcode
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:42.160]  five ninety five a month trial membership or get a yearly membership and get
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:45.440]  three months free then you can share your passcode
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:48.800]  well really with as many people as you want but it only allows
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:52.640]  the passcode to be entered by six different people simultaneously
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.320]  so six people can use it with the same username and passcode
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:59.760]  simultaneously so i wouldn't give it to more than 10 people
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:03.120]  because if you do more than that and they share it you'll go in and try to use it
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:06.320]  you'll be locked out while the other six people are on there
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:09.440]  and we'd give it all to you for free if we could it's high quality
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.920]  you know this stuff is close to hd some of the new films coming out we're

[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:29.760]  well i guess it's yesterday now that as i had predicted earlier uh one of the
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:35.280]  major cities in greece has gone bankrupt no i i i rephrase that
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:39.200]  one of the major cities in greece has defaulted
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.440]  on some of their loans and that's pyraeus which is the
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.560]  main port in the country which is uh fairly close to athens
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.520]  and so it it may have begun over there
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.920]  and we saw the euro just a month ago was supposedly going to collapse
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:00.560]  but then the belterberg said we can't allow that
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.400]  but and then merkel wouldn't let the brokerage firms come in
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:09.600]  and manipulate their currencies is there a split within the elite right now
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:15.040]  um yes there is at least on that measure and that happens from time to time
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:19.200]  uh they're a greedy bunch and they always want more money than the next guy
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:23.280]  and um she did the right thing there's absolutely no question
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:28.320]  and uh the euro got down to one eighteen seventy five
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:34.160]  uh yesterday closed over 130 and uh so that's quite a recovery
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.320]  i would imagine somewhere along the line it will solidify
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:42.160]  uh the consumer confidence in germany is very strong
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:49.280]  because the big exporters and that less expensive euro is going to make their
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:53.760]  exports probably at least 10 cheaper than they normally would
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:57.600]  but the implosion of all these fiat currencies has got to go somewhere
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.760]  the way the system set up and some of our uh economics guests we've had on the
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:05.040]  last week are saying they see it migrating to
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:09.120]  london or tokyo next what do you say
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.520]  well that could that could happen in part uh what i thought you were referring
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:18.640]  to when you asked that question was uh the currencies and where people are
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:22.320]  going to go to and of course the the main reason
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:27.120]  the gold is higher than it is and and and and and this is
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.720]  something that people overlook except some professionals
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:36.880]  and that is for the last 15 months gold has been competing with the dollar
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:43.120]  as the for the position of the preeminent currency in the world
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:48.320]  people who have currencies all of them are gravitating back to gold
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:51.440]  because they know it doesn't owe anybody anything
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:56.240]  and you're going to see this strengthen as time goes on
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:01.840]  not the answer to question but no no no i mean i mean it was just an open no no
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:06.160]  that is my question uh so i mean you did answer it
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.200]  uh did gold going down a little bit have to do with an entire years market
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:16.240]  uh being secretly sold by the imf and world bank two weeks ago
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:22.560]  we don't know uh what they did uh we will find out in time but there was a
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.840]  lot of selling but you got to remember things go up and things go down
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:33.520]  stocks goals commodity etc and so it's not unhealthy
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.960]  to have a hundred point corrections sure it's painful if you're in the long
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:40.160]  side of the market but then again it's not so painful if
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.800]  you've got money to do more buying or you're making an initial investment
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.200]  you know like the the the french roosters just as an example that
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:53.920]  that ted uses in his business they're around and don't quote me on this i'm
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:57.920]  not a coin dealer but around two hundred and sixty five dollars
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:02.640]  a year from now might they might be double that and so what would you rather
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.360]  have a rooster or a dollar or a federal reserve note
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:11.360]  and of course the answer is pretty simple well gold is up thirteen dollars
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:15.040]  and eighty cents today when do you see it running back up to the levels it was
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:20.880]  at two months ago it's it's in the process of doing so
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:27.200]  okay and uh you know i thought that by the end of the year we could get 16 1650
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:32.000]  and i think that's still very doable uh it might be a little bit more difficult
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  it's hard to say i think a great deal of the selling that you've seen
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.440]  that occurred in the gold market occurred
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:47.040]  in the futures market as opposed to physical selling
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:52.160]  and the reason why is there's a record and close to record amount of contracts
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.040]  being traded uh yesterday on wednesday was a good example of that
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:01.440]  they set a record and gold contracts and that means that
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:05.920]  there was a lot of selling going on but this is paper selling
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.120]  it's different than the physical market and that's what gata's lawsuits and
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.720]  investigation deals with is how they use the paper market to manipulate the
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:16.720]  physical yes and they're using leverage
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:19.520]  which they're not supposed to do which is illegal
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:24.400]  and uh there is testimony from a professional in london on the lbma
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:28.400]  that the leverage is about a hundred to one
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:31.680]  and there's another report i saw by adrian douglas
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:36.080]  and he had it paid to the minimum of 45 to one so do you call that naked i mean
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.880]  they're not even really investing they're just manipulating that's right it's naked
[02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:45.520]  you know it's just like a big casino and the u.s government has told them hey
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:51.120]  they go do it you know we'll cover you total like jp morgan chase controlling
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:55.920]  the silver market it's illegal but the government's behind them
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:00.240]  look at the lawsuit several years ago that was brought forward
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:03.920]  uh by another coin dealer in in the united states
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.120]  and in the testimony and barrett gold said
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.040]  well we were selling gold forward under instructions
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.920]  from the united states government it's right in discovery
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:19.680]  it's it's just incredible how rigged things are let's take some phone calls
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:25.520]  mike in pennsylvania you're on the air yeah the quote by andrew jackson when
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:29.840]  he was putting up with the same struggles in the 1830s about then uh
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:35.760]  thomas bill the same ben Bernanke you are a debt of vipers
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:39.920]  and by eternal god i will route you out
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:44.480]  and we have to get behind the secret of ours's idea of
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:48.240]  debt free money issued interest free by the federal government
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:52.720]  not the federal reserve and we're state banks rule
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:56.400]  and i wanted your comment well no i mean i agree with you
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.240]  uh that's the power of congress that's in the constitution
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:04.160]  that that the people's congress chooses our monetary
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:10.720]  system not a private federal reserve this is federal as federal express bob
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:14.560]  agreed but you've got to remember we don't want
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:21.280]  another us note without any backing you've got to have gold or silver or
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:26.080]  both backing that us government produced
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.200]  currency that you're talking about it's extremely important
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:34.640]  because you'll just be like every other fiat currency in the world
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.720]  and the name will change from federal reserve notes to us notes
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.800]  that's not good enough we have to have something tangible
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:46.800]  behind that new currency that the gentleman is referring to
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:50.000]  mike i appreciate your call the bottom line is this
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.240]  we're fighting the same type of banking structure
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.120]  and fiat manipulative uh money changing system that our founding fathers fought
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.040]  that andrew jackson fought uh that lincoln dealt with
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:07.760]  it's always the same but 200 years ago americans understood this
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:11.440]  now americans are just now beginning to understand it and so
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:15.440]  this expansion of federal reserve power is their reaction to the fact
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.280]  that they know people are waking up to them
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:24.000]  let's talk to rick they're waking up in a big way alex and you and i both
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.200]  know that it's very exciting let's talk to steven pennsylvania you're on the
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:29.920]  air steve
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:36.880]  hey what's up alex hey buddy hey i got a question for bob
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:42.160]  uh bob i have a question for you being a disabled vietnam veteran
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:46.880]  and doesn't uh you know have very much to live off of
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:49.840]  and with this crisis uh that's going to occur
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.880]  shortly i'm starting to fear here for my life here because i i see no way out
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.520]  for myself here and you know i'm
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  i'm hoppin and i'm trying to let people know what's going on but like people
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:10.240]  look at me like i'm stupid uh sir that will change
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:14.080]  and there'll be a lot of good people there to help you
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:18.480]  that's important that you tell them now and let them laugh at you
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:23.280]  and you just say just remember so as everything you talk about unfolds
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:28.000]  then your credibility will be gold i mean that's the experience i've had
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.000]  in 15 years on air the first five it was a you know people most people laughed
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.560]  at me and now there aren't many people laughing
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:40.960]  and those that are laughing have got iqs at around room temperature
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:45.280]  and i agree with that and there's a lot of good people out there who are going
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:50.320]  to help one another so don't fret uh don't feel down
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:54.560]  uh there's a lot of good americans and the good other people out in the world
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:58.560]  uh who are going to help people like you absolutely god bless you steve
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:02.560]  kevin in ohio you're on the air hey what's up
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:07.680]  hey buddy um i want to address the situation with the g ng 20 in pittsburgh
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:12.960]  um as everyone knew that they were in london and with the assault on land
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.040]  tomlinson yeah they murdered a guy delivering newspapers and then now
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:20.400]  the the the cops not going to get in trouble and it was in front of witnesses
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:24.160]  he beat his brains out from behind just because he wanted to feel powerful and
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:27.600]  then the government said good job murder people delivering newspapers
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:30.800]  so like in toronto and because we're also want to talk about fema camps in
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.160]  ohio where i live in ohio up by sandusky in toleto and
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:38.000]  well rob do got taken to walmer lucradowski they took him to a military base
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.200]  and they were taking people off trucks with bags on their heads i mean
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:45.600]  they're there it's admitted camp harry and limo we have po w camps where we
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:48.800]  held german italian prisoners in world war two and we
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.320]  you know renovated them to make them fema camps
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.680]  and the model uh you know emergency powers act talks about that uh the
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:01.440]  emergency centers act talks about it and then glenn becks's third says there's
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  no evidence of it even though that i appreciate your call bob
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:09.360]  what did you think about the washington post two weeks ago in top secret usa
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:12.720]  admitting what we'd already reverse engineered that they've got close to a
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:16.800]  million private spies preachers have been hired to be spies
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:20.640]  uh cia and every local town it's all illegal
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:24.640]  but i mean this is the they have been gearing up for this takeover this is so
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.720]  diabolical well it is and you know you referred
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:32.560]  earlier to commentaries uh that i had gotten
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.480]  uh on the other program i'm on and have been for about five years
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:43.680]  uh the the marine disposition and talking with and getting information from
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.640]  especially people who are active and uh the comments have been
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:54.240]  generally this uh if we're told that we're going to have to shoot americans
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:58.720]  we're not going to do it and uh if foreign groups come into the
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:03.200]  country they're not going home and thirdly if they push
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:06.800]  us far enough maybe we'll do what you want us to do
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:12.000]  and at stand there in there for you and my comment has been to all of them
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:15.520]  and these are offices uh non-commissioned offices
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:22.160]  and other people uh who are privates and corpos etc and my
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:26.880]  my feeling on this is this if and when it starts
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:33.120]  we go to the military and we say how can we help you
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:37.440]  i just want my republic back and i mean when they're in bloomberg admittedly
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:41.920]  taking dead veterans insurance money and keeping it
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:46.400]  uh in fact the headline is fallen soldiers families denied cash
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:49.520]  as insurers profit in the article says it's criminal but nobody's going to get
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:53.120]  in trouble i mean what does it take to know this government
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:56.480]  is criminal run and i'm not just talking about obama i'm talking about those
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:51:02.080]  republican whores as well we'll be right back with some final calls
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:04.560]  you worry but only because you're paying attention
[02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:08.080]  what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:11.920]  a similar audacity called gmo or genetically modified organisms means
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:15.600]  that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:18.880]  in the balance now that summer's here what better time to learn about the
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:23.600]  bounty that nature provides in wild edible food let author linda runyon
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:27.680]  show you the best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:30.880]  this summer for the cost of a good meal or two out you can literally starvation

[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:21.120]  everybody now let's jam in three quick calls for bob
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:27.120]  quick comment or question mark in tejas you're on the air
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:31.600]  that was an explosive start mark welcome sir they gotta let him go
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.440]  lisa in california you're on the air
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:43.520]  hello yes lisa welcome hi alex um my question is i've heard that by
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:47.760]  manipulating the price of silver you manipulate the price of gold and
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:52.240]  thereby the dollar i'm just wondering if they
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:57.760]  decided to stop manipulating it would that suddenly cause the dollar to
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:02.160]  collapse and is this maybe yes yes most economists say silver
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:06.560]  should be 50 bucks gold should be 2,500 correct bob
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:10.320]  that's correct and about 15 months ago
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:14.960]  uh that uh syndrome as we'll call it for many years
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.480]  the attachment of gold to the dollar and the dollar went up gold would go down
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:28.080]  and vice versa that is no longer true there is a 20 percent
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:35.360]  um what would you call it uh influence of the dollar on gold and vice versa
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:39.840]  and that's it in other words of gold's having a good day in the dollar's week
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:43.680]  gold's having a little bit better day than it would have otherwise so they
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:48.000]  so they partially decoupled well almost totally
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.160]  80 decoupling and that's going to continue because gold's on its own
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:55.840]  because the competing with the dollar for the
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:59.280]  supremacy of the only real money in the world
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:03.440]  and this is what we're going to eventually evolve into
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.200]  most people haven't discovered it yet but then again they haven't been doing
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:11.120]  this for over 50 years like i have so i get a little head start on
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.800]  absolutely lisa great question quickly matt in new york last caller you're on
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.960]  the air with bob Chapman hey good to speak to you both i have
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:22.480]  two quick questions for bob okay jail gunner hit him
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:27.920]  okay first of all um bob do you see uh eventually gold bullion separating from
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:32.800]  the price of gold stocks and second quickly um how do you what do you see
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:37.520]  for private gold if there becomes a currency that has a gold backing
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.680]  well first of all uh the gold in and in this
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:45.520]  shares both are being manipulated by the united states government
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:49.520]  and each day they lose a little bit more ground you've seen it
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:55.680]  gold's gone from 250 uh to uh 1200 dollars in round figures uh
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.680]  agneco weagle has gone from four dollars uh will say to 57 dollars has been as
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:05.920]  high as 83 and a half and so there's no decoupling there
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:09.760]  they will move together and all of a sudden the shares will
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:13.120]  move in a far greater manner than the bullion will
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:17.520]  and the same will happen with greatest great admin state
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:21.200]  numismatic coins so you'll see the jump in the stocks
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:25.600]  before you see physical go up yeah they always lead
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:28.960]  because they have uh more sophisticated investors
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:32.560]  and and that's the more rigged in as well great points bob Chapman talk to
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:34.880]  you again next week thanks for spending time with us
