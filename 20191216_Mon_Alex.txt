[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, December 16th, 2019.
[00:14.160 --> 00:22.120]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and the awakening has begun.
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.560]  The Second American Revolution is going worldwide, 2.0.
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.080]  We're going to lay it all out.
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.840]  But first, let's take a look at the impeachment
[00:29.840 --> 00:32.040]  about to pass out of the house and go
[00:32.040 --> 00:34.720]  into the trial in the Senate.
[00:34.720 --> 00:37.280]  If you impeach a president, if you
[00:37.280 --> 00:42.720]  make a high crime in misdemeanor out of going to the courts,
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.120]  it isn't abuse of power.
[00:45.120 --> 00:46.920]  It's your abuse of power.
[00:46.920 --> 00:52.880]  Well, McConnell planned to acquit Trump at trial.
[00:52.880 --> 00:57.960]  They're not just going to have a 51 vote up or down,
[00:57.960 --> 01:03.160]  which the Senate can do to fully reject the indictment that
[01:03.160 --> 01:06.280]  is set to be passed out of the house illegally.
[01:06.280 --> 01:07.840]  They've done the whole thing illegally.
[01:07.840 --> 01:09.520]  According to the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[01:09.520 --> 01:11.440]  Robert's rules, common sense.
[01:11.440 --> 01:13.040]  It's been a huge abuse of power.
[01:13.040 --> 01:15.320]  Textbook, they should all be impeached.
[01:15.320 --> 01:18.040]  There actually are procedures to impeach members of the House.
[01:18.040 --> 01:19.720]  But the Democrats have a majority.
[01:19.720 --> 01:21.360]  They're not going to impeach themselves.
[01:21.360 --> 01:23.320]  So we're seeing real tyranny on parade.
[01:23.320 --> 01:25.320]  Will voters reject this?
[01:25.320 --> 01:25.960]  Yes.
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.760]  The case is so darn weak coming over from the House,
[01:28.760 --> 01:30.600]  we all know how it's going to end.
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.720]  There's no chance the president's
[01:32.720 --> 01:34.200]  going to be removed from office.
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.400]  My hope is that there won't be a single Republican who
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.120]  votes for either of these articles of impeachment.
[01:43.120 --> 01:46.360]  And Sean, it wouldn't surprise me if we got one or two
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.080]  Democrats.
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.960]  It looks to me over in the House that Republicans
[01:49.960 --> 01:52.640]  seem to be solid, and the Democrats seem to be divided.
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.920]  The problem is, Democrats are going for a broke.
[01:56.920 --> 01:59.400]  Leader McConnell is basically sending a signal,
[01:59.400 --> 02:01.840]  I don't want to talk to Schumer.
[02:01.840 --> 02:04.560]  Today, New Jersey Democrat Tom Malinowski
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.200]  got some booze when he told constituents in his district
[02:08.200 --> 02:10.640]  he plans to vote for impeachment.
[02:10.640 --> 02:12.800]  I believe that on the two counts of impeachment
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.960]  that have been put before us, that the vote should be yes.
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.400]  And I will be voting yes.
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.000]  And you've got a half dozen Republicans in the Senate
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.480]  up in 2020 who may not want to be put in that position.
[02:25.480 --> 02:28.040]  So they tried, well, everything.
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.400]  Smearing courageous witnesses, including Trump appointees,
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.760]  attacking the process itself, obstructing the investigation
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.560]  by withholding relevant testimony and documents,
[02:40.560 --> 02:43.960]  ridiculous stunts like storming a meeting they were actually
[02:43.960 --> 02:45.840]  invited to.
[02:45.840 --> 02:47.840]  Engaged in mass-election fraud and had people
[02:47.840 --> 02:50.480]  voting in the names of millions of dead citizens.
[02:50.480 --> 02:51.360]  That's all confirmed.
[02:51.360 --> 02:54.000]  Judicial Watch this year got documents in California.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.040]  A voter fraud investigation done by the federal government
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.160]  would be the most significant civil rights investigation
[03:00.160 --> 03:01.640]  in a generation.
[03:01.640 --> 03:02.520]  And why is that?
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.200]  Because if there is voter fraud, whether it be a dozen,
[03:06.200 --> 03:09.600]  a few hundred, a few thousand, or as President Trump
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.080]  seems to allege a few million, those
[03:12.080 --> 03:14.960]  are votes that are stolen from average Americans who
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.560]  are voting lawfully.
[03:16.560 --> 03:20.160]  And so you can ask yourself, is it good that McConnell
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.560]  is going to allow a full Fiasco trial to counter
[03:24.560 --> 03:28.320]  the lies that we've seen in the House?
[03:28.320 --> 03:32.080]  And Trump says, if there's a trial, he wants a long one.
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.800]  I wouldn't mind a long process, because I'd
[03:34.800 --> 03:37.840]  like to see the whistleblower who's a fraud.
[03:37.840 --> 03:39.760]  The whistleblower wrote a false report.
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.760]  And so they have time to call Steele and Strock and Page
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.800]  and McCabe and Adam Schiff and all the rest of them
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.480]  and put them on the hot seat, something they've been dodging.
[03:54.480 --> 03:57.760]  Well, McConnell says, no, we're going to have a quick trial.
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.480]  But then we've got the votes to acquit the president
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.680]  and say he's completely innocent.
[04:01.680 --> 04:02.680]  Well, that's great.
[04:02.680 --> 04:09.440]  How we can impact that really is just with 51 votes.
[04:09.440 --> 04:12.080]  The Chief Justice is in the chair.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.880]  I don't expect the Chief Justice to try
[04:13.880 --> 04:16.520]  to tilt the playing field either way.
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.040]  We'll listen to the opening arguments
[04:20.040 --> 04:22.600]  by the House prosecutors.
[04:22.600 --> 04:26.920]  They will listen to the president's lawyers respond.
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.720]  And then we'll have to make a decision about the way forward.
[04:31.720 --> 04:34.280]  Now we actually might see something,
[04:34.280 --> 04:36.200]  because if they were going to put it to bed,
[04:36.200 --> 04:37.920]  they'd put it to bed with this IG report.
[04:37.920 --> 04:39.360]  They are not putting it to bed.
[04:39.360 --> 04:40.800]  Trump's demanding action.
[04:40.800 --> 04:43.560]  But I've got feeling things have changed now.
[04:43.560 --> 04:45.480]  The globalists had a deal to back off.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.760]  They haven't backed off.
[04:46.760 --> 04:49.960]  And because of this impeachment, that behind-the-scenes deal
[04:49.960 --> 04:55.520]  of detente is over.
[04:55.520 --> 04:56.040]  We'll be back.
[04:56.040 --> 04:58.920]  Stay with us.
[04:58.920 --> 05:01.360]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale
[05:01.360 --> 05:04.800]  has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.880]  and double Patriot points.
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.880]  Don't shop with Amazon or other big tech companies that
[05:09.880 --> 05:11.080]  hate your guts.
[05:11.080 --> 05:13.920]  Take the InfoWars Christmas challenge and support
[05:13.920 --> 05:15.240]  the fight for freedom.
[05:15.240 --> 05:17.880]  Finish your Christmas shopping with one click
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.640]  and support the InfoWars.
[05:19.640 --> 05:22.000]  For the 12 days of Christmas, we're
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.280]  adding a new special every day, plus free shipping, double
[05:25.280 --> 05:28.640]  Patriot points, and extra stickers in every package

[05:31.560 --> 05:32.360]  libtards.
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.120]  Check in every day to find the new deals.
[05:35.120 --> 05:37.160]  We're also coming out of the gates with specials
[05:37.160 --> 05:38.320]  we've never had before.
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.640]  The Christmas Mega Pack is at cost at $99.95.
[05:42.640 --> 05:45.720]  Get two bottles of knockout, two bottles of Brain Force Plus,
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.440]  one box of turbo force, one bottle of ultimate krill oil,
[05:49.440 --> 05:53.120]  and one bottle of Survival Shield X3 at cost.
[05:53.120 --> 05:56.120]  Again, find this amazing special and over 100 others
[05:56.120 --> 06:00.120]  at infowarsstore.com and support the InfoWarm.
[06:00.120 --> 06:14.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.680]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.680 --> 06:18.280]  Well, so does he.
[06:18.280 --> 06:23.240]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.240 --> 06:26.440]  And we are live on this Monday, December 16,
[06:26.440 --> 06:33.320]  2019 Worldwide Broadcast, and humanity has awoken.
[06:33.320 --> 06:35.520]  And now the fall of the globalist is assured.
[06:35.520 --> 06:38.720]  The only question is, will they try to take us down with them?
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.680]  And will we let them?
[06:41.680 --> 06:44.200]  There's a reason the globalists are fighting so hard
[06:44.200 --> 06:45.480]  to shut us down.
[06:45.480 --> 06:48.480]  They know the spirit of 1776.
[06:48.480 --> 06:53.680]  The spirit of the Renaissance shines brightly from InfoWars.
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.360]  That spirit of fighting evil is growing stronger,
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.720]  not weaker under attack, because your will is strong.
[07:01.720 --> 07:05.560]  And make no mistake, this is a war of wills.
[07:05.560 --> 07:10.560]  InfoWars' main mission is to expose the globalist blueprint,
[07:10.560 --> 07:14.920]  rally humanity, and stop them dead in their tracks.
[07:14.920 --> 07:19.200]  As modern Paul reveres, it's critical for all Americans
[07:19.200 --> 07:22.440]  to do their part in the animating contest of liberty
[07:22.440 --> 07:26.760]  to expose darkness and promote freedom and a pro-human future
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.520]  everywhere we go.
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.400]  The quickening is here.
[07:30.400 --> 07:33.080]  We are now entering the crossroads.
[07:33.080 --> 07:37.600]  And InfoWars is rising to the challenge.
[07:37.600 --> 07:41.080]  InfoWars and our dedicated, committed crew
[07:41.080 --> 07:44.040]  is fighting harder than ever.
[07:44.040 --> 07:47.480]  We live in the most historical times ever seen
[07:47.480 --> 07:49.280]  in the history of our species.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.680]  Everyone can see it.
[07:50.680 --> 07:51.720]  They can feel it.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.600]  They can taste it.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.320]  But now, it's all going to the next level.
[07:57.320 --> 07:58.720]  Evil is rising.
[07:58.720 --> 08:02.640]  And to challenge it, good is rising as well.
[08:02.640 --> 08:05.800]  The fact that you're awake, the fact that you're involved,
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.200]  the fact that you're engaged, even in the smallest way,
[08:10.200 --> 08:11.480]  is giant.
[08:11.480 --> 08:12.800]  It's massive.
[08:12.800 --> 08:14.680]  It's consciousness.
[08:14.680 --> 08:20.160]  Now, as the year 2020 dawns, we must redouble our efforts
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.000]  like never before in the fight to bring down the deep state
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.440]  and defeat the globalist anti-human system.
[08:27.440 --> 08:29.760]  But the only way our information gets out
[08:29.760 --> 08:31.760]  is when you spread it.
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.120]  And when you support it by funding our operations, which
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.360]  are your operations at infowarstore.com.
[08:38.360 --> 08:44.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[08:44.600 --> 08:47.320]  At the bottom of the hour, Paul Joseph Watson
[08:47.320 --> 08:49.440]  will join us from London, England,
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.520]  where the Conservative Party just
[08:52.520 --> 09:05.040]  routed the leftist in an ultra-massive way.
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.640]  And we see that expanding across the world that everywhere
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.440]  the globalists are seeing their power structure falter,
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.200]  and the people reject their systems.
[09:17.200 --> 09:23.440]  The great second awakening, or the second phase of the renaissance
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.760]  that began 500 years ago, is here.
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.000]  It is a competing system against the globalist exterminist
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.120]  operation, and it's up to every man, woman, and child out there
[09:36.120 --> 09:39.040]  across this globe to decide which direction we
[09:39.040 --> 09:42.480]  are going to go together.
[09:42.480 --> 09:43.920]  In fact, I hadn't told the crew this.
[09:43.920 --> 09:46.760]  Paul put out a report this morning that's extremely powerful.
[09:46.760 --> 09:53.760]  It's his latest report on this election and all the media
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.200]  trying to deny that the Conservatives are going to win
[09:56.200 --> 09:59.680]  and trying to fix the polls, just like they did three years ago.
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.760]  For Hillary Clinton, but still, it didn't work.
[10:03.760 --> 10:05.760]  Didn't convince people to say, oh, well, suddenly
[10:05.760 --> 10:06.600]  the Liberals are ahead.
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.600]  I'll vote for them to feel like I'm a winner.
[10:08.600 --> 10:09.800]  The propaganda didn't work.
[10:09.800 --> 10:12.240]  The real polls showed the Conservatives 50
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.800]  and 20 points ahead.
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.200]  And the Conservatives won by a whopping 20-plus point lead,
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.960]  meaning they have a majority-wide in the Parliament, not seen
[10:25.960 --> 10:31.960]  in a long, long time, meaning, now, it's up to Boris Johnson,
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.720]  who was put into power by the populist, by the patriots,
[10:35.720 --> 10:38.720]  by Nigel Farage, who was put into power
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.520]  by our listeners in the UK.
[10:41.520 --> 10:43.560]  Farage has said that openly.
[10:43.560 --> 10:46.920]  This audience of activists put them on the map,
[10:46.920 --> 10:49.480]  and now they put Johnson on the map.
[10:49.480 --> 10:51.160]  And the only reason I point that out
[10:51.160 --> 10:53.680]  is this audience of activists has to be
[10:53.680 --> 10:56.480]  to know how amazing you are and what you've done.
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.000]  We started having Nigel Farage on, like, 16, 17, 18 years ago,
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.440]  with all these different UKIP candidates on.
[11:03.440 --> 11:05.480]  And he would talk about half the people
[11:05.480 --> 11:08.440]  when they'd go to their front doors who knew who they were,
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.840]  suddenly, UKIP, even though they'd been around a decade
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.520]  before that, had learned about it from Info Wars.
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.160]  Hell, back then, routinely, Info Wars
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.760]  would be in the top 100 websites in the UK.
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.000]  And that's how we've quietly been working behind the scenes,
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  just believing that if we fired out the signal,
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.800]  they would come.
[11:28.800 --> 11:32.000]  And it did happen, so from the UK to Brazil,
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.600]  from Germany to Spain, from countries in Asia,
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.600]  across the board, globalism is being rejected.
[11:40.600 --> 11:42.760]  Globalism is in trouble.
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.760]  And here, even in cooked polls,
[11:45.760 --> 11:49.000]  Trump has gained five to 10 to 15 points.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.800]  Real polls, Trump's 15, 20 points ahead
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.600]  of the Democrats right now, they're in full panic mode.
[11:54.600 --> 11:56.400]  They already knew that, and we're trying to get him
[11:56.400 --> 11:58.800]  out of office with this impeachment,
[11:58.800 --> 12:03.400]  but it has spectacularly backfired on them,
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.000]  and the public is really awakening.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  And this weekend, all over the US,
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  Joe Biden got confronted repeatedly.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.400]  The Clintons got confronted repeatedly.
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.000]  Adam Schiff got confronted repeatedly.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.400]  Schiff got confronted.
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.000]  Nancy Pelosi got confronted spectacularly.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.400]  And it's exponential.
[12:28.400 --> 12:35.000]  I felt it, I saw it, I could taste it, I could feel it
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.800]  with what happened when Owen spontaneously stood up
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.000]  in Congress last Monday calling out the hoax.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.600]  And that, again, like ripples in a pond, triggered others.
[12:44.600 --> 12:48.000]  And we're seeing it build towards the crescendo
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  of human action due to the censorship.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.200]  They've even had Wall Street Journal articles where they're
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.800]  like, oh, we've got to shut down these anti-vaxxers.
[12:59.800 --> 13:03.000]  We wouldn't let them have their free speech online.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.300]  So now they're taking over live events.
[13:05.300 --> 13:06.600]  We've got to arrest them.
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.200]  We've got to take their children.
[13:10.200 --> 13:12.800]  The last desperate action of a tyrant is try
[13:12.800 --> 13:14.300]  to arrest their opposition.
[13:14.300 --> 13:16.600]  When the vaccines are tainted, they've been given liability
[13:16.600 --> 13:19.500]  protection by the same dangerous big pharma companies
[13:19.500 --> 13:21.600]  that have caused such great scourges.
[13:21.600 --> 13:23.400]  We're going to break that down at the bottom
[13:23.400 --> 13:25.600]  of the next hour with Zach Voorhees,
[13:25.600 --> 13:27.200]  who's done a lot of research into it.
[13:27.200 --> 13:29.500]  He's going to shoot a big PowerPoint with some research
[13:29.500 --> 13:32.000]  today or tomorrow that we're going to be airing this week
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.800]  as well, really drilling into the facts on vaccines
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.000]  and how it's a corporate delivery system into your body
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.400]  with whatever payloads they want to bring in.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.800]  And the fact that they're desperately trying to cover up
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.200]  even the inserts that admit they are maining people in mass.
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.000]  So that's all coming up.
[13:52.000 --> 14:01.600]  And so much more, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:01.600 --> 14:08.400]  Hillary Clinton has a disgusting Joan River style facelift
[14:08.400 --> 14:11.500]  on her ghoulish face.
[14:11.500 --> 14:14.600]  Her ghoulish mug.
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.600]  And the Internet's really mocking it.
[14:16.600 --> 14:20.200]  The new glam look sparks meme fest.
[14:20.200 --> 14:22.500]  That's up on enforce.com.
[14:22.500 --> 14:24.100]  As she again prepares to enter the race,
[14:24.100 --> 14:27.000]  we'll say, well, she's had past the deadlines.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.800]  She's going to try to have a brokered convention.
[14:28.800 --> 14:30.000]  That's the plan.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.800]  Doesn't mean it's going to happen, but I told you
[14:31.800 --> 14:32.400]  it's the plan.
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.200]  And now they're basically admitting that's the plan.
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.200]  We'll be discussing all of that.
[14:37.200 --> 14:43.300]  But the first big thing we're going to hit today is not the fact
[14:43.300 --> 14:49.800]  that she's gotten all the Botox, like monkey face John Kerry,
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.500]  but that the Democrats are trying to cause a civil war
[14:54.500 --> 14:55.400]  in this country.
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.500]  And now Rand Paul is making that point.
[14:58.500 --> 15:00.300]  So we have that clip when we come back.
[15:00.300 --> 15:01.900]  Please don't forget.
[15:01.900 --> 15:05.800]  If you get your order in by this Friday,
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.300]  we can guarantee shipment to anywhere in the United States
[15:09.300 --> 15:14.500]  before Christmas, not just the continental United States.
[15:14.500 --> 15:17.500]  And it's your purchase of the products that fund this operation.
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.200]  Why wouldn't people do their Christmas shopping
[15:21.200 --> 15:22.900]  and enforce.com?
[15:22.900 --> 15:31.500]  Great products, fantastic prices, huge variety,
[15:31.500 --> 15:34.300]  and it's funding an operation that stands up
[15:34.300 --> 15:39.000]  for a pro human future and our children and our current

[15:41.300 --> 15:44.500]  double patriot points, giant specials with the 12 days

[15:54.100 --> 15:54.500]  with us.
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.000]  I'm here with Scott.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.400]  You see him founder of OMG tax.
[16:01.400 --> 16:04.100]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there
[16:04.100 --> 16:06.300]  who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.300 --> 16:09.500]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax
[16:09.500 --> 16:12.700]  experts remove wage garnish and sometimes in the same day,
[16:12.700 --> 16:14.300]  we even have reduced the total debt.
[16:14.300 --> 16:16.700]  Some of our clients were required to pay for what is known
[16:16.700 --> 16:18.200]  as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.200 --> 16:20.500]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.500 --> 16:25.800]  Oh, can I ever we have taken a $500,000 liability
[16:25.800 --> 16:27.200]  with the IRS?
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.000]  Guess what?
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.700]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation
[16:30.700 --> 16:33.000]  known as non collectible status with the government.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.700]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see
[16:36.700 --> 16:41.100]  if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG tax right now
[16:41.100 --> 16:43.500]  for a free tax saving consultation.
[16:43.500 --> 16:53.800]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112.
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.500]  That's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.500 --> 17:00.200]  Attention GCN self reliance listeners.
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.200]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.100]  system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[17:06.100 --> 17:08.800]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.800 --> 17:11.000]  Bill Hyde here, I want to tell you about a huge sale
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.300]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[17:14.300 --> 17:17.300]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[17:17.300 --> 17:18.100]  off the grid.
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.800]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[17:20.800 --> 17:23.300]  we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.300 --> 17:26.100]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[17:26.100 --> 17:29.000]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.300]  warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:31.300 --> 17:34.500]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood
[17:34.500 --> 17:35.500]  waters backstory.
[17:35.500 --> 17:36.700]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:36.700 --> 17:41.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.200]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:43.200 --> 17:47.400]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:47.400 --> 17:50.500]  In the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or $500,
[17:50.500 --> 17:51.700]  300 or even 200.
[17:51.700 --> 17:54.400]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:54.400 --> 18:00.400]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.700]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[18:03.700 --> 18:06.400]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many
[18:06.400 --> 18:09.400]  years ago and I've found a few places where it's mentioned.
[18:09.400 --> 18:12.400]  But if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemforward.com.
[18:12.400 --> 18:14.600]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning
[18:14.600 --> 18:17.600]  of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history
[18:17.600 --> 18:20.500]  where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on
[18:20.500 --> 18:21.600]  and were assured of victory.
[18:21.600 --> 18:24.200]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have
[18:24.200 --> 18:27.800]  to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[18:27.800 --> 18:30.600]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose,
[18:30.600 --> 18:34.300]  but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly
[18:34.300 --> 18:35.500]  killed is much, much worse.
[18:35.500 --> 18:36.800]  That's a paraphrase.
[18:36.800 --> 18:39.800]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being
[18:39.800 --> 18:42.300]  able to win this easily if we find our spirit,
[18:42.300 --> 18:45.100]  find our focus and don't give up and take action.
[18:45.100 --> 18:47.200]  But if we don't stand up and get involved,
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.600]  we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[18:50.600 --> 18:51.500]  That's a fact.
[18:51.500 --> 18:54.200]  They fear info wars because we are alive.
[18:54.200 --> 18:59.000]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.500]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[19:02.500 --> 19:04.500]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[19:04.500 --> 19:08.000]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.800]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.100]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas
[19:14.100 --> 19:17.800]  season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.000]  quality supplements that are life changing in what they will
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.600]  do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life,
[19:25.600 --> 19:29.000]  your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.600]  But then, of course, it also funds the info war that is so
[19:31.600 --> 19:32.900]  incredibly critical.
[19:32.900 --> 19:36.000]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.200]  that's a true 360 win?
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box
[19:40.400 --> 19:44.100]  stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally
[19:44.100 --> 19:46.500]  are working against you and your family's future.
[19:46.500 --> 19:49.700]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings
[19:49.700 --> 19:54.300]  and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com.
[19:54.300 --> 19:56.100]  That's infowarstore.com.
[19:56.100 --> 20:23.700]  And please make the right decision.
[20:23.700 --> 20:29.100]  Joe Biden says Morris Johnson's victory portends doom for more
[20:29.100 --> 20:31.700]  leftist Democratic Party.
[20:31.700 --> 20:37.800]  Look what happened in the Labor Party moved so, so far to the left.
[20:37.800 --> 20:38.300]  That's right.
[20:38.300 --> 20:41.700]  I mean, Joe just wants to confiscate all the semi-auto handguns
[20:41.700 --> 20:42.700]  and rivals.
[20:42.700 --> 20:48.000]  The Democrats to the left of him want to take them all.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.800]  There is no difference.
[20:49.800 --> 20:55.100]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us next segment from the UK to break
[20:55.100 --> 20:56.400]  all of this down.
[20:56.400 --> 21:04.900]  But what are the establishment entitled embedded bureaucracies
[21:04.900 --> 21:08.000]  that interface and revolving doors with the corrupt corporations
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  of the world?
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.100]  What are they going to do to try to give populace to bloody nose?
[21:14.100 --> 21:17.300]  They're going to import illegal aliens all over the world to
[21:17.300 --> 21:20.100]  different nations and then hype them up to hate the countries
[21:20.100 --> 21:21.600]  they've moved to.
[21:21.600 --> 21:24.400]  They're going to try to pass laws that have you challenged that.
[21:24.400 --> 21:26.700]  You're a thought criminal.
[21:26.700 --> 21:29.100]  But more importantly, they're going to try to plunge economies
[21:29.100 --> 21:33.000]  to get so many people on welfare that they can basically
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.800]  domesticate the population into accepting servitude.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.200]  And they're going to try to create political theater.
[21:41.200 --> 21:47.700]  It's so deceptive and so vicious that it causes not just collapse
[21:47.700 --> 21:51.200]  of economies because of uncertainty, but collapse in the
[21:51.200 --> 21:57.000]  general well-being and social contract and social construct.
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.500]  Senator Rand Paul said impeachment charade could destroy the
[22:03.500 --> 22:04.100]  country.
[22:04.100 --> 22:08.900]  That's a Steve Watson article upon info wars dot com.
[22:08.900 --> 22:11.100]  Democrats don't like Trump and his demeanor.
[22:11.100 --> 22:15.200]  So they have decided to criminalize politics.
[22:15.200 --> 22:19.300]  This is more of what the senator had to say.
[22:19.300 --> 22:23.000]  You have said you do not think there will be any Republican
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.300]  support for removing President Trump in a Senate trial.
[22:26.300 --> 22:28.500]  You will, of course, be a juror in that trial.
[22:28.500 --> 22:32.000]  So are you still keeping an open mind about this or have you
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.500]  already decided you will acquit the president?
[22:36.500 --> 22:37.800]  You know, we've seen the evidence.
[22:37.800 --> 22:39.700]  We're going to hear the evidence repeated, but we're not going
[22:39.700 --> 22:40.800]  to see any new evidence.
[22:40.800 --> 22:42.900]  So I think all of America has seen this.
[22:42.900 --> 22:45.600]  What we found is this is a very partisan exercise.
[22:45.600 --> 22:47.800]  There's not going to be any Republicans in the House.
[22:47.800 --> 22:49.700]  In fact, there'll be a handful of Democrats who will vote
[22:49.700 --> 22:51.300]  against impeachment in the House.
[22:51.300 --> 22:53.600]  In the Senate, I think all Republicans will vote against
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.000]  the House and I think two Democrats have a very good
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.200]  chance of voting against impeachment also.
[22:58.200 --> 23:00.700]  So I think what we've seen is it's just a very partisan thing.
[23:00.700 --> 23:01.800]  This is a disagreement.
[23:01.800 --> 23:04.400]  People on the Democrat side don't like President Trump.
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.700]  They don't like his demeanor.
[23:05.700 --> 23:08.700]  And so they decided to sort of criminalize politics.
[23:08.700 --> 23:09.600]  But I don't think it's a good thing.
[23:09.600 --> 23:11.400]  I don't think it's a good day for the country.
[23:11.400 --> 23:14.200]  I think it's a sad day because I hope it doesn't devolve into
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.600]  that every president like in different parts of Latin America
[23:17.600 --> 23:20.000]  we either impeach or throw presidents into jail just
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.600]  because we don't like their politics.
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.000]  I think that will really dumb down and destroy the country.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.800]  And that's the whole plan is to dumb it down and destroy
[23:28.800 --> 23:31.400]  the country and destroy due process.
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.600]  But I've really never seen such an awakening.
[23:34.600 --> 23:39.000]  If you thought Epstein's murder assassination attempt to cover
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.800]  up angered the public and solidified the fact that they
[23:41.800 --> 23:45.600]  don't believe a word they're told by the establishment.
[23:45.600 --> 23:50.200]  Watching Trump be persecuted for supposedly going after
[23:50.200 --> 23:57.900]  corruption has really gotten every blue collar yellow dog
[23:57.900 --> 24:02.100]  working class person that I know or that anybody else I know
[24:02.100 --> 24:06.600]  that knows to say that's it. We're done because you watch
[24:06.600 --> 24:11.000]  them salivate over nothing burgers while everybody knows
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.600]  they've committed all these massive crimes and then the
[24:13.600 --> 24:17.200]  last straw was dressing up in red white and blue broaches
[24:17.200 --> 24:21.700]  and ties and lapel pins and saying rule of law.
[24:21.700 --> 24:23.500]  Nobody's above the law.
[24:23.500 --> 24:26.000]  Trump is hurting America.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.900]  Trump hates America.
[24:27.900 --> 24:30.800]  He's not doing the best interest of America.
[24:30.800 --> 24:33.000]  Well, Democrat constituents are like, wait a minute, you're
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.900]  the ones that told me America sucked and America was never
[24:35.900 --> 24:38.400]  great and it was never going to be great.
[24:38.400 --> 24:40.200]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[24:40.200 --> 24:44.100]  You want me to buy into that and tell me all the better world
[24:44.100 --> 24:44.500]  if I do.
[24:44.500 --> 24:50.100]  But now you're telling me Trump hates America.
[24:50.100 --> 24:56.500]  And there's just a total rejection of it.
[24:56.500 --> 24:58.600]  I mean, look, the Republicans always wear red, white, blue
[24:58.600 --> 25:03.700]  reptiles. I do as well when I can get one around my neck.
[25:03.700 --> 25:05.200]  But Democrats never do.
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.400]  Suddenly, they're all wearing them up there because again,
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.300]  close, he's like, we have to do this for the Constitution.
[25:11.300 --> 25:13.200]  I don't want to put America through the pain of this,
[25:13.200 --> 25:14.600]  but we've got to do it.
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.700]  It's so ridiculously transparent.
[25:18.700 --> 25:21.400]  It's like watching Leave It To Beaver for older folks that
[25:21.400 --> 25:21.900]  have seen that.
[25:21.900 --> 25:23.800]  Younger people may not ever see Leave It To Beaver.
[25:23.800 --> 25:27.000]  When Eddie Haskell shows up to the House to talk to Mrs.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.800]  Cleaver or Mr. Cleaver, everybody already starts laughing.
[25:31.800 --> 25:34.200]  There's already a laugh track because you know,
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.500]  he's going to say something slimy and deceptive and manipulative
[25:38.500 --> 25:43.100]  before he opens his mouth and he never disappoints.
[25:43.100 --> 25:51.400]  And now everyone sees Democrats as far worse than Eddie Haskell.
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.200]  And people aren't laughing when they see them now.
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.100]  They're cringing and they're realizing that,
[25:56.100 --> 25:57.000]  hey, that's the enemy.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.400]  That's the problem.
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.000]  So I haven't wanted to be too optimistic and I've wanted to
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.200]  say the President's in danger and I've wanted to say that
[26:05.200 --> 26:07.400]  we're not completely winning and I've wanted to say they're
[26:07.400 --> 26:09.800]  going to have some tricks up their sleeves during the Senate
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.300]  trial and have a bunch of new allegations come out and that's
[26:12.300 --> 26:14.400]  all going to happen.
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.000]  But it doesn't matter because they have really screwed the
[26:18.000 --> 26:18.400]  pooch.
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.600]  Now, that's if you look at currently what's on the table.
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.400]  If I was them, I'd be pulling false flags right now.
[26:29.400 --> 26:31.400]  I would morally do that myself, but if I was them,
[26:31.400 --> 26:34.900]  I'd be pulling false flags right now and I would be blaming
[26:34.900 --> 26:35.600]  my opposition.
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.400]  So how would you demonize Trump?
[26:37.400 --> 26:39.000]  How would you demonize America?
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.500]  How would you demonize the Liberty Movement?
[26:40.500 --> 26:41.500]  And that's what they're going to do.
[26:41.500 --> 26:43.100]  They're going to try to plunge the economy.
[26:43.100 --> 26:45.300]  They're going to try to cause a race war.
[26:45.300 --> 26:47.400]  They're going to try to create more division.
[26:47.400 --> 26:48.500]  How would you do that?
[26:48.500 --> 26:50.500]  And then you've got the answer of what they're trying to pull
[26:50.500 --> 26:51.400]  off right now.
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.000]  Here's the problem.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.800]  They don't have control of the federal agencies.
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.500]  Trump may not have full control, but they don't either.
[26:59.500 --> 27:04.400]  So their own people are scared as evidenced in the emails and
[27:04.400 --> 27:06.600]  text messages that have come out even three years ago.
[27:06.600 --> 27:08.100]  They're like, Hey, this is illegal.
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.300]  We get caught.
[27:09.300 --> 27:12.600]  I know we're getting orders to do this, but damn, we can't.
[27:12.600 --> 27:13.800]  Trump's done nothing wrong.
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.500]  I mean, I hate the guy, but he's done nothing wrong.
[27:18.500 --> 27:25.700]  See now they don't have a third the power they had and every
[27:25.700 --> 27:27.400]  day Trump stays in office.
[27:27.400 --> 27:30.800]  They're in deeper and deeper waters.
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.500]  So that's good news except for this.
[27:35.500 --> 27:39.600]  When you finally get the head boss nailed down and cornered
[27:39.600 --> 27:42.900]  and that's what's happening right now.
[27:42.900 --> 27:47.700]  They've got tricks up their sleeves and they are threatening
[27:47.700 --> 27:50.400]  all their minions right now that if you don't do this, we're
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.500]  going to release this dirt on you.
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.600]  And if you don't do that, we're going to kill your daughter
[27:53.600 --> 27:55.300]  or your son right now.
[27:55.300 --> 27:59.800]  The threats are flowing like Niagara Falls.
[27:59.800 --> 28:02.700]  And so if everybody sits there as happy as pigs and you know
[28:02.700 --> 28:07.000]  what, we're going to get sucker punched by a big left upper
[28:07.000 --> 28:07.600]  hook.
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.500]  But if we get really frosty right now, watch our six and
[28:11.500 --> 28:15.300]  press the attack to destabilize them and go out and confront
[28:15.300 --> 28:16.300]  them in public everywhere.
[28:16.300 --> 28:19.400]  They're legally lawfully, but very aggressively right up to
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.600]  the edge of the law.
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.400]  Civil disobedience is now needed.
[28:23.400 --> 28:25.300]  This is your chance to fight for America.
[28:25.300 --> 28:28.000]  If you the audience become the activist, which you already
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.200]  are just got chills.
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.200]  It's over and it's already happening.
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.600]  I've got all those clips coming up.
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.400]  You can feel the spirit rising like never before.
[28:39.400 --> 28:42.600]  It's happening.
[28:42.600 --> 28:44.400]  Oh my God.
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.100]  The battle is now joined. This is it.
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.000]  This is it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.500]  Back to Paul Watson from the UK.
[28:53.500 --> 28:56.300]  Another huge victory there.
[28:56.300 --> 28:58.200]  Stay with us.
[28:58.200 --> 29:00.200]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[29:00.200 --> 29:03.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.600]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.100]  there.
[29:07.100 --> 29:10.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.400]  these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.400 --> 29:18.800]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in
[29:18.800 --> 29:21.400]  thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:21.400 --> 29:23.200]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.400]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.800]  I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.800 --> 29:32.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.200]  be using this product as a preventative to keep their
[29:38.200 --> 29:40.000]  cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or HBextract.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.500]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[30:06.500 --> 30:08.500]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[30:08.500 --> 30:13.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  going to have more power per dollar.
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  Your bang for your buck fear gets you great products at
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.500]  great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit
[30:23.500 --> 30:26.500]  of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[30:26.500 --> 30:27.500]  And so it's very simple.
[30:27.500 --> 30:31.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  taken to the enemy, which God wants to see.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.500]  You see, we have to make the effort.
[30:34.500 --> 30:37.500]  110% God will finish the move.
[30:37.500 --> 30:40.500]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack,
[30:40.500 --> 30:41.000]  attack.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  I want to attack.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.500]  I want to go after the globalist.
[30:43.500 --> 30:45.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.500]  to fight for all of our futures together,
[30:48.500 --> 30:50.500]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[30:50.500 --> 30:53.500]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us,
[30:53.500 --> 30:55.500]  for myself and my family, for your family.
[30:55.500 --> 30:56.500]  Because we're in this together.
[30:56.500 --> 30:59.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  Andy in Florida.
[31:00.000 --> 31:00.500]  Thank you, Andy.
[31:00.500 --> 31:01.000]  Go ahead.
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.500]  Hey, Alex.
[31:02.500 --> 31:03.000]  I love you, man.
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  We love you.
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand,
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  I've got to talk about one of your products.
[31:08.000 --> 31:08.500]  A little bit about me.
[31:08.500 --> 31:10.000]  I'm 245 pounds.
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  And make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  for its energy-boosting properties.
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.500]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand.
[31:22.500 --> 31:25.000]  And, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.500]  So I tried your TurboForce.
[31:26.500 --> 31:29.500]  And really, it's a cliche, this product changed my life.
[31:29.500 --> 31:31.500]  But TurboForce really changed my life.
[31:31.500 --> 31:33.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall.
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  And I get by, literally, the 13 hours a day I work
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  on a half of a packet of your TurboForce.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  And you save so much money versus, you know, a monster,
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  which is, what, $4.99?
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  how great TurboForce is.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  We're really proud of TurboForce.
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.000]  So thank you, sir.

[33:25.000 --> 33:31.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:57.000]  I've got a hunch it's going extremely well.
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  I've got a hunch that all the experts elsewhere may just have got it wrong.
[34:02.000 --> 34:12.000]  The 31st of January.
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  And there we are. That is an absolutely extraordinary result.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  This is terrible, isn't it?
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  It's a total rejection of your politics, of your style of politics
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  in the Labour Party and everything that you've done with the Corbyn Project.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  Well, it would seem that way.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  It was a catastrophic result for a country
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  and for everything that the Labour Party exists to fight for.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  The people that were founded to champion, to represent.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  And I'm so sorry to people watching this,
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  you're full of dismay and horror and who are scared.
[34:43.000 --> 34:51.000]  Disbelief at first.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Jeremy Corbyn.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  We won the argument.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  Sure, Jim.
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  You had the worst result for Labour in 85 years.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Yeah, you really won the argument.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  Greatest defeat for Labour since 1935.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  Jeremy Corbyn.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  We won.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  Jeremy Corbyn.
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  We won.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  Brr.
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  We won the argument, but I regret we didn't convert that into balls into the goal.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  The operation was a complete success.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  I'm delighted with the results.
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  The patient, however, is dead.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  I nearly ran the country, you know.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  Of course you did. Let's get you ready for bed.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  Do you want to know why Labour lost?
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  Because the left has abandoned the core principle of what they once represented,
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  the interests of the working class.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  They won a single C in a wealthy area of London
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  and lost dozens in the poorest parts of the UK.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  The areas devastated by mass immigration and deindustrialisation.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  When the new face of Labour sounds like this...
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  And to see working-class people caring about Boris Johnson,
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  they're shooting themselves in the face.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  It's disgusting.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  Working-class people. That's disgusting.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  The globalists are in panic mode.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  Despite everything they're throwing at humanity,
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  nationalists and populists are getting elected.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  And of course, those nationalist movements are infiltrated with globalists.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  At least they're having to act like their patriots to get elected.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  And then it's only a process of removing the globalists
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  who are able to get in by lying to the people.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  And most of the time, the people actually getting in,
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  in the case of Trump or the case of the leader in Brazil and other areas,
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  are actually patriots.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  And so it's just their minions that we have to then discover and remove.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.000]  But the process of our ideals becoming the dominant,
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  governing ethos and force is happening.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Now, does that mean we're not facing record suicide and fentanyl flooding in
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  and depression and screen sickness and GMO and toxic waste dumping
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  and the leftist scourge? Absolutely.
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  But if you expose globalism as an evil anti-corporate world government force
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  using socialism and leftist policies to domesticate and control,
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  if you expose that it's what's running all of this
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  and the agenda 21 and the agenda 30, which are all real UN global plans,
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  then it's over for them.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  And notice we're not having the New York Times say,
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  globalism doesn't exist or agenda 2030 doesn't exist.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  Now they're just saying, oh, it's bad to oppose it.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  Well, people remember that the supposedly none of this existed.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  So now we're beginning to have a real debate on globalism.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  Do we want unelected foreign megabanks,
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.000]  allies with authoritarians like communist China and orthodox radical Islam?
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  Malignant Islam, the proper name.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  That's what it is. It spreads like cancer and takes over.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  You must submit to it or die.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  An ally with the most degenerate forces on planet Earth, Hollywood,
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  they have diplomatic immunity, pay no taxes or above the law,
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  giant 500 foot yachts, huge jets, turbo copters, hundreds of mistresses.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  Their favorite pastime seems to be Aleister Crowley rituals.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  We're going to let these people run our lives.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  Leonardo DiCaprio, dozens of private jet trips a month
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  lecturing us that we can't have a vacation.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  It's about power and control and the planet is rejecting it,
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  but they're going to strike back.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  So I wanted to get Paul Watson on from the UK. I really appreciate him joining us.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  Paul, Joe Biden said that Boris Johnson's victory portends doom
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  for more leftist Democrat Party.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  I actually agree with what Joe Biden said there.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  How big is this?
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Because I know you don't brag about it,
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  but you're in the inner workings of the Brexit Party and UKIP
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  and you know Farage well and you've been in those meetings when this is all being quarterbacked.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  I mean, it really is Farage that's behind Boris Johnson.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  This has really got to scare the globalists.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  The guy that kept way out in the hinterlands for so long
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  is now the power behind the throne with nationalist parties
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  taking over Europe at every election.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  This is amazing time, Paul Watson.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Well, exactly. I agree, Joe.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  I think that's right because what happened Alex,
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  three and a half years ago, we voted for Brexit.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  We voted to leave the European Union here in the UK.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  A third of Labour voters, for people who don't know,
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  the Labour Party is the left wing party here in the UK,
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  which just lost, which just got absolutely creamed in the election.
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.000]  But a third of those Labour voters voted to leave the European Union.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  Many of those voters reside in working class northern towns in England.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  They're outside of the London Remainer elitist middle class bubble.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  So a third of them from the Labour Party voted to leave.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  Then for the next three and a half years,
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  leftists demonised and insulted those people,
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  called them uneducated, stupid, racist bigots,
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  whose vote shouldn't have counted.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  And then it comes to 2019 with this election
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  and they asked them to vote for Labour again.
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  Is it a big surprise that the very people you've demonised and insulted
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  and basically devalued, denigrated,
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  they're very right to vote, you know, by dismissing them as old,
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  they're old anyway, they're going to die soon,
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  they don't represent, they don't have a stake in the country.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Those very people were demonised, denigrated for the past three and a half years.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  And then they act all surprised at what happened.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  And what happened, Alex, is that some of these northern towns,
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  these working class towns that have been represented by the Labour Party,
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  but 60, 70 years plus, they've been Labour for that long,
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  suddenly switched in the election,
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  and now in some cases have huge Conservative majorities,
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  because again, they felt completely abandoned over Brexit,
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  lectured, taunted, insulted, demonised.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  That's why they voted for the Conservative Party.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  So it was absolutely no surprise to me that this is what happened in the election,
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  and it comes down to this also being one of the major points.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  Someone tweeted yesterday,
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  tweets from Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader,
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  and Boris Johnson, the Conservative leader, on the morning of the election,
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  pointing out that Corbyn, the Labour Party tweet, got 156,000 likes,
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  the Conservative Party tweet got 12,500 likes,
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  and their message on this tweet was,
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  can someone explain how support for Labour is so overwhelming,
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  yet we have a huge Tory majority when it comes to the election?
[41:50.000 --> 41:56.000]  Well, it's because you created this massive echo chamber on Twitter,
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  on social media, by banning people,
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  by forcing self-censorship of alternative opinions.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  So don't be surprised when reality doesn't reflect
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  your social media bubble.
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  They thought that just calling people racist and bigots on Twitter and social media,
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  publicly humiliating them, getting them fired from jobs,
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  you know, going in and actually breaking up families,
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  people losing relations with family members,
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  that that would bully them, intimidate them,
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  into voting left, into voting for the Labour Party.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  It didn't, it completely failed,
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  because Twitter is not the world,
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Facebook is not the world,
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  reality does not reflect your social media bubble.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  Oh, wow, Paul Watson always on fire,
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  all our guests are on fire, particularly on fire,
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  when we come back from the front lines of the Global Awakening,
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  we'll get his expert take on what's coming next.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  Very exciting to be alive, but listen,
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  the enemy's gonna throw a counterpunch,
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  the Empire will strike back.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars,
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  with free shipping store-wide and double-patriot points.

[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  one box of Turbo Force, one bottle of Ultimate Crill Oil,

[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com and support the Info War.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code,
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs,
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  lowering our life expectancy,
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  We're being taken off the land.
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian World Government model.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  This is the post-human error.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better,
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  and that's taking care of our individual health.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  than to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the highest quality supplements
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body,
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.000]  your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  But then, of course, it also funds the InfoWars that is so incredibly critical.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  and the big globalist online merchants
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  Spend your money on high-quality products and have huge savings,
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  That's InfoWarsStore.com. Please make the right decision.
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  There is no one formula that you're going to find out there
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  that is more game-changing.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  It's 65% off right now.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling Biotru Selenium
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  for the mustard seed.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy,
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  your focus, your entire body.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  The globalists know about this, but have been suppressing it.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  Take advantage of it now.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  This is a Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus combo
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  with Biotru Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  and help yourself, your family and the InfoWars.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  Again, do your Christmas shopping for yourself and your family.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  You need to try the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus
[46:57.000 --> 47:13.000]  and Biotru Selenium for yourselves.
[47:27.000 --> 47:40.000]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is our guest
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  and I've got that Twitter he just talked about.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Can someone ever explain this?
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  How the support for labor is overwhelming
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  and yet exit polls predict a huge Tory victory
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  smells like a fixed election.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  That's what Dr. Lesbian fan to ACC says
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  and that's what they're now saying
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  that if Trump doesn't get removed in the Senate, it's rigged.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  There's no evidence, he's done nothing wrong
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  and Google and Facebook and Twitter, YouTube were popular
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  when they were somewhat free.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  They were still rigged towards the left
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  but now that it's out in the open,
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  people have exited other platforms or they're sarcastic
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  or they don't say what they really think, just like polls for Trump
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  showing he's as popular as Obama.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  No, he's way popular because people know he's anti-establishment
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  and by having him persecuted for going after Ukrainian Democrat corruption,
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  now people see Trump as truly the anti-establishment guy.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  Now, he's an outsider trying to become the establishment
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  and he doesn't mince words.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  He wants to make it open, free government for the people,
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  powerful military, a successful nation
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  that dominates through its shrewd business dealings.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  People like that, they like the straight shooting of that.
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  Trump's not ashamed of America, he's not ashamed of American power
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  but American power back when it was about our freedom
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  and our innovation and our lack of red tape
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  getting back to what made us great.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  We want to get into some of the big censorship events
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  and PewDiePie is the biggest thing in the world.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  A lot of adults don't know who he is, a lot of older folks don't but he is
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  the King Daddy out there with 100 billion views on YouTube alone.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  But continuing here on how big this alignment is, this realignment,
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  this awakening we're seeing globally,
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  what's happening with the impeachment, where you see that going
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  and how you think they'll strike back.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  Well, the other aspect to come out of this UK election is the youth vote.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  Now, if you look at a map of the UK in terms of red and blue
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  as to how people voted, if you look at it overall,
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  it's almost entirely blue with little tiny pockets of red in London
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  and some of the other big cities,
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  which of course is why they want to change the whole election system
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  because they want the cities to dominate the entire country
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  because that's how they rig it, that's how they win.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  But if you look at the 18 to 24 year old town they voted,
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  it's almost entirely a sea of red.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  And this is why back in the late 90s in the UK,
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  not only did Tony Blair open up the borders to create
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  a giant new voting block to come in over the next generation,
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  which is what happened, which is now why people on the left are saying,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  oh, just be patient, we'll win it with the demographics,
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  we'll win it with the mass immigration.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  Again, anyone on the right who talks about that is a white supremacist
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  and talking about the great replacement.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  But if you talk about it in a positive way and you're on the left,
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  then it's perfectly acceptable.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  But there's a sea of red for 18 to 24 year olds and this is the problem
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  because Tony Blair basically set into policy
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  this goal of having 50% of people go to university.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  Now, he's doing that because universities,
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  even more so in the UK than the US in many places,
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  are literal Marxist brainwashing camps.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  Now, some people would say those 18 to 24 year olds are going to grow up,
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  they're going to become property owners,
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  they're going to have more wealth,
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  they're naturally going to become more conservative.
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  But that's not the case if they've been in the Marxist brainwashing camps
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  because that social engineering lasts forever.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  And that's what we see in many of the pro-EU demonstrations in London,
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  the extinction rebellion demonstrations in London.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  Paul, let me just interrupt you for TV viewers.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  The map, it's the opposite in the UK.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  The Liberals are red, the Conservatives are blue.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  So we've got that map there and literally it's the city centers
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  and the left openly says it's about demographics,
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  whites are bad, bring in foreigners, vote out those that are actually from the UK.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  Well, the classically liberal UK folks from what I've seen
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  that were openly for having folks come in that wanted to join the country
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  and you thought the UK was great from the old days when it was an empire,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  people from India, people from all over came to the UK
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  because they aspired to be part of that.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  Well, that old system of the open red carpet has been used now against the country
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  and so people have woken up to it, correct?
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Yeah, that's correct.
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  But the reason why they want free education, free university tuition
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  is to create this voting block of people who've been brainwashed
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  and then the brainwashing continues into later years
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  which is why you get older people at the pro-EU demonstrations
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  and at things like extinction rebellion.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  Now, not everybody is supposed to go to university
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  and I know dozens and dozens of people
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  and this is similar in the US, of course, people come out of college
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  with mountains of debt, but they also come out of college with worthless degrees
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  and can't even get jobs when they would have been better off
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.000]  starting their own businesses and even doing some of those lower sector jobs
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  that they then need to bring in the immigrants to do.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  So it ties into immigration, but it also ties into trying to get as many people
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  in these Marxist brainwashing camps as possible
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  by creating, quote, free college tuition, which of course is never free.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  Somebody has to pay for it at the end of the day.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And the UN literally sets up reeducation camps in the third world,
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  moves them up to the European border, they're in reeducation camps for months again,
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  then brings them into literal reeducation camps inside the country
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  and then releases them as political soldiers.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  So when you call the university reeducation camps,
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  that's actually what they're calling them.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  Precisely, yeah.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  And you see the kind of snarling, aggressive demons that emerge out of that culture
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  and those are the same people who've been lecturing Labour lead voters
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  for the past three and a half years, that they're racist bigots, that they're horrible,
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  that they're destroying the country, that they're going to kill millions of people.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  So they haven't learned the lesson, Alex.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  They haven't learned the lesson of Brexit.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  They haven't learned the lesson of Hillary Clinton
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  calling millions of Trump voters racist deplorables.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  They still don't get it, which is a good thing.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  And we saw a fan up for us if we want to win elections.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  And we saw this in the build-up.
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.000]  You saw the kind of people who were being platformed on the BBC, on ITV,
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  on these mainstream news stations with the people like Ash Sarkar,
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  Owen Jones, Aaron Bastani and others, who had big, vocal, noisy minority Twitter presences
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  and these people are far, far left.
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  They're basically radical communists being given a platform to go on the BBC literally every day
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.000]  and talk trash about this third of Labour voters who do not resonate with that kind of message
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  because they are, at their heart, patriots, they're pro-British.
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  Well, remember, the UK was like 90% didn't want a new war
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  because you'd lost millions in World War I,
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  but when Hitler decided to bomb civilian targets, it went 99% for war.
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  So they thought intimidating the actual indigenous population of the UK would make them roll over,
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  all it did was wake them up.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Yeah, and that's what's happened in this election.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  But at its core, you had a Labour Party and this is not a cliché.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  They hate their own country.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  It's all about identity politics.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  It's all about injecting colonization studies into everything.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  The leader of the Labour Party is literally a terrorist sympathizer
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  that appears on a platform with ISIS sympathizers.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  He's pro-IRA.
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.000]  That was rejected vehemently and it's going to take them 10 years to try to get this back,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  but again, they're going to try to do it.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  That was my next question. Stay there, Paul.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  At least one more segment with us.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  I want to see what comes next. How do they repair themselves after this
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  and will they just get more shrill, more aggressive?
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  I predict they will stay right there.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  I did accurately predict years ago, four years ago when Brexit passed,
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  I said they're going to try to stall it.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  They're going to call everybody racist.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  They're going to demonize everyone and hold it back.
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  That's going to cause an even bigger takeover by populist nationals.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  And now Boris Johnson and others deliver.
[56:10.000 --> 56:17.000]  It's going to be solidifying for 50 years a restart for the UK and so much more.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  This is very exciting.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  And then all foreigners coming in won't be bad because they won't be being brainwashed against the country.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  Because again, obviously we're not having kids in the West so we need to bring people in.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  We need to bring good people in that want to be here and that want to assimilate
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  and bring their unique culture to create a true diversity,
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  not a globalist Marxist leftist cult brainwashing everyone for total control.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  We're going to start the next hour.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  Don't forget Paul has an excellent site that he runs with a lot of exclusive news.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  Summit.News, Summit.News and bookmark that and share it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:54.000]  And then remember it's a real act of rebellion against the globalist to spread the word about newswars.com, infowars.com,
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  and of course band.video.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  And through Friday, if your order comes in by Friday, guaranteed shipping anywhere in the US
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  before Christmas, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.

[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  Turbo force day, 60% off, never had it at that.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  That is the best seller you want good, clean, focused, 10-hour energy.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  That's it.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  Turbo force is the eighth day.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  www.infowarsstore.com, that's how you fund the rebellion.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  And are we not delivering?

[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  I really can't hype up enough how amazing the global awakening is. People are seeing right through it.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  The bullying, the intimidation by the left, the big corporations, Hollywood, is being rejected,
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  whether you're in South America or whether you're in Eastern Europe or Western Europe or areas of Asia.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  Vietnam's now crazed pro-America capitalist. A lot of things are changing around the world.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Paul, what would you call this time? Paul Watson of Summit.News.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  How will the globalist strike back? Let's get into PewDiePie. That's pretty big news.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Well, it's the great awakening or it's the great backlash with PewDiePie and social media censorship more widely.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Of course, YouTube instituted this new policy about insulting people based on all these different vague new categories.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  But the thing about it was they retroactively enforced it.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  So it's like, you know, if in America they passed a new federal law making marijuana completely illegal across the entire country,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  they could then retroactively go back and say, oh, you smoked marijuana or you talked about smoking weed two years ago.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  We're going to arrest you for it. That's how dumb YouTube's new policy is. And in fact, not only was Idubs,
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  who is one of the biggest creators on there with about 20 million subscribers, had his video removed
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  for insulting the shape of somebody's chin, basically, had a video with 30 million or so views removed.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  I had a video where basically half of it was me insulting a pedophile and that got removed too.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  So apparently now you can't insult pedophiles on YouTube.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Of course, Facebook had a policy a few months ago where they said, no death threats,
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  no organizing violent attacks, except against this list of people who we don't like.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  You're on that list. I'm on that list. They had to come out and revoke it too late.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  You're not joking. They actually said, here's the groups who can organize their murder.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Yeah, literally, it was a fatsoir against anyone Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Now PewDiePie has basically quit Twitter. He came out and said he was taking a break from YouTube
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  immediately after this new harassment policy was announced.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And after he put out two videos criticizing it, so it's obviously not just coincidental.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Now he's just literally put out a video saying absolutely impugning Twitter
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  for how it's a massive virtue signaling echo chamber, how it's really toxic and corrosive.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  And he's literally, it looks like he's just deleted his Twitter account entirely.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  So the rebellion, the backlash is here. Of course, the problem with YouTube is
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  there's still no real competitor because it's so expensive to host and to stream video,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  which is why Google runs YouTube at a loss.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Well, that's right. That's why listeners are like, oh, you're doing great.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Some days we get millions of views a day at Bandot video.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  And yeah, folks, only because our hardcore audience is buying so much product, we pay for it.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  I don't want to say what the bandwidth costs because we've got, I mean, it's, it's what we call it.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  It's insane.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Yeah, Google runs YouTube at a massive loss, but there's no competitor because, you know,
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  on most of these other video sites, you can barely play the video without it taking,
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  you know, 15, 20 seconds even to start playing.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  So there needs to be a better competitor, maybe PewTube.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  That was one of the suggestions by somebody.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  But again, it's getting people to cross over.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  It's getting all the big creative.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  If anybody could launch an alternative, it'd be PewDiePie.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  And again, for older folks who don't know, he's got like 100 billion views on YouTube alone.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  There's nothing bigger ever.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  I mean, you talk about just all the, anybody under 25 knows who he is.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And the guy's really funny.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And again, he's bigger than all of the other media combined.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  We need, I mean, let me tell you, when he plugs in fours, it's massive.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  You've experienced the plug, we need him to join with us, join with Soran.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Yeah.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And he's authentic.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  He's one of the few massive superstars who has rejected the identity,
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  politics, social conditioning.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  That's why they fear him so much.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  You're talking about what's going to happen coming out after the UK election, Alex.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  They're going to try and claim that there's a national emergency.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I hear this over and over again.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  The only thing that can stop Brexit now is a national emergency.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  And literally that's all they're clinging to is basically, oh, how can we create martial law?
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  So whether that comes as a result of mass riots or some invented catastrophe remains to be seen,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  but I hear them talking more and more about that as they get more desperate.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Paul, that's too huge.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I was about to let you go, but I want you to come back and do two minutes and speak more to that
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  with Owen Shroyer straight ahead today with us.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code,
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  We're being taken off the land.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  This is the post-human error.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  This is the crossroads.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  We destroyed for eternity.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, December 16th, 2019 Worldwide Transmission.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  I am your host Alex Jones riding shotgun with me.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  He is Owen Shroyer, the next two segments.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Then we have Zach Vorhees joining us in studio for some other big news.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  A former Google employee, big whistleblower, but he's not going to get into Google today.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  We're going to get into vaccines, your phone calls, a lot of other news.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  But Paul Watson, that's where I was going next with Owen Shroyer.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  You didn't know that.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  We were going to break for folks that were watching.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  They saw that for the folks that just joined us.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  And I said, how is the left just crushingly defeated in elections in Germany, in Spain, in Greece, in Brazil, in the UK, in the U.S.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  All over populist winning, nationalist winning, globalism being rejected.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  How are they going to counter?
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  And you said national emergency, martial law is what they're calling for.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Well, here's Rand Paul in peace with Shroyer could destroy the country, trigger a civil war.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  That's what he said.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  I played it last hour.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  That's what the Democrats want is to use all the BS and the trial in the Senate to energize their constituents to riot and attack.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  They want to trigger race wars.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  They admit this, not just in WikiLeaks that came out four years ago on Hillary, but they're admitting this currently.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  So just you intrigued me bringing that up that it's the same type of policies there that we have here.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  I saw in Germany a few weeks ago, they said, oh my gosh, conservatives and Christian parties are getting elected.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Nazi alert and they are having rallies warning Nazis are everywhere, but it's not Nazis attacking people.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  It's the Islamists and the leftists that are attacking people.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So can you speak more to that briefly?
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Paul Joseph Watson of summit.news.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Yeah, the only tool they've got left in their arsenal is more hysteria.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  I don't think it's going to work at this point.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Politically speaking, they're saying, oh, we're just going to double down and become more left wing, more radical, more Marxist.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  That's not going to work.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  So the only term I'm hearing now is a national emergency to stop Brexit.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  We had Antifa rioting attacking police on the streets of London the night after the election.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Whether that builds up because you had that way worse in the U.S.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  I don't think they've got the numbers to do it here.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  But we also have this hysteria about hate crimes, which they could use to try and whip up, you know, more, more madness.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  You have a story out of the metro.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  British Muslims prepare to leave UK after Boris Johnson wins election.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Complete BS, he's found this writer, Basit Mahmoud, has found two people who've said, oh, I'm scared for the future of my children.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  I might consider leaving.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  That's not British Muslims leaving the country en masse.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  That's one person who you spoke to.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  And then another one is like a random tweet.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  And this is an amazing publication.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  But if they think it's so bad, they can go to a country that's 100 percent Sharia law with daily bombings and they can have their daughters genitals cut off.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I mean, if the UK is so bad, don't let the door hit you on the ass.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And it just goes back to this point of hysteria.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  And, you know, we had a campaign where overwhelmingly people on the right were being slandered.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  They were being attacked.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  They were being physically assaulted with milkshakes.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  And it was a big joke.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Oh, we can violently attack people because, you know, they're bad, evil, big at races.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Again, it's the same people.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  It's always the same people they talk about inclusivity, tolerance, diversity.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  They've spent the last three and a half years in the last five days since this election demonizing the people who dared express diversity of opinion at the ballot box.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  We had a professor today calling conservative voters vermin.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  We have them blaming conservative voters for killing thousands of people because the NHS might not get enough of a raise in funding as they wanted.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  We have people wishing violent harm upon conservative voters.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Again, they are the most divisive, intolerant, bitter, snarling, nasty people to the point where many actual liberals on the left constantly say to them, what are you doing?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  You've lost as the last four elections. You lost as the referendum.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Stop behaving like this.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But, Alex, they just simply can't stop as they highlighted in the video.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  The go-to thing is you're a racist. You're a bigot. You're killing thousands of people.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  They do not learn their lesson.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And if, you know, we want to continue to be successful in elections, we should probably encourage that those people don't be de-platformed, that they get to air their ridiculous hysteria as much as possible because it ain't working.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  I was about to say, you just hit the key. They consilence us. They're still going to turn everybody off with, we need to cut three-year-olds genitals off.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  That's happening at John Hopkins here in the U.S., folks.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  We need to forcibly, if sex education to all five-year-olds, we need to the schools to physically masturbate the children, pedophilia.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  That's now being called for by Democrats worldwide and leftist.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  People are going to say no to totally open borders and making their daughters wear hijabs so that there's cultural, you know, unity.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  The people are going to reject the NWO whether we're there opposing it or not.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  And that's what's just so insane about the crazy left and the globalist in their bubbles and their big tower of Babel master plan.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Thank you so much for hosting the fourth hour tomorrow. We always look forward to that. Paul, thank you.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  All right, there goes Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Now, till about 45 after I've got Owen Stroyer here, and then we've got Zach Vorhees for about an hour and 15 minutes with us in studio,
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  because I was going to do a big PowerPoint presentation on, I just call it PowerPoint.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  It's not really PowerPoint in here, it's not the same computer program, but in here exposing vaccines.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  In fact, can I have that big folder? I forgot to bring that in. Thank you.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And then Zach was sending me other big PowerPoints and research and he's a big, you know, advocate of letting people know what's on the insert.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  So I said, Zach, you're a well spoken guy. Let's get you in here on something other than Google censorship and things because you're smart on other subjects.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  So he's going to be on air talking about this and politics and taking your calls with me.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  And then he and I are going to shoot today or tomorrow, an hour long special report.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  He'll do the main body of it. I'm going to add some points at the end.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  That I'm really going to promote to people that this is what you need to know about vaccines.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Here is the real vaccine warnings.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  So you actually see what's on the fine print that they don't want you to see.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  And used to they'd hand these out at the pharmacy like, oh, here you want to see what comes with it?
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  I'm like, oh, we're not supposed to give that to you because it's damning.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  It's damning. So that is coming up as well because this is a big, big deal.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  But oh, it's Royer is here with us for the next two segments or so. Oh, and to say the global awakening is here is an understatement.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  I mean, we cannot hype this enough. The humanities waking up to huge globalist operations.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  I'm not saying we're waking up to a better roses here, but at least we're going to be awake.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  This is scaring the hell out of the globalists everywhere they go.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Everything they do, everything is turning against them.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And then the more they bully, the more it blows up in their face.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  What would you call this moment, the great awakening?
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Well, it's the American Revolution 2.0. It's the next Renaissance, the third grade awakening, whatever you want to call it, Alex.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  It's been an expression of human independence, searching for justice.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  But it's been laying dormant, waiting for one explosion to pop the lid so that it can all come rushing out.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And so I wind the clocks back, Alex. And if you remember, in 2016, obviously, most of the audience will remember the Carl the Cuck AIDS Skrillex video.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  That video in 2016 created a new genre of content where people now go out and confront Trump protesters, exposing how they don't know what they're talking about,
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  exposing how they're falling for false narratives, exposing how they're all parrots, clearly being trained and practiced as these astroturf protests.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  That goes viral. Now, Alex, we've seen in a very shortened time span in the cyclone of time here as it gets tighter,
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  now we already have, after what I did Monday, dozens of videos of politicians being confronted.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And so that's why they don't want to be focused.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  And they're confronted with, you're the criminal, you're involved in treason, it's effective, it's focused, and they're falling apart.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Joe Biden falls apart when it happens.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Adam Schiff falls apart when it happens.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  It's so easy to do it. It's so easy. These people are a cheap tent. They're going to fold right up with any wind.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  You give them a little breeze and they fold right up.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  So we're going to play a lot of these clips, Alex.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  But I just think that this is, Info Wars is always the leading edge.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  We're blowing the top of freedom of expression in this country. That's been land dormant.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  We're doing it again. We're getting ready to go into 2020. I'm really excited for this upcoming year.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  It's going to be perilous, but there's a reason why there's perilous times right before revolution of human freedom.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  And I smell blood. And I don't mean physical blood. I smell the energy draining out of the globalist, but we're getting stronger.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  And a fist bump. Yeah, we'll be right back. Stay with us.

[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  Investors have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  It's time to take yourself to the next level. It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young. As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Now, in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis, and then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone. We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Real red pill plus has some added energy as well. Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrusillenium that's from the mustard seed. The two go together in an incredible way.

[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  You know, America is an amazing country. We've got an incredible history. This planet's amazing. There's a lot of other great countries and great people as well.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  A lot of them wanted to come here because you could have more freedom here than any other place. That made us great.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Africa's got three times the geographic area we do. Russia does. Russia's a country. Africa's a continent, but they just can't be as successful as us.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  What was it? Well, it was the Wall-Wall West. It was freedom. It was not having a king or queen, not having a bureaucracy.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  And now, here we are. We didn't have a tribe, but we had a tribe in that we were Americans. That's what made us strong.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  And now that's under attack, but it's coming back. And I cannot express to you that it's true that I've never been more energized.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  That means when I'm in a good mood, I'm in a better mood in my life. When I'm in a bad mood, I'm more angry than I've ever been, so it's got its side effects.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And I know you're in the same position. We can feel it. We can see it. We can taste it. We can smell it. And it's like that song. We can face it.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  And we can make it. We can make it through this and be strong on the other side if we admit what we're facing is evil and promote goodness against it.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  So as Owen said, I can't even keep track of it. President Trump tweeted out our great reporter, Will Johnson, out there at the Capitol.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  He's got a mic flag for his other organizations. We encourage him to use, so he doesn't get physically assaulted by leftists.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  And so that they retweet those videos. You notice they don't retweet the Info Wars videos unless they don't have the Info Wars mic.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  Absolutely. Well, Trump's retweeted some of them, but we've done that so it makes it easier because it's not about getting credit for Info Wars. You, the audience, know that it's you doing it.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  In fact, that's when you call up and give me thanks. It's kind of a joke because, like, looking in the mirror, seriously, thank yourself.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  But yes, he's got his organization. We've got Action 7 News. We've got a lot of other gnome diplomas, a lot of which we don't take credit for.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  Other organizations, other groups, other reporters that we are funding thanks to your support to the mothership.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  So yes, Trump did send that out, did send that little confrontation out. We'll play that next segment.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  I want to get to a lot of these that have taken place. First, the Joe Biden that just happened yesterday.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  Owen, I mean, if the people decide to go out to Democrat events and confront them with facts, they're so criminal it's over.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  They just fold like an old rotten barn and a tornado. And I felt it last Monday. I told the story. My wife remembers it.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  I said, the answer is getting out in the streets and confronting them. She goes, well, yeah, of course, that's always the answer.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  I went, yeah, but I mean, it's going to happen. It's going to happen. We're going to win. I can tell. I can just feel the energy.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  She goes, wow, what are you on? I don't normally do that at the house. I have energy on air, but the house, I'm pretty damn calm.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  Unless the kids, you know, let the cat crap on the carpet or something. But this is huge, my friend. I mean, you can feel it.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  You can see it. And then the phone starts ringing. I start getting text about what you had just done as I felt that energy bolt.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  I felt that surge.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Well, we've always been connected like that, Alex. It's kind of freaky sometimes.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  But, you know, I made the analogy, a weightlifting analogy, but, you know, maybe it's more accurate.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  You know, these politicians are up there lifting what they claim are, you know, 3,000 pound dumbbells, and they're lifting them up over their head.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  And then they put them around our necks and they say, it's just too strong for you. Only we can lift these.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Well, all Infowars does is go and lift them up and says, these aren't 3,000 pounds. These are like three pounds.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  And it's just an example like, no, you lift it up, lift it over your head.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  And then the other people are like, whoa. Oh my gosh. It's not 3,000 pounds. It's only three pounds. I can lift that.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  And so they're going out. They're lifting the weight off of their necks by going and confronting these politicians.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  They say, oh, well, you know, nobody can stand up to Jerry Nadler. Nobody can stand up to Adam Schiff.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Nobody can stand up to Joe Biden. Well, yeah, you can.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  And by the way, we're not saying like they've said, like Mad Maxine has said, Maxine Waters, you go out in front of the gas station, the store, the restaurant, the church.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  No, we're, you know, you get in their face. No, we're just saying you go to their big public events where they're spewing lies and you counter their ass right there.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  And it's peaceful. It's legal. And it's what America is all about.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  I love how you tweeted out the London Guardian. In fact, I meant to give us a crew of my fault. We didn't. It's on his Twitter from yesterday.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  I love how you tweeted out on, you know, the on shorter Twitter.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  I like Guardian article where they were lying about Cabinon last year, how valiant it was. Women fight back. It's so wonderful. But when you did, it's disruptive and evil and bad.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Yeah. And well, I don't necessarily want to get into some of the logistics of the legal battle that I may be encroaching on right now.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  But, you know, I was arrested. I was sent to jail. They weren't. Why am I such a criminal? You know, I was perfectly cooperative.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  I didn't even try to. Oh, they stayed five times longer than you. And they weren't arrested. Good point.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  And by the way, if you if you read the law, it's actually saying you you you organized and had it's kind of like, you know, pre pre planned to take it over and obstruct the proceeding.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Not that you had your free speech heard in the face of a lie. They arrest the congressman that famously in the state of the union said to Obama, you lie.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  So it just shows again how it's one set of rules for them, the progressive left, the liberals, which is obviously regressive.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  By the way, Norm Pattis is our great First Amendment lawyer. We have to pay him obviously because these are big long cases that he's been in literally 50 plus court hearings just over their suits against me.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  But with you, I think you're picking up pro bono. He'd be the guy to take your First Amendment case, especially when they're not arresting these Lib Tards.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Yeah. And I obviously love to talk to Neil about this. And I'd love to have a victory on this, not for myself, but for America, for conservatives. Alex, they're sick of getting bullied.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  They're sick of seeing the two tiered justice system.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  Well, it shows what they're really afraid of is a bunch of conservatives going in there and shouting them down. The liberals code pink, they can do it all day.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  And they're, oh, nothing happens to them.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  And Alex, what you said has actually been said by Jerry Nadler. And you know, I think the Democrats are actually accidentally telling us their plans, whether it's we're going to take your guns, we're going to censor you.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Nancy Pelosi said she was a medic. She practiced medicine in some weird clip. We can play that later. I know I'm going to have it on the war room. It's like, what is she talking about voodoo?
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  But Alex, here's the key. Jerry Nadler said two weeks ago, he doesn't trust the American people to elect a president. What's he saying? They want to select a president for you. He wants to run a dictatorship.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  He said, quote, Trump might win if we don't do this.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Exactly. Then in the impeachment hearings where I was in there and I said, no, Nadler, you're the one committing crimes. Trump is innocent. He said, you're not here to talk. You're here to observe.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  They're projecting on to you what they want. They want you to sit down, shut up, and be dominated by them.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  And let them or once they're on a dictatorship.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  And let them teach your three-year-old how to chop their genitals off.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  And so, exactly. Well, if they run a dictatorship, if they end up with the totalitarian state that they were...
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  Their main target, your children's genitals, will be theirs.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  They'll do whatever they want.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  They're constantly just your children's genitals. It's the one thing in their mind. I'm not joking.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  You know, that's a weird thing too, Alex. I mean, I don't want to go down this road.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Well, it's the future. And if you can get the kids and rape them, you've got the future.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  But they all seem to have this weird obsession with male and female genitalia. It's a very odd thing.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Well, I mean, if you take one look at Nadler, I mean, he looks like what you would imagine someone
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  that kidnaps three-year-olds would look like. I'm not saying he kidnaps three-year-olds.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  I'm saying he promotes convicted pedophiles going in to school and having your kids sit on their knees.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  He is a slimy sack of maggot vomit.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Well, we don't have to make up a script about what Joe Biden has done as far as, you know, kids coming up to him.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  He keeps his hands off kids. And then Joe Biden literally says, we have to touch our children.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  I want to touch your children. He literally said that.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Now, you can say, oh, he means, like, you know, in a whatever way.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I mean, he doesn't touch your children.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  These demons, in fact, we'll show what happened when we come back with Joe Biden.

[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Hey, Alex, I love you, man. We love you.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  It was a day I no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  And you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, $4.99.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  We're really proud of turbo force, so thank you, sir.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  Then help us spread the word. Let's just get busy at M4store.com.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  From the front lines of the information war.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  This broadcast is just here to Paul Revere to expose what's going on and to say, hey, we want nationalism and freedom and justice and success.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Or do we want to be slaves?
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  There's no way the globalists can win if their systems are challenged.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  That's why they bring in the political correctness, which is really just authoritarianism, to shut down speech, but it's not working.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  It's going the same course it always has.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  They thought because they got a bunch of fancy high tech systems and they're trying to take people's bank accounts away that we're like communist China, that it's going to work here.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Communist China is on the verge of collapse.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  This is not going to go well if good men and women stand up and say no.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  And if you fund an operation, you know, that's the only weak link here.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  We've probably had triple the traffic the last week that we've had in the last six months that it's not translated into any extra sales at infowarstore.com.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  Because new listeners come through, they watch, they listen.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  Okay, it's interesting, but it's the hardcore fans that by the products that literally do all of this.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  So what's the most important part?
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  And that's my allegory.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that lasts for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of it.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Some people get about eight hours.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  But turbo force is there to be long clean without the big crash.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  It just has a gradual come down.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  People take this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their post workouts.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  You can call us whatever you want.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  It's all around the best you're going to find.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  It's a total solution.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And it stacks very, very well with the brain force plus at infowarstore.com.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  And we are into the 12 days of Christmas.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  We're now up to day eight.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  The special stack every year through Christmas super blue 50% off brain force plus 60% off knock out the sleep page.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  60% off body's ultimate tumor formula.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  60% off ultra 12 amazing strongest best vitamin B 12 are going to find taking out the tongue.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  60% off selenium bio true selenium for the mustard seed.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  60% off all apparel.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  This is big 25 to 50% off.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  That makes some of these loss leaders.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Turbo force 60% off and tomorrow it's krill oil, alpha power, vitamin refusion and vaso beach.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  And all of those sales just continue on right through Christmas.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  But the 20th is the last day to get them guaranteed delivered to your door before Christmas.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  And by the way, everybody knows I've been mad at Amazon and stuff like that.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  So I try to say, Hey, shop with us on Amazon.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  We still get Amazon packages.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I was asking my wife this morning, where are all these Amazon packages?
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Well, my mom and sisters send the kids presents.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  And I'm like, Yeah, I wish people do that with us.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  You just sit at whatever address you want in the checkout.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  You put a note.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Hey, it's Bob.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Hey, it's Karen.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Hey, it's Luigi, whatever your name is.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  And boom, right there.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  They open it up.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  It's the present.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  That way you don't have to get it and ship it back off or whatever.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And that's how you fund our operation while not fighting the crowds while not fighting the traffic.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And almost all these big box stores are owned by globalists that piss all over America.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  I mean, you name it.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Walmart, Target, all of them.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  They're transgenderism.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  All of it.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Coca-Cola is supporting it.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  All of them.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  You buy great products in force.com.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  You're not doing that.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  You're supporting people that are fighting to the death for your freedom standing with you and your family.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  It's like an electrical connection and a current without you.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  We don't roll.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  With you, we search forward together.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  It's like a sailing ship without wind.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  It's like blood, you know, not having any oxygen in it.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  It's a win-win 360 together in fullwarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Please do your Christmas shopping with us for your own self-interest and their great products.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  We're continuing here dealing with the awakening how big this is.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  If other people don't just sit back and wait for the next person to go confront somebody,
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  if you go get in line first, like this fellow we're about to play did,
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  the same guy that went in front of Hillary in Austin.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  This was in San Antonio this weekend, Joe Biden.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Wade in line, didn't just yell and scream, mindlessly like a leftist,
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  waited for the right moment, eloquently spoke.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  He took the whole thing over.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  It was all over the news.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Well, and that's the key here is, you know, you constantly hear the frauds like Maxine Water say,
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  truth to power.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  But the reason why their activism has no power is because there's no truth behind it.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Now that's been exposed and the reason why the Democrats are so fearful of citizen activism
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  is because they know when this gentleman steps up and says,
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  no, Joe Biden, you know, your son was a crackhead.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Your son is refusing child payments as an illegitimate father.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Your son is the one that had deals in Ukraine.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  That's all true.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  That's all true and they can moan and whine and complain, but it's all true.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  And that's why they fear it.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  They fear the truth.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  They fear the truth coming out of the citizens' mouths.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  They fear having to actually sit there and face the truth.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  And that's something that they haven't had to do in a long time.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  So they're obviously panicked right now.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  And, you know, we're in a weird tipping point, Alex,
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  because there is a large awakening happening right now.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  There's no doubt.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  But it's got to be put into action.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  It's pro-America.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  But, you know, Alex, it's not...
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  There's a deeper level of understanding still
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  that is waiting, I think, to be consumed by America
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  that maybe they don't understand.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  So they're still asking,
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  why are they going through with this impeachment scam?
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Why are they lying about Trump all day long?
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Why is the media a part of it, too?
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  So, you know, as it continues...
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Because they can't help but attack.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  But what it exposes, Alex, is call it whatever you want,
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Shadow Government, Deep State, Illuminati, Seeger's Society.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  It's one force.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  It's one force in control of all these other factors.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And it believes it.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  And it believes it owns this country and us,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  so it thinks it's rightfully doing it.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  And it doesn't care if all its minions get destroyed in the process.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  It is arrogantly attacking.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  And it wants to dominate us.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And so, I mean, I want to ask the average leftist
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  or the average Antifa person, you know,
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  what do you consider the establishment?
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Okay, mainstream news, Hollywood, cable television.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Well, all of them hate Trump.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  How about the corruption in D.C.?
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  They hate Trump.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  I'm not saying Trump is perfect.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  So, this is really a failure of the power structure to habits will.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Because they can't dominate us.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  And they can't shut us up.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Which makes them not the power structure.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  It's we the people, bitches.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  That's the key, Alex.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  As soon as people realize they have the power,
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  as soon as people realize they have the muscle,
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  as soon as people realize they can lift that weight off their necks,
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  it's not 5,000 pounds.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  If you let one Ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  And so, I think there's going to be a crescendo.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  As you said, Alex, a cascade of citizen activism.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Well, it's already happening.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  But if everybody listening just starts finding out
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  who's coming to talk in their town,
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  starts doing the research, starts looking into it,
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  and take your children down there.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  And you're an American.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Stand up to the guy on the podium and let them know your mind.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Here's part of what happened in San Antonio this weekend.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  The video is on infowars.com.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  Here it is.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  We can't let this happen.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  This election is about the soul of our nation.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And Donald Trump has poisoned our soul.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  He spans the flames of hate.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Hate groups, white supremacists, here at home.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  Coming down the escalator when he announced
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  racist crimes, he said he was doing it before he hit the ground floor.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Remember he said, he said,
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  I'm going to take on those rapists Mexicans.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  There's never been a president.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  That's a lie, Joe.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  There's never been a president.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  That's a lie.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Oh, it is a lie.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And it was your son and the Ukraine.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Bang.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  What's your point?
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Get out of there.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  Get out of there.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  You're the one that offered to withhold a billion dollars.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  Bam.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  That's a little foreign relations.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Son of a bitch, he got fired, right, Joe?
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  Son of a bitch, he got fired, right?
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Remember that?
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  Trump is innocent.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Trump is innocent.

[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Just total victory, man.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Just total victory.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  It goes on.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  It goes on from there.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Oh, my God.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Man, that's like, Alex, I don't even know how to explain.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  And if they're dumb enough to put a bullet in me, which I hope they don't do,
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  it's only going to make Infowars more powerful.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  That's why they're like, we want to kill him.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Alex, for me?
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Destroy his name.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Oh, that's not working.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  What'll you do?
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  What'll we do?
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  You get the hell out of the way.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  That's what you do.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  That's like watching a slam dunk, Alex.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  That's like watching a slam dunk of truth.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Boom.

[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us,
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  We're being taken off the land.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  I think they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  This is the post-human error.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  This is the crossroads, resist or be destroyed for eternity.

[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Jesus is king, bound to complain with one accord.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Now happy tail, welcome the lord.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  Ring Christmas bells, sound for a new love for the old.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Jesus is king, hail all the news, to old and young.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  Tell it to all in every time.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  19, the year Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  He was afraid. There's really no other way to put it.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  According to sources that were inside his Manhattan townhome, the place was covered in video cameras.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Gerald Leftcourt, who was one of Epstein's attorneys back during the original arrest
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  and the original investigation, wrote a letter which has been made public.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  And in that letter, Gerald Leftcourt claims that Epstein was one of the original funders of Clinton Global Initiative.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  He gave Jeffrey, forgive me, Jeffrey Epstein gave President Clinton $4 million, according to a source.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Will the 2020s be the decade that the Clintons finally get literally exposed?
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  According to a statement given by Bill Clinton on his relationship with Epstein,
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Clinton claims that in 2002 and 2003, he took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  One to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  The problem with Bill Clinton's statement is that it couldn't be a bigger lie,
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  and everybody in his cousin knows that Hillary and Bill are legendary liars.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  But I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  Again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something sprang out of that and assault sprang out of that.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  And that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  And the American people could have known that within days, and they didn't know that.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  What difference at this point does it make?
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Now, according to the flight logs, Bill Clinton's presence on the Lolita Express grew from 4 to 6 to 11 to as many as 26 times.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  Then came the admission of Jared Kellogg, a former IT system contractor for the Zorro Ranch property in New Mexico.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  Kellogg, who had little knowledge of Epstein's pedophilic reputation, said he was brought on by property manager Bryce Gordon
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  to improve the estate security systems and set up surveillance cameras around the compound.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Kellogg admitted, what was weird was that the whole time I was on site, Bryce would be bragging about how the Clintons would visit the whole family.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Not just Bill, but Bill, his wife, their kid, and they would stay on the ranch itself.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  I was saying how cool the replica houses were. They're pretty neat like the 1800s. Kellogg continued about Epstein's property in New Mexico.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Gordon said, yeah, they're built for guests. We get a lot of visitors. It's really cool that the Clintons come out and hang out with Epstein.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  It sounded like a normal summer vacation, Kellogg added, unaware Epstein frequently trafficked underage girls throughout his property.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Bill Clinton had denied ever visiting any of Epstein's homes except for a visit to his New York apartment,
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  where a $56 million portrait of the former president in a Monica Lewinsky-like blue dress and red heels had been discovered.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  And as the walls close in, more accusers point the finger at Prince Andrew, whose some accusers say Epstein used as bait.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  While a photo of Hillary Clinton happily visiting with Jeffrey David Cox has emerged.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Cox is only the head of the federal prison guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where Epstein met his mysterious end.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  The 2020s could be the decade when the New World Order's secret elite find themselves in the precarious position they signed up for.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Once all of those videos confiscated by the FBI detailing Epstein's Mossad-backed blackmail operation come either leaking out or become available through FOIA.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we couldn't be here without your support, couldn't be here without your prayers and without this great crew.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  Zach Voorhees is riding shotgun with us today, about 15 minutes into the fourth hour, so he has plenty of time in Gerald Salente with all the big trends forecast for 2020.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  He's going to be taking over the last three segments of that hour, the last 45 minutes of that hour.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Zach is here to get into vaccine damage.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  Now, I've had scientists on, I've had medical doctors on, but I like Zach as he's an engineer and a former Google guy, and he's got a lot of the PowerPoints and a lot of the research together.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  We're going to shoot a PowerPoint the next few days that will then air live on the air and then post to Bandai Video.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  This is just going to be a little bit of a prelude to that, but when you look at vaccines, it's just part of big pharma with their horrible history of damaging people, knowing drugs were going to hurt people.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  Now they've been given liability protection since the 80s, and now they're expanding that into other areas of drugs.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  It's extremely dangerous, and they're trying to ban people online that try to talk about vaccines and damage.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  What happened to them? What happened to their families? What the inserts say?
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  So really, they're attacking consumer rights and medical choice, and so we're going to get to all of that with Zach Voorhees who's riding shotgun with us.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  And then I do intend the last 30 minutes or so when he's on with us to give the number out for people that love vaccines and have great stories to tell, or people that have had bad reactions.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Just what you personally have experienced, because that's really where the rubber meets the road about everybody.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  They could say a restaurant's the best restaurant in town, but if you get food poisoning there once or twice and you hear your neighbors got it, and pretty soon everybody's not going to go there anymore because you get food poisoning.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  It doesn't matter if the news says that nobody ever got sick there. If you got a bunch of people coming out dead, folks are going to think they're putting cyanide in the food, not just bacteria or other toxins.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  So Zach, I want to get into all this with you in the next hour. But first off, what do you think of the impeachment wheels coming off?
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  What do you think of all the confrontations with politicians happening? What do you think of the Brexit party, you know, winning so big in the UK?
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  I mean, I call this a pretty big awakening. What do you think is happening right now?
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Well, I think that the election win in the UK was phenomenal. Like you saw Boris Johnson come out ahead with a huge and surprising win by the Conservatives.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  The mainstream media was saying that, oh, it's going to be really close. It's going to be really close. No, it was a total blowout for the Conservative Party.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  They swept through. And just like the Brexit election win signified the upcoming Trump election win, I think that this Boris Johnson win is going to signal the next Trump win in 2020.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  And that's what Joe Biden just said, too.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Yeah. You know, and so right now with the impeachment, the mainstream media is starting to like wake up and realize, hey, I think they're setting us a trap.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  And for a lot of us, including you, you've been kind of saying this for a while.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  There's a trap that's being set. The Republicans control the Senate. And when it comes to the Senate, there's really no way out.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And right now the Democrats have two bad choices. They can continue this sham impeachment and have it die in the Senate, or they can retract and they can like abandon it and then, you know, show themselves to be the losers.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  And either way, they're impotent.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  Either way, they're impotent.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  So what do you expect them to pull, though, to get their bacon out of the fire?
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Oh, man, that's a good question. You know, I honestly think that, you know, I'm actually, I have no idea what to expect.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I am sitting here going, what's going to happen next? What's going to happen next? It's almost like we're watching a movie.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  I was thinking the truth is stranger than fiction. This is incredibly riveting. No one knows what's going to happen. What's your idea? What do you think is going to happen?
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Well, they had planned to not have him release that transcript. They had planned to just buffalo the public into abandoning, but they've been caught lying so much at backfire.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  They plan on bringing women forward and racist stuff during the actual trial, I believe. That's just what they do in the past.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  But I think now, even if Trump did some real stuff, it's not going to work anymore because they have fired so many.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  They've cried wolf so many times now that it really rings hollow, but they are trying to start civil unrest. They are trying to plunge the economy.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And I don't think Trump is invincible, but I agree that calling everybody racist, bullying everyone, doing all this is not working as backfiring spectacularly,
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  but see they're in their own echo chambers and bubbles on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google. And so they've radicalized themselves within those bubbles.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  They don't see any opposition where they are. And so they just can't believe that it's not working. So it's the immovable object moving into the unstoppable force.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  It's going to be explosive.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  You know what I think is really funny is the fact that with all the impeachment going on and all the reasons why they justified this impeachment going forward,
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  the one reason that they didn't put in for the impeachment was the whole Russian collusion.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  It looks like they just sort of dropped it and then expected all of us to just sort of forget that the whole reason that they started this impeachment process in the first place was because of...
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  And why did they drop it? Because it's all their evidence that they were involved with Russia and others and they know Trump's going to put that evidence on.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Yep. The exact same thing is happening in Ukraine. Think nearer. Like think of all the allegations that are against Trump.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  In reality, all the allegations that they were leveraging against him apply to Biden, Obama...
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  I got to say this. I got to say this. I wasn't buying into this whole thing that trust the plan that's going to blow up in their face and take them down.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  But you know what? That is really what's starting to happen. It's pretty amazing to stay with us.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now. If you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  I've tried TurboForce with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put TurboForce in my coffee. That was a crazy week.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  If you're into the group, think, don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection. He's completely surrounded. And to pray for him to have discernment.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  And to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him, that the globalist could win.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for Infowars and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist. Thank you and God bless you all.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Zach Voorhees, Big Google whistleblower about to expose vaccines starting in the next segment. You were telling me about this article out of Breitbart that I hadn't seen.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Where of course there's lawsuits and they're finding all these irregularities. Thousands of people voting the names of dead people.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  Oh no, that well-known problem across the country doesn't exist. It's racist to say so. What the hell does that have to do with black people that Democrats are going around in the cemetery getting people's names and voting in them.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  Again, the media injects race into everything.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Yeah, right. What has the media been telling us? They've been telling us that there is no way that there's election rigging that's happening across the nation.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  And now there's a lawsuit that says, hey, look, Detroit, you're using dead people to vote. And their responses, not that no, we're not.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  They're saying, no, that's racist for you to even think that that's happening. It's a direct attack on people of color. It's like, come on.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  Why is accusing them of voting dead people to vote a direct attack on people of color? I don't get it.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  When we were playing that clip of Joe Biden earlier, some people might have been tuned in and might have missed it.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  While he's speaking of the crowd like brain sheep going, racist, racist, they just like it's a magic word. They're like, racist, racist.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  When they're talking about Trump and things, they're just brain like sheep. Like it's magic and I'll be out on the street and have a leftist toddle over.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  And they used to say, Russian agent. And they're like, Oh, I got you. Now they go, racist. It's always like some weird white person. I just laugh at them and they look all freaked out.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  Like what? My magic word didn't hurt you. Like I'm supposed to go, no, no. Like a burst in flame or like that movie scanners, my head starts puffing up.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  I go, yeah. I mean, it just doesn't work. I'm not exactly say racist. I'm like, Oh, I'm melding. I'm melding.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  It's like, I'm sorry. It's almost 2020. It's like, we don't see that anymore. You know what Zeus does when he throws thunderbolts down and kills money?
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  He goes, oh, racist. Right. They got rid of that from the Greek Athenian legends. Everyone was claiming racist.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  There it is. Look, that guy says racist and it's over when he says it.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Yeah. So, yeah. So apparently, claiming dead people can vote is racist. Also, there's an interesting story that my friend dug up where he discovered that if certain aborted children in California don't have to be issued a death certificate.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And there, yeah, this is true. This is true. And there is this theory of why would they do that? Is it because they are registering to vote as Democrats 18 years later?
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  Ah, say that again.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Okay. So in California, there's a law that they passed in 1997 that stated that a fetus that was aborted at a certain time frame didn't have to be issued a death certificate by the hospital.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  Yes.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  And so there is this theory that those aborted fetuses are now voting in California.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  Well, hell, I mean, they've been caught doing stuff just as bad as that. I mean, they just had judicial watch lawsuit a few months ago came out and it found that it's pretty amazing like millions and millions of people had voted illegally or in the names of dead people.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  Yeah. And there was like more people registered to vote in certain certain counties in California than there are actual people in the county.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  But you know, that's racist to bring that up.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  I know, right? Why is that racist?
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  It's like if your tire is flat, you just go, it's racist. Or like if you're a landlord and somebody wants you to fix the toilet, just go racist. You don't have to.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  Right.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  Or if somebody wants you to like, I mean, let's say a waitress brings you out like a soup with a fly in it. Just, just, just, you know, just say racist.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  Right.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  It'll fix any problems, I'm saying.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  We should look to Iraq to really how to vote because they got it down cold. They take your finger, you dip it in ink after you vote and then you can only, you know, put your finger in ink once.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  And that's it. Does your finger have ink on it? Sorry, you can't vote anymore, you know, but now in California, now in Oregon, you don't have to come into vote.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  You can send in a mail-in ballot. And whenever I see a state instituting a mail-in ballot, I realize, okay, this is paving the way for massive election fraud that's going to come in.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  That's two plus two equals four, which is racist.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  Check in every day to find the new deals.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Secure a bottle of the good halogen.

[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  All right, coming up, bottom of the hour, I'm going to give your number out, call in and tell us your horror stories or your stories about how you found your knight in shining armor when they gave you that vaccine,
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  which is really just a company producing something. They're going to put in your body that they claim will teach your body to have a learned immunity to it, artificially learned immunity,
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  which no one's arguing is in a real science out of the whole history of it.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  The problem is they've been given liability protection. Now they're lying about what's on the inserts. Now they're trying to pass laws to not have the inserts and not have to tell you what they can do to you.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  And here's the thing, Gardasil was doing trials 18 years ago, and it killed a bunch of people that took it, caused autoimmune disorders and others, sterilized women, caused cancer,
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  and that was all over local news around the country, people dying in the test.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Rick Perry, who had a Merck former head as his chief of staff, said, well, I'm going to say it's a civil emergency. So if a governor or the president does that, be a governor too.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  It gives liability protection to that vaccine because it's a mandated. And they rolled out a product that was banned in Japan and India in places where they tested it and killed people.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  And they dumped a drug banned in other countries on the American market.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Think about that. And it's the same thing that we see with 5G. Israel invents it, bans it for security and health reasons last year.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  5G is illegal in Israel, but they're selling it to us.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  Now, again, Switzerland's starting to ban it and it's different states, cantons. So it's the same thing. They go safe and effective.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  They have fact sheets at the drug stores when you go there, Walgreens, CVS, but they're not the vaccine inserts, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  Now, just the other day, I had the crew just go to Walgreens. They try to not give us these and here are the real inserts.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  This is what comes with them by law. You read this with a magnifying glass. It says it can kill you and give you Guillain berets, narcolepsy, all these other disorders.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  How'd you like to get a case of permanent epilepsy? How'd you like to get cancer? You need to read the adverse reactions on these and do it while you can.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  They got laws in Congress to stop issuing these.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  And now Facebook is intercepting the sharing of these nutritional labels on these vaccines and preventing the spread through social media.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  That's the newest thing of the last month. They don't want you sharing the information that's on the vaccine label, which is incredible.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  They were just scrolling through and I read there are undetectable items in this that may interfere with infants such and such.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  And then it was just everything you're reading just deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Did you know that there is an entire human that they inject when they push that vaccine? The cells that they use to incubate a lot of the vaccines is actually an entire genome because they use aborted fetal tissue in order to grow these vaccines.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  And then so the fact that it's calling an autoimmune response to that is going to cause an autoimmune response to all the other genes in the body, many of which you match, which then is going to trigger autoimmune disease in your body.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  And it's not just single. It's not just the DNA. It's also the fact that you're injecting an immune agitator called an adjuvant.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  So that could be mercury, which is I think they banned it.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  Aluminum.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Aluminum is still legal. And that aluminum adjuvant says to your immune system, hey, oh, the impairment to fertility.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  Oh, oh, the MMR shot hurts your fertility.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  Oh, just maybe it's best we not read this.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  Oh, adverse reactions. Look at this.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Vasylitis in your in your heart.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  Digestives. Oh, pancreatitis. Oh, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  Look at that. Oh, my gosh, diabetes. Hey, you like diabetes? Is there other type one diabetes?
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  Where?
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  Scroll up, scroll up.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  My brother's got type one diabetes.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  It's genetic. Really? What does it?
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Oh, it's one in 100,000 is what they say.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  But now it's increasing.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  They told one of my good friends that when his daughter went in and they gave him the vaccine years ago, and all of a sudden she got type one diabetes.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  The whole Children's War was full of kids after that shot that got type one diabetes because they gave him pancreatitis.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  Yeah.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And instead of trying to even treat it and said they're pancreas, they just say, hey, your kids on this forever.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And then once they put them on it, they never have the insulin again.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Bye bye.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  That's what happens.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  Look, following vaccination, children, reactions and joints are uncommon and generally a brief duration.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  But then it goes on to say, but it actually might give them arthritis in some cases.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  And look at that. Isn't that nice?
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  See, don't you hate that double speak? They say.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  Oh, it might give you measles. You see that?
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  Because it's a live measles vaccine.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  The risk of serious neurological disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains less than the risk of encephalitis.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  And it goes on following injection with wild type measles.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  Did you hear what that just said?
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  The risk of serious neurological disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains less than the risk of encephalitis.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  And it goes on following injection with wild type measles.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  The side effects of the measles vaccine is measles.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Isn't that weird?
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  One of the side effects of the measles vaccine is measles.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  But it's okay.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  It's not going to cause neurological damage as bad as the wild one.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  But then they lie to you and tell you there's no problem, safe and effective.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  But this live video is banned on Facebook.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  And if somebody tries to clip this out and just show you the insert, they're going to say, that's not medical.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  They're not allowed to talk show host to read an insert.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  That's like, hey, don't read on Drano that it says you can burn your eyes out or if you drink it will kill you.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  Only a doctor is allowed to read that to you.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  You're not allowed to read it either.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  You're not a qualified authoritarian to make these certain comments.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  And that's what they say on Facebook. You've got to be a qualified expert.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Yeah, unless you are no nothing 16 year old that wants to push the climate alarm and isn't like Greta.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Then all of a sudden it's like everyone saying, oh yeah, we should listen to this kid.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  It's really weird this double standard about how you can't comment on certain things, but you can if you go with the agenda.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  They had the swine flu vaccine back in the 70s. Tens of thousands died.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  It was all over the news. No one debated it.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  My grandmother got polio from the polio vaccine.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  I have a really good friend. In fact, everybody knows his name here on the show.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  His mother is fighting, like I said, the name for her life.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  After what they call polio like virus ate her spine.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  Polio like virus. What if it's polio?
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  Well, this individual was vaccinated previously, but they're in an area with the precious little migrants from Syria.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  But you see, oh, polio is eradicated. So when you get polio either from the vaccine or someone else from third world country.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  Remember, it doesn't exist. So it's now polio like, oh, they've eradicated death.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  They just call it death like symptoms.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  If the death has been eradicated, there's still times when people, you know, you're right, you go away, you're never here again, your physical body.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  But that's not death. That's death like.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  May include side effects like death like symptoms or death. Yeah, right.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  You're learning how this works. Yeah.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Look at this death from various and in some cases unknown causes has been reported rarely following vaccination with measles, mumps and rebella vaccines.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  However, a causal relationship has not been established in healthy individuals.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  See contradictions, contraindications, no death or permanent.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  What does that say? Permanent sequelae sequelae reported in the published post marketing surveillance study in Finland involving 1.5 million children and adults who were vaccinated with MMR.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  Oh, but don't worry. Look, oh, that was back in 1982. Everything's fine.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  And then you just read this stuff yourself. Unbelievable. And we're just randomly just scrolling through one of many here. Why don't you read the Gardasil?
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Contraindications. Read that. Hey, listen, don't worry about that. Just know this.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  We're not living as long. Cancer rates are way up. Neurological rates are way up.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  IQ is the employment of a plunging and infant mortality is exploding. So keep taking those shots.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher.

[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  800-600-3388. Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you. Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short. I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties. I kind of got a little out of hand and I listened to you religiously in my truck every day.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  We're really proud of turbo force. So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  Then help us spread the word. Let's just get busy and 4store.com.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  And I'm saying the worst vaccine for my research is the Gardasil HPV, human papillomabars.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  I took it, too, before I knew.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  And I didn't know this about you. And then the boom operator talked about a family member in great shape, amazing, took it and got ovarian cancer.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  And by the way, it says on the insert, increases ovarian cancer. It's been tied to sterilizing women.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  Everyone in Mexico, school-aged girls are basically being forced to take it. The headlines say it's the law. It's just like here. It's not really the law.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  And boy, are they getting sterilized. And again, I don't want floods of illegal aliens up here that are told to hate America and want welfare.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  But I don't want to sterilize all the Mexicans either. You understand?
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  So the leftists have this, oh, we love the third world. We love the migrants.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  Remember, they didn't just give black people in the U.S. syphilis in vaccines.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  They did it in Peru. They did it all over the world. They did it to poor white people.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  They do it to poor people because they don't know what hit them.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  And Zach, I'm going to shut up and give you the floor because you're going to do a whole PowerPoint and we're going to air it either this week or next week.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  I'm going to make a big deal about it because we just do something. It's a big deal. If we do it, big production value, you can really run through it all.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  But before we get into some of your documents here, tell me about your experience with the Gardasil.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  Yeah, so while I was working at Google, I decided that I wanted to get vaccinated against HPV. Who wouldn't, right?
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  You take a shot and all of a sudden there's one less thing to worry about.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  And then after getting the shot, I started getting kind of sick, like headache, started getting like the flu a lot.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  And now in retrospect, what I suspect is that I suspect that the vaccine was a contributing factor.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  And I suspect this because of all the poisons that are in these vaccines.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  Well, brother, when they give you a big fat spectrum of cancer viruses that aren't really attenuated, your body is freaking out.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  And then every contaminant in there, your body now creates an autoimmune response to that.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  And that's really the big danger. It's not the aluminum. All that's a side issue from our research.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  This is mainline science. It's whatever else is in there. Just like that insert said, oh, there's other stuff in here.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  This may cause an autoimmune disorder. That's why autoimmune disorders are skyrocketing.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  I mean, and that that is part of what the adjuvants do.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  They cause the body to have an immune response to the vaccine that's in there.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  And as a result, most of the time your body is going to be like, it's the vaccine that I need to inoculate against.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  Sometimes it's going to inoculate against your own tissues and then boom, you now have an autoimmune problem.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  Let's explain that again.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  Most vaccines got grown on fetal tissue at one point, letter that may grow that base group on eggs or something.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  Or on that's a blood of lots of growth material, but it still has human DNA in it.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  And so your body is going to start having autoimmune responses to human DNA.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  Right. Like it takes in that DNA and it says to your lymph systems and they pulled apart.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  They're like, what's here that we need to like generate an immune response to?
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  And then it's like, aha, it's like this protein that's expressed in your kidneys or your connective tissue.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  And now boom, your body is attacking.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Now you got lupus.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  Now you got lupus, right?
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  So this happens all the time.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  And, you know, it's a mystery. Why are all these diseases happening?
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  They're all getting so bad. I only made this corn out of a monkey fish frog.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  The hogs eat it, they die.
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  They eat the GMO, they have Gardasil.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  Hell, have some Roundup.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  They can drink all the bottle of this.
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  And the Indian farmers go really and kill themselves with it.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  Ever know anyone with a peanut allergy?
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  Yes.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  Do you know why that that peanut allergy happened?
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  Tell us.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  They had a peanut oil as an adjuvant for vaccines.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  Yes.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  And now they've stopped and now the peanut allergies have gone way down.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  And that's why.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Oh, you eat a peanut almost kills you.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  Yeah, no one talks about it.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  I did know the answer, but I didn't want to steal the punchline.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  All right.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  But hey, what's wrong with the diet from peanut allergies? It's liberal.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  Right.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  Well, why are you racist?
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  There's too many people.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  Why are you racist against peanut allergies?
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  Yes.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  People deserve their peanut allergies.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  People love, they work hard for those.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  And it really sucks if you have a peanut allergy.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  The peanut allergy, my uncle, the one that's still alive.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  He worked out on a ranch.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  He cut himself, was around horse manure, that's got a lot of, you know, tetanus in it,
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  went and got a tetanus shot.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  Arms and legs, swole up, everything else almost died.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  And the doctor told him, yeah, the tetanus shot did this, don't ever take one again.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  I mean, but then they act like, oh, vaccines, everything was wrong, oh, it's made up.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  Oh, that's crazy.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  There was a lady who worked here, she would do the show, she would, you know,
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  you know she'd write some of the notes what we talked about you know to put
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:17.560]  headlines up and things later and uh she was going to go to vietnam so they
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:20.280]  told her oh here's the shots you take the state department said
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:23.880]  and she was wearing mask here for like a month and everything and she said no no
[2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:26.760]  they've told me from the rest of my life i can never take any vaccines again
[2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:29.640]  because once you have a bad reaction you can't ever take them again but on the
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:32.200]  news they just say zach just take them just keep taking them there's nobody
[2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:35.080]  ever had a problem zach what's wrong zach i just can't
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:38.840]  oh my uncle almost died from one my mom almost died from one my grandmother
[2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:42.840]  was given polio from it and the doctor told her that back in 1954 but
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:45.800]  everything's fine zach you got really sick when you took one but everything's
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:49.240]  fine zach everything's fine zach did you know
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:54.840]  that the polio vaccine contained a virus that caused cancer and that one
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:25:59.560]  third of all the vaccines that were given in like the 1960s were contaminated
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.360]  with this oncological virus sv-40 sv-40 that's right swimming virus 40 they
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:09.240]  estimated 100 million people got cancer from it and tens of millions died how
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:13.320]  liberal yeah this isn't a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy fact
[2:26:13.320 --> 2:26:17.480]  oh but it the good of vaccines outweighs the bad
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:21.160]  no it doesn't because the truth is it's a eugenics program just like the fluoride
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:25.000]  and all of it to dumb you down and make you infertile so the ruling class can
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:28.440]  dominate you none of them take any of the vaccines folks
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:32.280]  yeah it's interesting that the president of russia
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:35.800]  recently stated that they were not going to put any fluoride
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:39.640]  in the waters in russia because he said that fluoride should only be used
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:43.000]  in the gulags it should not be given to the general population
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.960]  i thought that was fascinating and you know who was pushing
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:50.360]  this fluoridation in the waters none other than george
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:56.520]  soros he loves us man i don't get why he is the enemy of humanity i don't
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:26:59.080]  understand it well i mean he's signed on to
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:02.440]  when you're 14 helping round up your fellow jews to send them death camps
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:05.720]  i mean you get an early start with bells above he'd pay him a top general
[2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:09.080]  is it funny how the adl says it's anti-semitic to criticize
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:14.840]  a jew killer like george soros it's it blows my mind like that 60 minutes
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:19.320]  interview where he says that it was the most exhilarating time of his life
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:22.600]  look all george soros demands fluoride into drinking waters in schools
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:28.360]  helping the children ah liberal even though the america medical
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:32.840]  association harvard all admit massive fertility drops massive cancer
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:36.120]  massive iq reduction all given to you by
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:43.960]  soros and alexander soros smiles down to when he's not an allocerelli rituals
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:47.320]  you know he takes photos of himself at the allocerelli events
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:50.520]  george soros does no no alexander he's very proud of himself
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:54.600]  yeah such a powerful young man he's an evil villain in the making
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:57.160]  well you look at him he just looks like a sack of
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:01.320]  garbage uh yeah just like his father apple doesn't fall far from the tree
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:04.520]  well i mean again they've got to serve satan they've got to commit to pure
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:07.480]  evil because when you get into that level of satanism
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:11.080]  if you don't absolutely turn yourself over the dark side you are not going to
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:14.840]  be happy camp luckily there's people that have you alex
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:18.200]  jones to come here and say the truth and tell people what's really going on
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:21.480]  well i'm certainly trying but i have gone a little bit crazy
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:24.520]  hey joe rogan talked about the human growth was pretty good wow it's

[2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:08.040]  been done by the cdc and various organizations around the world
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:11.800]  the mainstream media does not want to talk about them
[2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:15.880]  despite the fact that they come from the cdc themselves
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:19.880]  we've been able to get them out of their cold dead hands
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:23.720]  with a FOA request that is the freedom of information act
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:28.200]  and the person we should thank for this is the children's health defense fund
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:32.680]  which is done by robert f kennedy jr so we thank you for that robert f
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:35.400]  kennedy i want to get into the first one which
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:40.520]  is the cdc's unpublished study on het b which showed dramatic increase in the
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:45.000]  risk of autism 7.6 percent uh times increase
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.600]  sleep disorders speech disorders and neurodevelopment
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:52.520]  disorders and that's given right at birth and you might as well just throw
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:55.880]  your baby up against the wall because we'll just you know drop them a few
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:36:59.000]  times on their head yep next up we have this is the
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:02.760]  chemical lobotomy at birth that's right next up we've got the hepatitis v
[2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:06.520]  vaccine which increases the odds for special education
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:12.920]  by nearly nine times okay this was published in 2008
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:17.880]  um and uh there it is right there on the screen
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:20.920]  um so i mean this is you know what's wrong with the lobotomy that makes us
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:23.080]  a little bit more a little bit more if that was the
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:25.320]  jab this into my cerebral cortex a little bit i wouldn't
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:28.440]  have as much you know thoughts that are so complex that upset me
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.920]  society would run better right just you know and the benefits is that it lowers
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:36.520]  your SAT score which is also loving and liberal please continue
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:39.960]  uh which actually makes you more eligible for welfare
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:43.640]  um next up is the hepatitis v vaccine in male newborns increases
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:49.560]  odds of autism by 3x that's another reason to take the hepatitis and these
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:52.680]  are major pub med studies all linked all well known
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:56.840]  yep um you know it's funny autism is actually a multi-spectrum
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:37:59.800]  disorder it's caused by many different factors
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:03.560]  it's basically brain inflammation and a persistent inflammation that that's what
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:06.040]  they call the spectrum because there's all different ways
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:09.640]  our brains try to repair themselves after the massive autoimmune response
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:12.280]  that happens in the brain yeah it's like five different diseases all
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.160]  classified under the same thing it's like oh you've got fatigue
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:18.200]  well what's it caused by well it could be like five different things right
[2:38:18.200 --> 2:38:21.800]  that's the way autism works it's like these five different things but
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:26.040]  um they just call it oh exactly so um let's see
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:30.520]  flu shot increases rate of non flu infection by 4.4
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:34.040]  times and there's your big mainline scientific studies
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:37.320]  yeah i mean a lot of us see that ourselves like my dad always gets
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:40.840]  vaccinated and then he's just like but i still got the flu
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:45.080]  how does that work i know a lady that manages a major medical facility here
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:48.040]  in austin and she just got hired by the new
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:51.400]  group that bought it up to run it i don't believe it that
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:54.680]  well they come in and watch everyone now and make sure they have a shot usually
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:58.520]  all the nurses in them they just inject it into a trash can and lie
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:01.720]  they all were made to take it she's deathly ill right now
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:04.520]  and a bunch of them are sick and the company's losing money she's not a
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:07.160]  nurse she's a manager for major medical equipment
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:10.840]  used across austin i'll just leave it at that okay
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:15.240]  but alex you're not an immunologist how can you say things that may or may not be
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:18.600]  all the nurses and all the people are secretly injecting it in trash cans
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:22.520]  and this time the the new nazi company literally comes in and watches you take
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:26.680]  it what the hell is going on here yeah and god bless those
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:30.360]  nurses that will just throw the vaccine to the garbage and then say that oh they
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:33.080]  all do it they all do it but but now they watch them
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:36.360]  now they watch them there's a monitor that watches the nurse they came in they
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:40.440]  watched she's the head lady she's thinking about
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.760]  coming on she's coming she's literally super sick
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.440]  i'm so glad i'm not a baby right now they've got it rough um let's talk about
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:49.240]  dtp it increases this happened this week brother
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:53.320]  what's happened this week yeah this lady manages
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:57.080]  the whole austin territory so she's the boss so they came in everybody
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:39:59.880]  watched her take it then they all the takers they were all refusing
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:03.320]  like line up roll up your sleeves we're gonna prove how tough we are it just
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:06.200]  keeps on getting crazier and crazier and crazier
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:10.520]  right dtp increases mortality in girls
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:15.480]  10x that comes so the old days the nazis just put you up against a wall like
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:18.760]  Greta Thunberg wants to shoot you now we just do it where you go off and linger
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:21.240]  for a while it might have to take care of you then you die
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:24.680]  well the thing is is that when they line you up and shoot you that's too much
[2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:28.360]  you know cause and effect now they want to have probable deniabilities they just
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:31.400]  want to make you sick and is it the vaccines is the water
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:35.000]  soft chill is it the food like you don't it's all of it it's like hey
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:42.600]  yeah keep going okay um let's see vaccination of preemies increases
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:47.080]  odds of neurodevelopment disorders by 6.6 time uh
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:50.120]  percent i keep on wanting to say percent but it's times
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:53.800]  um so uh vaccination received a one or more
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:57.000]  recommended vaccines was significantly associated with
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:01.160]  neurodevelopment disorder while preterm birth without vaccination was
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:07.320]  not so there's big studies on the amish just don't get autism
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:09.960]  yeah but you know what that's going to come to an end because now they're
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:14.760]  saying that the odd the amish have to vaccinate if
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.120]  they want to attend a private school i saw that court ruling this week
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:21.560]  yeah like for last week arms like it's really
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:25.640]  in the left is doing it the left is always like oh separation of church and
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:28.520]  state church and state will not here's a religious group they're like
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:31.400]  we want to have a separation of church and state like no
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:35.560]  it has to be mandatory your school has to be accredited with vaccinations
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:38.280]  they're like but we don't get autism and we have the lowest rate of infection
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:45.240]  to shut up who take it we love you do you have allured allergic
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:49.080]  rhinitis allergy adhd autism ischemia learning
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:53.080]  disability neurodevelopment disorder you may have been
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:56.040]  vaccinated so vaccination increases the risk of these things
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:02.040]  look like a lot allergies 30 times yeah come on down
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:06.040]  oh my gosh what is the thing a four four point two
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:11.160]  times increase of adhd 4.2 of autism yay
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:15.080]  the common thread here is that these are all tied to the immune system
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:17.960]  okay neurological disorders four percent
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:22.520]  yay you get a neurological disorder you get cancer
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:26.440]  you get autistic you die you have convulsions
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:31.240]  you have autoimmune disorders yay instead of you get a car you get a car
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:35.080]  you get a disease you get a disease you get narcolepsy you get epilepsy

[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:06.200]  of your product a little bit about me i'm 245 pounds i work about 10 to 13
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.120]  hours a day at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:13.320]  with adderall i do have adhd but you know i was taking
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:16.600]  adderall for its energy boosting properties you know i kind of got a
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:19.640]  little out of hand and you know i listen you religiously in my truck every day
[2:43:19.640 --> 2:43:23.960]  so i tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:26.120]  life but turbo force really changed my life
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:29.880]  i mean it was a day i no longer take adderall and i get by literally the 13
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:33.240]  hours a day i work on a half of a packet of your turbo force
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:37.240]  and if you take a half a packet that's literally a dollar a day and you save
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:40.840]  so much money versus you know a monster which is what 499 and i you know i

[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  you
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:35.000]  we're just talking to Zach Voorhees and myself about different pentagon studies
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:40.280]  they've done in situations that about 10 days of no food
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:43.720]  most people become cannibals about 80 become cannibals
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:48.520]  though 20 usually commit suicide and so yeah your kids are starving to death i
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:52.520]  wouldn't go out and grab other groups of people and then eat them
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:54.840]  but i'm just being honest with them with the lizard brain kicking in the lower
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:57.640]  brain yeah i'm just being honest most like you know
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:00.680]  let's say a rating party comes your house tries to eat you during collapse
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:03.800]  and you haven't eaten in about a week and a half they're trying to eat you
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:07.160]  i'm not gonna go out and eat children and stuff but i'll kill gun these guys down
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:10.120]  and then i'm gonna eat i'm gonna eat them and i'm not gonna enjoy doing it i'm
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:13.720]  just being honest that my kids eat food i'm gonna eat them yeah i heard
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:17.800]  people taste like pig is that what it is all long ham in the uh
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:21.480]  it's not specific yeah i don't have any desire to eat people
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:24.200]  yeah uh but you know it's like if you're in a jet and it you know that famous when
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:27.480]  they crash in the andes or whatever and half of them you know we're dead they
[2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:30.360]  made the decision to eat the people and they left
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:34.040]  yeah and so there's this big taboo that's eating people i'm against it too but
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:38.040]  we inject ourselves with vaccines grown on dead babies that's the same thing
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:42.120]  can you imagine the discussion around that they're like well you know
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:45.640]  we ate three days ago but this guy's dead and in 10 days it's probably gonna
[2:48:45.640 --> 2:48:48.360]  spoil so even though we're not hungry we should probably eat now remember the
[2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:51.640]  mutiny on the bounty that's a true story and it was the furthest you know open air
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:55.800]  uh navigation by small boat like all the way across the pacific they all said
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:49:00.040]  in the logs that oh we sustained ourselves off one bird we caught no that
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:04.120]  word it they they ate the dudes wow they're they they they ate the few guys
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:07.000]  the guys reportedly later one because one guy wrote his diary they said hey eat me
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:10.200]  when i die okay so yeah that's you know
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:14.280]  but i mean come on let's just be honest about it oh on to happier on to happier
[2:49:14.280 --> 2:49:17.960]  notes talk about vaccines let's talk about eating our neighbors
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:22.120]  this one is really important to me this is the vaccination increases type one
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:27.160]  diabetes by three times now this is really important to me because
[2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:31.480]  my brother developed type one diabetes when he was 17
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:35.560]  and all of a sudden he lost a bunch of weight started urinating frequently all
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:38.920]  the time i think he even wet his bed and then
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:42.040]  we put him on the scale is like oh you're 10 pounds underweight
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:46.040]  we brought him in his like blood sugar levels were like 1300
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:49.160]  okay and then ever since then he's had to inject himself
[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:54.120]  with a bunch of insulin every single day so uh why did that happen
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:58.360]  why is it so common uh it's linked to vaccines
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:03.960]  right they cause an autoimmune response in the pancreas that's on record yeah
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:08.040]  that's right uh polio vaccination increases type one diabetes by
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:14.440]  two and a half times um raw cdc data shows vaccination
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:18.680]  on time with mmr increases odd odds of autism by
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:23.240]  three and a half times um so this is the cdc's
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:27.000]  own unpublished study the reason why we have it is because
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:30.760]  of a full request oh you're going through 50 or 60 of these
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:35.560]  slow down on that one zack this is the cdc's own internal study
[2:50:35.560 --> 2:50:39.960]  bombshell beyond belief and 2020 back at the time also covered it
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:43.480]  then the cdc suppressed it they had the cdc famously the meeting said my god
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:45.080]  they'll kill us if they learn what we've done
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:48.280]  i've got to tell my kids not to give them my grandkids this stuff
[2:50:48.280 --> 2:50:51.800]  this all came out on abc news show them that again yeah it's right here
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:56.120]  right put that back on screen guys please great job crew
[2:50:56.120 --> 2:51:00.520]  look at that it's it's it's you know it's like this should be given to the
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:03.400]  public so that they can see what's going on and they could be like you know
[2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:07.000]  maybe we should figure out which one of these three
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:11.800]  vaccines in the mmr is causing this right but they don't want to do that they
[2:51:11.800 --> 2:51:14.520]  want to you know they want to lock it they want to increase the amount
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:17.960]  they want to increase the amount right because apparently it's really good for
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:21.080]  black folks by the way fluoride all this seems to be way
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:24.920]  double worse for blacks fluoride whatever the vaccines are doing the same
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:28.520]  double worse we should call vaccines racist
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:32.600]  they actually are right for whatever reason whatever reason africans
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:37.800]  do even worse than um any other group with fluoride and what's in the
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:41.000]  vaccines every study just you want to i mean you think it's frying why folks
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:45.560]  folks it's really bad for black next time i talk to a left-wing racist that
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:48.520]  accuses me of being a conspiracy theorist i'll just say hey you're racist
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:52.360]  right because vaccines harm a lot of black people more than they do
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:56.280]  other uh racial groups well i mean look
[2:51:56.280 --> 2:51:59.480]  humans are all the same but statistically there are known genetic
[2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:02.360]  differences and and that's why every long distance
[2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:06.120]  champion runner is kenyan they're just something and that's all the other
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:08.840]  africans get beat by them too there's just something going on with
[2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:11.960]  kenyans and that's certain percent that have a metabolic system that allows
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:13.960]  them to just run 50 miles and never stop
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:17.240]  yeah okay there's just something well you take people that are souped up like
[2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:19.960]  that like like a man's more souped up than a woman
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:23.480]  okay and then on average a black guy you have more athletic ability to call
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:26.520]  that racist effect it's in all the studies folks but when you're a race
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:28.920]  car and souped up you put bad fuel in that
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:32.440]  bye bye yeah you understand mm-hmm you start running a little
[2:52:32.440 --> 2:52:36.280]  thick you know yeah that's why fluoride and any other contaminate the black
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:39.800]  people is really really bad it's bad for everybody folks
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:43.240]  bad for boys those girls are the least effective why
[2:52:43.240 --> 2:52:46.840]  stronger blood-brain barriers that's right yeah it's stronger blood-brain
[2:52:46.840 --> 2:52:50.280]  barriers between on women and then guys don't have it that much
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:53.480]  which is the reason why guys suffer from a whole bunch of
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:57.240]  diseases that women don't suffer men are the target
[2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:03.640]  mm-hmm they want a weak male you know group uh let's do this next one the
[2:53:03.640 --> 2:53:07.160]  Marisol testosterone also the higher the testosterone as well the worse these
[2:53:07.160 --> 2:53:10.120]  things affect is that true yeah did not know that
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:14.200]  okay so the Marisol containing hepatitis b series increases odds
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:21.000]  of autism by three point four times now what is the Marisol the Marisol is
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:24.200]  mercury mercury it's like methyl ethyl mercury
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:29.960]  really bad stuff you get it in your system and uh your body starts to attack
[2:53:29.960 --> 2:53:34.280]  the cells that it gets absorbed into why does your body absorb mercury because
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:39.080]  it seems like it appears to be similar to the other metals
[2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:44.360]  above it in the periodic table okay so um human
[2:53:44.360 --> 2:53:48.600]  papilloma virus that's HPV for those of you that don't know this
[2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:51.480]  virus vaccine increases the odds of asthma
[2:53:51.480 --> 2:53:55.480]  eight times moving on another mercury containing
[2:53:55.480 --> 2:53:58.520]  vaccine hepatitis b series increases odds of premature
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:05.720]  puberty by two times okay mmr vaccine increases risk
[2:54:05.720 --> 2:54:10.120]  of Crohn's disease by three times and ulcerative
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:14.680]  colitis by two and a half times i actually dated a woman that had
[2:54:14.680 --> 2:54:17.800]  like this and there was just a whole bunch of food that she couldn't eat and
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:21.640]  she couldn't figure out why she had a stados genetic and then they find the
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:25.960]  the they find the immune um antibodies in the gut
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:30.040]  yeah for measles believe it or not in a lot in 85 percent of the cases
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:34.520]  the people that have like autism or this like bowel and that's what disease
[2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:37.240]  and that's what these doctors were finding so they just picked a few
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:39.880]  demonized them and claimed that their research was a hoax
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:43.240]  but none of it was all it was all true yeah and then these scientists they
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:47.560]  don't want to be lumped in to that like you know fraud
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:51.880]  which is labeled by the mainstream media so they don't go next to those
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:54.600]  you know studies they don't make a follow-up study on that because they
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:58.280]  don't want to get slimed like they see the other people
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:05.320]  were so yeah so mmr vaccine that's measles mumps and rubella
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:08.760]  the merasol containing hepatitis b vaccines when compared to children
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:14.440]  unvaccinated with the merasol increases odds of adhd
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:17.560]  that's it's so i keep on going oh this one's a bombshell
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:20.840]  all right highest levels of the merasol remember that's
[2:55:20.840 --> 2:55:25.880]  mercury containing vaccines uh exposure increases autism risk
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:32.760]  11 times 11 times how do we get this information
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:37.320]  to the public alex 11 times and let's be clear
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:41.480]  they know exactly what they're doing because the higher the merasol
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:46.520]  the bigger the autoimmune response so when they up the adjuvant which makes
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:51.560]  the amount they put in stronger then that causes a bigger autoimmune response
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:55.720]  which causes swelling in the brain which causes brain damage
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:55:59.400]  you ever hear about like sudden infant death syndrome sids yeah didn't exist
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:02.600]  to all the vaccines yeah and australia found it was the vaccines they covered
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:06.040]  it up and it happens within 72 hours of vaccines but
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:09.320]  it's still a mystery oh it may have been like baby shaken
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:14.120]  syndrome even though japan found out it was and what 15 years ago banned children
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:18.840]  under two from getting vaccines you know japan's actually got it right they've
[2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:22.360]  actually no more about uh yeah the japanese are like oh we didn't have any
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:25.720]  babies dying of this and now they just suddenly are dying over a shot
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:29.400]  it's the shot they went to the study and it was a shot yeah um think about it but
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:31.960]  think about this you can get stung by a honeybee
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:35.240]  you have an autoimmune response you swell up you get really sick
[2:56:35.240 --> 2:56:38.120]  and you if you don't get a shot you die i i never used to be allergic to them
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:41.320]  till i whole group up and chase me when i was like 20 i got stung like 15 times
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:45.160]  and now if i get stung by one i swell up um and for a while i'd have an epi
[2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:49.240]  pin because he got really bad uh and now it's gotten better because i haven't
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:53.160]  been stung in a long time but to make a long story short
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:56.360]  imagine the newborn baby and there's like five six shots they're getting
[2:56:56.360 --> 2:56:59.960]  these big and your body it is not ready for that
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:03.720]  they have autoimmune responses and a lot of times they die like a bee sting
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:07.400]  would you would you just let six bees sting a baby
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:10.280]  no no because they're gonna have an autoimmune response well what the hell
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:13.480]  you doing with big injectors pumping stuff into them
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:17.080]  like it's this is like the vaccine the baby's like this big right like
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:20.840]  if that was like you like think how big that vaccine would have to be be like
[2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:25.560]  giant vaccine like a beer can amount yeah like 16 ounces
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:29.240]  unbelievable unbelievable well the nurses talk about how they watch the
[2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:32.440]  babies a lot of them have convulsions after and they're like oh sorry they're
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:36.760]  gonna nick you like five minutes there a lot of parents are crying right now
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:39.720]  they're like yeah yeah that they want to lobotomize
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:42.920]  all of us they want to manage us they want to control us and if you post the
[2:57:42.920 --> 2:57:46.200]  video they'll take it driving into the operations
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:48.920]  center this morning it just hit me like a ton of bricks
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:53.000]  i need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell out the facts
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:56.440]  when you spend your money at places like dick sporting goods
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:57:59.640]  they're financing a group that gives huge amounts of money
[2:57:59.640 --> 2:58:03.640]  to gun control disarming you and your family then when you go down the list
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:07.000]  and look at these companies like walmart did you know they're doing the same
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:10.520]  thing now did you know that almost every big box store including target
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:14.760]  they're the worst are actually funding the transgender movement
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:18.600]  targeting children do you know what jeff bezos and amazon's
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:22.120]  up to ladies and gentlemen it'll make your head spin
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:25.720]  why in the hell are we supporting these people
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:28.680]  why are you going to buy your christmas presents for your family
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:33.080]  from these institutions that hate america and hate your guts
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:37.560]  do your shopping at infowarsstore.com and get great products and then rest assured
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:40.840]  you're funding the resistance you're funding the voice of liberty in the
[2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:45.080]  face of tyranny please shop at infowarsstore.com
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:50.600]  if it isn't broken then you can't fix it that's why the technocracy is openly
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:55.800]  breaking the human code genetically mutating us poisoning us lowering our
[2:58:55.800 --> 2:58:59.160]  IQs lowering our life expectancy and then destroying the
[2:58:59.160 --> 2:59:03.800]  institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal
[2:59:03.800 --> 2:59:07.960]  species of the family we're being taken off the land
[2:59:07.960 --> 2:59:14.760]  we're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we
[2:59:14.760 --> 2:59:18.600]  cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:23.000]  then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play god
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:27.320]  believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will
[2:59:27.320 --> 2:59:31.880]  willingly beg for them to implement against us
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:36.360]  this is the forced seduction of the luciferian world government model
[2:59:36.360 --> 2:59:40.280]  this is the post-human error this is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the
[2:59:40.280 --> 2:59:43.160]  planet this is the crossroads resist or be
[2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:46.360]  destroyed for eternity
[2:59:46.360 --> 2:59:57.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:28.680]  we are back live broadcasting world wide
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:32.680]  zach more he says our guests here in studio we got loaded phone lines you're
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:35.880]  going to be back tomorrow and we will more concisely without me
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:39.000]  interrupting go through all of those we're going to shoot a power point either
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.880]  today or tomorrow by power point i mean just a
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:45.960]  presentation here where we go through it slowly and document all of this and
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:49.480]  then go through this big stack of articles
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:52.680]  a lot of it is i also want to go through these other inserts i've got
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:56.520]  and highlight them i've got a big magnifying glass we bought
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  so that i can show people on screen because the print
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:04.680]  has gotten even smaller before it was about a third the size of the smallest
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:07.640]  bible print if you had perfect eyes you could read it
[3:01:07.640 --> 3:01:10.840]  it's now zach i want to show you the new printing
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:16.920]  look at this that's the the new flu vaccine all you can read is the name of
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:21.320]  the company no one can read that let me see
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:25.480]  that oh my god that's like cartoon print you know
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:29.240]  like where they had like an electron microscope to read it
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:33.000]  wow and i've got like that's almost like microchip
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:38.440]  etching on right like the microfilm you know you go
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:42.200]  into the microfilm show yeah so we're going to go to calls right now
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:44.840]  Gerald Salete's coming up you're going to be on with us
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:47.080]  third hour tomorrow and i appreciate you coming to town
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:49.640]  and we're going to shoot this special here you know and i joke about all this
[3:01:49.640 --> 3:01:52.520]  because it's making me sick it's making me cry
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:57.400]  this is really going on this is a societal let's hit this thing go to calls
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:00.280]  clearly they know they're doing it clearly it's an agenda they're
[3:02:00.280 --> 3:02:03.160]  intensifying it how the hell do they think they're going to get away with
[3:02:03.160 --> 3:02:07.480]  this well you know i think that they've got control of
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:10.040]  the mainstream media the mainstream media is going to push
[3:02:10.040 --> 3:02:13.160]  what they want them to push and the thing is is that
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:16.600]  the un's been really clear that they want to reduce the population they think
[3:02:16.600 --> 3:02:19.320]  that there's too many useless leaders on the planet
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:23.400]  and this vaccination drive is one of the ways that they're going to lower the
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:26.440]  population if you're dumb enough to do it then i think you deserve it
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:32.280]  right and the only out that they give you is the vaccine thing they always have
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:35.880]  to give you a choice they always have to inform you of what they're going to do
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:39.800]  that's how the black magic works and and so what you see
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:44.440]  is you see a horrible end user license agreement pretty much a vaccine insert
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:48.040]  it's like longer than the itunes end user license agreement and
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:51.160]  they're giving you this saying hey this is what is going to happen so if you
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:55.960]  take it then you had a full consent but now that people are waking up
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:59.800]  they're trying to hide it which means that they are violating their own rules
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:02.680]  well said we'll put that at the very front of this interview and we put it out
[3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:06.360]  of course it's live right now let's go to nicole in new jersey nicole we're going
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:08.680]  to move quick thank you for calling you're awesome on this
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:11.400]  monday edition i'll tell us what happened to you
[3:03:11.400 --> 3:03:16.040]  hi alex hi back um thanks for taking my call thank you for putting this
[3:03:16.040 --> 3:03:19.720]  information out there this is really close to home for me because
[3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:23.960]  i am a year and a week younger than you alex so that'll give you a time frame
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:27.640]  i grew up um having allergic reactions to different
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:31.800]  vaccines and things they weren't closing my fruit but they were hitting my ti
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:34.680]  track making me tired giving me all the bad effects
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:37.560]  so i grew up kind of battling here in new jersey
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:42.760]  excuse me the uh legal system with it they want to cover allergies everything
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:47.960]  guys are saying is totally on point they don't want to make people aware of
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:53.480]  how sick they really can make you and when i hit about 35 my entire immune
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:58.760]  system went and shot down so i um that's the point where i was allergic to
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:03.160]  almost all foods except for about 10 pretty much all
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:06.920]  easy greens and um i stopped taking flu shots when i was
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:11.000]  about 24 so it was crazy my son was the other
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:15.480]  reason i was calling when he was um just turning 13
[3:04:15.480 --> 3:04:18.760]  it was right around the time of the swine flu vaccine
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:22.760]  and his thyroid went off the chart and i almost lost him
[3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:26.760]  he was on concerta and his heart rate shot up
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:31.320]  and his blood pressure dropped so he was on cardiac medicine for a month
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:33.720]  jeez and then thyroid medicine for about two years
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:37.800]  Nicole listen i don't why why have it hurt you so bad i'm not judging you i
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:40.680]  guess they pressured you but when come back i want to ask you
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:44.440]  why did he take the vaccine if you'd already had these responses yourself
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:46.760]  we'll come right back and talk about it because i know they act like it's the
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:49.720]  law it's not another great part of this giant deception
[3:04:49.720 --> 3:04:52.600]  stay with us we'll be back in 60 seconds

[3:07:14.840 --> 3:07:20.120]  mackayla in nebraska wants to talk about a personal story in garter cell which
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:23.080]  that and the hepatitis shot are the most deadly in my experience from research
[3:07:23.080 --> 3:07:26.840]  mackayla go ahead hi alex thanks for taking my call
[3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:30.920]  love your show love your crew i mean you guys just amazing you woke me up my
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:34.840]  husband that's just been awesome you're awesome but um
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:40.680]  my so i'm 23 years old right now and when i was 12 i got the garter cell shot
[3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:45.800]  and shortly after i developed severe severe asthma
[3:07:45.800 --> 3:07:50.520]  and i started fainting just randomly just constantly fainting
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:54.200]  and every time i fainted i was hitting my head getting concussions
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:08:00.360]  and um yeah that's narcolepsy it says on the insert can give you narcolepsy i
[3:08:00.360 --> 3:08:03.080]  mean which which again imagine the newborn babies they're giving them
[3:08:03.080 --> 3:08:08.040]  vaccines and their little heart stop i thought the nurse is on sorry go ahead
[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:11.960]  oh no you're fine um well it took them until i was
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:16.200]  18 years old they decided that i had epilepsy actually instead of narcolepsy
[3:08:16.200 --> 3:08:21.000]  they refused to test me for narcolepsy and i asked them to do that but uh
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:25.160]  so then when i was and if you ever had any problems so you took the garter cell shot
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:28.840]  no none i didn't how fast did they hit you how fast did they
[3:08:28.840 --> 3:08:33.000]  hit you i would say within a month at the most
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:36.520]  because i the lucky people get the first round and get sick but don't go
[3:08:36.520 --> 3:08:40.120]  through the the second third some people get sick right up front but complete
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.760]  the three yeah but um i completed the three and
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:48.600]  that's when i got sick was after the three oh yeah
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:53.800]  so yeah so i got super sick and um but you know god is real and god healed me of
[3:08:53.800 --> 3:08:58.760]  it i have no asthma anymore i have no i don't faint anymore i have um i actually
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:03.800]  had a traumatic brain injury from falling on my head so i mean god is so
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:07.240]  real and he can fix anything and don't get vaccinated
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:11.160]  i mean it's it's real so so what your mother or your father
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:13.720]  watched the news thought they were doing the right things for a little cupcake
[3:09:13.720 --> 3:09:18.040]  took you in and got you the garter cell huh yeah well my mom she remembers
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:22.360]  distinctly they had those commercials um that were you know
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:25.400]  fear mongering pretty much saying if you don't get your child back to me with
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:29.000]  htv that they're gonna get cancer this was 15 years
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:34.920]  ago so so how old are you right now are you like 27 i'm 23
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:41.640]  wow yeah and we just uh my husband and i we just had our first child and
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:46.440]  we did not get him vaccinated with nothing and it was hard i mean everybody's
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:50.200]  been so rude to us about it and you know you really got to stand your ground
[3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:54.040]  because they will they'll try and force it on you
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:09:57.080]  but here's a little secret those nurses are all when they're supposed to take
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:00.600]  the shots every year the the the hepatitis the flu shot they're all
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:03.880]  squirting them in the trash cans nobody takes them
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:08.040]  i mean i even worked for a medical thing when i was in college for a year
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:10.840]  i'll leave it at that man they said no i'm never take this hepatitis shot you
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:13.800]  put it in the trash wow yeah i didn't take it
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:17.240]  trash can it's for you and the nurse he was a guy made a joke he goes
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.440]  and i always take this effing crap i want to live everybody knows yeah
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:26.760]  because they live around it man you take that stuff every year you're dead
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:31.000]  i was a large animal vet he said yeah the government mandates but nobody really
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.720]  gives it the i'm not going to get into it all the point is
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:38.680]  is that everybody knows those big beef production facilities
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:42.440]  they want their cows to be around they don't follow what they're supposed to
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:46.440]  anyways go ahead ma'am oh i also just wanted to say

[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:55.240]  energy and i just i feel amazing with it and i

[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:13.640]  your team and everybody there well mikaela we're all in this together and
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:16.840]  that's an understatement literally they're trying to silence us
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:20.120]  particularly but they want everyone's silence so that as we go from one in
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:23.320]  35 000 to one in 55 right now it's gonna be like
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:26.280]  one in 10 they're saying within about 15 years
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:29.320]  they don't want anyone saying hey it's this they're doing it to us they want
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:32.920]  to just slowly brain damage us till we don't know what it is but you're not a
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:37.480]  doctor you're not a doctor alex stop
[3:11:37.480 --> 3:11:42.120]  drawing all these conclusions it'd be like if somebody ran you over with a car
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:45.400]  and you go cause of death they were you have a hicular homicide they go
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:48.760]  you're not a doctor you see the car run them over
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:53.800]  weather guts everywhere god bless you ma'am yeah mikaela warn everybody you
[3:11:53.800 --> 3:11:56.920]  can not just this show warn everybody my
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:11:59.560]  children all the time they don't do it anymore they go dad please don't at
[3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:02.600]  grocery stores at the at the mall i'll see a pregnant
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:06.520]  woman with her husband i walk right over and i say listen i'm alex
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:09.560]  jones and i want you to read those inserts not the fact sheets i care about
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:12.520]  you most time i go i've heard of you yeah we're already having a debate about
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:15.720]  that my mom says i should take it but most of the time they already knows the
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:19.560]  goodness you know i was talking about you like half of austin doesn't vaccinate
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:22.120]  really they'll act like it's dirty if you don't do it yeah
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:25.560]  wow by the way alex is always like this this isn't an act
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:29.800]  i've seen alex like off camera he's exactly like he is right now that's
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:33.320]  you worse you're actually worse see he's toning it down right now
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:36.360]  on camera well you know when you know there's a scientific dictatorship
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:38.680]  trying to kill everybody you kind of get pissed as an alpha male
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:42.680]  you know i mean you know i really really the response to this is to go after
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:44.760]  these people physically but i don't want to do that yet because i'll turn it
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:48.360]  against us i want to just have them stop it i have no desire
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:51.640]  you know just let these people's throats i mean if you don't tell them you
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:55.480]  feel like you're not doing the right thing right like you see someone and
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:12:58.440]  you're like i got to give them this information and then it's up to them
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:01.320]  whether they want to accept it or whether they don't
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:05.240]  absolutely and i see all i mean you see most kids you can tell when the parents
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:08.120]  are really medical they're so dull eyed and the kids like three years old bumping
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:10.760]  and things down and you know you see the vaccine look
[3:13:10.760 --> 3:13:14.680]  down and or you see the poor mom trying to control her kids and like you know two of
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:17.160]  the boys are autistic and they're like screaming and yelling in the hall you
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:20.520]  know at the at the mall and you want to and i'll walk over and say
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:24.280]  hey i see you're pregnant again and they'll usually i know third 18 months
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:26.600]  gave them the third round of shots they're both autistic believe me i've
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:29.400]  learned with two body i got a lawsuit in right now
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:33.800]  i've had the moms like they already know
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:40.360]  yeah like they're not getting my third kid yeah i mean this is america folks
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:43.880]  i almost feel like they're trying to get rid of the firstborns like it's some
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:46.600]  sort of ancient thing that they're bringing back with it like
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:48.920]  you know it's like the firstborns going to get
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:52.680]  the the bulk of the vaccines and then the parents like wise up and then
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:56.680]  their second third child are going to get you know spared perhaps but the
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:13:59.640]  first one's going to get the brunt because they're just trying to do what's
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:03.720]  best for the kid they trust their doctor the doctor's supposed to say
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:07.640]  x or he doesn't get paid and so they follow the advice and
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:12.920]  then their first kid gets hit with these problems you know and it's it's
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:15.720]  well you said it's really deep because if you study all this they've proven
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:18.360]  kind of like the monarch butterfly has three
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:21.720]  rounds to get to canada and then they create the super one that comes back
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:25.320]  so you fly the way back down to mexico and then they've studied especially
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:27.560]  in humans but a lot of higher order mammals
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:31.640]  something happens with the with the firstborn more genetic memory somehow
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:36.360]  where the zygote forms is passed and but that i guess what the genetics works
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:39.400]  they don't want too many people however it's set up to have all the genetic
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:41.320]  memory because i guess that creates too many leaders
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:44.680]  so the firstborn supposedly you know statistically a leader and they want to
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:48.280]  knock that's why every ancient culture when it enslaved a group would demand
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:51.480]  the firstborn be killed male because they don't want those around
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:54.760]  yeah and i because that's a memory of genetic memory especially i saw this one
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:58.280]  study saying that the firstborn children are statistically smarter
[3:14:58.280 --> 3:15:02.600]  than the rest of the children that's why every astronaut uh was firstborn
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:05.240]  i didn't know that all the quarterbacks for firstborn
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:09.400]  all the other top ones it's it's fact yeah not putting down secondborn and
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:11.560]  of course you're going to see secondborn others surpass firstborn because
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:14.440]  like you just said statistically people aren't giving their next kids as many
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:17.160]  shots because they find out you know yeah you know
[3:15:17.160 --> 3:15:21.720]  oh my god it's so evil and look at all these the callers we've got a zack we've
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:25.160]  got taylor we've got jamie we've got johnny we've got chris we've got dug and

[3:17:52.440 --> 3:17:57.400]  the last few days i've been online looking for the speech
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:17:59.800]  i actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:03.320]  many years ago and i've found a few places where it's mentioned but
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:06.680]  if you can find it please send it to showtipstemfullwords.com and he talked
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:09.320]  about in the darkest hours at the beginning of world war two
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:12.840]  the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to
[3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:16.120]  stand up and fight early on and we're sure to victory then there was a second
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:19.800]  point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:23.000]  are pretty steep there's a third time
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:26.600]  when you know you're gonna lose but you have to fight because
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:30.360]  being enslaved and being slowly killed is much much worse that's a paraphrase
[3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:34.440]  but ladies and gentlemen we are in the position now of being able to win this
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:38.680]  easily if we find our spirit find our focus and don't give up and take action
[3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:42.360]  but if we don't stand up and get involved we're going to skip number two
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:47.080]  and go right to number three that's a fact they fear info wars because we are
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:52.360]  alive it's time for the world to awaken and take back our future

[3:20:54.440 --> 3:21:02.040]  trends going on around the world and in just a couple of weeks this will be my 40th year
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:10.120]  of trend forecasting that's when i began the trends research institute actually it was first
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:19.560]  named the socio-economic research institute of america the reason being is back then in 1980
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:27.720]  when you said when i told people i forecast trends they would say oh uh music trends fashion trends
[3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:34.920]  that was it i was as far as people could think so i had to use the socio-economic
[3:21:34.920 --> 3:21:41.640]  research institute we didn't change it to the doing business ads trends research institute
[3:21:41.640 --> 3:21:47.880]  until the 90s and then people started realizing that you can start looking ahead and see what's
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:55.720]  going on so when i talk about the prince of peace and what's going on let's take a trip around the
[3:21:55.720 --> 3:22:05.160]  world start in hong kong another violent weekend how about over there in france uh a strike going on
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:09.160]  most of the metros are closed down
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:19.400]  it's going on now for the 12th day people aren't backing down they want to change the pension
[3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:27.160]  laws but it also began to build last year around november when the yellow vests took to the streets
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:33.880]  because they were raising petrol taxes raising petrol taxes hey isn't that what just happened
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:39.480]  over there in oran when they raised the price of oil oh the people took to the streets there too
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:47.160]  didn't they how about down there in uh ecuador oh yeah people took to the streets when they rose
[3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:52.600]  raised the price of petrol down there too just a couple of months ago forced the government to
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:23:04.440]  backtrack what's going on in shillay oh people protesting violence going on between looting
[3:23:04.440 --> 3:23:11.000]  and the police killing and torturing and raping according to
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:21.800]  different kinds of peace groups and un groups what's that about same thing basically
[3:23:22.760 --> 3:23:27.240]  the one percent having everything the governments in business to help the elites
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:33.240]  well everybody else has nothing and you know what i say when people lose everything and have
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:38.920]  nothing left to lose they lose it and then we could go to bolivia and we could go to columbia
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:45.880]  and we could go to peru how about venezuela oh yeah wonderful what's going on over there
[3:23:46.760 --> 3:23:56.520]  inflation into numbers that are unimaginable argentina same thing where they have a 57
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:24:05.480]  percent inflation rate go around the world lebanon took to the streets again this weekend
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:12.840]  the same thing people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:20.120]  zimbabwe cameroon south africa
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:39.480]  guinea name the countries war demonstrations riots strikes over misery corruption poverty
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:51.080]  violence it's christmas time time to celebrate the birth of the prince of peace
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:57.640]  and i gerald selenity and a warrior for the prince of peace
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:08.760]  peace will you fight for war i should say will you die for war or you fight for peace
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:15.800]  will you have your children go die for war or will you fight for peace
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:26.520]  i say this because as a trend forecaster and again you don't always get it right all the time
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:33.320]  only human but i'll put my track record up against anybody's bring out your books trend
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:40.120]  tracking trends 2000 the trends journal show me your documented trend forecasts and then we could
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:46.360]  have a discussion oh you got that you said the markets are going to go down yeah i didn't know
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:52.600]  about zero negative interest rate policy quantitative easing and now pumping in almost four trillion
[3:25:52.600 --> 3:25:59.080]  dollars into the repo markets to keep the markets boosting so yeah you get it wrong
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:05.000]  but i could see what's coming and when i see coming is world war three
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:14.600]  doesn't happen in any assassinated the archduke void man and that's what began world war one
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:25.160]  it says a right now book yeah right would they bomb pearl harbor yeah i got it things led up to it
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:33.080]  and by the way anybody even without a moronic education system in the united states and i
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:38.280]  say moronic and i just don't throw that word out there loosely because when you look at the
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:43.480]  organization of economic cooperation the development study that just came out last week all the money
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:48.840]  we spent on education spent more of it just not any other country we don't even win places show
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:55.320]  compared to other countries but going back everyone knows that read a little bit of history
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:27:00.680]  that if you read about the agreement the treaty of Versailles after world war one
[3:27:00.680 --> 3:27:06.840]  was very clear that world war two would follow considering what the allied forces of the day
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:15.240]  did to the germans they set the stage for it they set the stage for Hitler we are on the cusp
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:20.680]  of the beginning of world war three you just saw the announcement that came out or maybe the
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:26.600]  united states since may has put 14 000 more troops into the middle east particularly
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:36.040]  saudi arabia ratcheting up the war against iran just last week they put more sanctions on iran
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:47.800]  these sanctions are economic warfare i'm mentioning this because it's christmas time
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:53.160]  the celebration of the prince of peace so please do what you can
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:28:04.360]  and to support info wars and of course my movement occupy peace occupy peace dot com

[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:19.080]  this is seattle liberal seattle at the time but of course what they did is they had a
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:25.800]  couple of agents provocateurs hundreds of thousands of people protesting smashing windows like in
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:32.600]  starbucks and setting a car on fire some something like that and that's all they focused on and then
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:46.680]  that quashed the rebellion so china has gone from five percent of its people being middle class back
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:59.480]  then to now over 35 percent china has a hundred million more middle class people which they consider
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:08.520]  middle class by their standards and america has entirely as a nation they got they got like 450
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:15.000]  million people at a middle class what do we got 325 million people in the entire country here
[3:36:16.360 --> 3:36:23.160]  you watch what's going on in china they're saying that the 21st century is going to be the asian
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:30.040]  decade and china is going to be the leader and you know what i say the business of america is war
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:37.000]  the business of china's business but their belt belt and road initiative
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:43.800]  doing all these deals with all these countries you know yeah they got to pay for what they're
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:50.200]  doing these building these bridges and these roads and this fast rail oh they're going to go in debt
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:55.160]  oh yeah they're going to go in debt like how about all the countries that go in debt with the
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:37:04.120]  international mafia uh excuse me monetary fund they don't get anything people get it people get
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:10.360]  shifted i'm going to raise your taxes raise your retirement age till after you die take away your

[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:27.240]  top trends shaping 2020 and put our list out last week was on with alec johnson while talking about
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:34.120]  him didn't get through all of them but i want to stand on the war front right now because last week
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:47.160]  the u.s approved a record military spending bill 738 billion dollars as our country is rotting
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:54.520]  we got homeless people all over the place can't secure the borders but
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:37:59.640]  they could keep that military industrial complex going and killing
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:10.840]  only 41 democrats voted against it there are no liberals in this country anymore is what they
[3:38:10.840 --> 3:38:22.280]  used to call themselves is war mongers yep there was a report that came out last week
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:31.560]  that's out of the news that my friends who are pretty in tune with things to some extent
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:43.320]  and never heard of it was a front page story in the new york times the paper of record or as i
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:54.440]  finally call it the turlet paper a record public was duped on afghan war claims of progress
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:39:03.400]  hid bleak assessments in other words they lied to us as they continue to lie general this and that
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:15.320]  they're lying murderers you got it the facts in here washington post story some 2000 pages
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:26.760]  coming from generals and troops i will read you one of them even as the taliban returned in
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:34.120]  greater numbers and troops on the ground voiced concerns about the america's strategy growing
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:43.000]  shortcomings senior american officials almost always said that progress was being made
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:55.400]  made senior american official liars senior american officials scum senior american pathological liars
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:09.560]  senior american murderers at the asian oh don't get upset salenti calm down learn how to be a pathological
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:18.760]  liar and boy do i know pathological liars i know one firsthand yep talk about that some other time
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:26.120]  a piece of slime pathological liars are great at what they do they become politicians as well
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:30.760]  you know they promised us they were going to do this but when they got elected they didn't carry
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:41.640]  through because they're pathological liars anyway the document outlined by the post showed otherwise
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:50.280]  quote we would devoid of fundamental understanding of afghanistan we didn't know what we were doing
[3:40:50.920 --> 3:40:56.040]  now who would say something like that they didn't know what they were doing admitted
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:58.040]  did
[3:40:59.880 --> 3:41:06.360]  douglas loot a three-star army general
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:15.800]  this is a guy at the top saying they didn't know what they were doing while the officials scum
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:28.280]  in washington under the bush under the obama and under the trump administrations keep lying to us
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:38.520]  what we would try what what are we trying to do here he told the government interviewers
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:52.520]  us we didn't have the foggiest notion of what we were undertaking the two thousand pages of
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:42:01.560]  interviews were obtained through the freedom of information act request and years of legal back
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:08.760]  and forth with the special inspector general for afghanistan they wouldn't give it to him
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:15.720]  three years oh we're americans we have freedom yeah freedom of what
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:22.600]  like the central banksters they hold back their reports after five years
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:32.280]  this is murder in the first degree we don't have a clue what's going on over there but you

[3:49:17.880 --> 3:49:23.880]  instead of they come back they feel like they have something because we see the suicide rates of
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:32.600]  the veterans it's over 20 a day you know when they had the wars going like the vietnam war you get

[3:49:40.200 --> 3:49:48.200]  afghan war is and what it's doing to destroy people matter of fact a soldier in that was an
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:56.440]  afghan war in australia they just found a young man he's dead now he was speaking out against
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:03.000]  the atrocities that were being committed by the soldiers there has just reported that he tragically
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:12.360]  died we have to stop this we will not elevate to a higher society in a state of war so again do
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:21.800]  you can to support info wars and occupy peace and as i said in the final segment here i want to
[3:50:21.800 --> 3:50:29.800]  talk about some of the top trends for 2020 you know the home builders came out today they are very
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:39.480]  excited they're looking for home sales to boost and new people buying new homes in 2020 well it'll
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:47.240]  be okay for a while because they're going to lower interest rates as my forecast to zero to negative
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:53.560]  by this time next year to boost up the slowing economy i just read to you what retail sales
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:51:00.200]  are doing they're not doing good whole home is the words that they use in the wall street journal
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:08.680]  the sales are slow economies are not that strong when you look at the jobs that are created where
[3:51:08.680 --> 3:51:14.600]  they're coming from the hospitality sector they don't make them a lot of money doing that or in
[3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:22.520]  health care so the boost the economy they're going to lower interest rates so we're saying real
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:32.520]  estate is peaked pick up a little more but it's peaked as for the equity markets as long as the
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:39.800]  federal reserve we've pushed it in more cheap dough to let the gamblers who are addicted and by
[3:51:39.800 --> 3:51:48.440]  the way if you know a lot of these wall street cats man yeah is one of their trips man and other
[3:51:48.440 --> 3:51:57.720]  stuff these cats get high their addicts the gambling addicts plus others they got to keep
[3:51:57.720 --> 3:52:10.520]  to have it going not all of them of course but there is a crew of them so the markets my forecast
[3:52:10.520 --> 3:52:17.640]  is there near the peak as well as real estate one of the other trends that we're looking at we call
[3:52:17.640 --> 3:52:26.520]  it high tech heroin they're coming out with this five g technology they're going to be cell towers
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:37.320]  on telephone poles on lamp posts on rooftops all around your neighborhood and throughout your city
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:45.400]  we've done extensive research we haven't done extensive research i say we have analyzed
[3:52:45.400 --> 3:52:52.520]  extensive research the people in the trends journal that are specialists in that field
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:53:02.760]  the science field and there is ample evidence of the deadliness of radio frequency radiation five g
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:12.280]  as well as what people call smartphones i call stupid phones i don't carry one won't carry one
[3:53:12.280 --> 3:53:18.760]  did work for the cellular telecommunications industry association going back to the 90s the
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:25.960]  early 90s when they had these boxes in the back of trunks in the trunk of your car with an aerial
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:32.280]  shooting out so i've been following it since then and i know the studies that have come out showing
[3:53:32.280 --> 3:53:41.480]  the dangers of this high tech heroin you're seeing sperm counts fall you're seeing cancer rates go up
[3:53:42.280 --> 3:53:47.720]  the facts are there well it causes cancer and rats doesn't mean it's going to cause cancer in
[3:53:47.720 --> 3:53:57.320]  peoples they were saying back several years ago not to let children use these things because
[3:53:57.320 --> 3:54:05.000]  their brain shield is thinner as you grow older it gets thicker so now the radio frequency
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:15.160]  radiations go in deeper with children so high tech heroin is another one of our top trends for 2020
[3:54:15.160 --> 3:54:24.920]  along with the roaring 2020s people want to have a good time this is dullsville man
[3:54:25.880 --> 3:54:36.520]  everybody's so uptight don't get loose be tight oh by the way politically correct is an oxymoron
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:42.360]  and you have to be a moron to believe politically correct because when you look up the definition
[3:54:42.360 --> 3:54:49.080]  of politician it's someone who's manipulative and devious typically to gain advancement within
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:56.120]  an organization so there can't be anything correct about politically correct so this is the time
[3:54:56.120 --> 3:55:03.000]  to boogie to let loose the entrepeneurs that see this and start creating sound style
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:11.160]  features atmospheres that make people feel good feel loose and feel respectful to one another
[3:55:11.160 --> 3:55:22.120]  that is going to be the roaring 2020s as well as elegance because in 2021 this thing's going down
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:31.240]  look i know billionaires i know a lot of rich people not a lot a lot but i run into them from
[3:55:31.240 --> 3:55:40.760]  time to time and they know it too they know the game is going to be over so before the game is over
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:46.680]  you want to raise yourself to the highest levels you can be spiritually emotionally physically
[3:55:47.720 --> 3:55:53.560]  in style grace and elegance bring it to the higher level go back to the 1930s the great
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:56:00.360]  depression swing time hottest music america ever knew i have a photograph of my parents made
[3:56:00.360 --> 3:56:07.320]  their souls rest in peace immigrant class of people talliano dressed to the nines in their
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:17.160]  wedding picture 1934 gowns like you don't see today they worked in factories they were laborers
[3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:19.240]  worked at fish stores grocery store
