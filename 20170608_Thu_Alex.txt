[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:13.480 --> 00:20.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they say in the Bible, in the end days, people will run to
[00:20.440 --> 00:27.240]  and fro frantically, and the time will speed up, and it kind of feels like that right now.
[00:27.240 --> 00:31.680]  We've got David Knight in the other studio, he's been on the last hour, two hours with
[00:31.680 --> 00:37.360]  live coverage of the historic Comey testimony, and I've got both the Nightly News crew and
[00:37.360 --> 00:44.180]  the radio crew in here frantically scrambling and doing an incredible job grabbing bombshell
[00:44.180 --> 00:49.760]  clip after bombshell clip after bombshell clip, and most of the mainstream media is
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.040]  actually ignoring these bombshells, but Donald Trump, Jr., that Matt Drudge is linked to
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.840]  and that we're linked to, is tweeting basically what we're saying in live time, but not because
[00:59.840 --> 01:00.840]  he's watching us.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.920]  He has sent some of our tweets out.
[01:02.920 --> 01:05.780]  It's because the same thing's happening.
[01:05.780 --> 01:09.480]  As I'm sitting there writing the tweets, trying to get ready for the show, but I can't even
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.080]  get ready because I'm watching the hearing, I tweet out, did you just see what Comey said?
[01:15.080 --> 01:19.360]  He says he gave his friends the memos to give to the press.
[01:19.360 --> 01:24.200]  He just admitted he's one of the main leakers, incredible bombshell.
[01:24.200 --> 01:28.840]  We are exporting that clip off C-SPAM, and I walked in here two minutes ago.
[01:28.840 --> 01:31.960]  It was on the computer exporting over so we can play it for you.
[01:31.960 --> 01:35.040]  We don't have the big giant, you know, instant replay studios.
[01:35.040 --> 01:43.160]  Then, about 40 minutes ago, the even bigger bombshell, he totally, absolutely, completely
[01:43.160 --> 01:47.200]  admitted that he committed perjury to Congress.
[01:47.200 --> 01:48.720]  He said, I have been influenced.
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.280]  They have tried to influence me, going back to his memo in February, when two months later
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.280]  on May 3rd, he says, no one ever tried to influence me.
[01:59.280 --> 02:00.280]  This is incredible.
[02:00.280 --> 02:08.200]  Now, if you want to hear and see the feed without, you know, the radio show or the ads,
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.400]  we've got live, continual coverage right into the next hour when they then go into a closed
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.920]  session in the Senate of the hearing with David Knight.
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.280]  InfoWars.com, forward slash show, a lot of our stations grab our feeds.
[02:20.280 --> 02:23.480]  If our stations want to get the feed there with limited commentary during breaks with
[02:23.480 --> 02:26.800]  David Knight, what a great job, that feed is there for you.
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.520]  If radio listeners and TV viewers want to see the David Knight feed, infowars.com forward
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.680]  slash show, the front page of infowars.com, you can see our live feed, Facebook, Twitter,
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.400]  Google, YouTube, you name it, we've got all those feeds up there right now, and coming
[02:41.400 --> 02:46.240]  back to the next segment, I'm gonna go to some of the live feed, and I'll tell you why.
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.160]  You want to probably hear it, some of you, but also, I have got to get in that control
[02:50.160 --> 02:56.000]  room because there are like 11 clips that I was sweating over just in the last hour
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.160]  looking at these clips.
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.040]  I mean, this is insane, and we've got to get these on Twitter.
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.440]  We've got to get these up on YouTube so you can spread them fast.
[03:05.440 --> 03:10.360]  Infowars.com is going to have that front page war room in the next hour with Rob Dew and
[03:10.360 --> 03:17.600]  Michael Zimmerman and Travis Knight and everybody else in there grabbing these clips out while
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.720]  they run these two live TV slash radio shows.
[03:21.720 --> 03:23.960]  That's why we've got to grow the crew here at Infowars.
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.520]  That's why your sponsorship and support is more important than ever, like Superblue.
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.600]  Now in a better tube, higher quality, I mean, it was already a great tube, but a new better
[03:34.600 --> 03:43.120]  tube, fluoride free, it's got the colloidal silver, it's got the iodide in it, it's got
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.240]  the peppermint, the tea tree oil, it's amazing, and now back in stock with a tube I picked
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.200]  that I think is a better tube, softer tube, a little bit larger diameter port on it so
[03:53.200 --> 03:54.760]  you can get more of the toothpaste out.
[03:54.760 --> 03:58.280]  It is concentrated toothpaste, ladies and gentlemen, no fillers, Superblue fluoride
[03:58.280 --> 04:04.520]  free toothpaste bringing you this live coverage and analysis and the multiple feeds at Infowars.com.
[04:04.520 --> 04:11.280]  The syndicated radio, the TV, and so much more, 1,358 reviews, 4.8 stars, my power
[04:11.280 --> 04:19.520]  reviews, third party site, Superblue fluoride free toothpaste, now 33% off at Infowarsstore.com
[04:19.520 --> 04:26.720]  or Infowarslife.com or Caltol-free-888-253-3139 and we are trying to hire a lot of new people,
[04:26.720 --> 04:30.920]  we're getting new engineers, new switchers, new editors, new, you know, more reporters,
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.960]  we are really trying to expand the face of the globalists because so much news is coming
[04:34.960 --> 04:41.840]  out, so much is unfolding, but when we return, when we return, the live coverage feed and
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.760]  then Kit Dales has got the article going up as we speak, he already found the video but
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.840]  he had to link to it in a larger clip where we're getting the clips up ourselves of him
[04:51.840 --> 05:01.080]  perjuring himself and admitting he's the leaker, unbelievable.
[05:01.080 --> 05:11.040]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book and it's about 13 historical women who
[05:11.040 --> 05:15.680]  pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.720]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant
[05:20.720 --> 05:27.640]  idea of asking her to sign the book titled She Persisted for Juanita Broderick, who as
[05:27.640 --> 05:33.680]  we all know was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[05:33.680 --> 05:38.440]  Can you sign up for my friend Juanita Broderick because she's been silenced by your parents,
[05:38.440 --> 05:42.840]  especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist, can you sign up for her?
[05:42.840 --> 05:49.720]  Naturally Chelsea refused to sign the book but her reaction was priceless and you can
[05:49.720 --> 05:54.480]  watch the video in its entirety right now at Infowars.com.
[06:19.720 --> 06:24.600]  Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers,
[06:24.600 --> 06:28.880]  your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[06:28.880 --> 06:33.880]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[06:33.880 --> 06:36.840]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[06:36.840 --> 06:39.080]  The general public doesn't.
[06:39.080 --> 06:43.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[06:43.040 --> 06:46.640]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[06:46.640 --> 06:50.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[06:50.200 --> 06:53.400]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[06:53.400 --> 06:59.240]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:59.240 --> 07:04.480]  The reason Infowars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[07:04.480 --> 07:05.920]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[07:05.920 --> 07:06.920]  I take this.
[07:06.920 --> 07:10.800]  My family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.320]  information you're going to find anywhere.
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.880]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.440]  If I ever forget to take them, like I'm having noticeable difference.
[07:21.440 --> 07:22.640]  I don't feel good.
[07:22.640 --> 07:26.280]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[07:26.280 --> 07:29.040]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[07:29.040 --> 07:35.120]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[07:35.120 --> 07:37.880]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.440]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[07:41.440 --> 07:43.560]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.560]  I love it.
[07:44.560 --> 07:47.280]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.280]  Survival Shield X2.
[07:48.280 --> 07:51.640]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[07:51.640 --> 07:55.880]  iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[07:55.880 --> 08:16.720]  So win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[08:16.720 --> 08:23.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:23.320 --> 08:26.320]  Alex Jones.
[08:26.320 --> 08:29.680]  All right, folks.
[08:29.680 --> 08:34.800]  We have got two different live transmissions going on right now and I'm going to cut over
[08:34.800 --> 08:40.160]  the live coverage of Comey that David Knight is hosting during the breaks here in just
[08:40.160 --> 08:41.160]  a moment.
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.640]  We have Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas questioning the former FBI Director James Comey right
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.640]  now.
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.320]  Now I'm going to go here in just a minute or two to the live feed.
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.600]  If you want a total uninterrupted commercial free feed, it's at Infowars.com.
[08:54.600 --> 08:58.120]  Our stations out there and other folks are welcome to pick that feed up that has limited
[08:58.120 --> 08:59.680]  commentary with David Knight.
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.240]  When I go to breaks today, you can also tune over to that feed if you'd like as well.
[09:04.240 --> 09:07.320]  Both feeds are on the front page of Infowars.com.
[09:07.320 --> 09:10.280]  This is the live syndicated radio slash TV broadcast.
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.280]  This is Infowars Live.
[09:11.280 --> 09:13.200]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.400]  Now when we play 10, 15 minutes of this, I'm going to come back because we've got a big
[09:19.400 --> 09:23.560]  raft of clips and our great crew on the TV side and the radio side have got all their
[09:23.560 --> 09:24.560]  own clips.
[09:24.560 --> 09:31.160]  We're going to come back and play first off two bombshell clips that should be top headlines
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.160]  everywhere.
[09:32.160 --> 09:33.520]  It came out of Comey's mouth.
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.920]  It's completely clear and the only people that get it are Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.000]  that I've seen so far and of course Donald Trump Jr. is getting it and tweeting in live
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  time exactly what we're seeing.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.800]  I've been tweeting on my Twitter at Real Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:50.800 --> 09:56.640]  About 45 minutes ago, Comey said that the president did order him and did try to basically
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.760]  influence him, something he said no one had ever tried to get him to do, but now he's
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.080]  spinning it semantically.
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.320]  But it's clearly perjury one way or the other because he said May 3rd back from the February
[10:07.320 --> 10:10.520]  meetings that that had never happened, okay?
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.840]  Now that's one big issue.
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.680]  One bigger is he said he gave memos to friends to give them to the press.
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.000]  I can't believe he said it.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.120]  I saw him say it and almost had a heart attack.
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.120]  So again, we've got all these live feeds going.
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.200]  We have to then go into the feed that we're archiving live time, grab it out and then
[10:31.200 --> 10:33.280]  put it into the live feed back.
[10:33.280 --> 10:38.040]  So right now I'm going to fade over to the other studio where David Knight is with live
[10:38.040 --> 10:44.360]  coverage with the live feed, but this is amazing.
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.360]  Here just got it.
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.680]  See James Comey admits leaking his Trump memos to the press.
[10:48.680 --> 10:54.280]  This is incredible, but we've got the other incredible headline going up right now at
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.320]  infowars.com that Comey committed perjury and the same article we're going to have the
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.320]  sub headline and he admits he leaked memos to the press.
[11:02.320 --> 11:04.000]  That is so illegal.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.360]  That is such a national security violation.
[11:06.360 --> 11:09.520]  That is so unbelievable.
[11:09.520 --> 11:12.000]  Confirm Comey committed perjury to Congress.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.480]  New York Times debunked.
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.480]  Trump didn't directly order end of Flynn investigation.
[11:17.480 --> 11:24.720]  That's powerful that in the same article we have the video as well where he admits that
[11:24.720 --> 11:27.880]  he gave it to the press.
[11:27.880 --> 11:33.880]  In fact, here is the leaked memo clip now, then I'll go to the live feed.
[11:33.880 --> 11:34.880]  Here's the clip.
[11:34.880 --> 11:39.520]  President tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes.
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.480]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.840]  that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape and my
[11:47.840 --> 11:51.760]  judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square and so I asked a friend
[11:51.760 --> 11:57.040]  of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, didn't do it myself for a
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.880]  variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.120]  of a special counsel and so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.000]  And was that after firing?
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.560]  No, no.
[12:07.560 --> 12:08.560]  Who was that?
[12:08.560 --> 12:13.680]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[12:13.680 --> 12:16.040]  That is so over the top sensational.
[12:16.040 --> 12:17.400]  I don't even know what to say.
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.400]  That is so illegal.
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.360]  And of course it came out at the time that Trump thought it was coming and when Trump
[12:24.360 --> 12:30.160]  was saying give me loyalty, he meant stop leaking national security information.
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.640]  The FBI director committing crimes with the media and he comes out and admits another
[12:35.640 --> 12:41.400]  clip we've got coming up that Loretta Lynch did try to tell him to leave Hillary alone
[12:41.400 --> 12:43.960]  on the emails and he did.
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.280]  He did close the investigation and she did go on that airplane with William Jefferson
[12:48.280 --> 12:50.240]  Clinton, former president of the United States.
[12:50.240 --> 12:55.920]  I mean, the crimes they are committing in front of everyone I've never heard or seen
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.440]  anything like this and he's doing it in a confidence game because he knows it's all
[12:59.440 --> 13:00.440]  coming out.
[13:00.440 --> 13:04.680]  He's saying it all to act like, yeah, I strangled my wife and buried her in the backyard.
[13:04.680 --> 13:05.680]  Good deal.
[13:05.680 --> 13:06.680]  Everybody does it.
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.480]  So let's go to the live feed with David Knight covering it and I'm going to come back with
[13:11.480 --> 13:13.480]  the other clips.
[13:13.480 --> 13:15.620]  This has reeked from the beginning.
[13:15.620 --> 13:22.520]  This has stunk to high heaven and I am definitely hit peak point in my life in media covering
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.520]  stuff.
[13:23.520 --> 13:24.520]  I've never seen anything.
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.040]  This is so bonkers.
[13:26.040 --> 13:31.360]  This is so over the top because the media is going to act like Trump did something.
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.160]  Folks, this is so illegal.
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.760]  Let's go back ladies and gentlemen of the live feed.
[13:39.760 --> 13:41.960]  It's possible, but I don't remember any.
[13:41.960 --> 13:46.640]  Do you know if the attorney general was involved, in fact, involved in any aspect of the Russia
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.440]  investigation after his recusal on the 2nd of March?
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.440]  I don't.
[13:52.440 --> 13:55.120]  I would assume not, but let me say it this way.
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.080]  I don't know of any information that would lead me to believe he did something to touch
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.840]  the Russian investigation after the recusal.
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.840]  In your written testimony, you indicate that you...
[14:05.840 --> 14:07.840]  Again, this is Kamala Harris.
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.080]  She's a newly elected Democrat senator.
[14:10.080 --> 14:11.080]  She is trying to...
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.840]  First, she did a series of events saying, well, are you aware of this or this or this?
[14:14.840 --> 14:17.400]  And of course, he can't comment on any specifics of the investigation.
[14:17.400 --> 14:23.120]  So they can throw out any kind of unsubstantiated innuendo or allegation and he'll have to say,
[14:23.120 --> 14:24.320]  well, I can't comment on that.
[14:24.320 --> 14:26.320]  So it sounds like they are true.
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.240]  Then she comes after attorney general's sessions.
[14:29.240 --> 14:30.360]  When did he recuse himself?
[14:30.360 --> 14:32.400]  Did he have anything to do with his firing?
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.680]  And yet he's saying that, no, I don't see anything with that.
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.520]  I don't see anything that was political in my firing, with the exception of one point
[14:40.520 --> 14:44.520]  in which he seemed to contradict himself, which he did contradict himself in his sworn
[14:44.520 --> 14:48.840]  testimony earlier, that there was no attempt to shut down the investigation for political
[14:48.840 --> 14:49.840]  purposes.
[14:49.840 --> 14:52.880]  But I don't have a clear recollection of that.
[14:52.880 --> 14:55.360]  He didn't say anything.
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.200]  And on that same February 14th meeting, you said you understood the president to be requesting
[15:00.200 --> 15:01.760]  that you drop the investigation.
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.520]  After that meeting, however, you received two calls from the president March 30th and
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.280]  April 11th, where the president talked about a cloud over his presidency.
[15:10.280 --> 15:14.240]  Has anything you've learned in the months since your February 14th meeting changed your
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.440]  understanding of the president's request?
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.280]  I guess it would be what he has said in public documents or public interviews?
[15:21.280 --> 15:22.280]  Correct.
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.920]  And again, what he had said before was they said, he said, I hope that nothing is going
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.760]  to happen with Flynn.
[15:30.760 --> 15:33.720]  And that was a day after Flynn had been fired.
[15:33.720 --> 15:38.240]  And then a Democrat senator talking to him said, well, that's all he said.
[15:38.240 --> 15:43.160]  But the body language made it clear that he really wanted you to shut this down for political
[15:43.160 --> 15:44.160]  purposes.
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.160]  Oh, yes, oh, yes.
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.680]  So he has contradicted himself and his sworn testimony that there was never any pressure
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.280]  put on him to try to shut down this investigation for political purposes.
[15:54.280 --> 15:58.440]  He said, yes, people have told us to shut down investigations because they weren't productive,
[15:58.440 --> 16:00.520]  but not for political purposes.
[16:00.520 --> 16:03.000]  And then he contradicts himself today.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.960]  So he's, it's very interesting how this is going to go.
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.360]  He was walking a very thin line as he was doing that.
[16:08.360 --> 16:11.840]  But of course, we've also learned that he was leaking information to the New York Times
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.200]  and he has shut down as false New York Times stories.
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.680]  So we've had very interesting developments here regarding the fake news from the New
[16:21.680 --> 16:22.680]  York Times.
[16:22.680 --> 16:23.680]  I'm David Knight here.
[16:23.680 --> 16:26.360]  This is our live coverage of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
[16:26.360 --> 16:32.680]  This is James Comey in his coup attempt against Donald Trump, the coup attempt that is joined
[16:32.680 --> 16:35.600]  by the mainstream media and the Washington Establishment.
[16:35.600 --> 16:41.960]  We'll go back to that testimony here and this is John Cornyn, Republican from Texas.
[16:41.960 --> 16:48.200]  Do they have a duty to report it?
[16:48.200 --> 16:49.200]  That's a good question.
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.880]  I don't know that there's a legal duty to report it.
[16:51.880 --> 16:55.480]  They certainly have a cultural ethical duty to report it.
[16:55.480 --> 16:56.480]  See something, say something.
[16:56.480 --> 16:59.400]  Why didn't you say something when you saw something at the time?
[16:59.400 --> 17:00.400]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[17:00.400 --> 17:01.400]  I've not thought of it before.
[17:01.400 --> 17:06.120]  I don't know where the legal is a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony, knowing
[17:06.120 --> 17:09.760]  of a felony and taking steps to conceal it, but this is a different question.
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.760]  He doesn't know the law.
[17:10.760 --> 17:11.760]  He's the FBI director.
[17:11.760 --> 17:15.520]  I would expect any FBI, you know, as a reason, information about a crime being committed to
[17:15.520 --> 17:16.520]  report it.
[17:16.520 --> 17:17.520]  Me too.
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.520]  But where you rest that obligation, I don't know, it exists.
[17:20.520 --> 17:26.720]  And let me ask you, as a general proposition, if you're trying to make an investigation
[17:26.720 --> 17:35.440]  go away, is firing an FBI director a good way to make that happen?
[17:35.440 --> 17:36.440]  By that I mean.
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.160]  Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I'm obviously hopelessly biased given
[17:40.160 --> 17:42.200]  that I was the one fired.
[17:42.200 --> 17:43.840]  I understand it's not personal.
[17:43.840 --> 17:49.440]  No, give it a nature, you're taking it personal, I said, it's no indispensable people in the
[17:49.440 --> 17:52.120]  world, including at the FBI.
[17:52.120 --> 17:54.920]  That is lots of bad things about me not being at the FBI.
[17:54.920 --> 17:57.760]  Most of them are for me, but the work's going to go on as before.
[17:57.760 --> 18:02.360]  So nothing that's happened that you've testified to here today has impeded the investigation
[18:02.360 --> 18:08.880]  of the FBI or director Mueller's commitment to get to the bottom of this from the standpoint
[18:08.880 --> 18:11.400]  of the FBI and the Department of Justice.
[18:11.400 --> 18:12.400]  Would you agree with that?
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.120]  That's correct, especially the appointment of former director Mueller is a critical part
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.120]  of that equation.
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.520]  Let me take you back to the Clinton email investigation.
[18:20.520 --> 18:30.600]  I think you've been cast as a hero or a villain, depending on whose political ox is being gored
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.680]  at many different times during the course of the Clinton email investigation, even now
[18:35.680 --> 18:43.920]  perhaps, but you clearly were troubled by the conduct of the sitting attorney general Loretta
[18:43.920 --> 18:48.120]  Lynch when it came to the Clinton email investigation.
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.160]  You mentioned the characterization that you'd been asked to accept that this was a matter
[18:52.160 --> 18:56.160]  and not a criminal investigation, which you said it was.
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.600]  There was the matter of President Clinton's meeting on the tarmac with the sitting attorney
[19:02.600 --> 19:08.120]  general at a time when his wife was a subject to a criminal investigation, and you suggested
[19:08.120 --> 19:14.080]  that perhaps there are other matters you may be able to share with us later on in a classified
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.400]  setting.
[19:15.400 --> 19:20.400]  But it seems to me that you clearly believe that Loretta Lynch, the attorney general,
[19:20.400 --> 19:23.240]  had an appearance of a conflict of interest.
[19:23.240 --> 19:27.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got live commercial free feeds at infowars.com
[19:27.400 --> 19:28.400]  for radio stations.

[19:32.920 --> 19:38.560]  start playing clips that we have of him clearly waffling and perjuring himself in different
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.320]  congressional testimonies versus what he says was in the memo that he leaked to the press.
[19:44.320 --> 19:51.960]  That's right, he leaked basically a lie according to his testimony now to the press.
[19:51.960 --> 19:59.040]  So he's leaking information that's also lies, a double, double helping.
[19:59.040 --> 20:02.920]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[20:02.920 --> 20:06.720]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this

[21:57.920 --> 22:02.480]  It's been said, any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[22:02.480 --> 22:04.040]  Those times may be near.
[22:04.040 --> 22:08.120]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[22:08.120 --> 22:09.760]  and North Korea.
[22:09.760 --> 22:14.520]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[22:14.520 --> 22:18.340]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[22:18.340 --> 22:20.360]  from a single cyber attack.
[22:20.360 --> 22:24.520]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.120]  during a widespread national emergency.
[22:27.120 --> 22:30.120]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.

[23:56.040 --> 24:02.800]  Alex Jones here.
[24:02.800 --> 24:07.000]  We are back live with my intrepid crew and our great affiliates across the country.
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.080]  David Knight is streaming on the internet and to some stations and folks that are picking
[24:12.080 --> 24:18.000]  up our live coverage and live feed of the Comey hearings with limited analysis by David
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Knight.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.480]  He'll be joining us a little bit later in the broadcast.
[24:20.480 --> 24:23.600]  Those feeds are on infowars.com right now.
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.800]  You can see David Knight over there giving live analysis of the hearings via the C-span
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.800]  feed.
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.520]  If you want that live coverage, you go to infowars.com.
[24:33.520 --> 24:38.960]  I'll be taking excerpts throughout this hour and some of the live feed.
[24:38.960 --> 24:39.960]  My head is spinning.
[24:39.960 --> 24:43.400]  I have never been running around like a chicken with my head cut off like I've been the last
[24:43.400 --> 24:47.760]  few hours because the clips were about to start playing now and then ongoing as the
[24:47.760 --> 24:50.160]  hearing continues.
[24:50.160 --> 24:54.160]  This is beyond a nothing burger.
[24:54.160 --> 24:58.640]  This is a treason burger, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:58.640 --> 25:07.800]  He admits he leaked the memo to the New York Times, which they did admit got the story
[25:07.800 --> 25:08.800]  wrong.
[25:08.800 --> 25:13.200]  Oh, so they used a memo misrepresented what was in it to hurt the president.
[25:13.200 --> 25:18.320]  That's what I told you day one, that he wouldn't give the memo to Congress.
[25:18.320 --> 25:27.120]  So he admits he gave this memo to a friend in the press and now CNN has had to admit
[25:27.120 --> 25:30.880]  fake news about coming testimony and, of course, issued a retraction.
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.480]  CNN issues correction, headline changes following testimony.
[25:35.480 --> 25:37.840]  Sorry for the fake news.
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.800]  I mean, this is just mind blowing, but my head's spinning right now.
[25:43.800 --> 25:45.360]  This is so many things.
[25:45.360 --> 25:49.160]  This is Comey admitting he put out the memo.
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.560]  Comey then admits that the New York Times got the story completely wrong from the memo.
[25:53.560 --> 26:01.160]  So he commits a crime with a memo that he leaked to the press that they then misrepresent,
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.400]  which we know it was meant to do, because that memo, the way the New York Times reported
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.560]  it and the way the Washington Post reported it, completely and totally contradicted his
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.240]  testimony on May 3rd, two months later.
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.960]  So now he's got to come back and clean all this up, but it gets worse.
[26:19.960 --> 26:28.600]  He then tells multiple senators that no one tried to influence him on Russia.
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.880]  But through his surrogates that he's leaked to, he said that they did try to influence
[26:32.880 --> 26:35.200]  Russia on the Russia.
[26:35.200 --> 26:38.800]  All Comey now says he felt influenced on was leave Flynn alone.
[26:38.800 --> 26:40.400]  He's a good guy.
[26:40.400 --> 26:42.720]  I hope you can see it through to not go after him.
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.040]  That's not ordering him.
[26:44.040 --> 26:45.600]  So that's a lie too.
[26:45.600 --> 26:50.920]  All of this is a bunch of lawyers trying to spin and confuse and manipulate the public.
[26:50.920 --> 26:52.080]  That's exactly what it is.
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.720]  The takeaway is none of it's real.
[26:54.720 --> 26:57.520]  It's all fake from pillar to post.
[26:57.520 --> 27:02.280]  Then they've got other clips dealing with the Russia dossier, Piscate, all of it, admitting
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.160]  that's all fake now, but remember Buzzfeed and all the rest of them and Daily Beast coming
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.080]  out and saying, I had edited a tape of Comey.
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.040]  Then he's asked if anybody's trying to influence him, the attorney general or anybody.
[27:17.040 --> 27:18.880]  He says no, no one has.
[27:18.880 --> 27:21.760]  That means no one has because it'd be a pretty big deal.
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.880]  They then spun it that that didn't mean the president.
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.840]  But then today, Senator Burr's talking to him and he says specifically the president
[27:29.840 --> 27:30.840]  didn't.
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.320]  So we're real, Buzzfeed and the Daily Beast, you're fake.
[27:34.320 --> 27:36.640]  And CNN has to admit they're fake.
[27:36.640 --> 27:42.800]  We were right again, specifically on target exactly as it was.
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.120]  There was a memo that he never filed with the Justice Department like he's supposed
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.600]  to do that he then gave to the media.
[27:51.600 --> 27:53.200]  That's a whole other crime.
[27:53.200 --> 27:55.640]  Then the media claimed it was national security information.
[27:55.640 --> 27:57.040]  Well, a memo like that would be.
[27:57.040 --> 27:58.560]  So that's another crime.
[27:58.560 --> 28:02.520]  Then the media misrepresents what it is and Comey lets that go on for over a month and
[28:02.520 --> 28:08.800]  a half before he comes out and says that it was misrepresented on and on and on a tissue,
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.080]  a spectrum, an entire world of lies.
[28:14.080 --> 28:16.000]  We're going to come back in the next long segment.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  Go to all these clips.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.160]  Rubio on Flynn, Senator Burr flashback would have been a big deal.
[28:23.160 --> 28:24.400]  Nobody tried to influence him.
[28:24.400 --> 28:27.440]  Loretta Lynch did try to influence him on the email.
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.600]  That's a big deal because then he did kill the investigation.
[28:30.600 --> 28:31.600]  Wow.
[28:31.600 --> 28:32.600]  Wow.
[28:32.600 --> 28:38.520]  New York Times, Russia collusion story, wrong in the main.
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.240]  That's why they're now shifting gears to, oh, it's a criminal investigation in case
[28:42.240 --> 28:47.120]  somebody who was innocent tried to not answer questions right and claim they lied to the
[28:47.120 --> 28:48.120]  FBI.
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.120]  That's how it always goes.
[28:50.120 --> 28:51.120]  Incredible.
[28:51.120 --> 28:54.600]  Meanwhile, Hillary and her people get 30 plus million from the Russians shall at our
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.040]  uranium meet secretly with Putin.
[28:58.040 --> 29:03.200]  I mean, Megan Kelly's running around doing interviews with Putin.
[29:03.200 --> 29:09.360]  She's got more connection to Putin than general Flynn does just being at the same banquet
[29:09.360 --> 29:10.360]  hall with him.
[29:10.360 --> 29:11.520]  That's what Putin said to her.
[29:11.520 --> 29:13.520]  He said, you should be arrested.
[29:13.520 --> 29:19.440]  If Flynn's been fired for going to a public event that I was at, then you should be arrested.
[29:19.440 --> 29:22.560]  And people say she got destroyed in an interview.
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.720]  She got destroyed because she's been given an impossible job.
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.080]  Megan Kelly's probably the hardest interview I've ever done.
[29:30.080 --> 29:32.200]  She's a very sharp lawyer.
[29:32.200 --> 29:34.720]  She got the better of me in the interview she did the other night.
[29:34.720 --> 29:38.960]  That's why I'm mad because it was just a lawyer asking the same questions five, six
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.400]  times to twist it all into knots on purpose.
[29:42.400 --> 29:47.120]  But see, she's got an impossible job to sell and so does the media on Russia collusion
[29:47.120 --> 29:48.280]  because it didn't happen.
[29:48.280 --> 29:49.560]  We're on the march.
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.720]  The empire's on the run.
[29:51.720 --> 29:52.720]  Bombshell clips.
[29:52.720 --> 29:53.720]  Bombshell clips.
[29:53.720 --> 29:54.720]  Bombshell clips.

[33:21.400 --> 33:29.600]  You're listening to live coverage of the historic former FBI Director James Comey hearings
[33:29.600 --> 33:32.480]  in Congress that has blown up in their face.
[33:32.480 --> 33:39.080]  MSM is in damage control mode right now going, oh, Comey leaked to the press because it was
[33:39.080 --> 33:40.080]  the right thing to do.
[33:40.080 --> 33:44.040]  Oh, and then we took the information and used the wall of secrecy to lie about what was
[33:44.040 --> 33:45.040]  in the memo.
[33:45.040 --> 33:49.080]  He's now said the media got it wrong, and he said, oh, they did try to influence me.
[33:49.080 --> 33:52.040]  Oh, but they didn't try to influence me in congressional hearings.
[33:52.040 --> 33:53.640]  We have all these clips.
[33:53.640 --> 33:54.640]  This is unbelievable.
[33:54.640 --> 33:57.640]  Oh, and Loretta Lynch tried to influence me.
[33:57.640 --> 33:58.640]  And guess what?
[33:58.640 --> 33:59.640]  She did.
[33:59.640 --> 34:03.080]  You dropped the investigation into the email servers.
[34:03.080 --> 34:04.400]  This is all coming up.
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.880]  I've got seven of these clips I'm going to play in just a moment.
[34:08.880 --> 34:12.960]  But I want to go to some of David Knight's live coverage of one of the biggest anti-American
[34:12.960 --> 34:19.040]  globalist pieces of garbage is out there, John McCain, of the Keating Five, anti-gun,
[34:19.040 --> 34:23.480]  pro-open borders, funding the radical jihadis, the Arab Spring, working with the EU to open
[34:23.480 --> 34:25.400]  the borders up to bring in refugees.
[34:25.400 --> 34:29.280]  I mean, John McCain is about as conservative as Mao Zedong.
[34:29.280 --> 34:30.280]  Let's go to John McCain.
[34:30.280 --> 34:33.480]  In the campaign, it was ongoing when I left.
[34:33.480 --> 34:39.080]  You just made it clear, and what you said, this is a, quote, big deal, unquote.
[34:39.080 --> 34:44.920]  I think it's hard to reconcile, in one case, you reach complete conclusion, and the other
[34:44.920 --> 34:47.760]  side, you have not.
[34:47.760 --> 34:56.160]  And in fact, obviously, there's a lot more there, as we know, as you called it, a, quote,
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.160]  big deal.
[34:57.160 --> 34:58.640]  She's one of the candidates.
[34:58.640 --> 35:01.880]  But in her case, you say, there would be no charges.
[35:01.880 --> 35:08.440]  And in the case of President Trump, the investigation continues.
[35:08.440 --> 35:14.160]  What has been brought out in this hearing is more and more emphasis on the Russian engagement
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.560]  and involvement in this campaign.
[35:17.560 --> 35:19.720]  How serious do you think this was?
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.040]  He just, tell me, just came out 20 minutes ago and said that there wasn't evidence of
[35:24.040 --> 35:25.040]  it.
[35:25.040 --> 35:26.040]  I want to say something to be clear.
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.760]  It was, we have not announced, and there was no predication to announce, an investigation
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.760]  of whether the Russians may have coordinated with Secretary Clinton's campaign, Secretary
[35:34.760 --> 35:35.760]  Clinton's campaign.
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.200]  They may not have been involved with their campaign, they were involved with the entire
[35:39.200 --> 35:41.320]  presidential campaign, obviously.
[35:41.320 --> 35:42.320]  Oh, obviously.
[35:42.320 --> 35:43.320]  Oh, of course.
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.320]  And that, that is an investigation.
[35:44.320 --> 35:45.320]  They're on everything.
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.080]  That began last summer, and so far as I'm aware, it continues.
[35:49.080 --> 35:50.080]  So both.
[35:50.080 --> 35:55.440]  When is somebody going to investigate Comey's connection to Christopher Steele, who came
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.760]  up with the dirty dossier?
[35:56.760 --> 36:01.560]  Were they going to investigate the connections between Steele and the Clinton campaign?
[36:01.560 --> 36:06.200]  As Grassley said, this raises questions as to whether or not the FBI is independent from
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.240]  politics and whether or not the Obama administration used law enforcement and intelligence agencies
[36:12.240 --> 36:13.720]  for political ends.
[36:13.720 --> 36:17.040]  This is what the Senate Intelligence Committee should be investigating.
[36:17.040 --> 36:18.040]  That's right.
[36:18.040 --> 36:19.040]  You're listening to live coverage.
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.000]  Intelligence Committee should be concerned about whether or not our own intelligence
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.480]  agencies were used for political purposes.
[36:25.480 --> 36:26.480]  There's ample.
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.920]  Again, David Knight is giving you live coverage on the feeds at infowars.com.
[36:32.920 --> 36:38.320]  You can go to infowars.com and find those feeds of his live coverage.
[36:38.320 --> 36:40.960]  That's David Knight with infowars.com.
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.720]  He is running a live feed of the hearings and going, giving limited commentary.
[36:46.720 --> 36:49.440]  And unfortunately, the way we have the feeds going today, I can't talk over him.
[36:49.440 --> 36:50.440]  He can't talk over me.
[36:50.440 --> 36:53.000]  So we have to cut each other off and one of the other people comes up.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Let's go to a few more minutes of this.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.360]  I'm going to come back with our clips.
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.000]  Yeah, I get that, Senator.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.160]  Honestly, I'll tell you what, this is speculation, but what I concluded at the time is in his
[37:01.160 --> 37:06.960]  memory he was searching back to our encounter at the dinner and was preparing himself to
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.680]  say, I offered loyalty to you.
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.680]  You promised loyalty to me.
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.000]  And all of a sudden his memory showed him that did not happen.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.320]  And I think he pulled up short.
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.320]  That's just a guess.
[37:15.320 --> 37:17.560]  But a lot of conversations with humans over the years.
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.000]  Except that you testified under oath that you are never pressured to stop an investigation
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.600]  for political purposes.
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.640]  He keeps going back and forth, back and forth under oath.
[37:28.640 --> 37:30.560]  This guy needs to be tried for perjury.
[37:30.560 --> 37:34.440]  You want to talk about how he's trying to entrap people in the Trump administration with
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.440]  process crimes?
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.440]  He has done this multiple times today.
[37:39.440 --> 37:42.400]  That's a subject for committed perjury investigations.
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.200]  Not something I can comment on sitting here.
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.200]  But you reached that conclusion as far as Secretary Clinton was concerned, but you're
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.160]  not reaching a conclusion as far as this administration is concerned.
[37:58.160 --> 38:03.800]  Are you aware of anything that would lead you to believe that information exists that
[38:03.800 --> 38:11.320]  could coerce members of the administration or blackmail the administration?
[38:11.320 --> 38:14.320]  That's not a question I can answer, Senator.
[38:14.320 --> 38:17.320]  They're trying to gavel him down, telling him that he's out of time.
[38:17.320 --> 38:20.520]  And quite frankly, he really wasn't able to get his points across.
[38:20.520 --> 38:27.920]  Clinton made the points very succinctly as to what McCain was doing, but did it far more
[38:27.920 --> 38:30.320]  succinctly and pointedly.
[38:30.320 --> 38:31.920]  Now we're going to go to another questioner.
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.320]  This is going back to Burr, who is the chair of the committee.
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.560]  This may be the end of the individual questions.
[38:38.560 --> 38:39.920]  Be there at one o'clock.
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.360]  We have about three minutes.
[38:44.360 --> 38:45.360]  Another 20 minutes.
[38:45.360 --> 38:46.920]  I'd like to have a order.
[38:46.920 --> 38:54.840]  Again, you're listening live coverage of the Senate Intelligence Committee talking to James
[38:54.840 --> 38:58.480]  Comey, trying to find something to come after Donald Trump for.
[38:58.480 --> 39:06.080]  And yet we have had James Comey multiple times now state and also imply sometimes directly
[39:06.080 --> 39:11.880]  stated that he was politically pressured to stop the investigation and direct contradiction
[39:11.880 --> 39:19.480]  of what he testified about a month ago just before he was fired.
[39:19.480 --> 39:23.840]  And of course, he said that a couple of months after these private meetings that he's now
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.840]  saying, well, he was pressuring me privately to shut down the investigation for political
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.840]  purposes.
[39:28.840 --> 39:31.080]  So he has committed perjury.
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.960]  He has also talked about how he leaked information to the New York Times.
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.880]  He has shut down New York Times articles as fake news.
[39:38.880 --> 39:41.000]  It's been an interesting couple of hearings here.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.480]  Let's hear what is going to be coming up next from the chair, Senator Burr.
[39:45.480 --> 39:50.000]  That we're grateful to them with the level of cooperation that they have shown us with
[39:50.000 --> 39:57.280]  the trust we've built between both organizations, the Congress and the Bureau.
[39:57.280 --> 40:00.480]  We couldn't do our job if it wasn't for their willingness to connect with us.
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.040]  Again, this guy is hopelessly involved with the intelligence community.
[40:04.040 --> 40:08.320]  He will not go to where the Senate Intelligence Committee needs to go.
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.480]  And that is oversight and investigation of multiple violations of the law by the FBI,
[40:13.480 --> 40:19.880]  by the NSA, the involvement, the open involvement by current and past officials of the intelligence
[40:19.880 --> 40:21.840]  services in our politics.
[40:21.840 --> 40:27.480]  The politicization of these intelligence agencies is something that the Senate Intelligence
[40:27.480 --> 40:29.640]  Committee should be investigating.
[40:29.640 --> 40:30.640]  And instead, they aren't.
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.320]  Instead, they're doing the same thing that Hillary Clinton did back with the DNC as
[40:36.320 --> 40:42.720]  that was beginning, redirecting everybody away from her criminal actions and to this
[40:42.720 --> 40:45.080]  boogeyman of the Russians, the red herring.
[40:45.080 --> 40:46.080]  They're doing the same thing.
[40:46.080 --> 40:52.760]  The real story here is what did the FBI, the NSA, the CIA do directly violating laws?
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.760]  And we just had the FISA court declassify a statement telling us that they're violating
[40:57.760 --> 40:59.440]  the law.
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.040]  They're raising the flag.
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.600]  These people are trying to bury that and misdirect it towards Trump, towards the Russians.
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.200]  When the reality is, the story here, as Rand Paul has said, is the use of the intelligence
[41:11.200 --> 41:13.360]  community for political ends.
[41:13.360 --> 41:16.440]  Grassley has said that as well in a letter to Comey.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.000]  That's what needs to be investigated.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.080]  That's what's not being talked about.
[41:20.080 --> 41:26.480]  That's what people like Richard Burr are covering up, and that's his responsibility to investigate.
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.760]  For your appearance, and there clearly still remain a number of questions, and the one
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.560]  thing I want to commit to you, and more importantly, I think the chairman and I want to commit
[41:36.560 --> 41:41.440]  to all those who are still potentially watching and following.
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.400]  There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and we're going to get to the bottom of this.
[41:44.400 --> 41:49.160]  We're going to get the facts out the American people deserve to know.
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.080]  There's the questions around implications of Trump officials and the Russians, but
[41:53.080 --> 41:57.520]  there's also the macro issue of what the Russians did and continue to do, and I think
[41:57.520 --> 42:03.040]  it is very important that all Americans realize that threat is real, it is continuous, it
[42:03.040 --> 42:07.040]  is not just towards our nation, it is all towards all Western democracies, and we have
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.520]  to come to a solution center.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.520]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[42:09.520 --> 42:21.640]  Director Comey, thank you once again on behalf of the committee this year and to Joe.
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.320]  And there you can see that they are recessing.
[42:25.320 --> 42:31.480]  They've also talked about going into a private hearing on intelligence, so we'll continue
[42:31.480 --> 42:34.200]  to watch this as it unfolds.
[42:34.200 --> 42:36.800]  We're going to go back to David Nahn a little bit later.
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.440]  He's got the live feed coverage of what he's doing, but they are breaking up live right
[42:41.440 --> 42:42.440]  now.
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.640]  We'll have more information for you here in just a few minutes.
[42:45.640 --> 42:47.400]  There was the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[42:47.400 --> 42:49.080]  Now let's stop.
[42:49.080 --> 42:53.240]  The point David Nahn was making as we were taking that live feed with his live analysis
[42:53.240 --> 42:59.040]  at the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas, picking up the feed from D.C. if you're tuning
[42:59.040 --> 43:04.920]  in and wondering what you're hearing is that it's now in the news it's confirmed Obama
[43:04.920 --> 43:11.560]  was using the NSA in the 2016 election to spy on Trump and his opponents to try to basically
[43:11.560 --> 43:18.320]  derail the situation and to basically try to win it for Hillary.
[43:18.320 --> 43:19.320]  We know that.
[43:19.320 --> 43:24.440]  That other elements of our intelligence agencies and people inside the DNC began to leak information
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.560]  to try to counter that and to try to stop that because they understood that the deep
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.720]  state was trying to keep a nationalist, populist candidate from coming to power.
[43:35.720 --> 43:37.240]  That's exactly what they did.
[43:37.240 --> 43:42.440]  They knew what they were doing, and so a major counterbalance came into counter it, and that's
[43:42.440 --> 43:43.440]  what's happened.
[43:43.440 --> 43:50.360]  But I told you that the Comey memo was just an excuse for them to put out disinformation
[43:50.360 --> 43:55.040]  and that when the memo came out it wouldn't say what they said because Comey is a snake
[43:55.040 --> 44:00.880]  and he's not going to put in a memo that the president tried to basically commit crimes
[44:00.880 --> 44:06.160]  and tell him what to do on a criminal investigation with Russia and then go testify to Congress
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.680]  that that was the case except if he was keeping the memo back illegally and not filing it
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.600]  with the Justice Department so he could use it in case he wanted to.
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.360]  But then he now comes out and testifies that that's not the case and that the New York
[44:20.360 --> 44:22.240]  Times and others got it wrong.
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.240]  What was in the memo?
[44:23.240 --> 44:25.200]  So let's go ahead and go through some of the clips.
[44:25.200 --> 44:31.120]  Here is Marco Rubio talking about General Flynn today and was Trump trying to influence
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.720]  the Russia investigation or influence things on Flynn?
[44:34.720 --> 44:36.720]  Let's go to that clip.
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.960]  Dr. Comey, the meeting in the Oval Office where he made the request about Mike Flynn,
[44:41.960 --> 44:45.480]  was that the only time he asked you to hopefully let it go?
[44:45.480 --> 44:46.480]  Yes.
[44:46.480 --> 44:50.840]  And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia
[44:50.840 --> 44:55.840]  investigation, he was asking very specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself.
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.080]  That's how I understood it, yes sir.
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.000]  And as you perceived it, while it was a request that he hoped you did away with it, you perceived
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.680]  it as an order given his position, the setting and the like and some of the circumstances.
[45:06.680 --> 45:07.680]  Yes.
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.840]  At the time, did you say anything to the President about that is not an appropriate
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.240]  request or did you tell the White House Council that is not an appropriate request?
[45:15.240 --> 45:18.240]  Someone needs to go tell the President that he can't do these things?
[45:18.240 --> 45:19.240]  I didn't, no.
[45:19.240 --> 45:20.240]  Okay.
[45:20.240 --> 45:21.240]  Why?
[45:21.240 --> 45:22.240]  I don't know.
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.600]  I think the circumstances were such that it was not, and didn't have the presence
[45:27.600 --> 45:28.600]  of mind.
[45:28.600 --> 45:32.720]  And I don't know, I don't want to make you sound like I'm Captain Courageous.
[45:32.720 --> 45:35.160]  I don't know whether you know if I had the presence of mind, I would have said to the
[45:35.160 --> 45:37.000]  President, sir, that's wrong.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.080]  I don't know whether I would have, but in the moment, it didn't come to my mind.
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.760]  What came to my mind is be careful what you say, and so I said, I agree, Flynn is a good
[45:45.760 --> 45:46.760]  guy.
[45:46.760 --> 45:51.240]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific
[45:51.240 --> 45:56.920]  investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[45:56.920 --> 45:59.440]  In theory, yes.
[45:59.440 --> 46:01.240]  As it happened?
[46:01.240 --> 46:06.160]  Out of my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something
[46:06.160 --> 46:09.000]  that without appropriate purpose.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.960]  We're oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there, and so you ought
[46:12.960 --> 46:15.000]  to stop investing resources in it.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.320]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political
[46:18.320 --> 46:19.320]  reason.
[46:19.320 --> 46:20.520]  That would be a very big deal.
[46:20.520 --> 46:22.520]  It's not happened in my experience.
[46:22.520 --> 46:25.120]  Now we're going to play that clip again.
[46:25.120 --> 46:32.520]  The first part was Marco Rubio today.
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.720]  And we're hearing that he did feel like he was being influenced and being ordered around.
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.640]  And then we've got the clip from May 3rd, two months after the supposed memo in February
[46:42.640 --> 46:46.320]  with the president, where he did try to influence him, that was leaked to the press, saying that
[46:46.320 --> 46:48.600]  he didn't feel like anybody tried to influence him.
[46:48.600 --> 46:51.600]  But then the media spun that and said, oh, Jones, fake news again.
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.400]  Clearly they're asking about the Attorney General or the Justice Department.
[46:54.400 --> 46:56.280]  No, he's asked about that.
[46:56.280 --> 47:01.240]  And then he comes out and he says, nobody, it'd be a big deal.
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.360]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it, mainstream media saying I lied or edited the clip.
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.840]  But let's play a clip from today that really puts that to bed.
[47:08.840 --> 47:16.240]  Here's Senator Byrne asking specifically if he was told to shut down the Russia investigation
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.240]  or influence.
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.040]  This is today, Daily Beast, today, Buzzfeed.
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.240]  You liars, you fake news, garbage sellers that lied.
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.880]  I mean, the Huffington Post said the headline today that the top story is Marco Rubio's
[47:28.880 --> 47:30.800]  hair.
[47:30.800 --> 47:34.600]  This isn't funny that we've got the deep state and both political parties trying to destroy
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.480]  President Trump, trying to cut our taxes and restore our republic, claiming he works for
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.840]  foreign powers with no evidence in a dangerous witch hunt when they're the ones that sold
[47:42.840 --> 47:44.520]  us out to globalist.
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.160]  Yeah, Marco Rubio hair nabs a starring role during Comey testimony.
[47:49.160 --> 47:54.200]  That's one of the top stories on the Huffington Post because they've got these readers that
[47:54.200 --> 47:55.400]  think everything's funny.
[47:55.400 --> 47:58.280]  I was on the Daily Beast the other day and I was also on the Buzzfeed.
[47:58.280 --> 48:02.640]  They had a whole article about how to eat boogers.
[48:02.640 --> 48:07.120]  That's what the grown, intellectual left reads all day because they keep them in this arrested
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.040]  development mode where they think this is all funny watching the whole world gang up
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.040]  on our president, where they think it's funny to watch gays getting thrown off buildings
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.800]  by jihadis that are then brought into our country by the liberals and women put it on
[48:18.800 --> 48:19.800]  her jibs.
[48:19.800 --> 48:23.080]  You people are mentally ill and crazy.
[48:23.080 --> 48:24.080]  But that's equilibrium.
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.200]  You're given a total country, everything free, bunch of spoiled brats, so you want to burn
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.960]  the house down over our dead bodies comebacks.
[48:30.960 --> 48:37.440]  Here's Senator Burr today confirming what Comey said on May 3rd that nobody, including
[48:37.440 --> 48:41.640]  the president, tried to make him shut down the Russia investigation.
[48:41.640 --> 48:44.800]  Exactly what Donald Trump said.
[48:44.800 --> 48:53.280]  Director Comey, did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into
[48:53.280 --> 48:56.640]  Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[48:56.640 --> 48:58.520]  Not to my understanding, no.
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.920]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you
[49:03.920 --> 49:06.720]  to stop the Russian investigation?
[49:06.720 --> 49:07.720]  No.
[49:07.720 --> 49:18.800]  Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote, let Flynn go.
[49:18.800 --> 49:27.320]  General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense.
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.880]  And if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between facts and
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.520]  his FBI testimony.
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.560]  And your estimation was General Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy.
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.800]  And in addition to that, do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice
[49:46.800 --> 49:53.760]  or just seek for a way for Mike Flynn to save face given he had already been fired?
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.740]  Well, General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy.
[49:57.740 --> 50:02.680]  There was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian
[50:02.680 --> 50:05.120]  contacts and the contacts themselves.
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.280]  And so that was my assessment at the time.
[50:08.280 --> 50:11.440]  I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.000]  an effort to obstruct.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.280]  I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that's the conclusion I'm
[50:17.280 --> 50:20.960]  sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.840]  there and whether that's an offense.
[50:22.840 --> 50:28.160]  But you didn't give it to the Justice Department, even though it was so disturbing.
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.680]  That General Flynn was at a dinner that Putin was at publicly at a TV gala, oh my gosh,
[50:32.680 --> 50:33.680]  arrest Megan Kelly then.
[50:33.680 --> 50:37.520]  And I'm not saying arrest Megan Kelly before they run those headlines.
[50:37.520 --> 50:41.240]  Wow, that is mind blowing right there.
[50:41.240 --> 50:44.520]  But of course, what does the so-called memo say?
[50:44.520 --> 50:47.600]  Well, I hope you can see it your way to leave Maloney's a good guy.
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.920]  What do they prosecutors talk about all day?
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.120]  But the president, he's not allowed to talk like that.
[50:53.120 --> 50:56.760]  Clearly, clearly, this is all an attack on the president made up.
[50:56.760 --> 51:03.020]  When it comes to the success of your small business, you make every dollar count.
[51:03.020 --> 51:05.120]  So what could you do with $10?

[52:28.720 --> 52:29.720]  It's really incredible.

[54:06.520 --> 54:11.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows that when I see something that looks negative for
[54:11.720 --> 54:16.400]  our cause of restoring the Republic, cutting taxes, defeating the globalists, getting us
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.600]  out of the UN, restoring our sovereignty, when I see something bad happening, I'll tell
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  you.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.600]  When we're losing, I'll tell you.
[54:23.600 --> 54:33.520]  I don't put spin on things, but when you look at what happened today, this was a disaster
[54:33.520 --> 54:34.520]  for Comey.
[54:34.520 --> 54:39.800]  We've got a clip coming up because I've got to do these in order where he says, I'm kind
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.880]  of cowardly, hit out with my wife, you know, I had this stuff that was disturbing, but
[54:43.880 --> 54:46.480]  I didn't tell anybody because that's a crime.
[54:46.480 --> 54:50.320]  If he thinks something's going on illegal, which he's already said to his surrogates,
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.320]  and then he didn't give it to Congress, he didn't give it to the Intelligence Committee.
[54:54.320 --> 55:00.200]  He didn't give it to his superiors at the Justice Department.
[55:00.200 --> 55:01.200]  And it goes on and on.
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.400]  And then admitting Loretta Lynch tried to influence him because he knows there's evidence
[55:06.400 --> 55:09.720]  of it, or he wouldn't be saying that.
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.320]  I mean, he knows she did it, obviously, but he knows they've got evidence, so he's trying
[55:14.320 --> 55:16.880]  to cover up now like it was no big deal.
[55:16.880 --> 55:19.080]  It was illegal for Bill Clinton to get on that plane with her.
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.760]  And that's why he came out and reopened the investigation for just a couple days.
[55:23.760 --> 55:27.600]  He's now admitted that to make it look like he wasn't being told what to do, to make it
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.960]  look like he hadn't committed crimes.
[55:29.960 --> 55:31.560]  This is incredible.
[55:31.560 --> 55:36.120]  They've started an investigation on Trump, and it's totally blown up in their face, but
[55:36.120 --> 55:45.160]  the whore lying, Decepticon, sewage, prostitute, New World Order, dinosaur, anti-America,
[55:45.160 --> 55:51.440]  evil media is in full spin mode of, oh, more evidence of the Russians, things just got deeper
[55:51.440 --> 55:52.440]  for Trump.
[55:52.440 --> 55:58.800]  This totally validated Trump, on not trying to influence on Russia, it totally validated
[55:58.800 --> 56:00.760]  everything Trump said.
[56:00.760 --> 56:03.800]  And then Comey admits he's the leaker.
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.560]  Wow, I mean, boom, boom, boom, this is explosive.
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.400]  I'm sorry for the crew today.
[56:14.400 --> 56:16.080]  I am bouncing off the walls.
[56:16.080 --> 56:17.360]  Well, they're bouncing off the walls, too.
[56:17.360 --> 56:18.360]  This is incredible.
[56:18.360 --> 56:20.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to open the phones up, get them again.
[56:20.680 --> 56:21.680]  This is coming up.
[56:21.680 --> 56:22.680]  We're going to play a bunch of these clips.
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.240]  I'm going to play the Loretta Lynch when we come back.
[56:25.240 --> 56:26.680]  I'm going to play the Cowardly Clip.
[56:26.680 --> 56:33.040]  I'm going to play the New York Times, Russia collusion story wrong, not true.
[56:33.040 --> 56:36.040]  That's why they're saying it's now a criminal investigation, hoping Flynn didn't answer
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.640]  the questions right or they can catch a bank account that's wrong or something, you know,
[56:39.640 --> 56:43.640]  the dealing with something else or paperwork that wasn't filed because they're desperate.
[56:43.640 --> 56:46.320]  Oh, praise God for this.
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.920]  You talk about the Bible says you'll dig a pit for somebody and you'll fall in it.
[56:51.920 --> 56:55.040]  So many times my enemies attack me and then what they do to me ends up happening to them.
[56:55.040 --> 56:56.880]  I don't even have to do it.
[56:56.880 --> 56:58.800]  And I just think Trump has providence.
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.040]  We should pray for Trump.
[57:00.040 --> 57:01.040]  We should pray for America.
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.040]  We should pray for this whole world and for peace right now.
[57:04.040 --> 57:06.360]  Briefly, please support the broadcast.
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.240]  David Knight and that crew over there did such a supportive job with two plus three hours
[57:11.240 --> 57:12.240]  of live coverage.
[57:12.240 --> 57:15.320]  They kind of ended it early because Kwame was getting destroyed in there.
[57:15.320 --> 57:17.560]  They look like they had their asses handed to them.
[57:17.560 --> 57:18.680]  Praise God.
[57:18.680 --> 57:21.760]  This incredible crew, everybody, you the losers that make it all possible.

[57:30.160 --> 57:31.160]  They have.
[57:31.160 --> 57:34.040]  They've tried to shut down our YouTube revenue about 75 percent.
[57:34.040 --> 57:39.400]  Paul Watson shown those graphs, but thanks to you, we're still able to slightly expand

[58:50.080 --> 58:52.080]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[58:52.080 --> 58:55.680]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's
[58:55.680 --> 58:59.920]  was at the same point in his presidency, that's despite all the negative media attention, the
[58:59.920 --> 59:04.080]  wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's involvement in the election and the unending
[59:04.080 --> 59:07.280]  chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network news.
[59:07.280 --> 59:10.880]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better
[59:10.880 --> 59:13.320]  than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[59:13.320 --> 59:16.840]  While Trump's approval ratings only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better
[59:16.840 --> 59:20.920]  than Clinton who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[59:20.920 --> 59:26.160]  Of course, Trump's disapproval ratings also higher than Clinton's at 57% compared to Clinton's
[59:26.160 --> 59:27.160]  49%.
[59:27.160 --> 59:28.160]  But what do you expect?
[59:28.160 --> 59:32.120]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[59:32.120 --> 59:35.240]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under
[59:35.240 --> 59:37.960]  constant assault even before he got elected.
[59:37.960 --> 59:41.960]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the
[59:41.960 --> 59:44.640]  fake media's narrative is dying.
[59:44.640 --> 1:00:13.240]  And for Infowars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:20.640]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:21.640]  show.
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:27.560]  Well, in the heat of the moment, the last two and a half hours with live coverage of
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.960]  the Comey hearings with David Knight and the rest of the crew, I was angry.
[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:31.960]  I was focused.
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:35.480]  I was like a piranha running around trying to collate all the data.
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:39.360]  Our great writers and crew get the stories up on Infowars.com.
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:43.120]  It's amazing to see us leading the coverage.
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:46.880]  Something about how boom, he just perjured himself.
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:48.400]  Hour later mainstream news.
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:49.400]  Boom.
[1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:50.560]  He just admitted he's the leaker.
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:51.560]  Boom.
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:53.080]  Mainstream news an hour later.
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:56.000]  It really shows how we are the new dominant news.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.500]  Let's put DrugsReport.com up.
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:00:58.500]  You know what?
[1:00:58.500 --> 1:00:59.500]  I want to do that the next segment.
[1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:02.240]  I want to just show some of the coverage and headlines there.
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:03.480]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us.
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:06.880]  We're going to be playing clips while he's on of some of the highlights of this hearing
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:12.920]  that they thought was going to be the waterloo of Donald John Trump and the American people
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:13.920]  in our populist movement.
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:18.720]  And so many folks ask me, they say, Alex, used to be so anti-government, so upset because
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.560]  it was been seized by the New World Order.
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:22.200]  I was never anti-government.
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:27.680]  I went limited constitutional government to protect my rights and my way of life.
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:29.160]  I love America.
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:34.040]  And the globalists are getting their butts kicked out of our government.
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:38.120]  And they're dug in like a bunch of ticks on the hind end of an old hound dog.
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:40.720]  But they're getting their butts pulled out there.
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.920]  This is a big time to be alive.
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:43.920]  And you know what?
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:44.920]  It's a dangerous time to be alive.
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:49.520]  But it's like I told globalist Megan Kelly, we're going to break your New World Order.
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:50.520]  She said, me?
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:52.160]  I said, you represent it.
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:53.160]  You represent the establishment.
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:54.320]  Don't act like you don't.
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:55.600]  And you're going to be defeated.
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:58.760]  It doesn't mean I'm not going to be destroyed, sweetheart.
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:00.760]  This isn't about me getting out of here.
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.080]  It's about you getting beat.
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:03.080]  You understand that?
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:05.200]  It's about David Rockefeller getting beat.
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.560]  It's about the Zabicki-Brasinski getting beat.
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:13.000]  Long after they're dead, which they are now, it's about their New World Order failing.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:19.440]  Humanity succeeding and those greedy, nasty robber barons being in the ash heap of history.
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:21.000]  And already globalism's out in the open.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.160]  The Federal Reserve's out in the open.
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.400]  The anti-family agenda's out in the open.
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:32.120]  You want to have your agendas, take over our lives, run us into the dirt, and we just sit
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  here on the sidelines.
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  That's not happening.
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.600]  You're going to fail.
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:40.360]  Let's go to this clip of Loretta Lynch influence.
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.360]  This is big.
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.840]  Probably the only other consideration that I guess I can talk about in an open setting
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:51.680]  is that at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation,
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:55.720]  but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me.
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:00.080]  But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.760]  from the department if we're to close this case credibly.
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:07.400]  You know, James Comey is what I talk about.
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:10.040]  I talk about how the globalists are all cowards.
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:14.280]  They have all these interlocking boards and systems where no one ever really knows who
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:15.280]  gave the order.
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:18.240]  Nobody ever knows who, you know, approves the drug.
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.800]  For him, affiliates, they know it's going to kill most of them or nobody knows who gave
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:25.720]  the order to inject the black people with syphilis at the ski year.
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:28.720]  Nobody ever knows who gave the order to do this or that.
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:33.040]  It's just kind of in a consortium and they have consultants that come and certify it
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.800]  and you have auditors and everything just kind of gets swept out of the rug and nobody
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:39.760]  knows who did the TPP.
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:42.040]  Nobody knows who tried to ratify it in secret.
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  Nobody knows how the euro got control of Europe and is unelected and where it came from and
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:49.160]  because they did not exist until like 2000.
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:54.640]  It was a conspiracy theory previous to that out here, back in the 70s, folks over at my
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:58.080]  parents house going, they're going to have a European Union and then an Asian Union and
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  an American Union.
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:02.200]  It's going to merge and they're going to have a global tax and they're going to track
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:06.280]  everything you do with the big supercomputers in Brussels, Belgium.
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:12.040]  I'm sitting there like five years old hearing this and then here I am 40 years later.
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:16.080]  It all happened, didn't it?
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:24.040]  I remember sitting there as a child and I just grew up thinking everybody knew that
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.040]  stuff.
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:28.480]  And by the way, it wasn't like quacks or kooks that were over at my parents house.
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:35.920]  It'd be like heads of major churches and FBI agents and cops and military people and I'm
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:39.640]  sitting there as a kid hearing this stuff and missionaries coming to the house and talking
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:40.640]  about it.
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:42.600]  We're going to meet the New World Order and it's just crazy.
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:47.320]  And just thank God for all those people because man, they got attacked and called loons back
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:53.800]  then, but because of them, 40 years later, we got Donald Trump, we got Nigel Farage,
[1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:59.720]  we got National Slow Bunch and we've got victory.
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:03.520]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:05.280]  the Bush administration.
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:10.240]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:12.240]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Ray.
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:17.920]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Ray a man of impeccable credentials, including
[1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:22.520]  serving as the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division under George
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:23.520]  W. Bush.
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.800]  Ray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:32.760]  role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:37.480]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:41.760]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:46.080]  by the White House, but according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:49.920]  and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:52.960]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:58.760]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:42.160]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com and I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:58.840]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:02.200]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:03.960]  Why is this so good?
[1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:08.520]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:13.240]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:18.920]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:22.280]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:27.360]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:28.640]  going on everywhere.
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:29.640]  These are all parasites.
[1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:32.320]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.640]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:39.920]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:43.120]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:46.120]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:49.960]  And folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:53.240]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.440]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:07:55.440 --> 1:08:04.120]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:09.000]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  on top.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  to hell.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  I'm coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  You're coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:59.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, I don't put a pretty face on things unless it's a pretty
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:05.440]  face and Comey just self-destructed in front of the world.
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:11.040]  Comey just melted down and the media is trying to change the subject to Marco Rubio's hair
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:13.360]  or oh, the Russian investigation goes on.
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:14.720]  This adds weight to it.
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:19.560]  He said that he's the leaker and that the New York Times and others got it wrong, what
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.240]  was even in the memo.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.080]  So he commits a crime because he didn't bring it to his superiors.
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:25.200]  He's deeply troubled.
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.520]  He admits that he doesn't bring it to him.
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:33.800]  He testifies on May 3rd, two months later after the meeting that no one's tried to influence
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  him.
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.280]  Senator Burr asked him again, did Trump try to ever influence you?
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.200]  He said, no, he didn't do that.
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.200]  He didn't try to order me.
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:42.200]  It's unbelievable.
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:47.880]  The entire case, again, completely and totally implodes, then they add all these cherries
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.520]  on tops where he says, I'm cowardly.
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.720]  I hit out.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:58.120]  He goes on to say that the New York Times-Russia collusion story was wrong in the main.
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:09:59.120]  That's a quote.
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:03.360]  He goes on to say Loretta Lynch ordered him to not call the investigation of the email
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:09.960]  server of Hillary Clinton and then he kills the investigation and when it comes out, she's
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:14.600]  colluding with Clinton.
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:21.320]  He then reopens it for a couple days to look strong and then admits that's why he did that.
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:26.120]  So we have him passing, classified in photo with friends.
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:30.160]  We have him admitting that he was never ordered by Trump to stop.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:31.160]  It's amazing.
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:33.040]  I'm going to play all these clips.
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:37.320]  It's coming up live coverage right now on this Thursday edition.
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:44.440]  But wow, I am really surprised Comey went and even testified because he looked weak.
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.960]  He contradicted himself.
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:50.320]  He floundered and he then had to confirm everything Trump said.
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:55.760]  He was never under investigation and he never told him, dropped the investigation.
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:58.200]  He said, gee, I hope you can see it clear to do this.
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:01.800]  Now Gavin McGinnis is the founder of Vice News, everybody knows.
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:06.640]  He's syndicated radio and TV host, English-born writer and comedian.
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:10.920]  And of course, compoundmedia.com, Twitter at Gavin underscore McGinnis.
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:16.240]  We really appreciate him joining us to talk about all the things that are going on.
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:19.360]  I haven't talked to him previous to him coming on.
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  We just get him on every few weeks.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:21.600]  He's gracious enough to come on.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:25.400]  But obviously I want to get his take on, did he watch the hearings and what does he think
[1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:26.400]  of the hearings?
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:28.520]  And does he agree with me on what just happened?
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:34.200]  I don't know how the media, how the horror media, how the dinosaur media puts Humpty
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:38.680]  Dumpty back together again, because this to me was a bloodbath, even though they were
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:46.520]  trying to prop him up, they ended up ending it about 20 minutes early and look like rats
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:47.680]  running out of an aqueduct.
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.400]  Gavin McGinnis, what do you think?
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.160]  I think it's amazing how the left keeps putting all their eggs into one basket and then that
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.600]  basket turns out to have a hole in the bottom.
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:03.440]  And instead of going, uh-oh, I guess I'm wrong, they just move their eggs to the next basket.
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:07.080]  Like they pin all their hopes on some giant myth.
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:10.440]  And then when it doesn't work out, they never scratch their head like a scientist wouldn't
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:13.120]  go, maybe I'm wrong on this crusade.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:16.880]  They just keep going, all right, well, let's put them all over here now.
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:18.360]  And they're unflappable.
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.960]  Like it's sort of like, you know, these cults where they say the world's going to end on
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:27.240]  August 12th, 2016, and then it doesn't end and you go, well, that's the end of that cult.
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.040]  No, they just move the date up.
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.600]  So I don't think they're going to be that thwarted by all this evidence that the James
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.160]  Comey smoking gun isn't the James Comey smoking gun.
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:38.840]  They wanted it to be.
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:40.120]  I agree with you.
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:44.120]  And they are a cult and sociologists are now admitting that worldwide socialist collectivists,
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:48.640]  they've seen North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, everywhere else, Europe creates a nightmare.
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:52.960]  And then they just double down on more Islamists is coming in and all the answers have feminists
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.120]  wear hijabs.
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.640]  We were joking just six months ago that feminists were starting to get into Islam.
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:02.040]  Now USA Today says that's the new thing to do if you're a feminist.
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.960]  And I mean, aren't they in danger, though, of becoming so insane in their own cult that
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:10.520]  it drives more moderate people back to reality?
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:11.520]  Yeah.
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:15.560]  Well, you know, a funny thing about it is what they end up doing is pushing people to
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.920]  the right just out of spite.
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:23.320]  And another thing they're doing is politicizing people who normally wouldn't be political.
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:27.640]  So they're they're screaming about Nazis and Comey and Trump and Russia.
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:31.000]  And eventually people start going, what's I'm going to check to see what you're screaming
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  about.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Oh, you're wrong.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.880]  So they're accidentally creating an army against them.
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.040]  They are so annoying that they are getting people involved in politics.
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:43.920]  So it ends up being great for us.
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:47.800]  Well, when I was first telling people at the inauguration that I saw thousands of women
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  having a jibs handed out to them, American flag, a jibs, I said, live on air, people
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:55.160]  couldn't believe it, even though they were seeing it.
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:13:59.440]  And then I went on radio the next day when I got back to Austin on Sunday and listeners
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:00.720]  didn't believe it.
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:05.040]  And then I pulled up news articles where it admitted that George Soros spent 200 and something
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:09.520]  million just on those marches nationwide, and that it was actually an Islamic group
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:14.720]  running it nationwide with this lady we all know about that says mutilate women's genitals
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:17.960]  and jihad is good running the women's marches.
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:23.880]  I mean, in what fruitcake fantasy land are the major feminist marches run by women in
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:25.760]  a jibs?
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:27.440]  It's even crazier than that.
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:29.240]  She advocates for Sharia law.
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.560]  She's wearing she's wearing a hijab.
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:33.920]  That means that she's pro life by definition.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:36.560]  You can't wear that and be pro choice.
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:41.560]  Yet pro life women were banned from coming on the march.
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:44.920]  They also have this black woman there, I forget her name.
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:46.460]  She Donna Hilton or something.
[1:14:46.460 --> 1:14:50.320]  She murdered a gay man by sodomizing him to death.
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.160]  She's up there talking in front of LGBT people.
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:55.320]  And you watch this and you go, you know what this is?
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:01.040]  This is a microcosm of what society would be like if I handed you the keys to the city.
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:03.040]  And it would be a complete catastrophe.
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:04.480]  Oh, that's another great point.
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:06.880]  I forgot at the same march up there on DC.
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:08.600]  It was like the Legion of Doom.
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:11.040]  This woman was Sharia law and sexual mutilation.
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:17.160]  This woman raped a man to death with a broomstick and beating to death and was convicted.
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:18.160]  And I remember reading that.
[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:19.160]  I'm like, what?
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:25.800]  And it's all these gay people going, yay, we love you, so wonderful, killed Donald Trump.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:28.640]  It's fascinating because they call you and me Nazis.
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:29.640]  And we go, no, we're not.
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:33.680]  And they go, you're homophobic, you're a fascist.
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:35.560]  You want women to be second class citizens.
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:40.680]  And you go, not only are you wrong about that accusation, but everything you just said
[1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:45.360]  applies to the two women sitting right next to you that are running your movement.
[1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:47.800]  I have to take control here.
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:51.600]  We need the patriarchy because it's better for you.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:57.280]  The left is less oppressed if we don't let them run the show because they are saboteurs.
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:58.280]  Why do they run?
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:15:59.280]  And then we'll get back to the hearings.
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:00.360]  We've got McGinnis joining us here.
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:04.200]  Why do they run though to the most oppressive, weird thing?
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:07.640]  I guess just like toddlers throwing a fit, you know, riding on the wall with their own
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:08.640]  crap.
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:09.640]  It's the most violent.
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:16.400]  I remember, I think it was in World War II, we found this crazy tribe of little midgets
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:21.520]  in India who were particularly sadistic and they were incredible fighters.
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.200]  And they didn't really have an allegiance to Britain, but Britain used them.
[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:25.200]  I forget the name of them.
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:28.400]  They've got a funny little name and they're like five feet tall and they were incredible
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:29.400]  warriors.
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:32.240]  And we used them to colonize India and all over the world.
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:33.760]  It was a very effective team.
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:36.720]  In fact, they're fighting for veterans rights now as Brits.
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:41.240]  But anyway, the reason that Britain chose them is because they're just ruthless.
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:45.960]  And I think the left is choosing radical Islam, not because they agree with them philosophically,
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:49.680]  but because they're very effective, violent human beings.
[1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:54.640]  They are great henchmen because they have no morals and are happy to stab a woman.
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:57.360]  We just saw what they do to children in Manchester.
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:00.280]  So the left is so amoral, immoral.
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:04.520]  They're so sadistic that they go, I know we don't trust these guys, but let's just use
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:08.440]  them anyway to blow up the world because that's all we want is sabotage.
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:09.440]  Well said.
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:10.600]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest for the Balanced The Hour.
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.120]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 20 minutes.
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:14.640]  I want to play some more of these clips for everybody.
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:16.520]  Let's play this one because there's so many here.
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:20.760]  Comey says that he was weak, cowardly, and afraid to speak his mind.
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:24.720]  So his excuse for not going to the Justice Department when he thought something had been
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:30.440]  done wrong was to write a memo and then leak it to the press, but then admit that the president
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:33.040]  didn't do anything illegal and didn't order him to.
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.600]  So what's happening here is I'm a Democrat appointee.
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:37.600]  I'm an operative.
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:38.600]  I've been caught.
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:39.600]  The Republicans are in power.
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:40.880]  I'm scared.
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:41.880]  Just leave me alone.
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:42.880]  I'm a possum.
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  I'm playing dead.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:45.960]  But the truth is he didn't play dead.
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:49.920]  He went and made up this memo, then purged himself to Congress two months ago, saying
[1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:51.560]  nobody tried to influence him.
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:54.880]  And now in the hot seat again, he's saying no one did order him.
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.680]  So here's the clip of Comey saying he's a yellow belly.
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:07.680]  April 11th, did he ask you more ever about the Russia investigation?
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:10.400]  Did he ask you any questions?
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:16.080]  We never spoke again after April 11th.
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:20.840]  You told the president I would see what we could do.
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:22.280]  What did you mean?
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.920]  I was kind of a slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him we're not going to do
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:30.360]  that, that I would see what we could do.
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:34.120]  It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly.
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:40.760]  And then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general, Mr. Bente.
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:43.520]  So again, what do you think Comey's really trying to do?
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.080]  I mean, I know he was at this big corrupt bank with the Clintons and all tied into the
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:48.080]  Russians.
[1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:49.080]  And so is Hillary.
[1:18:49.080 --> 1:18:50.080]  So is the Podesta.
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:51.080]  So is Maxine Waters.
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:54.080]  I mean, I think they created the Russian era.
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.960]  In fact, I've been told this by higher ups, you know, that are smarter than I am in this
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:03.800]  world with the amount of information they have that that's what's happening, that they're
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:07.120]  really basically on the communist Chinese payroll and the Russians payroll.
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:09.280]  But Gavin McGinnis, what do you think's happening here?
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.200]  I mean, maybe your pay grade's higher than mine.
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:12.200]  Maybe you know what's going on.
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:13.520]  No, no, you're way smarter than me.
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:19.000]  I can't figure this out, but I do know that Trump was ridiculed for having a bad feeling
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.120]  about Comey.
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.000]  He must be wrong.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:23.120]  Trump's always wrong.
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:26.400]  And we find out that everything that Trump said was true.
[1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:30.960]  How many times has this happened, by the way, where Trump looks paranoid and he's got a
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:33.920]  hunch and we say, that's insane.
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:36.560]  And it turns out everything Trump predicted was true.
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.880]  Now, I don't think this guy is a wizard.
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:40.320]  I don't think he's Gandalf.
[1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:44.560]  I think what he does is he's smart enough to employ people who do great research for
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:48.360]  him and say, hey, Don, uh, Comey's bad news.
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:50.040]  And he goes, yeah, I was getting that by.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:51.040]  That's right.
[1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:52.040]  Gavin McGinnis, stay there.
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:53.040]  He loves you.
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:54.040]  I know he loves me.
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:56.640]  And he also goes with this guy and he is kind of like Gandalf.
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:19:57.640]  Come on.
[1:19:57.640 --> 1:19:58.960]  Let's admit it.
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:01.520]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:03.680]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?

[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:21.520]  You put this in quotes, words matter, you wrote down the words so we can all have the
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:23.080]  words in front of us now.
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:28.000]  There's 28 words there that are in quotes and it says, quote, I hope, this is the president
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  speaking, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.440]  He is a good guy.
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:37.560]  I hope you can let this go.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:39.000]  Now those are his exact words.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Is that correct?
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Correct.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.080]  Correct, okay.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:46.080]  Thank you for that.
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:50.000]  He did not direct you to let it go.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Not in his words.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  No.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  He did not order you to let it go.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Not in his words.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.080]  Again, those words are not in order.
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:24:57.080]  No.
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:59.240]  He said, I hope.
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:05.040]  Now like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:09.400]  people with criminal offenses and of course you have knowledge of the thousands of cases
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:12.080]  out there that where people have been charged.
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:18.160]  Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:25.520]  for that matter any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped for
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:27.760]  an outcome?
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:33.280]  I don't know well enough to answer and the reason I keep saying his words is I took it
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:34.280]  as a direction.
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.280]  Right.
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:39.840]  I mean as the President of the United States with me alone saying I hope this, I took it
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:41.640]  as this is what he wants me to do.
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:44.120]  Now I didn't obey that but that's the way I took it.
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:46.600]  You may have taken this as a direction but that's not what he said.
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:47.600]  Correct.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  He said, I hope.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:50.800]  Those are exact words, correct.
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.000]  You don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something, is that a fair
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  statement?
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  I don't as I sit here.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  Thank you.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  All right.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  That's Senator Resch from Idaho.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  He did a great job.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  We're going to go back to Gavin McGinniser in the short segment, long segment coming
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  up.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you just saw two big things there.
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:09.480]  I'll ask Gavin, he agrees with me on what else he sees and we're going to ask you when
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:11.960]  you open the phones up what you saw.
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:20.040]  But he commits perjury there because he said in a May 3rd congressional testimony that
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:24.400]  we played earlier, we're going to play in the next segment, that no one ever tried to
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:31.640]  influence anybody on his Russia investigation or anything else concerning.
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:37.480]  But two months before, he writes a memo saying he thinks the president did try to influencing.
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:40.960]  But now he says, but not in words.
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:44.800]  So you talk about this guy is a bigger weasel than Bill Clinton.
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.400]  This is so incredible.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:51.120]  But here he is, though, letting the memo go out to his friend, letting them misrepresent
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.880]  what's in it and saying he was ordered, though he wasn't ordered, but then like a weasel
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:02.200]  to hurt Trump, he says, though, he still felt like it because he knows there's perjury.
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:04.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so proud of him for wars.
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:05.480]  We pointed this out.
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:06.480]  We got attacked everywhere.
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:10.120]  They called it fake news when we played the clip.
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:11.120]  Next level.
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:13.800]  Gavin McGinnis, what do you make of this?
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:20.280]  You know, I think what's really going on here is America isn't used to a real deal dude
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:21.280]  as president.
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:24.120]  They're not used to this level of transparency where he says, you know what?
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  You want to investigate me?
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.160]  Go nuts, let's go Russian collusion, whatever you want.
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:29.160]  Let's do it.
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:30.440]  You can see everything.
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.880]  And they go, well, something must be up here.
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:35.440]  And then we've put we get the guy in a courtroom.
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:36.440]  We say, what happened?
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:40.080]  He said, he hoped that I wouldn't pursue this, but he didn't tell me not to.
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:44.040]  And that's why they can't find any smoking guns because they just assume that if they're
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:47.280]  allowed this kind of freedom, there must be something terrible going on because we're
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:51.960]  used to Obama sending Susan Rice to talk shows to lie.
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:55.520]  We're used to Clinton's legacy of lies.
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:58.000]  We're not used to guys saying, go ahead, go ahead and do it.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  I don't want you to.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  But that was in evidence.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.160]  His own surrogates go, no, it's not a travel ban.
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.040]  He goes, yeah, it is a travel ban.
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:07.840]  Or they go, oh, no, he's not mad at Comey about Russia.
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:09.400]  And he goes, no, actually I am.
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:10.400]  He's totally insane.
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:11.400]  It's pure crap.
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.200]  And they go, oh my gosh, you did fire him for Russia being an agent.
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:16.520]  He's going, no, he's crazy.
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:18.440]  That's why he's fired.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:22.840]  We're used to Kissinger just making problems go away in the dead of the night.
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:27.720]  We're not used to the guy that was elected on the basis of I'm a real American.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:28.920]  I'll do it right.
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:29.920]  And then he starts doing it.
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:31.720]  And we go, well, something must be up here.
[1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:37.600]  But no, that's why every time you lift up a rock, you don't find the vermin you expect
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:38.760]  to find.
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:41.320]  Because Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.600]  He's being an honest American citizen.
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.240]  He's the only president.
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:47.720]  He's the only president in 100 years that hasn't had lobbyists.
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:50.560]  He's the only one that ever got rid of them all.
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  Yep.
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:57.920]  And it's telling too that we think that hope is something that you can be arrested for.
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:59.520]  And you can go to jail for hope.
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:00.600]  We're not allowed to wonder.
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:03.960]  Remember, Clive and Bunny said, I wonder if these guys would have been better off during
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:04.960]  slavery.
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:07.600]  He was wrong, but he was pilloried for wondering that.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.340]  We keep getting people losing their careers for asking a question.
[1:29:11.340 --> 1:29:14.800]  And Trump implies, he goes, jeez, I hope you would drop this.
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:20.280]  But no, that's got to be a criminal offense because we are so desperate to make him into
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:24.440]  Hitler that there must be some sort of dictatorship going on.
[1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:26.600]  And I don't think we can convince these people otherwise.
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:27.600]  I think we should give up.
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  Well, sure.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:29.600]  I mean, a judge isn't obstructing justice.
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:33.160]  If you get up and say, I hope your honor, you can let me out of the speeding ticket.
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:37.560]  And this is the president to Alan Dershowitz says he could go even further under executive
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:38.560]  power.
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:39.560]  Maybe it's arguable.
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.840]  But undoubtedly you can say, hey, this guy's a great guy.
[1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:42.840]  You agree?
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:43.840]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:44.840]  He's all alone.
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.840]  Give me a break.
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:46.840]  There's no real evidence.
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:48.120]  And, and, and Comey has admitted all that.
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:55.200]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:55.200 --> 1:30:02.400]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:04.520]  back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:08.320]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six month
[1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:09.320]  supply for listeners.
[1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:13.600]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:16.440]  super blue research across the board is clear.
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:17.800]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:21.680]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:22.960]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:27.400]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:30:27.400 --> 1:30:29.960]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:34.120]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.120]  iodine.
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:39.760]  So the bad halogen fluoride super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:43.480]  times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:48.280]  Some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint
[1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:50.960]  oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:06.360]  time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:11.160]  I have my help today because of extendivite and if I did not take a leap of faith and
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:14.480]  try it, well I would be on disability today.
[1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:19.200]  Take one bottle of extendivite as suggested for 60 days to find out for yourself.

[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:24.440]  for you.
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:29.160]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel extendivite working for you and
[1:32:29.160 --> 1:32:31.080]  will want to take another bottle.
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:34.520]  Life is too short, get your extendivite today.

[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:22.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a smorgasbord of clips coming up to this hour in the next
[1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:28.240]  day and night who covered in his own live feed we did this morning.
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.760]  The coming implosion will be joining us later in the next hour as well.
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:41.640]  The toll free number to join us is 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:46.520]  One thing listeners that have listened a long time know, I don't come in here and get excited
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:49.080]  and tell you we're having a victory if we're not having one, and of course you can see
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:51.080]  it for yourself.
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:59.560]  But I'm really excited here, this was spectacular, the problem is most people don't have time
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:05.280]  to sit there and watch the three hour testimony or two and a half hour testimony, they ended
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:07.200]  a little bit early.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:13.440]  And so I'm looking at CNN, I'm looking at MSNBC, I'm looking at the New York Times,
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.480]  I'm seeing something different from what I actually saw, but that's why these people
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:19.960]  are losing their readers and viewers.
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:26.320]  He admitted to coming, I mean this is just insane, we're going to go into all of it,
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.680]  we got him again, he's going to take a few of your phone calls in the balance of the
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:34.960]  next 25 minutes, before I go any further, it is so important in the information war
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:35.960]  that the truth get out.
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:41.760]  We have the clips on infowars.com, excised out with Comey perjuring himself, with Comey
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:48.720]  admitting he's the leaker, with just incredible information up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:49.880]  right now.
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:55.120]  And you know this went on, you were watching, you were listening, maybe you're off today,
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:35:01.160]  it was your lunch hour, you've got to go to infowars.com or our Facebook or our Twitter
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:05.800]  and retweet or get it out on Facebook and grab these articles where he is caught.
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:08.960]  We have the different testimonies saying totally different things.
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.040]  We have him admitting that he did the leaking, that he released the memo and that the news
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:17.840]  is twisting what was in the memo and that Trump never ordered him to do anything.
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:25.080]  The media has all got more egg on its face lying about this.
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.880]  But what did Gruber say?
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:32.720]  Gruber said on Obamacare, I love the fact you have no memory, I love the fact that you're
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:37.000]  so stupid, I love the fact we can screw you over.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:42.960]  Let Comey, let Hillary, let Obama, let Gruber, let Michael Moore, let all the George Soros
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:48.880]  usual suspects know we have memories, we know what you did and we're going to take the clips
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:52.480]  of his perjury and we're going to take the clips of him now having to admit he did the
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:58.200]  leaking and we're going to subpoena the journalist he gave the memo to and we're going to get
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:01.840]  it all and we're going to expose the leaking because he admits nothing criminal happened
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:07.000]  in the memo, but he leaked a national security conversation with the president to the press
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.320]  to let the press for a month and a half put lies out to undermine him.
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:17.560]  I'm going to ask Gavin McGinnis of TheRebel.media and of course, compoundmedia.com and Twitter
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:24.200]  Gavin McGinnis, what he thinks should be done because listen, we can get caught up laughing
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:28.280]  at these people and how ridiculous they are and how out of their minds they are, but you
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.360]  know what?
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.440]  They still run the universities, they still run the media and they're still out to get
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:37.880]  us and they've blocked Trump, he keeps bitching about it, he should, the State Department,
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:42.360]  everybody else, oh we're bringing in record refugees and all the courts are blocking you
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:46.560]  and then his own agencies are following the courts when they should be following what
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:48.160]  he says under the Constitution.
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:52.880]  This is completely out of control, I mean the courts were saying let the air traffic
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:55.920]  controllers have raises, Reagan fired their bucks.
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:58.840]  So we'll talk about that with Gavin McGinnis and take your phone calls in a moment and
[1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:04.240]  play some more of these clips just briefly, spread the articles, support the new media
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:07.800]  that's exploding because we've got to get even bigger because they're trying to shut
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.240]  us down and financially.
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:13.600]  I thought everybody loves iodine, everybody loves colloidal silver, mix it with tea tree
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:17.520]  oil, mix it with a bunch of other great things like peppermint, organic, they're the biggest
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:22.240]  manufacturer of organic stuff in the country, same folks that mixed Tom's and Maine and
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:23.240]  put it out.
[1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:27.600]  And my dad's a retiring oral surgeon in Dennis, he still has his license, he developed it.
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:31.560]  It's a best seller, sold out for a couple months, it's back in and a new even better
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:35.920]  space age tube, buy it, support the broadcast, clean your teeth, save your teeth while you
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:40.800]  save the world from the globalist, infowarstore.com, go there.

[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:07.600]  like high quality, organic, non-nano, zinc, oxide based sunscreen, save your skin while
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:10.680]  you save the country and the planet from the globalist, while you fund the information
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:13.840]  war as we viciously attack the globalist.
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:17.320]  You can get those, absolutely, and of course, we just started selling them so there's no
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:18.720]  real reviews on it.
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:21.920]  Our enemies, every time we have a new product, go to the Power Reviews, do some fake reviews,
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:24.760]  they drive it down to three stars, and once people actually get it, they all go vote on
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:28.440]  the products and it gets, you know, 4.8 stars, the highest that Power Reviews and others
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:29.440]  have ever seen.
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:32.960]  This just came out a few weeks ago, and those are fake reviews that come through.
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:38.000]  Something else, the average of over 50,000 reviews on the site is 4.8 at Power Reviews.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.160]  They've never seen anything like it, but you can see it has three stars there because people
[1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:44.280]  are jerks and they go do that before real folks have done their reviews because there's
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:45.280]  two reviews there.
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:51.520]  But you've got the big pack, 25% off when you get an auto ship, 20% off retail, it's
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:54.840]  one of the top three organic brands in the country, private labeled by us.
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:58.120]  That's why you recognize the bottle, everybody's pretty much seen this.
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.040]  My daughter this morning says, I've seen this before, dad, and I go, yeah, we use it.
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.040]  The brand name is this at Whole Foods, but the owner is a fan, and let's just put it
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:08.120]  out 20% less directly to people.
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:11.040]  This is such a big deal because they've got a line of over 40 products.
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:15.880]  This is the first six, it's made in the USA, cruelty free, all natural, gluten free, certified
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:23.760]  organic, SLS free, chemical free, it's the best out there at the price that's just unbelievable.
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:24.760]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:29.920]  Okay, I'm done plugging, but we do need your support now more than ever, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:30.920]  Going back to Gavin McGinnis.
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:36.360]  I've been asking some of the questions here before we play some more clips and go to calls.
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:37.360]  What else is on your radar?
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:38.720]  What do you want to talk about?
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:45.080]  And really, where do you think the ball is in the fight for freedom with real liberalism,
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:50.560]  real constitutionalism, pro-human renaissance versus the cancer that's modern liberalism?
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:53.240]  Well, I have some great news.
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:57.560]  And the great news is that truth is on our side and lies run sprints.
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:03.400]  And I'm still going to fight all of these people, but Comey is a great example of give
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:09.200]  him enough rope and this guy is hanging himself and the left is cannibalizing each other.
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:11.640]  What are the, look at the three things that have come out today.
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:18.000]  One, he's conceded that he's a coward, two, he's conceded that he was leaking, three,
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.160]  he's conceded that Trump never told him to stop.
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:22.400]  He just said he'd hope he would stop.
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:27.360]  And now we have CNN calling the New York Times fake news.
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:30.720]  So the left demanded we do this, they want to see what's going on with Comey.
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.800]  We said, okay, you want it, you want scrutiny, you want meritocracy, you want justice here.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.960]  And we just see nothing but filth.
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:40.120]  And this is just happening right now with that guy.
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:45.040]  You know, Kurt Eichenwald, he's a MSNBC guy.
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:49.400]  So a long time ago, he was getting an argument with someone on Twitter and they sent a gift
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:54.280]  of, and then he, I think he lied, but he said he had a seizure from the gift and prosecuted
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:55.280]  the guy.
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:57.800]  So you see that and you go, I wish I could get justice.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.080]  I know he's lying.
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:00.240]  I feel it in my bones.
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:05.080]  I wish I could, there was some sort of retribution and you go, just give him enough rope.
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:07.480]  And then today we catch him.
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:12.520]  He tweets out a picture of hentai porn on his computer.
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:15.040]  He didn't realize it was in the top tabs.
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:19.440]  And here we see he's looking at anime tentacle porn or something.
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:20.440]  Now let me be clear.
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:26.000]  I got sent this like six a.m. this morning by one of my friends and I've got to be honest,
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.960]  I didn't want to search it because I don't even know what it is to show my ignorance.
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:34.200]  Do we know what it's supposedly like associated with underage stuff, but it's also like monsters
[1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:37.960]  raping babies or something in monsters, raping young girls.
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:42.880]  I mean, I, I know of this mostly through Kent, uh, Kurt's defense story.
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:47.640]  He sits, I just saw hentai this morning and then they go, Kurt is now defending himself
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:49.160]  going, no, no, no, look.
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:52.680]  My children didn't believe me that tentacle porn is a thing.
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:55.040]  So my wife and I, what?
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.280]  My wife and I got on the computer to show them that it does exist.
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.360]  Nice defense, by the way.
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  Sure.
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:06.120]  Well, I, without even surfing porn sites, but if you go to more, you know, racy sites
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:12.440]  to get news and info, they'll have pop up where it'll show like anime, you know, girls
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:13.440]  kissing or something.
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:17.260]  And then like a big goblin jumps into the screen and starts, you know, trying to have
[1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:18.260]  sex with them.
[1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:19.260]  You think this?
[1:42:19.260 --> 1:42:20.260]  Yes.
[1:42:20.260 --> 1:42:21.260]  It's, it's strange rape porn.
[1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:22.260]  I don't know.
[1:42:22.260 --> 1:42:25.680]  The Japanese, the Japanese are sort of like a canary and a coal mine of our culture and
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:30.680]  they've become so gender segregated that I don't think men even speak to women anymore.
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:35.520]  So they're often some crazy porn tangent that's nine million years into the future.
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:40.040]  I hope we never get there, but they, they are enjoying this kind of filth and a lot of sad
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:43.440]  perverts I think in the West are into it too.
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:48.960]  But the point of all this is we were mad at Kurt for what we thought was lying, what we
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:51.880]  assume is lying and he just hanged himself.
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:54.000]  So this just happened with Comey.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.160]  This just keeps happening again and again with the left.
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:02.800]  They demand something, they demand meritocracy, they demand justice and we end up learning
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:06.040]  how low on justice and low on merit.
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:07.040]  Everything about them is.
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:08.040]  Sure.
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:10.560]  And now that I think of it, I have had it pumping my phone too.
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:14.440]  I guess it was from Japan, I had text on it about a year ago.
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:20.760]  It was Xenomorph from like the movie Alien raping children and then ripping them in half.
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:24.720]  And so I think yes, that's, that's what this is, it's like, basically it's snuff film
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:25.720]  porn.
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:26.720]  Yes.
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:27.720]  But it's not real.
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:28.800]  It's like simulated.
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:30.240]  Are you remotely surprised?
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:35.760]  You know, I had the New York Times interview me recently and they did a hit piece.
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:40.520]  We have a group called the Proud Boys, a multi-racial group that has plenty of gays, Jews, blacks,
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:41.520]  whatever.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:44.800]  We're just Western chauvinists and we were started to create self-defense because I
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:48.160]  was getting pepper sprayed when I went to talks and Lawrence Southern was getting attacked
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:51.840]  and Hank Holter was having bricks thrown at her and getting banned.
[1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:53.600]  So we said, we'll protect everyone.
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:56.600]  We'll protect Shapiro, Crowder, you, everyone.
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  And we won't start fights, but we'll finish them.
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:01.400]  And the New York Times doesn't like that.
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:05.440]  And so this journalist did this hit and said we're a white pride group, blah, blah, blah.
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:09.840]  Now you're criticizing, you know, animations of demons with murdering small children.
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:11.240]  I mean, and raping them to death.
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:12.240]  How dare you be?
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:15.720]  So you're now a child porn phobe?
[1:44:15.720 --> 1:44:16.720]  Yes.
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:18.840]  I certainly am a proud child.
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:20.760]  I'm a proud pedophobe.
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:24.040]  But the interesting thing about this guy is they sit and they have beers with you, these
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:27.800]  journalists and they try to, you know, be your friend and they can't hold their liquor.
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:32.240]  And so this guy was drinking and he confessed that his wife, Alan Foyer is his name, New
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:33.320]  York Times writer.
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:39.000]  He confessed that his wife and their feminist dogma became such a burden that she gave up
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  on kids.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  She became a workaholic.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Her hair started falling out.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.180]  Their marriage fell apart.
[1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:45.680]  And then he starts dating a teenager, this guy.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:50.240]  He's dating, I think they've broken up now, but he leaves his wife for a 19-year-old.
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:55.120]  And I'm just looking at it and I'm thinking, you guys are Ratso Rizzo from Midnight Cowboy.
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:45:03.320]  You guys are slimy, insidious, assiduous parasites that would throw away everything.
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:08.840]  I was about to say, the older and more manly you get, the more you are looking for, you
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:13.400]  know, the real meat on the bone, supercharged woman.
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  But not leftist.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:19.360]  They want, you know, 20, 30, 40 years younger than them so they can dominate and control
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:20.880]  and feel intellectual.
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:21.880]  They're slime.
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:23.280]  They're creeps.
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:29.080]  All these betas, they screw their interns, they're incurious, they're immoral.
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:30.080]  They're not good people.
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:35.040]  Every time you read an article that says Nazi or something, take the name and go look up
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:36.040]  that person.
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:39.280]  And you'll find someone without kids, you'll find someone who's unmarried, you'll find
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:43.560]  a woman whose ovaries have dried up and you realize you didn't choose journalism because
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:44.840]  you're curious.
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:47.840]  You chose journalism for revenge.
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:53.000]  You are mad that your liberal dogma painted you into a corner of loneliness and being
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.920]  a dog mom and you want to punish us.
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:45:59.320]  Oh yeah, that's something Meg and Kelly was asking me and they always asked me this and
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:02.760]  John Ronson was texting me asking, like, you must not have had friends.
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:04.560]  You must be angry at the world.
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:07.000]  You must, it's why, I said, no, no, you're projecting.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.560]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but when I was in Dallas, I was the most popular person in
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.560]  the school.
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:12.560]  Okay.
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:15.200]  When I moved down to Austin, I hung out with the most popular people, had the greatest
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:16.200]  time.
[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:17.520]  My whole life's been nothing but total success.
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:18.680]  I've got four children.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:19.840]  I'm super successful.
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:24.080]  I'm changing the world and you look at my ancestors, it's basically all the same.
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:28.560]  Founding Texas, founding America, creating the stock exchange, dominating, doing everything.
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:32.840]  I mean, thank God for my genetics, but these people always think that I'm doing this because
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:36.920]  I'm not going to be overrun and controlled by a bunch of twisted filth.
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:41.360]  Hey, if you want to know who's corrupt, see who you can't criticize.
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  We're open to debate.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:43.360]  You have a problem with me?
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  I'd love to discuss it.
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:45.560]  You have a problem with my beliefs?
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:46.680]  I'd love to hash them out.
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:50.740]  I think that we always do well because we're totally open and brave enough to confront
[1:46:50.740 --> 1:46:52.240]  everyone about everything.
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:57.200]  But they are communists, so they have to hide behind propaganda, hide behind fear, hide
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:46:59.320]  behind... It's not free speech.
[1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:00.320]  It's hate speech.
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:01.320]  We can't do this.
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:02.320]  We can't do that.
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:05.920]  I've been talking to millennials a lot because they come to my show and the guys who wear
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:10.480]  MAGA hats will say, inevitably, I'll meet a girl and she'll say, oh, you like Trump,
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:11.480]  screw you.
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:15.200]  And then I'll get a call the next day saying, I can't stop thinking about you.
[1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:20.400]  And I think the moral of the story here is liberals and especially feminists don't want
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:22.640]  the utopia that they pretend they want.
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.920]  They know it's a dystopia and ultimately they want to be disciplined.
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:31.560]  They want someone who is confident and happy to hash it out because the first part of that
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:32.560]  is happy.
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:36.120]  And by the way, I'm not trying to get here and brag and say I was the coolest guy in
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  high school.
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:40.280]  I just thought back then I wanted to get out of high school.
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:43.800]  I thought it was boring and stupid and my friends were in college because I thought the
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:45.800]  girls were better looking and the parties were better.
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:49.480]  It's not like I was trying to be cool, but... And I'm not bragging.
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:50.640]  It's just that I've got to let them know.
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:52.160]  I've always been successful.
[1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:53.520]  I've always been the alpha.
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:56.760]  I've always been winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:47:58.200]  That's why I recognize Trump.
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:47:59.400]  He recognizes that.
[1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:01.080]  We want the Renaissance again.
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:04.720]  That's what the West is about, not wanting to beat everybody else so you can be better
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:09.400]  than them, but so we all just are awesome and all come together and absolutely have competition
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:10.880]  and go to the stars.
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:13.360]  Hey, we tried Revenge of the Nerds.
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:16.040]  We stopped wedging these guys for eight years.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:17.040]  It didn't go well.
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:19.200]  I did this in high school actually.
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:24.360]  We started our own thing, a bunch of punk rockers, and this nerd who no one liked, we
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:26.720]  thought, you come into our gang.
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:31.160]  We want to piss off the jocks, we want to think outside the box, and he drank his guts.
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:36.080]  He drank a whole bottle of vodka, remember him screaming, Tammy Cogglal, I love you,
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:40.200]  and then projectile vomiting, and I realized we've made a mistake here.
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:45.920]  We empowered someone who deserves a wedgie, and that's what all of journalism is today.
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:51.480]  It's bitter, angry nerds who should be hanging from a basketball hoop by the waistband of
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:52.480]  their underwear.
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:55.960]  Well, and I think that's over some location, but it's definitely true that you get big
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.640]  groups of nerds together, whether they're yuppie nerds or trendy nerds.
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:04.120]  I mean, I think of a nerd too as a guy trying to be perfectly wasp-ish and acting like he's
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  somebody he isn't.
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.080]  There's a guy in a cowboy hat who's never been on a horse.
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:11.440]  There's all these different forms of fakes and nerds that aren't real people.
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:13.880]  I don't even know if nerds are the word.
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:14.880]  What about posers?
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:15.880]  Pussies?
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:17.880]  Can we say pussies?
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:18.880]  Absolutely.
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:19.880]  Yeah, I think they're people.
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:24.120]  I noticed this with the Proud Boys, they go, yes, but you guys condone violence.
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:28.080]  And I said, well, yeah, we condone violence if we're getting attacked.
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:29.680]  I mean, what do you want us to do?
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:34.200]  Sit there and allow these antifa lunatics to pepper spray us and not fight back.
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:40.440]  We just had that Australian Alex Jones get attacked by antifa and he beat them all up.
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:42.880]  And I think the left goes, well, why are you being violent?
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.360]  And you go, because they drew first blood, I don't pick fights, but I finished them.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:53.400]  And I think that's totally foreign to a lot of the media class because they're wimps.
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:54.400]  Absolutely.
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  I'm going to skip this break.
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:56.400]  We have more time.
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:49:57.680]  Again, it's to go to your phone calls and play clips.
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:49:59.920]  This is a very important clip.
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:06.400]  This is, again, where we have coming, coming out and admitting that the New York Times
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:10.080]  got it wrong in the main about the Russia story.
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:14.160]  So he's leaking directly to them in the Washington Post, but saying then they got it wrong.
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:16.440]  Here it is.
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:22.920]  I remember you talked with us shortly after February 14th when the New York Times wrote
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:29.120]  an article that suggested that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians.
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.240]  You remember reading that article when it first came out?
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.240]  I do.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.560]  It was about allegedly extensive electronic surveillance, direct communication.
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:40.840]  And that upset you to the point where you actually went out and surveyed the intelligence
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:43.560]  community to see whether you were missing something in that.
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  Is that correct?
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:45.560]  That's correct.
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:47.760]  I want to be careful and open-sighted.
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:49.560]  I'm not going to go any further than that.
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:51.480]  So thank you.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:56.600]  In addition to that, after that, you sought out both Republican and Democrat senators
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:04.240]  to tell them that, hey, I don't know where this is coming from, but this is not factual.
[1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:05.240]  You recall that?
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:06.240]  Yes.
[1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:07.240]  Okay.
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:12.680]  So, again, so the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:13.680]  not true.
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:16.080]  Is that a fair statement?
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:17.640]  In the main, it was not true.
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:22.160]  And again, all of you know this, American people don't, the challenge that I'm not
[1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:25.800]  picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information is the people
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:29.880]  talking about it often don't really know what's going on, and those of us who actually
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:32.040]  know what's going on are not talking about it.
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:35.760]  And we don't call the press to say, hey, you got that thing wrong about this sensitive
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:36.760]  topic.
[1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:38.200]  We just have to leave it there.
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:43.840]  I mentioned to the chairman the nonsense around what influenced me to make the July 5th statement.
[1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:47.760]  Nonsense, but I can't go explaining how it's nonsense.
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:52.620]  No, you just put out memos and leak stuff against the president, and then know full
[1:51:52.620 --> 1:51:57.240]  well they're going to twist it and lie about it, and then claim, oh, sorry, Jeepers Creepers,
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  Gavin McGinnis.
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:04.040]  It's strange that he's sitting there saying, I can't talk to the press right after he admitted
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:06.600]  that he's the leak.
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:11.360]  It's a cognitive dissonance going on there that I don't think he realizes how badly he's
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:12.920]  incriminated himself.
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:16.240]  Is he at this hearing?
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:17.400]  That's a good way to put it.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:18.400]  He's hung himself.
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:19.400]  Was he at the hearing?
[1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:24.400]  He's just flip-flopping, incriminating, perjuring, because he's been in all these different hearings.
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:25.400]  He is lying.
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:27.400]  We don't know about what, but he's 180-ing.
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:30.080]  In fact, since you mentioned it, a lot of people probably just tuned in.
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:33.480]  They're like, oh, I've heard of Alex Jones before, because we're on over 200 stations
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:34.480]  around the country.
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:35.840]  That's the guy that's fake news.
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:39.280]  He says that the Trump was going to win the election and that the polls were fake, and
[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:41.160]  of course, oh, he was proven right.
[1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:44.520]  But just in case they just tuned in, because the mainstream media probably won't tell them
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:49.080]  this, at least until we force them to, oh, guess what?
[1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:53.120]  He said today that that's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:55.960]  Well, let's just play the clip.
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:53:00.640]  President tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes.
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:04.680]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally,
[1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:08.920]  that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape, and my
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:12.840]  judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square, and so I asked a friend
[1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:18.120]  of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, didn't do it myself for a
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:21.960]  variety of reasons, but I asked him to, because I thought that might prompt the appointment
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  of a special counsel.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:25.200]  And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:27.200]  And was that after firing?
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:28.640]  No, no, no.
[1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:29.640]  Who was that?
[1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:33.440]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:37.480]  We now have the name of the article right here, it needs to be subpoenaed.
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:44.200]  Obviously, we'll go back to Gavin, your call's in a moment, but just think about this.
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:50.040]  Trump comes out and says, I did not ask him to stop the investigation, but I have said
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:52.960]  it's a bunch of bull, and that Flynn's a good guy.
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:55.080]  Like I've said in press conferences, it should be left alone.
[1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.480]  But that's my opinion, I didn't order him to.
[1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:00.960]  And of course, then he goes, oh, I need corroboration, because of what Trump was saying.
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:05.560]  He runs out, puts out the memo, so they can then lie about it, and then plays dumb when
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:07.160]  it's an illegal leak.
[1:54:07.160 --> 1:54:09.400]  And I, why is he so confident?
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:12.720]  I mean, like I said, is he at the same hearing that we're watching?
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:16.440]  It's pretty bizarre, and I think CNN has realized it.
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:23.760]  I mean, CNN had a big ticking clock on their desk at a show yesterday, and once they realized
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:28.640]  that he's not going to be the smoking gun they thought he would, they removed the clock
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:33.880]  from the desk, because they're cutting their losses right now, they're throwing the dead
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.720]  weight off of the airplane to go a little farther on this tangent.
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:41.040]  But Comey is just going for broken.
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:44.600]  I think him and a lot of liberals don't understand it.
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  You put all your eggs in this basket, and there's a hole in the basket, and all your
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:49.320]  eggs just smashed.
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:53.120]  And this has happened time and time again, and they just don't wake up.
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.440]  I mean, I'm in New York City.
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:00.840]  I talk to people every day who are convinced that, they're very disgusting about it too.
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:04.200]  I won't get into the details, but the way they talk about Trump and Putin makes hentai
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:06.200]  porn look friendly.
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:09.000]  And you go, what's the evidence here?
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  What's going on?
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:13.640]  And again, if it was Obama's administration or the Clinton administration, they would
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:15.200]  have just made it go away.
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.880]  They would have canceled the investigation, that would have been the end of that.
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:20.040]  And we've become numb to corruption.
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:24.920]  So when someone allows an investigation to continue and says, I hope you'd stop, but
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:28.760]  don't, we don't have a file in our brain for it, because we're not used to this kind
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:29.760]  of trend.
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:32.840]  They thought then they would claim he's corrupt, because he's not.
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:35.360]  But now they're engaged in corruption, trying to get him.
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  So they're being hoisted on their own petard, as they say.
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:40.720]  I want to go to some phone calls right now again, McGinnis, in the closing minutes.
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:41.720]  We've got him.
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:42.720]  He's got to go.
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:43.720]  He's got his own show too.
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:45.600]  We'll talk to you five more minutes the next hour to get a few more in.
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:48.040]  But again, we're not like the globalists left.
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:51.280]  We don't just say, this was a train wreck to say it.
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.040]  I mean, this was a spectacular death star blowing up moment.
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:58.680]  These two and a half hours, we're going over more clips.
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:01.360]  This is the most incredible stuff I've ever seen, Gavin.
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:06.960]  Well, I feel like it's sort of like the left, they keep digging their own grave.
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:11.680]  There was a lesbian bookstore in Canada that said, we need laws against pornography.
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:12.680]  It's sexist.
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:13.680]  It's disgusting.
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:14.680]  It's horrible.
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:15.680]  And they changed the laws in Canada.
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:20.360]  The next thing you know, this lesbian bookstore can't import any of their content because
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:23.800]  they screwed themselves with their own parameters.
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:26.440]  And the left does this to themselves again and again.
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:27.760]  They're their own worst enemy.
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:28.960]  They demand transparency.
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:29.960]  They demand meritocracy.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:34.000]  Well, look how the Islamists just keep bombing gay nightclubs and, you know, teeny-bopper
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  deals.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:36.520]  And I say, why is the left bringing people in that kill them?
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:39.240]  And then the media says, I say the girls deserve to die.
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:42.600]  No, I said, why did your parents bring in the Muslims that killed them?
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:43.960]  I didn't kill the girls.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:45.280]  Megan Kelly asked me that.
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:49.360]  Like I killed the girls, you know, up there at the Manchester deal.
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  Let's go to a phone call.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:53.040]  Will, Jason, Stephen, Cole, Chris and others.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:56.280]  Then we got Roger Stone popping in with breaking news and more.
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:57.480]  Who's up first here?
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:56:59.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Will in Florida.
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:01.680]  Will, you're on the air with Gavin McGinnis.
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:04.240]  Hey, good afternoon, guys.
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:07.160]  Pretty interesting discussion you guys got going.
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:13.600]  I got a question for Gavin and basically has to do with Trump first, just to say really
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:14.920]  quickly that call me thing.
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:17.040]  I know that's going to be the talk of the town.
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:19.080]  I'm glad it came out how it did.
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:24.240]  But Gavin, would you be interested in like meeting up at the White House with a bunch
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:25.560]  of like-minded people?
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:30.200]  Because I remember when Ron Paul was on, I was just thinking, why Ron Paul doesn't deserve
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:31.280]  to get in the White House?
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:34.480]  Why Ron Paul doesn't deserve to be in the Oval Office?
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:38.120]  And instead of being like a bad builder, it'll be like a good builder.
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  Would you be interested in going to that?
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  Absolutely.
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  What about you, Gavin?
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:43.120]  Of course.
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.120]  I'm kind of pissed off.
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  I've never met him.
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:46.120]  I feel ripped off.
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:49.280]  Everyone thinks that Trump spends his secret paychecks and all that stuff.
[1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:54.720]  If I have to deal with the stigma of that lie, I should get at least one beer with the
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  guy.
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  I feel I've been gypped.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:59.960]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[1:57:59.960 --> 1:58:05.800]  The president's so busy in fighting and winning so good that even though I'm going to give
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:08.840]  the press something here, I've been invited and could have gone and met with the president.
[1:58:08.840 --> 1:58:10.400]  I'm like, sir, you're too busy.
[1:58:10.400 --> 1:58:11.400]  You don't worry about that.
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:12.800]  This is our battle for all of us.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:15.120]  This is defeating the globalists for our children.
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:19.320]  It isn't about being celebrities and hanging out with Trump, but I get your point, Gavin.
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:23.600]  I mean, obviously it'd be great, but we're winning the culture war.
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:25.400]  We're getting our taxes cut, hopefully.
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:26.480]  We're securing our borders.
[1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:28.160]  We're bringing back sovereignty.
[1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:29.760]  We're standing at full correctness.
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:30.960]  That's the win.
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:31.960]  That's what it's all about.
[1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:34.240]  Gavin, I know you're probably going to go up and do five more with us.
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:36.760]  Give us your take on that and a few more calls straight ahead.
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:37.760]  Thank you, Will.
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:38.760]  Great questions.
[1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:39.760]  Stay with us.
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:40.760]  I am fired up.
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:41.760]  Comey just blew up.
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:43.760]  Comey just melted like the wicked wedge.
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:45.480]  He just hung himself.
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:46.800]  He just disintegrated.
[1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:50.040]  He just wrote down the bomb.
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:52.040]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:55.640]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's
[1:58:55.640 --> 1:58:57.760]  was at the same point in his presidency.
[1:58:57.760 --> 1:59:02.040]  That's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's
[1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:06.320]  involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network
[1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:07.320]  news.
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:10.800]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:13.240]  than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:16.560]  While Trump's approval ratings only hovering around the 40 percent mark, he's still doing
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:20.840]  better than Clinton, who only had 37 percent approval at 138 days in.
[1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:25.080]  Of course, Trump's disapproval ratings also higher than Clinton's at 57 percent compared
[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:26.880]  to Clinton's 49 percent.
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:27.880]  But what do you expect?
[1:59:27.880 --> 1:59:32.040]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:35.240]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under
[1:59:35.240 --> 1:59:37.920]  constant assault even before he got elected.
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:41.920]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the
[1:59:41.920 --> 1:59:44.600]  fake media's narrative is dying.
[1:59:44.600 --> 1:59:51.600]  For more information, please visit infowars.com or call infowars.com or call infowars.com.
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:40.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, CNN has had to admit that it reported massive
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:48.680]  amounts of fake news surrounding Comey, because they just ran with all these lies that just
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:49.680]  got abolished.
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.040]  But to see in his credit, most of the other fake news isn't even reporting on that right
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.040]  now.
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:59.760]  Gavin McGinnis, this is such a huge explosion or implosion, I don't know how they can cover
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:00.760]  this up.
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:03.840]  I mean, I guess if they try, it'll be even more spectacular.
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:07.560]  This is as bad as them saying Hillary was ahead in all those rigged polls.
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:10.680]  It really is a total catastrophe for the left.
[2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:15.520]  And isn't it amazing, by the way, that the New York Times was able to destroy that brand?
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:19.600]  I mean, Times Square is named after the New York Times.
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:23.240]  It's been the paper of record for generations.
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:29.440]  And then Pinch comes along, Arthur Salzburger Jr., runs it into the ground with his obsession
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:33.680]  with, I don't know, multiculturalism in different restaurants and his hatred of the family.
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:36.440]  I don't really know what his total agenda is.
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:40.880]  And then he has to sell it to a Mexican billionaire.
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:43.960]  And the next thing you know, they have a bunch of bloggers running the show.
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:47.960]  Did you know they call President Trump Mr. Trump in their articles?
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:52.360]  Not in op-ed, but in normal articles, he's referred to as Mr. Trump.
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:56.920]  Have you all heard of this when you're typing on the computer, Trump isn't capitalized in
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:57.920]  the spell check?
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:00.680]  No, I haven't seen that.
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:01.680]  At least on iPhones.
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:02.680]  I mean, you're right.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:03.680]  They don't even call him the president.
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:05.840]  And again, it isn't about worshiping Trump.
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:09.880]  It's so good to see a blue-collar billionaire literally not care what they do and to see
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:10.880]  them folding.
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:11.880]  Yes.
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.480]  And they go, get him off Twitter.
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:14.720]  We want to control the narrative.
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:15.720]  No, no, no, no.
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:16.720]  And look how arrogant they are.
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:17.720]  Get off Twitter.
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:18.720]  Get off Twitter.
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:19.720]  Get off Twitter.
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:20.720]  Get off Twitter.
[2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:21.880]  What is that?
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:23.560]  It is, I want to control the narrative.
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:28.360]  Remember with the WikiLeaks, we had Cuomo over at, what was it, MSNBC.
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:29.360]  See it in.
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:30.600]  He said, we're only allowed to read it.
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:31.600]  You can't.
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:33.120]  I'll control this.
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.160]  And we're seeing this with the statues in New Orleans.
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:39.200]  I'll take down the statues and I'll put them in this museum over here.
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:41.360]  And then I'll tell you what the statues mean.
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:42.960]  It's all about controlling the narrative.
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:44.400]  It's all about power.
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:48.760]  And the funny thing about us is they call us fascists, but we are about the least power
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:49.760]  possible.
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.240]  We want to dismantle the government.
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:54.960]  We want everyone to control their own narrative and that is seen as fascism.
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:55.960]  Well, sure.
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:59.480]  I mean, first it's, say, gay and unhomosexual, then it's, let me take down the statue.
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:01.280]  Then it's, don't use the word mother or father.
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:02.840]  They want to control language.
[2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:03.840]  Yeah.
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:09.720]  I heard Reza Aslan call the founding fathers our four parents.
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:11.440]  You can't say fathers now.
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.080]  And that's why Trump was elected because someone said stop saying anchor baby.
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:20.400]  They gave a long involved definition of what it should be, children of undocumented peoples
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:21.400]  or whatever.
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:23.200]  And he goes, nah, I'm going to say anchor baby.
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:26.000]  And I think America is saying, nah, I'm done listening to you.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:27.240]  I'm done listening to the WIMPs.
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:28.240]  That's right.
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:29.240]  I'm done not wedging you.
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:30.240]  We're in control now.
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:32.720]  One more quick call and I'll come back to the rest of you, but we haven't got to go.
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:33.920]  I'm in Connecticut.
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:34.920]  You're on the air.
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:35.920]  Welcome.
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:36.920]  Hey, Alex.
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:37.920]  How you doing?
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:38.920]  I'm doing real good.
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  I mean, the boy, they're not going to put this toothpaste back in the tube.
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:49.480]  Well, um, you know, I've been listening since 2003, kind of took a break for a long while.
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:55.240]  They're an Obama administration, um, just be learning, uh, reading up as much as I can
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.800]  about history, just to get myself aware because I felt like such an idiot back then for not
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:00.800]  knowing anything.
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:03.480]  But anyway, getting back to Comey.
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:09.400]  So my analysis, I, it's looking like Comey is probably going to take the fall for this.
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:11.440]  He's going to perjure himself.
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:15.360]  He's going to get that all to put the case against Trump.
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:16.560]  They want to make him a Patsy.
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:21.560]  He'll say that Comey had to leak to the press to get the special counsel prosecutor or
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  whatever.
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:24.280]  And I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to you.
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:25.280]  I'm going to come back to you.
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:26.280]  I'm going to come back to you.
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:29.240]  Uh, Jason, real quick, just go on hold so Gavin can have a comment.
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:32.680]  I think that is what they're kind of setting up with him saying, I had to do bad things.
[2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:33.680]  Get the special prosecutor.
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:34.680]  What do you think?
[2:04:34.680 --> 2:04:36.640]  And does Comey know?
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:38.760]  Does he understand what's happening to him right now?
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:44.200]  Is he aware of his surroundings, calling yourself the leak, saying that you lied, pretending
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.120]  that hope was a command to stop?
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.400]  These are all huge deals, my friend.
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:50.520]  You're in big trouble.
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:51.520]  Does he notice this?
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:54.640]  All right, Gavin McGinnis, you're on fire and so are we.
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:57.760]  We'll be back with Roger Stone, your calls, David Knight and more.
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:04:59.680]  Stay with us.
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:03.560]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with the
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:05.240]  Bush administration.
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:10.200]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:12.200]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Ray.
[2:05:12.200 --> 2:05:17.880]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Ray a man of impeccable credentials, including
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:22.480]  serving as the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division under George
[2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:23.720]  W. Bush.
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:28.680]  Ray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:32.400]  role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:37.400]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:41.680]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered
[2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:46.000]  by the White House, but according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:49.840]  and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:52.880]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:53.880]  I'm Jeff Goba.
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:58.880]  I'm reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:00.680]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:07.000]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:12.360]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:13.360]  and high quality.
[2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:19.560]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[2:06:19.560 --> 2:06:24.720]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it, and if they're such patriots, they have let us
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:27.040]  basically keep their well-known packaging.
[2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:28.040]  It is an answer to prayer.

[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Great.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  Hey, thank you so much.

[2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:19.240]  and infusion.
[2:07:19.240 --> 2:07:20.240]  I've got the body armor.
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:21.240]  Wow.
[2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:22.240]  Thank you.
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:23.880]  You're the type of lesser that makes it all possible.
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:25.520]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:29.240]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:30.240]  That's amazing.
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:31.240]  That's really incredible.
[2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:34.400]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:35.400]  sweet.
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:41.040]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the InfowarsTrue and I just want to
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:45.680]  say, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:46.680]  John, buy it.
[2:07:46.680 --> 2:07:47.680]  You will love it.
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:49.960]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[2:07:54.360 --> 2:08:13.520]  So win, win, infowarslife.com.
[2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:15.200]  A dark day for Comey.
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:17.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:18.200]  A dark day.
[2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:23.200]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[2:08:23.200 --> 2:08:26.920]  Yes, the truth has come for them.
[2:08:26.920 --> 2:08:31.200]  You dig a hole for your brother to fall in it, you fall in it.
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:33.400]  That's biblical.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:38.280]  Trump's open approach to not engaging in chicanery, not doing illegal things, and just
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:40.080]  being open is devastating them.
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:44.120]  And now we have Comey, if you've just joined us, these clips are coming up admitting he
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:50.120]  was the leaker of the memo and then let them put out lies about the memo and then laughs
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:55.080]  about it saying it's not his fault because it's classified, but he was scared.
[2:08:55.080 --> 2:08:56.080]  He was cowardly.
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  He was weak.
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.840]  These are his quotes, weak, cowardly, afraid.
[2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:07.160]  Those are quotes to tell the attorney general about it so he had a memo he sat on illegally.
[2:09:07.160 --> 2:09:09.000]  That's a crime.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:15.240]  Now we've got congressional testimony that contradicts his memo and his newest testimony
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:16.360]  that contradicts it.
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:17.720]  He's lying.
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:23.880]  He's perjuring himself, those headlines with the video clips for you, my beautiful info
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:25.120]  warriors.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:28.560]  Of every race, color, and creed, there is only one race, humanity.
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:32.520]  You can access infowars.com right now.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.660]  We have the perjury article with the videos.
[2:09:35.660 --> 2:09:41.320]  We have the admissions that Trump never ordered him to stop the investigation.
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:43.120]  Totally destroying MSM.
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:45.840]  We have him admitting that he's the leaker committing the crime.
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.280]  I mean, this is delicious.
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:54.160]  And we have the articles on infowars.com with the video of him admitting Loretta Lynch.
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:57.600]  Ask him to not call it an investigation.
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:05.360]  That is the essence of obstruction of justice, the higher up going into an investigation
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:07.560]  and saying shut it down, basically.
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:11.160]  We need to create a master article, maybe Paul Watson can do it or anybody else that
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:16.640]  just says, 10 facts that destroy Comey, the Democrats and the Russian investigation, or
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:18.560]  the crimes that the testimony shows.
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.840]  I mean, this is unbelievable, total and complete reversal.
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:30.760]  Now, I follow my intellectual gut, and I follow my own research, and I follow my sources.
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:35.600]  And I told you on election night, the big battle was coming, and that things were going
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:37.440]  to be tougher than even the election.
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:40.720]  And I told Roger Stone when he was sitting right there beside me, and we were drinking
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:42.760]  champagne.
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:46.760]  I was shaken by it, and I went and did hours more live, drugs linked to it.
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:48.760]  I went live like 4.30 in the morning.
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:52.360]  Got to pull that speech up I gave it there, that was powerful.
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:58.000]  Not bragging sometimes the show's unlistable, but I know what is powerful.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.040]  And I said to Stone about two weeks ago on the phone, and I started on air, you all heard
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:02.040]  it.
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:05.200]  I said, Trump has totally turned the corner.
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:08.960]  It looks like he's going down because they're freaking out and throwing everything they've
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:12.280]  got, they're lying, this stuff's all lies.
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:16.640]  And when I saw it literally, literally, more than 50 lies a day that would give me headaches,
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:17.640]  there was so much.
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.840]  I couldn't even, chronically at all, it was all cut and dry stuff.
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:24.200]  All cut and dry.
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:27.440]  I gave away the location of the secret submarines, and it's like a Pentagon press release, there
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:30.800]  they are in Seoul, South Korea, you know, two weeks before.
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:38.080]  So, going to our guest, Roger Stone, I can tell you now that Trump has massively turned
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:39.440]  the corner with the public.
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.040]  I knew the Hillary polls were fake, I had my sources, I know how they operate, I read
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:48.080]  the methodology, the polls that he's only at 48%, he's at 65.
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:50.280]  Only the weakest-minded idiots now are for Trump.
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:56.320]  The stock market three trillion, the illegals down 43%, pulling out of the Paris carbon
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:11:57.320]  tax, the TPP.
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:01.640]  I mean, there's some bad stuff, he's got some bad people, he's gone sideways on some things,
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:07.200]  but with this Comey thing, this is like, this is like the Battle of the Bulls where we defeated
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:08.200]  Hitler for sure.
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:12.400]  I mean, this is the deciding or the battle of, you know, Leningrad or Stalingrad.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:16.440]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.280]  Everybody knows I will not celebrate unless it is a celebration.
[2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:24.400]  The media is going to try to spin this, but this is incredible!
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:30.160]  Man, this is like one of the election mo- I mean, this is- this is inc- Stone, am I
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:31.160]  wrong?
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:32.160]  I mean, how big is this?
[2:12:32.160 --> 2:12:33.160]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:38.560]  Well, Alex, I'm glad to see you're in a great mood, you have, I think, good reason to be.
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:43.040]  This testimony by Mr. Comey was a proverbial dud.
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:50.080]  First of all, I like the way he throws little country aphorisms in there like, Lordy, I
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:51.760]  hope there are tapes.
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:56.040]  Dude, you're an inside the Beltway slick lawyer.
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:01.760]  You were paid $6 million to cover up the crimes of the defense contractor Lockheed.
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:07.160]  Not acting like some country boy, you're as duplicitous and slippery and sophisticated
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:09.320]  as they come.
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:11.160]  But there's no beef there.
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:18.600]  He does not prove an obstruction case against the president, but he certainly infers heavily
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:24.840]  that Loretta Lynch, the attorney general for Barack Obama, attempted to obstruct justice
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:27.440]  in the Hillary email matter.
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:35.180]  I was also, Alex, very disappointed that no Republican senator asked him whether he concluded
[2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:41.840]  not to prosecute Hillary in the email matter on the basis of what we now know to be a counterfeit
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:50.320]  memo that showed collusion between Loretta Lynch and an official in the Clint campaign.
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:53.480]  It doesn't matter at this point whether the memo was real.
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:58.800]  What matters is what Mr. Comey believed, and according to the New York Times, he believed
[2:13:58.800 --> 2:14:06.280]  it was authentic, and therefore, rather than report it as an officer of the court, he furthered
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:07.280]  the obstruction.
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:08.280]  In fact, he facilitated it.
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:11.200]  Now, Roger, I want to walk through all of that because there's a lot of subtlety here,
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:14.120]  and that's what you're really good at being in Washington for decades to break this down,
[2:14:14.120 --> 2:14:15.520]  one of the top analysts out there.
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:18.320]  So I want to walk through that, and David Knight's coming in, and we'll do that at the
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:21.720]  bottom of the hour, if you can do the rest of the hour with us today, and then we've
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:25.320]  got Anthony Comey on the fourth hour, he's going to go over all the different clips of
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:27.880]  the testimony and take calls and things.
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:32.920]  Am I wrong just at an intellectual and gut level with what we just saw, admitting he's
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:38.080]  the leaker, admitting that the New York Times and others lied about what was in it, admitting
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:41.800]  that most of the Russian thing is made up, admitting that it was Loretta Lynch trying
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:42.800]  to influence him.
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:45.520]  I mean, to me, this is just bombshell.
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:51.240]  Well, the most significant thing from a personal point of view is that he debunked
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:59.360]  the New York Times reports of February 14th and later, and earlier January 20th, that
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:05.480]  I was among those who had been in touch with the Russians and therefore had colluded with
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  them.
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:12.200]  He admitted that this is entirely false, even though that story, those stories, were based
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:15.800]  on quote, intelligence community sources.
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:24.960]  So I think we wipe away the question of Russian collusion entirely with Mr. Comey's testimony.
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:25.960]  And let me stop you.
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:26.960]  That's why this is so big.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.680]  It devastates the MSM that has been caught in literally hundreds of different facets
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:32.680]  lying.
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:35.280]  They're having to do retractions all over the place.
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:39.960]  Is this a bigger egg on the face discrediting event than them lying about the outcome of
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:44.440]  the election and claiming Hillary was invincible and Newsweek already having hundreds of thousands
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:48.320]  of newspapers and magazines printed with Hillary, Madam President on the cover.
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:51.880]  I mean, this is a Death Star blowing up event.
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:55.280]  Yeah, I actually think it is the end.
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:16:01.680]  It's the death whimper of the Russian collusion narrative that has been pushed so aggressively
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:07.520]  by the mainstream media, even though Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein, a ranking member
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:13.520]  of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and even the hapless boob, Adam Schiff, the congressman
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:19.960]  from California are forced to admit on the record they have no evidence whatsoever of
[2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:23.520]  collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:29.160]  The whole thing is a hoax, a fairytale, a canard.
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:32.000]  And I think that is now openly exposed.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  So as you predicted a month ago, I saw a bunch of reports this morning last night.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  He's mentally ill.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  He has Alzheimer's.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  He's insane.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:44.360]  He works 18 hours a day, he climbs up hills, like a 15-year-old can't do when he's playing
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:45.360]  golf.
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:46.360]  How's he?
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:47.360]  Have such a great memory?
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:48.360]  Why has he got such great stamina?
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:49.360]  What's the secret of Trump?
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.400]  Instead, he's a doddering 99-year-old who doesn't even know what his name is.
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:17:00.280]  Yeah, they have to now quickly shift the narrative because we already have these July protests,
[2:17:00.280 --> 2:17:07.080]  really an excuse for violence, paid for violence, brought to you by our friend George Soros.
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:11.320]  And our rationale was supposed to be that we have to remove Trump because he colluded with
[2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:12.520]  the Russians.
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:18.960]  Now that that has collapsed, the new narrative is he's mentally ill, he's slipping, he has
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:24.760]  Alzheimer's, he's too old, of course there's no evidence of any of that either.
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:29.120]  That's a falsehood, a fairytale being put forward by the exact same people.
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:32.120]  No, I think Mr. Comey took a beating today.
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:38.920]  And interestingly, Alex, he shed the spotlight back on Loretta Lynch in the Obama administration.
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:41.880]  And since she raised that, let's go to Loretta Lynch first, then I've got him admitting he
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:43.760]  leaked to the press, which is clearly illegal.
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:46.320]  We're going to take your phone calls the next segment and look at all that.
[2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:51.240]  Roger Stone, who very soon, we're getting all the equipment set up, the studio's built.
[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:54.080]  We'll be hosting a daily nighttime transmission here.
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:57.280]  We've got to get the contract signed and do all that, but I'll just tell you, it's a done
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:17:58.280]  deal.
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:17:59.280]  We've already made that agreement.
[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:00.880]  And we've got a lot of other stuff in the pipe here.
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:03.880]  So thank you all for your prayers and support.
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:06.680]  The globalists know about it, by the way, and they are really pissed off too.
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:09.760]  So please pray for us and financially support us, because they can already see what we've
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:10.760]  done.
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:13.000]  They're really afraid of what we're about to do.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:17.800]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip of him on the former attorney general.
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:21.760]  Probably the only other consideration, I guess I can talk about an open setting is that
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:26.440]  at one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:30.120]  to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me.
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:34.520]  But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude, I have to step away
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:38.000]  from the department if we're to close this case credibly.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:39.840]  So that's way beyond what they claim even Trump did.
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:45.320]  Now let's go to a past info to friends in the press, which is again, he didn't give
[2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:46.480]  it to the attorney general.
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:47.480]  He sat on it.
[2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:49.920]  He was troubled by it, but he admits it's on order.
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:51.560]  It was a OI hope.
[2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:54.760]  And then he leased it to the press so they can then misrepresent what's in it.
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:56.920]  Here it is.
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:01.600]  President tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes.
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.560]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:08.400]  that there might be corroboration for our conversation.
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:09.400]  There might be a tape.
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:13.080]  And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square.
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.360]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, didn't
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:22.120]  do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:24.400]  prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:27.880]  So I asked a close friend of mine to do it and was set after firing.
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:28.880]  No, no, no.
[2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:31.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back with Roger's take on this, but do you
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:33.760]  understand what you just heard?
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:38.560]  He got bluffed, which Trump does have tapes, obviously, but by Oh, really, I've got tapes.
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:43.320]  When Comey was trying to lie through surrogates and say there was more from was Oh, really,
[2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  I got tapes.
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:45.680]  You better hope I don't have tapes.
[2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:49.440]  So then he gets bluffed into bringing out his little hidden memo that he kept from the
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:50.880]  Justice Department illegally.
[2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:53.600]  So Trump bluffed him and he went, you got an ace card?
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:54.600]  Well, I got one.
[2:19:54.600 --> 2:20:00.320]  I pulled out of my butt here to fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:05.120]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[2:24:04.800 --> 2:24:08.480]  Man, we got so many powerful clips we've just now found from the two-and-a-half-hour testimony
[2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:14.040]  they cut short, because coming was committing sepicoot in front of everyone, Harry Carey
[2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:16.400]  at suicide.
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:17.560]  This is amazing.
[2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:21.800]  But here's Marco Rubio, who I usually don't like, but he's some of the best questions
[2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:22.800]  there.
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:25.200]  He's running from stone, some interesting inside baseball, he might be able to tell
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:26.200]  you about it in a minute.
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:28.000]  I'm not sure if it's secret or not.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:32.520]  But Rubio says, is the only thing you didn't leak that you knew Trump was innocent?
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:36.040]  Because exactly what I've been saying, and I didn't see this part of the testimony,
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.640]  he just let this go on and on and on with the memo and the press and everything that
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:42.360]  Trump had done, all these things that he now says he didn't do.
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:47.480]  So he just let Trump, you know, fly around out there in the wind.
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:52.000]  But again, Trump has nine lives, he defeats the Scaliwags, here's the clip.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:55.880]  Can you please tell the American people what these leaders in Congress already know, what
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:25:01.560]  you already know, what you've told me three times, that I'm not personally under investigation?
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:03.480]  Those are the three things he asked, yes, sir?
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.920]  You know, this investigation is full of leaks left and right.
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:09.560]  I mean, we've learned more from the newspapers sometimes than we do from our open hearings,
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:10.560]  for sure.
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:14.520]  Do you ever wonder why, of all the things in this investigation, the only thing that's
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:18.720]  never been leaked is the fact that the President was not personally under investigation, despite
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:22.560]  the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in the leadership of Congress knew that and
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:25.280]  have known that for weeks?
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:26.280]  I don't know.
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:32.280]  I find matters that are brief to the gang of eight are pretty tightly held in my experience.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.240]  Finally, who are those senior leaders at the FBI that you share these conversations with?
[2:25:37.240 --> 2:25:42.840]  As I said in response to Senator Feinstein's question, Deputy Director, my Chief of Staff,
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:48.200]  General Counsel, Deputy Directors, Chief Counsel, and then more often than not the number three
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:52.640]  person at the FBI who's the Associate Deputy Director, and then quite often the head of
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:54.200]  the National Security Branch.
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:55.200]  Wow.
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:25:58.400]  How amazing, how unbelievable, how historic.
[2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:02.600]  He just said, oh, the gang of eight, they're really good at not leaking, except for you.
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:03.600]  You.
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:05.600]  And we know it isn't just this.
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:09.640]  Roger Stoner, your gut, I know you've been talking to the Senate committee, you've been
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:11.400]  talking to them quite a bit.
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:15.160]  I mean, is it not clear that Comey probably is one of the main leakers?
[2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:16.760]  I think it's apparent, Alex.
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:22.840]  First of all, a shout out to Mr. Comey's plastic surgeon, a lot of Botox going on there.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:23.840]  A lot.
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:29.440]  If you notice his face barely moves when he speaks, maybe he should get with Nancy Pelosi
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:30.840]  in any event.
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:36.840]  Yeah, you had essentially a stunning revelation here that he is a leaker.
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:41.280]  Why would we then believe that this was the only time that he leaked?
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:47.920]  The intelligence services, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, but the 17 wanted
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:54.680]  agencies we keep hearing about, have leaked like a sieve, and those leaks are a crime.
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:27:00.280]  That's not a leak of political information, that's a leak of stuff they learned in surveillance.
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:02.800]  That is patently illegal.
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:08.280]  These are Obama holdovers who are doing the leaking, and they've done it to try to destabilize
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:12.160]  and delegitimize the presidency of Donald Trump.
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:18.520]  I think that their whole scheme is laid bare today by this devastating testimony.
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:22.560]  I think Comey stumbled out of the Senate hearing room.
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:23.560]  That's right.
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:28.680]  I've been struggling for the word, Roger Stone.
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:32.680]  This was devastating to the media, their lies, the whole Russia thing, and then we've got
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:37.040]  people with high level security clearances like this Miss Winner, who believes white
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.880]  people should be genocided, and that being white is terrorist, this is the insane people
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:46.320]  the left to put in charge of everything, total lunatic, racist, crazy people.
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:47.320]  Go ahead, Roger.
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:48.320]  Sorry.
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:55.040]  Well, today in the Washington Post, there is an op-ed by Philip Lacovara, who says,
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:28:01.520]  I prosecuted Nixon in the Watergate matter, and I know obstruction when I see it.
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:07.720]  Mr. Lacovara, you met with and communicated illegally with Judge Sirica in the Watergate
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:08.960]  case.
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:11.320]  You should have been disbarred then.
[2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:16.040]  I'm going to be filing a complaint against you now, which is still right.
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:18.280]  You should be disbarred now.
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:23.920]  Those meetings, those communications, ex-partide with Sirica were completely illegal.
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:25.760]  You will have to pay a penalty.
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:27.760]  Don't lecture us about Donald Trump.
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:31.720]  You yourself have violated the law, Mr. Lacovara.
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:34.320]  We got a minute and a half left, and I'm going to come back, hit calls, and David Knight's
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:38.800]  coming in, but I promise callers, I'm going to you first, Chris, Nicole, everybody.
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:39.800]  How are they going to come back?
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:41.240]  I mean, I know they're going to say he's mentally ill.
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:42.240]  That's not working.
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:43.240]  What else?
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:44.240]  Try to assassinate him.
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:45.240]  A summer of rage, civil unrest.
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:46.240]  They're not giving up.
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:48.240]  What do they do now for this huge, devastating defeat?
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:53.600]  Well, Alex, I think you're exactly right about the president turning the corner.
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:29:00.000]  And perhaps he can now finally devote his full attentions to rebuilding our economy, rebuilding
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:06.160]  our foreign relations, having a foreign policy that is based in common sense, sealing our
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:12.800]  borders from the hordes of young Islamic men who would like to come here to rape and pillage
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:14.600]  and assault American citizens.
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:16.900]  That's what women throw.
[2:29:16.900 --> 2:29:18.600]  This is the Trump agenda.
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:22.960]  And if the president will stick to his agenda.
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:28.560]  And so far, so good, even though he has surrounded himself with establishment quizlings, he has
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:33.040]  managed to ignore most of their advice and stick to what he told the American people
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:34.040]  he would do.
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:35.040]  Paris, for example.
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:36.040]  That's right.
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:38.160]  Roger Stone, I want to commend you.
[2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:42.640]  We are now really entering the major victory zone.
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:46.440]  The victory secure so far is now being really, really cemented.
[2:29:46.440 --> 2:29:51.960]  And so cause for celebration to the listeners and you and everybody and President Trump.
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:59.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network, big victory, folks, just a big deal.

[2:30:31.600 --> 2:30:35.640]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line

[2:33:04.920 --> 2:33:10.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:33:10.560 --> 2:33:21.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:27.600]  All right, I've got Jason, and I've got Stephen, and I've got Cole, and I've got Chris, and
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:30.360]  I've got Rod, who've been holding some of them 50 minutes.
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:34.080]  So we're going to bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bing, bong, bing, bong, bong, bong, bing.
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:38.200]  We're going to go through those phone calls, and then we've got David Knight here, who
[2:33:38.200 --> 2:33:42.920]  did a great job the day holding his tongue, because I would have been worse.
[2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:47.440]  Everybody knows we can cover the live debates because we're giving analysis and commentary,
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:51.160]  but we have to give commentary for fair use to be able to do it, even if it's government
[2:33:51.160 --> 2:33:52.160]  produced.
[2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:57.200]  Well, we're covering C-SPAN's live feed here, and David had limited comments, a lot he wanted
[2:33:57.200 --> 2:33:58.200]  to say.
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:03.160]  I talk three times more than he does, and of course, we provide it on infowars.com, the
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:08.000]  clean feed from C-SPAN, the feed with his limited commentary, and then me, where you
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:13.040]  probably, in the first hour, got five minutes of the live feed, and I saw in our feed on
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:17.920]  Facebook and YouTube and Infowars going, Jones, shut up, and the reason I'm addressing this
[2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:22.400]  here is not that anybody did anything bad, it's that listeners are wonderful people,
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:26.840]  but that we can't always just listen to the trolls, because we were very clear every ten
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:32.000]  minutes to say, we have clean feeds at infowars.com, or go elsewhere, it's everywhere in the world.
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:36.760]  So you've got to ask yourself with that nanny state culture, not the majority of our listeners,
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:40.920]  not even a minority, but a very small number of people that just picked things to bitch
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:41.920]  about.
[2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:46.160]  Instead of, wow, I'm glad you're here giving us an alternative feed and grabbing clips
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:50.000]  so that as soon as it was over, we could have an analysis, and I don't want to give attention
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:54.080]  to the one percent of complainers, I just want to point out to listeners, they shouldn't
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:58.320]  give those type of folks attention, because we've got all these clips to play, your calls
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:03.600]  to go to, David's analysis of stuff he couldn't get to, with all the notes he wrote down today,
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:07.920]  and Anthony Kumiya coming up, and the nightly news tonight, but David walked in and said,
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:11.880]  oh, people were complaining I was talking too much, and I heard you were, only at like
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.920]  one point, because he couldn't hear me, I wanted to go to him in the cross feeds, and
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:20.120]  we're trying to work out the complex new studios we built, but nobody's bad.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:27.080]  This is all complex wargaming, high tech satellite, TV satellite, radio satellite studios, people
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:32.920]  in different areas, we are in the growth pains here at Info Wars, and this is a celebration,
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:38.280]  a celebration to our entire crew, our affiliates, our listeners, and to God above for the blessing
[2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:41.440]  of life, just everybody, this is amazing.
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.160]  We totally, absolutely kick butt, Kumi melted down, Info Wars and Drudge, everybody had
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:51.920]  great coverage, there was Donald Jr. with his dad, sir, I get tweeting in live time,
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:55.880]  that was really the president pretty much, I mean, this was, he didn't have the president
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:35:59.720]  give him too much attention, I want to give folks too much inside baseball, but this is
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:04.280]  an amazing time to have the president kicking the liar's ass in live time through his son
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:07.480]  on Twitter, a lot of it was his son as well, I was writing tweets, and then I would see
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:13.160]  that Donald Jr. had just sent the exact same thing out, not that we're synced up, because
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:18.160]  he did perjure himself, Kumi did admit he was the leaker, he did admit he was political
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:22.680]  and shut down investigations into the Clintons, he did admit that Trump wasn't under investigation,
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:27.120]  he told him that, everything the media denied, everything was a total route, and if we let
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:32.440]  the media spin it like, well, the Russia investigation goes on, this was inconclusive,
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:36.920]  that's kind of their spin, no, they have egg on their face, they've been discredited
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:42.120]  worse than all their fake polls in the WikiLeaks and all that garbage, this is a devastating
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:47.040]  defeat for these people, Kumi, Loretta Lynch, MSM, all of them, that's exactly what I'm
[2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:52.520]  saying and now Trump's sending it out, we saw the same thing, this was a galactic route,
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:56.200]  and we have to realize the effect you the listeners are having, our affiliates, those
[2:36:56.200 --> 2:37:00.440]  local stations you're listening to are the biggest heroes out there, what they get targeted
[2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:03.880]  with, how they get boycotted behind the scenes, you don't know listeners, send them $100
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:08.280]  a week, become a sponsor, we instead of worrying about the trolls bitching is why I'm giving
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:12.400]  this speech, let's think about the fact that we're not perfect, but we're in the arena
[2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:17.400]  like Teddy Roosevelt said, somebody print me the arena speech please, and we are kicking
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:21.640]  ass, because I get mad, well I did a perfect interview the other night with Megan Kelly,
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:26.240]  I was exhausted, they've been here since nine in the morning, we finished at almost 11,
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:30.040]  I did okay, but I knew they could snip it out a few things where I got tired, or where
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:33.840]  stuff was going on, and I got mad at myself, I was actually depressed for about half a
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:37.000]  day, and said some mean stuff about Megan I probably should have said as well, but the
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:40.280]  point is it didn't matter, I didn't realize it didn't matter, I'm in the arena, we changed
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:45.360]  history, we're winning, we're dominating, for good, let's celebrate it, let's be happy
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:49.480]  about it, give me a high five, yeah, David Knight, we're gonna go to these calls, we've
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:50.480]  been holding for an hour, but go ahead.
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:53.920]  You know Alex, one of the things, the dog that did not bark, that I was so upset about
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:59.160]  at the end of this hearing when Burr was summarizing everything, very calmly, you know, if you
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:04.080]  wanna watch the thing uninterrupted without comment, then just go to NPR and take some
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:05.080]  pro's act.
[2:38:05.080 --> 2:38:07.800]  But you need to understand that the real threat here, when Megan Kelly was here the
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:11.840]  other day, she said, what do you think about Putin, I said he's just ex KGB, I said the
[2:38:11.840 --> 2:38:17.040]  people we need to be concerned about are the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, who have actively
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:20.960]  engaged in politics, and we've had Senator Grassley, Senator Paul point this out, we've
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:26.540]  had the FISA court point out their crimes and do something very unprecedented, immediately
[2:38:26.540 --> 2:38:31.880]  declassify a statement, talking about how their court decision, talking about how the
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:36.360]  FBI and the NSA had violated laws, where's the investigation of that, where's the oversight
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:37.360]  of that?
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:41.480]  And again, we've got good people in the government fighting to expose rogue elements in the government,
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:45.040]  it's not the whole deep state, I'm not defending deep state, but rogue elements in the secret
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:50.760]  government going after our president because he's a real American, he's actually trying
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:52.960]  to restore the republic.
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:57.640]  You know, it began with Burr saying, we have the obligation here, the Senate Intelligence
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:00.720]  Committee, make sure that the intelligence agencies are following the law, and that's
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:03.640]  what they did not do, they did not talk about that, but let's talk about what they did talk
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:04.640]  about.
[2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:08.480]  You mentioned that Comey exposed himself as a leaker, he made comments about how multiple
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:12.680]  times, yeah, that story from the New York Times, yeah, it was pretty much all fake news,
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.880]  it wasn't any of that true, but they were playing with semantics, there's three words
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:20.600]  that they're trying to leverage this in, and I was just looking at the feed that we have
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:26.080]  of CNN, of course they said, oh, Comey was, it's just such a big win for Comey, oh really,
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.440]  really, let's talk about what happened.
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:32.680]  So now we know what they're doing, I mean, total loss, clear cut, like 75 to zero football
[2:39:32.680 --> 2:39:36.600]  game, what's the record NFL loss, isn't it like 89 to zero or something?
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:40.880]  Matt's a big sports guy, I used to be two, Matt, what is it, Matt, look it up, what is
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:42.720]  the biggest loss ever?
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:43.720]  What is it?
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:49.040]  Well, let's look up, the biggest NFL loss in history, the largest point spread, I mean,
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:54.640]  this was a route, this was an open and shut, this was a domination, this was a bone crusher,
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:40:00.080]  this was an absolute complete win for the truth, a repudiation of the media, Lynch,
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:05.560]  the Clintons, Obama, the globalist, the fake Russian narrative, all of it, a vindication
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:10.680]  of our president telling us the truth, and then CNN wants to try to spin it, sorry, go
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:11.680]  ahead.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:15.520]  Well, you know, what we saw was Comey's character, when they hit him on this, they said, well,
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:20.560]  you know, what about what you did with Hillary Clinton, and he had testified that Loretta
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:26.640]  Lynch had wanted him to use the terms, we're looking into a matter, instead of we are investigating
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:28.640]  Hillary Clinton over violation.
[2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:31.720]  And that's the way he spun it, well, what came out then is he really wanted to end the
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:34.600]  criminal investigation and just call it a matter.
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:38.800]  Those terms mean two different things, it isn't a semantical term, it's whether it
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:43.920]  is a matter that they're looking at investigating, that's what they first call it, or is it an
[2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:44.920]  investigation.
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:49.920]  They first shift out of investigation into a matter, which is saying kill the investigation.
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:51.520]  We're going to get to your whole list.
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:56.160]  Take him at his word, what he's doing is saying that he's susceptible to this because he wants
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:40:57.160]  his job.
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:40:59.600]  You're going to go through, that's why I got your whole list, I know you're chomping
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:00.600]  a bit.
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:03.200]  Let's go to these calls and we're going to let this lion off the leash, because I know
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:06.760]  you had to sit there and not talk 90% of the time, and I know it's tough, because I couldn't
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:07.760]  have done what you were doing.
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:10.720]  What I'm saying is let him talk, David, I'm telling myself that because I'm worse than
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:12.040]  you.
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:15.960]  Let's go ahead and go to, who's been holding the longest?
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:21.720]  Let's go to who held over, that's right, we go to Jason, then Chris, then Cole, then
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:22.720]  Stephen, then Rod.
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:25.760]  Jason in the great state of Connecticut, you got caught off by a break, go ahead and make
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:26.760]  your point.
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:33.360]  Yeah, so like I was saying before, you know, Comey might go down and he's doing it just
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:38.400]  so they could push the Russian narrative even further saying that, oh, you know, he had
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:43.440]  to say this stuff just so they could get the special counsel and prosecutor in there, and
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:45.080]  he had to save us from the Russians.
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:47.600]  So he was being weak and cowardly because of that.
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.400]  I'm not sure how much weight that holds, but yes, let me ask David Knight that question
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:56.240]  and he'll come back, Jason, just briefly about these calls, but is, is there a method of
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:57.240]  the madness?
[2:41:57.240 --> 2:41:58.240]  Is there something else we see?
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.360]  I've looked at this carefully, the Democrats are out of control, Comey's out of control,
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.360]  they're showing real fear.
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:07.520]  I could see where Trump manipulated them to show their hand to release the memo.
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:10.000]  I don't think that there's something behind this.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:15.360]  I think we're watching these people finally facing an intellect and a humant group of
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:18.320]  citizens out in the public that are ready to take them on.
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:19.440]  We'll have to see.
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:22.520]  Maybe some of the comments that have been made back and forth the last few days about
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:27.760]  the concerns that the friction between Trump and Attorney General Sessions is because maybe
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.560]  Trump is trying to get him to actually do his job and criminally prosecute people inside
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:34.840]  the government who violate the law.
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:35.840]  People like Comey.
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:40.320]  And here's the bottom line, the caller saying, what can come out of Comey apparently blowing
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:41.640]  up and self-destructing?
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:42.640]  I think it was a real self-destruct.
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:45.120]  That's what the media is spinning and is it a win?
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:48.520]  If they were spinning it as a self-destruct right now, then you know they might be turning
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:52.960]  apples or lemons and the lemonade that, you know, they might be trying to spin out of
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  this.
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:57.360]  I see actually them spinning out of control, not knowing what they're doing.
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:02.800]  The big dangerous question is, what may they pull now to get their bacon out of the fire?
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:03.800]  Jason?
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:09.280]  Well, I think just that, that's all they have at this point.
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:15.600]  But going to Sessions, Sessions was just speaking with a bunch of policemen and everyone down
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:21.080]  in Georgia on the 6th, I believe, about busting pedophiles big time, so maybe he's very busy
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:25.640]  doing that and said, you know, I can't really break away from that to go, you know, go after
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:26.640]  Clinton.
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.240]  Well, we're going after their Luciferian lifeblood over here, all this pedophile, the whole pedophile.
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:34.840]  There's been over 10,000 arrests now, I mean, Trump is moving against the, they just busted
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:39.440]  the head of Penn State for covering up and now they're saying they may arrest hundreds.
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:40.880]  I mean, they are scared.
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:46.380]  Trump is the real, folks, Trump's the real deal and everybody should have trouble sleeping
[2:43:46.380 --> 2:43:50.640]  right now because this is, I'm going to make this announcement, we're in a civil war and
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:51.880]  Trump has turned the corner.
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:54.200]  We are now winning the civil war.
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  We are now winning.
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:59.520]  I'm getting, ladies and gentlemen, this is real and a lot of times you'll see Trump
[2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:02.480]  bring somebody in who's a globalist.
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:06.880]  All he's doing is getting the intel from him because they're so narcissistic and then he's
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:08.120]  destroying him.
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:12.520]  I mean, this is biblical, ladies and gentlemen, you've got to recognize it when it's happening.
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:14.240]  There's no way this is a deception now.
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:16.720]  This is irrevocably damaging them.
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:17.720]  Thank you, Jason.
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:19.480]  I mean, I see you nodding your head.
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:23.040]  I mean, we are turning the corner on the civil war right now.
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:26.600]  I think one of the key things that you see here in Cornyn would get a great job in terms
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:28.120]  of cross-examining him.
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:32.760]  One of the things that he pointed out, Alex, was that, okay, you're trying to imply that
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:36.560]  Donald Trump did something inappropriate, that he tried to obstruct justice in terms
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:38.680]  of shutting down the Flynn investigation.
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:42.800]  But doesn't an FBI agent, just in the order, not necessarily the FBI director, but any
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:47.520]  FBI agent, doesn't he have a duty, a legal duty to make that clear if he sees a crime
[2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:48.520]  being committed?
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:51.480]  So what he's doing is he's incriminating himself multiple times today.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:55.440]  You had this situation where he had said previously, we talked about this a great deal.
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:56.800]  I was never pressured.
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:44:58.680]  That would be a big deal, he said.
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:02.760]  If anybody ever pressured me politically to shut down an investigation, yet today, one
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:06.080]  of the key words that was going back and forth between the Republicans, Republicans say,
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:08.400]  you're very specific about what you wrote.
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:13.020]  You said that the president said, gee, I hope nothing comes of this investigation, hope.
[2:45:13.020 --> 2:45:16.360]  And then he comes back and says, yeah, well, I think he was implying that he would like
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:20.280]  to have this guy taken out, just like Henry II said about Archbishop Beckett.
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:22.000]  He will rid me of this man.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:26.320]  Now expanding on that, he agreed with that.
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:28.080]  I've analyzed this and I know what it is.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:30.960]  I'm going to tell you, they thought they could make this run to the president.
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:35.400]  They thought they could use disinfo, fake memos, never show the sources, trap behind
[2:45:35.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  the scenes is called their bluff.
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:39.800]  He's ready to release it all as president, as the executive branch, he can release anything
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:41.320]  classifying once.
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:43.800]  And they are in free fall panic mode.
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:46.360]  We could see them attack the White House the next 24 hours.
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:47.960]  We could see them start a war.
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:51.800]  This is a very dangerous time because right now we are beginning to route them.
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:56.160]  We're not completely routing them yet, but we're turning the tide completely.
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:01.640]  We've gone from beach head to battle, to civil war, to major collapse of the enemy.
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:04.000]  And this is an incredible time.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.280]  You already see the Saudis rolling over.
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:10.120]  The Russians are ready to roll over because they see a big, huge, powerful United States
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:12.560]  and that actually wants to work with them.
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:16.040]  And this is a big moment, ladies, that the EU is imploding.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:18.160]  They're activating the Muslim brigades in a crisis.
[2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:20.240]  I mean, this is an incredible time.
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:21.240]  Let's go to calls.
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:22.240]  I got to be good and go to calls.
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:26.440]  Stephen in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:29.920]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:36.240]  I want to make your day come up with, I guess you could say, a rallying cry and celebration
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:39.040]  of what you're talking about with this Comey Fiasco.
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:42.920]  First of all, I think you ought to come out with a shirt, which is with his character,
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:47.000]  a character on it, that's James Comey Hentai Homey.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:52.080]  I think that would be really fitting, but here's the main thing.
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:59.320]  You should have something that says a lot of lines of truth, Trump-wise, good Trump
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:09.840]  evil, nationalism, Trump's globalism, and info wars, Trump's disinfo wars.
[2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:10.840]  That's beautiful.
[2:47:10.840 --> 2:47:11.840]  Please say it again.
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:16.280]  I want them to tweet that it may be too long or we can do a text shot and then have that,
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:17.760]  you know, in the bottom is the image.
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:18.760]  So I'm going to have Lewis do that.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:22.840]  We'll have that in the bottom, you know, as an image, and then in the top, we'll just
[2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:24.520]  have the first of it, dot, dot, dot.
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:27.840]  So say that one more time.
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:38.360]  Truth, Trump, and Trump's is an all-capital of truth, Trump-wise, good, Trump's evil,
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:47.720]  nationalism, Trump's globalism, info wars, Trump's disinfo wars.
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:50.000]  Or disinfo MSM enemies, absolutely.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:53.640]  I want to go back to you briefly, but this is breaking news, two different breaking news
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:57.360]  articles, then I'll go back to you, Stephen, here in a moment, and Cole, Chris, and Rod.
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:01.920]  This is not a U.S. state of day, and this is what I've been saying since this happened
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:06.040]  an hour and a half ago, or two and a half hours ago before we even went on air live.
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:08.680]  You were live at the time with your live feed.
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:12.840]  Trump lawyer says James Cummy made unauthorized disclosures of privileged talks.
[2:48:12.840 --> 2:48:17.680]  Yes, it's illegal because only if what Trump was doing was illegal and he brought it to
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:23.360]  the Justice Department, and they'd said no, and he brought it to the Intelligence Committees,
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:26.880]  then only under law, and I agree with this, could he leak it to the press?
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  Yes, he won't have his cake and eat it too.
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:29.880]  He won't have his...
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:32.120]  He won't acknowledge that there's illegal operations going on here, but then he kept
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:34.720]  it to himself, he had tried to justice, he didn't report it to anybody.
[2:48:34.720 --> 2:48:38.880]  Cummy needs to be indicted, and listen, we're not looking for trouble, but they want to
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:42.240]  put our president in jail, they want to bring in jihadis, they want to bankrupt the stock
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:47.400]  market, they want to screw over America, then they want war, let's give them info war, and
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:51.200]  let's give them judicial war, let's give them legislative war, let's give them judicial
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:52.200]  war.
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:55.600]  I mean, you people keep wanting to fight with America, haven't you, globalist, and all
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:48:58.120]  your servants, and all you fake liberals figured it out?
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:03.440]  We are kicking your asses, and we're going to go on winning because the sleeping giants
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.680]  here, baby, and we will break you, just like I told the enemy the other day.
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:11.920]  Now, get the other one, even Chris Matthews, go ahead and tell them.
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.080]  As you said, even Chris Matthews with MSNBC, now of course CNN has said, oh, this is wonderful,
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:21.600]  James Comey was so credible, yet Chris Matthews said the Trump-Russia collusion theory just
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:23.680]  came apart with the Comey testimony.
[2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:24.680]  And let me tell you-
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:26.880]  Exactly what I said in the first hour, because it's true.
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:28.360]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:32.120]  The other thing to Alex is that he goes back and he memorializes this, he says, on his
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:33.200]  personal computer.
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:37.120]  He had just investigated Hillary Clinton for having her own personal computer that wasn't
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:39.360]  secure, that was aside from all this.
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:43.760]  He has a work computer where he can memorialize this stuff, he doesn't have to have it classified
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:44.760]  and allocated.
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:46.120]  Exactly, and then it will-
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:47.120]  Oh, you just said it, you just said it.
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:50.320]  Him keeping this memo is just like Hillary having her own private server.
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  Yes, yes.
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:52.640]  But class, he had his own private server.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:53.640]  Yes, exactly.
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:54.960]  Comey had his own private server.
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:59.680]  Yeah, except we don't know if he did that memo at that time or if he just did it just
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:01.240]  before he leaked it to the New York Times.
[2:50:01.240 --> 2:50:02.920]  We don't know when he created this stuff.
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:07.640]  There's no way that we can know when he recorded, when he wrote this stuff down, because he
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:08.640]  didn't do it in the-
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:09.640]  You know what's happening?
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:10.640]  You know what's happening?
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:11.640]  As he obliged to.
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:14.760]  You know what's happening in the United States, the American people of every race, color and
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:18.160]  creed, Americana striking back, the real deep states striking back at the deep state right
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:19.160]  now.
[2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:20.160]  Yeah.
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:21.680]  I'm deep state 1836, 1776, baby.
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:22.680]  I'm deep state.
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:23.680]  And so is David Knight.
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:24.680]  So is this whole crew.
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:25.680]  We love you all.
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:26.680]  Stephen, take us out to break.
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:27.680]  Final comments.
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:32.680]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, the Bible talks about those whose conscience is seared
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:33.680]  as with a hot iron.
[2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:36.680]  You know, these people, they couldn't spell truth.
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:40.920]  I mean, they just lie through their teeth and they get off on it because I really believe
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:42.760]  that they've got no conscience.
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:46.840]  You know, they say that, you know, I'll talk about, you know, every man has his price.
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:48.920]  Well, not the man who sold out what's-
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:49.920]  No, no, that's right.
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:52.000]  I've talked to top-side Congress that have interviewed the big serial killers.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.400]  They all have no emotion till they do bad.
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:56.000]  They only live by doing bad.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  We'll be back.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  Stay with us.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  More calls.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:03.680]  Will the government protect your family from Iran and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[2:51:03.680 --> 2:51:05.440]  We buy guns to protect ourselves.
[2:51:05.440 --> 2:51:07.920]  Home, health and car insurance for accidents.
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:09.520]  Maybe you also have food storage.
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:13.640]  But how would you keep your refrigerator running in a long-term EMP blackout?

[2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:18.040]  It's so good to be crazed, it's so good to love liberty, it's so good to be alive.
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:20.640]  United Megan Kelly asked me, are you on something?
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:24.200]  And I said, yeah, I've had a couple cups of coffee.
[2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:28.480]  David Knight doesn't even drink coffee, and David Knight is a very mild mannered guy,
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:30.760]  but when he gets on air, it bounces off the walls.
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:34.240]  Because when you're informed and you're intellectual and you have children and you have a wife,
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.040]  and you love your country and you want to be free, and you study how evil these people
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:42.920]  are, you get in a fighting mode, are there something wrong with you when most of these
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:47.200]  abortion places, it turns out, are doing devil worship ceremonies, and it comes out and they're
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:48.400]  keeping the babies alive.
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:50.040]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:52.800]  Now it's mainstream news, I'm pissed off.
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:54:53.800]  Yeah.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:56.760]  I mean, it's like people now see a woman getting mugged and do nothing.
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:55:00.400]  I'm not a hero, I see guys mugging some woman, I can't help it.
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:06.320]  I've got inbred switches that I turn into a killer when I see stuff like that.
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:08.720]  And when I see stuff like this, what do you think Info Wars is?
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:14.640]  It's a weapon system, we're attacking the globalist, we're in a war, we hate them, because we love
[2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:15.640]  our children.
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:18.320]  David, I got to plug and go to this caller, because Cole's been holding Forever and Chris,
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:21.680]  we'll see if Anthony Cumi will let us go, if not I'll punch out, he's a great guy, has
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:26.480]  a lot to cover, I don't want to mess up his agenda, but just briefly to that, why do you
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:27.480]  get so aggressive?
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:28.480]  What do you want?
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:29.480]  Are you on freedom?
[2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  Are you on Jesus Christ?
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:31.680]  Because they always ask, what am I on?
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:33.840]  I'm on not being a devil worshiper.
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:38.200]  I did a report the other night, Alex, the difference between Islam and Christianity, and I talked
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:42.080]  about this gleeful terrorist who was the happiest, everybody said, oh, he's the happiest I've
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:45.240]  ever seen him, the day he was going out to mass murder people.
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:49.120]  And then there was the bouncer, Ozzie, at one of the bars, the guy who fought him off
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:52.280]  with his bare hands throwing stuff at him, and he took on three of them.
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:56.080]  Yeah, this is a guy who first instinct was to run, he didn't want to get into a fight,
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:56:00.040]  the guy had a suicide vest, but then he came after him, because he said, if I don't do
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:02.240]  something, innocent people are going to die.
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:06.560]  That's the difference, folks, between Islam and Christianity, between the cultures and
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:10.960]  the societies that those two religions create, and that's the essence of it, Alex.
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:14.440]  Yeah, scroll down, he got stabbed, the whole back of his neck slashed him, all in the arms,
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:17.720]  you know what they say, reportedly kicked at least two of their asses, and it held
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:21.160]  him off before they killed another five, six people for the cops to get there.
[2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:26.320]  When he first saw them, they were stabbing repeatedly a woman, three guys stabbing a
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:29.000]  woman with a knife repeatedly, the three of them teaming up on her.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:33.320]  And they were reportedly like 50 men in there, this one guy, he stood up, he saw it, he
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:37.320]  just said, F you, he committed right there, he said F you.
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:40.720]  That's right, that's right, they beat him up and they ran out of the bar and the police
[2:56:40.720 --> 2:56:43.200]  shot him, that's how that thing ended.
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:45.240]  He fought three guys with knives and ran them out.
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:49.240]  Yeah, that's right, that's right, so you know, that's the difference, you have to at some
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:50.240]  point, we don't want to fight.
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:55.000]  Oh, he's great, oh, he's aggressive, oh my gosh, you know, well that's why they bash
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.920]  guys that like to go to soccer games and then they get in fights if they want, those are
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:03.040]  still men that have the distigial memory of fighting, and you know what, the guy'll
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:04.880]  beat the living hell out of you, that's what it's all about.
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:08.240]  But we're not fighting over tribalism, we're fighting over saving innocent lives, we're
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:12.160]  fighting over our freedom, over the freedom of our children and our families and our
[2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:15.920]  grandchildren, that's what we're fighting about, we're fighting to save our culture,
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:19.560]  our society, our legal system, we're not going to run away.
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:22.440]  And that's the thing, at some point you gotta turn around and say, I'm not gonna put up
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:23.440]  with this anymore.
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:24.440]  You know, you don't-
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:27.400]  And then once you get committed, you get so alive, these people are also dead because
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:30.640]  they're selfish, they want to just owe the best movie, the best rock concert, I enjoy
[2:57:30.640 --> 2:57:31.720]  all that too.
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:36.240]  But if you're not spending a large time every day being free, you're not alive folks, you're
[2:57:36.240 --> 2:57:39.600]  alive when you, and I know our listeners know that, but we gotta reach out to more zombies
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:44.080]  before I'm in the shower, I love super blue with the colloidal silver in the iodine and
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:48.600]  the fluoride free, but I said to my dad, it's awesome, you know, retired dentist and world
[2:57:48.600 --> 2:57:54.480]  surgeon, I said, I don't like the tube yet, I said, I want the more classic slash space
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:58.160]  age, not the really old style tubes, not this super new tube, I like the classic softer
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:01.240]  tubes, the bigger, you know, bigger end on them, because well, it's concentrated, you're
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:03.840]  not supposed to get that much out, I said, I don't care, I like this, we'll see if I'm
[2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:05.680]  right, if not, we'll go back to the old tube.
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:10.040]  It's the same amount, infowarslife.com has been sold out for months, it's back, the bubblegum
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:16.520]  for kids is sold out, bubblegum flavor, it's all natural, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com,

[2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:35.280]  play some of those tomorrow, folks out exposing CNN as the enemy, it's all happening, but
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:40.120]  your calls, Cole in Alabama, Christian Rod, I promise, man, I'm too fired up, 70 seconds,
[2:58:40.120 --> 2:58:45.440]  I am high as a kite, I have had two cups of coffee and Nico did bring chocolate covered
[2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:49.880]  and donuts, I did eat those, that's probably what this is, no, it's the testimony.
[2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:53.040]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news, according to the Daily Caller, Trump's
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:57.600]  approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's was at the same point in his presidency,
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:59:01.560]  that's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of
[2:59:01.560 --> 2:59:05.640]  Russia's involvement in the election and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:10.240]  on network news, even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating
[2:59:10.240 --> 2:59:14.480]  was better than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in, while Trump's approval ratings only hovering
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:19.160]  around the 40% mark, he's still doing better than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at
[2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:24.720]  138 days in, of course Trump's disapproval ratings also higher than Clinton's at 57%
[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:29.240]  compared to Clinton's 49%, but what do you expect, Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster
[2:59:29.240 --> 2:59:33.560]  boy of everything cool about modern liberalism, meanwhile Trump and his family have been put
[2:59:33.560 --> 2:59:37.880]  under a microscope and have been under constant assault even before he got elected, despite
[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:42.560]  all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the fake media's
[2:59:42.560 --> 2:59:44.240]  narrative is dying.
[2:59:44.240 --> 3:00:09.480]  Reporting for Infowars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:35.880]  Welcome to the front lines of the information war.
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:40.360]  We'll be right back with a little bit better than I used to be because I'm a live, live
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:41.360]  wire.
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:43.960]  And I'm coming for you, globalist.
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:46.680]  You may defeat me, but just know this, I'm coming for you.
[3:00:46.680 --> 3:00:48.960]  24 seven, my eyes on you.
[3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:51.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Cole in Alabama.
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:54.000]  You're on the air with David Knight and of course myself.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:01:00.200]  Alex, David Knight, great honor to be on the show with you all fighting this info war.
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:01.200]  Honored to talk to you, brother.
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:02.200]  What's going on?
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:06.080]  Yeah, so well, I really have two things, first, I'm going to miss this mission.
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:09.520]  I love all the classic rock and the classic country you got going on in the info music.
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:10.520]  That's awesome.
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:11.520]  So I have two things.
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:16.080]  My first thing is with this Comey situation here and after watching this and paying attention
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:21.080]  to the show, paying attention to everything going on, something was revealed to me after
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:22.560]  Comey said a few words.
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:24.600]  He mentioned himself being a coward.
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:28.680]  Now he's just trying to get off the phone, streaking, being trying to get off the phone
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:29.680]  with Trump.
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:36.240]  He's revealing to the whole world that Trump, the alpha, is intimidating him, the beta.
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:42.080]  He was intimidated by Trump and that's almost a microcosm of our metaphor, if you will,
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:46.400]  of Trump intimidating the deep state, how they're frantically trying to figure out what
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:50.320]  to do with him, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:52.680]  That's really what I want to get across here with this Comey situation.
[3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:53.680]  That is the whole day.
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:01:57.000]  That's why I should take more calls because they have such wisdom and I'm not being patronizing.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  It's true.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:01:59.160]  I kept saying, why would he say I'm weak?
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:00.160]  I'm cowardly.
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:01.160]  I'm afraid.
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:02.160]  We'll play that clip later.
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:05.160]  We played it earlier because he's signaling, I'm a poor baby.
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:06.160]  Leave me alone.
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:07.160]  I don't want power.
[3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:08.160]  I just want money.
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:09.160]  I want to roll over.
[3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:10.160]  I want to give in.
[3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:13.760]  That's what a leader always say to me, they go, Alex, what's your number?
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:14.760]  What do you want?
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:15.760]  Just stop it.
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  Just look.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:17.760]  Join us.
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:18.760]  You come on.
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  Don't.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:20.760]  You're going to be destroyed.
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:22.800]  And it's the fact that they're saying that, that I have to fight them.
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:26.600]  Not that I've got some, you know what, measuring contest, but I can't roll over to that type
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:30.200]  of person because they want to dominate the innocents before they can grow and be strong.
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:32.680]  You know, these guys don't know how to cut it off with dominating other men.
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:34.760]  It goes on to women, children, you name it.
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:36.320]  That's a very deep point he just made.
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:40.280]  Why would he brag about being a beta?
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:41.840]  He thinks there's some virtue in that.
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:42.840]  That's what these people think.
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:45.760]  I think one of the key things to coming out of this, Alex, and we'll talk about this coming
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:49.120]  up, are the revelations coming out of Grassley's letters.
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:50.440]  He wrote a couple of letters.
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:55.720]  He, like Rand Paul's, very concerned about the politicization of the intelligence service
[3:02:55.720 --> 3:03:00.200]  of law enforcement, and he's called it out directly, and also Alex, the connections between
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:03.760]  Christopher Steele, the guy who created this dirty dossier, and James Comey.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:05.760]  And that's coming up in the next segment with Anthony Comey.
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:06.920]  I know you're chomping at the bit.
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:07.920]  That is big.
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:09.440]  Piscate, all the rest of it.
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:10.440]  Cole, great points.
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  Anything else?
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:16.600]  Yeah, I just have one more point, Alex, about the situation in London, if you will.
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:21.440]  So, you know, I pay attention to a lot of step-on-model news videos, and, you know, one video on this
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:22.760]  London attack really struck me.
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:24.600]  He mentioned something along these lines.
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:30.760]  Okay, so, at one point in history, Great Britain, it ruled one-third of the world.
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:35.520]  You know, I mean, Britain's armies defended that aisle against the armies of Napoleon.
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:38.520]  And it was known as the most vicious armies there were.
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  Right, exactly.
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:43.640]  You know, professional armies in Europe, I mean, our country, for heaven's sake, rose
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:48.960]  out of that English parliamentary common law, Magna Carta tradition, all right?
[3:03:48.960 --> 3:03:55.520]  And now, in the 21st century, going from one extreme as an outlaw of Europe, you have the
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:02.280]  British people in Europe itself afraid of being called a two-syllable politically correct
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:09.760]  word, which is racist, so they will bow down to their daughters, their people being trampled
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:10.760]  upon.
[3:04:10.760 --> 3:04:16.720]  To a budget of gibbering people on welfare, 80%, 80% military aged men with huge beards
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:20.520]  and wearing nightgowns, running around bitching at everyone.
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:23.920]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, and we're making there women wear beekeeper suits and, and
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:27.880]  every, I mean, and wiping their ass with their hands, and we just get them all welfare and
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:28.880]  bow down to their asses.
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:30.080]  I totally agree.
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:31.080]  I can't take it.
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:35.400]  And then there's one guy out of 50 men admittedly in a pub beats this hell out of three guys
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  with butcher knives.
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:40.560]  They'll run out, be gunned down by the police that were too afraid to come in and gun them
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:41.560]  down.
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:42.960]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around.
[3:04:42.960 --> 3:04:46.200]  I've had my ass kicked plenty of times where I grew up in Texas, and you look at somebody
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:47.200]  wrong.
[3:04:47.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  They're going to try to kill you.
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:52.840]  I mean, I don't understand this thing of like, I gotta tell you, it's the craziest thing.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:53.840]  I appreciate your call.
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:56.640]  Chris knows we're getting your calls, but this is Anthony Cummings hour.
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:59.600]  He's coming up.
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:03.400]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:05.160]  the Bush administration.
[3:05:05.160 --> 3:05:10.080]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:12.120]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Ray.
[3:05:12.120 --> 3:05:17.800]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Ray a man of impeccable credentials, including
[3:05:17.800 --> 3:05:22.400]  serving as the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division under George
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:23.640]  W. Bush.
[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:28.600]  Ray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:32.240]  role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:37.320]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:41.600]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:45.920]  by the White House, but according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump
[3:05:45.920 --> 3:05:49.680]  and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[3:05:49.680 --> 3:05:52.800]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[3:05:52.800 --> 3:05:58.760]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[3:05:58.760 --> 3:06:00.640]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[3:06:00.640 --> 3:06:02.680]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:06:02.680 --> 3:06:05.560]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:06:05.560 --> 3:06:11.600]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:16.560]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:21.520]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[3:06:21.520 --> 3:06:26.640]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:28.360]  you can to purify your air.
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:33.400]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:06:33.400 --> 3:06:36.400]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:38.600]  The general public hasn't.
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:42.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:46.160]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:06:46.160 --> 3:06:49.720]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:52.920]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:06:52.920 --> 3:07:00.160]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.

[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:22.240]  I don't feel good.
[3:07:22.240 --> 3:07:25.880]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:30.800]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:34.680]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[3:07:34.680 --> 3:07:37.440]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[3:07:37.440 --> 3:07:41.000]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:43.120]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing.
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:44.120]  I love it.
[3:07:44.120 --> 3:07:46.800]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:47.800]  Survival Shield X2.
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:51.160]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:55.400]  iodine survival shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:08:05.040]  So win, win, infowarslife.com.
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:10.440]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:29.680]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:08:29.680 --> 3:08:34.320]  Well Anthony Cumia is a syndicated radio host, I'd call him a Libertarium and we're
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:37.280]  getting ready to launch 18 hours a day of live broadcast.
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:40.320]  We're gonna have a morning show and a late night show soon and of course he's got his
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:43.400]  own network and his own great work, but he's invited on any time he wants.
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:49.720]  Everybody should also go and actually visit his sites and his Twitter and more because
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:54.640]  just amazing information is there at compoundmedia.com.
[3:08:54.640 --> 3:08:59.000]  We had one of his great hosts, Gavin McGinnis on for an hour earlier and he's somebody that
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:06.960]  I'd call Libertarium who said mild stuff about cop killer groups and people and got kicked
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:12.120]  off the number one show arguably was right there with Howard Stern off of XM after he'd
[3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:15.840]  been on that for over a decade and so that's why I'm so honored to have him here with us
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:20.120]  because he'll say things like it's you know wrong to say that if you built your business
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:24.040]  you didn't build that which sounds like common sense, but that's what he was kicked off XM
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:28.440]  and traditional radio for, but as they kick all their big talents off, they're just killing
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:32.000]  themselves because everyone's just coming here, they're going to compoundmedia.com.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:36.360]  Now I gotta get out of here the next 30 minutes because this is his hour, he does every few
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:39.480]  weeks with us, we appreciate it, kind of beta testing things.
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:42.840]  We got Chris and Rod and a few other callers, David Knight's got a ton, he wants to hit,
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:45.560]  a lot of them on the Natalie News tonight with some other things we didn't cover, but
[3:09:45.560 --> 3:09:48.120]  I want to just get out of the gates.
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:51.600]  Anthony Coomi is ticked because don't agree with me if you don't and I know he wouldn't
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:59.160]  anyways, but I don't want us to underestimate how big a self-immolation, a control demolition,
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:07.240]  a implosion, a wrecking ball, a self-destruct this was, he leaked, he let them lie about
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:12.160]  the leak, he perjured himself, Trump didn't do any of the things they said, on and on,
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:16.160]  he followed orders from Lynch to shut down investigations, that's what that means.
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:22.200]  I mean this was unbelievable and he looked like he'd been run over by a car when he left,
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:25.600]  the enemies of Trump looked like they'd been punched in the stomach, Anthony Coomi, what
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:27.240]  do you make of the hearings?
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:35.480]  Oh my God, I watched it with great interest and excitement and yeah, I do agree with you
[3:10:35.480 --> 3:10:43.440]  on that, he did get, well his ass handed to him, but oh my goodness, if you go to social
[3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:48.560]  media or go to some of the mainstream media, most of the mainstream media, you will think
[3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:51.280]  you watched a completely different thing.
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:58.040]  I mean, I don't understand how people can watch the same thing and get completely different
[3:10:58.040 --> 3:11:01.520]  opposing viewpoints of what they just watched.
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:06.280]  I'm still hearing people saying, well this is it, this is the beginning of the impeachment
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:13.240]  process for Donald Trump, that's it, oh Coomi sunk him today, thank goodness, it'll all
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:19.400]  be over soon and I'm arguing with people going, where is one shred of evidence that
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:26.160]  there was collusion or obstruction of justice or anything else they want to come up with?
[3:11:26.160 --> 3:11:31.440]  I love how they use, whenever the Democrats are up there at these hearings, you hear things
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:34.080]  like, well how did you feel?
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:35.320]  How did you feel?
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:40.240]  What was your interpretation of what happened that day?
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:45.540]  Did he, what did he mean when that, and the Republicans will say, well here's a transcript
[3:11:45.540 --> 3:11:46.880]  of your notes.
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:52.640]  And I quote, Donald Trump said, I hope we can get this out of the way or take care of
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:53.640]  this.
[3:11:53.640 --> 3:12:00.720]  So you're looking at facts versus raw liberal emotion that we know over the course of the
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:03.360]  years is a fantasy world.
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:05.760]  They are in fantasy land.
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:10.600]  When they watch something, they see and interpret it how they want to.
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:17.200]  So when the mainstream media feeds these people, they feed them like chickens.
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:23.880]  They just start feeding them outright lies, just lies about what they just watched.
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:25.880]  Let's be clear.
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:28.080]  We are not being delusional here.
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:34.840]  When stuff's bad, we'll say it, but I totally agree with Anthony Coomi of Compound Media
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:39.840]  because that's what they do, I mean he admits the president didn't order him to do that.
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:42.020]  He admits they were reported wrong in the memo.
[3:12:42.020 --> 3:12:43.680]  He contradicts his other testimony.
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:46.200]  He admits he leaked all of this is bombshell.
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:48.760]  He admits that Loretta Lynch did all this.
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:50.640]  This is a huge defeat by any yardstick.
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:54.320]  Even old liberals like Chris Matthews say, this is the end of the Russian narrative it
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:59.720]  imploded today, but you're right on online and even CNN, they're declaring this is a
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:00.720]  giant victory.
[3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:04.080]  Hell, they might come out and say that Germany won World War II.
[3:13:04.080 --> 3:13:05.080]  Anthony.
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:06.080]  Yeah.
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:07.080]  I do.
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:10.680]  I really don't get that mindset.
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:14.000]  You saw the Patriots lost to Super Bowl last year.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  Yeah.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:21.400]  I find it so frustrating when you go on social media and realize that there are so many people
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:27.320]  just roped in to this liberal narrative that the mainstream media throws out there that
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:31.120]  this was a horrible day for Donald Trump.
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:38.520]  They'll take a quote like, well, I guess Mueller's going to have to decide whether this was any
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  crimes were committed, obstruction or anything like that.
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.280]  And they take that as like, well, obstruction is still on the table.
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:47.280]  No, you're right.
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:48.280]  That's a new talking point.
[3:13:48.280 --> 3:13:50.960]  No, we just think he's not the BI director anymore and has no say over it.
[3:13:50.960 --> 3:13:55.040]  So why would he comment on whether how this whole thing is going to turn out?
[3:13:55.040 --> 3:13:56.920]  But they run with that.
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:59.760]  They run with it as if it's still on the table.
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:00.760]  No, that's right.
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:02.720]  In fact, you've got the talking point right.
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:06.960]  That's the new talking point everywhere is impeachment on the table, obstruction on the
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:09.120]  table, Russia narrative move forward.
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:13.000]  It just got blown to kingdom come in front of everybody.
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:15.960]  And then they spin it and turn it around into that, Anthony.
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:17.120]  How long can this go on?
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:20.560]  Because I see the people really turning against this narrative now.
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:22.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:28.520]  Within the first five minutes of the hearings, he had said that Donald Trump was told he
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:30.400]  was not under investigation.
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:33.960]  This is something we had been lied to about on mainstream media.
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:39.440]  A million times they said that Comey is leaking that he did never tell Trump that he was not
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:40.440]  under investigation.
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:41.440]  And it's confirmed.
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:42.440]  That's another bombshell.
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:43.440]  That's right.
[3:14:43.440 --> 3:14:45.120]  He confirmed it multiple times.
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:50.400]  He said there's no evidence of any collusion with Donald Trump.
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:52.640]  It was just he threw it all out there.
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:56.760]  Like you said, a bombshell and they just won't listen to it.
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:02.720]  He bounces right off their eardrums and whatever they want to hear, that's what they hear.
[3:15:02.720 --> 3:15:05.400]  And yes, this will go on for some time.
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:11.920]  I see too many people out there in public that just will not accept what's going on.
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:14.400]  He was elected president to the United States.
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:20.000]  He will be president of the United States until 2020 and perhaps longer.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:21.160]  And that's it.
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:22.160]  That's all you have.
[3:15:22.160 --> 3:15:27.680]  Do you think they'll be successful rolling out the rock or the head of Facebook, Zuckerberg
[3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:29.280]  to defeat him?
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:30.960]  Oh, yeah.
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:32.680]  Well, you know what?
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:38.080]  It's interesting that so many people now are changing their attitudes and the right and
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:41.800]  conservatives in all media are coming out and saying things.
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:46.760]  Finally, they are not just going, well, I'll go to work or well, I'll take care of my kids
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:47.960]  or raise my family.
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:51.360]  Now they feel motivated like, no, we have to do something.
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:55.720]  And I think that's why you see people like Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher getting some
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:15:57.080]  pushback now.
[3:15:57.080 --> 3:16:02.120]  We just used to sit down and go, ah, all right, I know stuff like this happens.
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:08.120]  But when the left would go after people and get them fired as we all know.
[3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:09.120]  That's right.
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:11.120]  Anthony Cummings is hosting the Sorry, Let Us Coast with him.
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:13.920]  I want to get a few of these calls out of the way and skip the breaks.
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:14.920]  We have more time.
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:17.200]  And David Knight's got some clips he wants to play and get your take on.
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:19.960]  But pulling back from this, I've got the clips right here.
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:23.240]  Loretta Lynch, influence, he admitted that happened.
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:27.160]  He went on to admit the New York Times expanded and exaggerated and made up the Russian area.
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:28.160]  It's not true.
[3:16:28.160 --> 3:16:29.160]  He said, I'm weak.
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:30.160]  I'm cowardly.
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:31.160]  I'm afraid.
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:34.920]  Why do you think he would make bizarre comments, Anthony Cummings, about himself like that?
[3:16:34.920 --> 3:16:43.480]  This is to get an image like, you know, hey, I'm a weak and tired and I'm, he's trying
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:49.480]  to be like Tom Hanks or, you know, that whole gosh darn it kind of a guy likeable.
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:52.760]  He's one of the biggest camera whores I've ever seen.
[3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:56.720]  He loves being in the news and in front of a camera.
[3:16:56.720 --> 3:17:03.120]  And I think if he looks like he's, well, he's catering to the, the beta males out there,
[3:17:03.120 --> 3:17:06.360]  all the, the males on the left, the, that's exactly what we thought.
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:10.960]  I mean, if some guy like him toddled over and was going, Lordy, Lordy, how you doing?
[3:17:10.960 --> 3:17:13.920]  I think serial killer con artist, get away from this guy quick.
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:18.320]  I mean, the way he talks and acts, I would run, I mean, who would hang out and have a
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:19.320]  beer with this guy?
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:20.320]  Would you hang out with this?
[3:17:20.320 --> 3:17:22.040]  Would you buy a used car from Comey?
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:24.080]  Uh, no, absolutely not.
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:27.680]  Uh, although he would make a good used car salesman because there are a lot of rubes
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:30.480]  out there that are buying his line.
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:31.480]  All right.
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:34.760]  Now let's get into the big enchilada issue here.
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:35.760]  What should happen to Comey?
[3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:40.520]  USA Today says Trump's lawyer says James Comey made unauthorized disclosures of privileged
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:41.520]  talks.
[3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:42.520]  Yeah.
[3:17:42.520 --> 3:17:43.520]  It was illegal, but that's not what's even big.
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:48.200]  He didn't give it to the DOJ if he was so disturbed and thought it might be criminal.
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:53.080]  He says it isn't criminal now, but he kept it for himself like Hillary's private server.
[3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:54.600]  Yeah.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:56.520]  Why wouldn't you say something?
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:18:00.720]  Obviously, if he thought there was a problem, you would want to convey that through the
[3:18:00.720 --> 3:18:01.920]  proper channels.
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:03.280]  He didn't do that.
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:06.560]  Um, he, again, more interpretation.
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:07.840]  Well, Trump said this.
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:15.680]  So I think what I, what I assume he meant, uh, without any basis, uh, besides a guy that,
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:20.760]  by the way, just got fired, uh, so he's not going to hold his boss in, in the best light
[3:18:20.760 --> 3:18:22.920]  possible.
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:29.120]  And uh, I think yes, something should have, there should be some type of, I hate all these
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:35.360]  investigations, but someone should look into why, uh, he didn't say something.
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:40.120]  And again, look into the whole, uh, Hillary and, uh, Bill Clinton and Lynch on the runway.
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:44.560]  Did you see the, the, the, the Marco Rubio clip when he said, boy, you sure leaked everything
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:46.240]  with the fact that Trump was innocent.
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:50.560]  We now learn and that you're confirming that Trump, uh, never, you know, asked you to,
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:18:51.920]  to, to stop anything.
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:56.560]  And that he did, you did tell him that he wasn't under investigation.
[3:18:56.560 --> 3:18:59.760]  Everything that, that the media has been lying for all these months now is all confirmed,
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:01.040]  but no headlines.
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:03.480]  Trump vindicated, call me disgrace.
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:04.480]  Where are the headlines?
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:07.840]  Alex, they came apart as Chris Matthews said, because of what you just said.
[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:13.840]  And also because he said, he revealed that Flynn wasn't central to the Russian investigation.
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:15.960]  That's another key thing that came, came out of this.
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:17.560]  And so, yeah, there's nothing there.
[3:19:17.560 --> 3:19:21.680]  And now you've got Chris Matthews saying, if that's not the case, where's the, there,
[3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:22.680]  there?
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:23.680]  In other words, this is a nothing burger.
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:25.800]  We even had a cartoon on our website yesterday.
[3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:26.800]  We had Hillary Clinton.
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:27.800]  It's a hoax.
[3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:28.800]  Clinton's right.
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:30.880]  And there it opens up the burger and there's nothing there.
[3:19:30.880 --> 3:19:33.040]  As you said, would you like lies with that?
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:34.040]  Like fries?
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:35.040]  Let me ask you this and then get into your other point.
[3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:41.040]  These calls, what, how do they get punished for this hoax, this giant hoax, this huge
[3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:42.040]  lie?
[3:19:42.040 --> 3:19:44.760]  Do you think he would just declare his victory and moves on day and night?
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:48.360]  I think, I think Grassley is onto him, Alex.
[3:19:48.360 --> 3:19:49.360]  There's the cartoon.
[3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:50.360]  You can see that.
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:51.360]  I think Grassley is onto him.
[3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:54.840]  I think a key thing here is the dirty dossier, Christopher Steele.
[3:19:54.840 --> 3:19:57.360]  Grassley said, and this was in a letter that he sent March the same.
[3:19:57.360 --> 3:20:01.680]  He got this guy in England that pulls out of his rear end, that Trump likes to be pee-peed
[3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:04.600]  on with no evidence, and it's been proven to be discredited.
[3:20:04.600 --> 3:20:09.240]  He says the idea that the FBI would pay this guy, that associates of the Clinton campaign
[3:20:09.240 --> 3:20:10.400]  would pay this guy.
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:13.200]  This is substantial questions about the FBI's independence from politics.
[3:20:13.200 --> 3:20:16.040]  He wrote this to Comey the beginning of March.
[3:20:16.040 --> 3:20:20.280]  He said, as well as, it raises questions as well as on the Obama administration's use
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:23.120]  of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.
[3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:24.760]  Now, he didn't get a reply.
[3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:27.400]  Feinstein sent a letter to him, said, we're concerned about this as well.
[3:20:27.400 --> 3:20:28.400]  He didn't reply.
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:32.160]  Instead, he sent a four-sentence letter back, and so then he got a multiple-page letter
[3:20:32.160 --> 3:20:33.160]  coming back from Grassley.
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:34.320]  He said, you didn't send that to me.
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:35.640]  He gave me four sentences.
[3:20:35.640 --> 3:20:40.000]  Two of those are simply boilerplate closers for any FBI thing, and he says we need to
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  know what's going on here.
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:45.200]  He said, there are material inconsistencies between the description of the FBI's relationship
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:49.320]  with Mr. Steele that you provide in your briefing and information contained in the Justice
[3:20:49.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  Department documents.
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:52.160]  And so he asked him specific questions.
[3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:56.160]  He said, document please for me all payments that you made to Mr. Steele, including for
[3:20:56.160 --> 3:20:57.760]  travel expenses.
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:01.280]  Document to me when the FBI was in contact with Mr. Steele, or otherwise, relying on
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:03.120]  information in the dossier.
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:07.560]  Was it aware that his employer, Fusion GPS, was allegedly simultaneously working as an
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:09.880]  unregistered agent for Russian interests?
[3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:11.760]  I'll talk about this more on the nightly news tonight.
[3:21:11.760 --> 3:21:12.760]  By the way, I was told...
[3:21:12.760 --> 3:21:14.200]  He understands this was the...
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:15.200]  This was the real thing.
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:17.720]  Flynn is just talking to a Russian ambassador as part of the transition.
[3:21:17.720 --> 3:21:19.200]  Listen, I know we have limited time.
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:21.600]  You're talking faster than I am, but this is important, but we don't want to take up
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:22.600]  his time.
[3:21:22.600 --> 3:21:23.600]  But let me explain.
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:29.040]  I was told by State Department and CIA sources that I don't want to get into on here, okay?
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:31.600]  But I mean, we've said this, we've done this, we have our sources.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:34.200]  Hell, I talk to the President sometimes.
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:39.640]  And they said, Alex, believe me, you're totally off in left field, even defending Trump, saying
[3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:41.040]  he's, you know, not with the Russians.
[3:21:41.040 --> 3:21:42.040]  You understand?
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:46.520]  Hillary, literally, was on their payroll because they thought she was going to win.
[3:21:46.520 --> 3:21:52.320]  And all these dossiers and things are through the Russians on Piscay.
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:53.320]  And all this.
[3:21:53.320 --> 3:21:54.320]  And I just said...
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:55.320]  And hey, these are multiple...
[3:21:55.320 --> 3:21:56.320]  But these are like high-level people.
[3:21:56.320 --> 3:21:59.280]  We're talking high-level generals above Flynn.
[3:21:59.280 --> 3:22:04.120]  We're talking about CIA, State Department, all of them telling me this.
[3:22:04.120 --> 3:22:07.480]  And I just kind of was around the office and I said this, because I was taking this like
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:11.400]  some new anti-Russian narrative that, my God, this anti-Russian narrative is so bad, I must
[3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:15.000]  be giving disinfo to be anti-Russian one way or the other.
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:16.720]  No, they later explained, watch.
[3:22:16.720 --> 3:22:21.080]  And now Grassley's come out, we learned, months ago, and it's true that the Russians were
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:22.680]  double betting, which any government would do.
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:23.680]  We're not anti-Russia.
[3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:24.680]  It's just a fact.
[3:22:24.680 --> 3:22:28.800]  And that's why the Clintons were so scared once they lost is because they know they've
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:33.000]  been on the Russian payroll, so they got to accuse Trump of what they've done and then
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  all the proof's there.
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  Let's go to Anthony Comey on that, covering their butts.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:38.520]  Oh, my God.
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:39.520]  Yeah.
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:47.160]  Boy, we sure saw a double standard between the way Hillary was treated by Comey and the
[3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:52.160]  way Trump and his people are being treated by Comey.
[3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:58.560]  What I see there also is, why does Comey get a pass?
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:06.280]  Why doesn't he have to answer for calling off the investigation or wrapping up the investigation
[3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:13.200]  on Hillary Clinton when we had real evidence there of things like collusion, corruption.
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:17.080]  Yeah, the guy creating the Piscay-Gossier is on the Russian payroll.
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:18.080]  That's right.
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:19.080]  Right.
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:20.080]  That's right.
[3:23:20.080 --> 3:23:27.480]  And as far as Flynn goes, people actually think Flynn was in trouble because of colluding
[3:23:27.480 --> 3:23:28.600]  with the Russians.
[3:23:28.600 --> 3:23:32.520]  No, he was well within his business to speak to the Russians.
[3:23:32.520 --> 3:23:38.320]  It was the lying to the FBI that was the topic of the investigation.
[3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:39.320]  But again,
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:40.320]  But let me give you the real thing.
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:41.320]  He didn't fill out paperwork.
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:42.320]  What people don't even talk about.
[3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:43.320]  Exactly.
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:44.840]  And they think, they believe it's a collusion case.
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:46.840]  They're trying to get processed.
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:47.840]  Well, I knew this.
[3:23:47.840 --> 3:23:48.840]  They just got it on Comey.
[3:23:48.840 --> 3:23:53.000]  I knew this before the election even ended, that Flynn was, and I know I like Flynn Ray
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  Patriot.
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:55.200]  He's totally a patriot like Trump.
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:59.080]  He just was doing consulting deals with Turkey and a bunch of other places that weren't properly
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:01.480]  disclosed on paperwork because it's so complex.
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:03.720]  The real reason he's gone is the Turkey thing.
[3:24:03.720 --> 3:24:05.160]  And I said that before it ever came out.
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:06.680]  It was just paperwork stuff.
[3:24:06.680 --> 3:24:11.400]  And Trump went on top of it, you've been doing lobbying, not just for the U.S. but
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:12.400]  foreign.
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:15.480]  I said five-year ban on lobbyists go.
[3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:17.880]  That's why he's gone.
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:18.880]  That's why he's gone.
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:19.880]  Let's take two calls.
[3:24:19.880 --> 3:24:21.520]  I'm going to get out here and let Anthony Comey take over.
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:24.440]  He's nice to let us board his show like this.
[3:24:24.440 --> 3:24:25.440]  Please.
[3:24:25.440 --> 3:24:26.440]  Let's go to Chris and Indiana.
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:27.440]  Chris, you're a real trooper.
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:30.440]  Chris and Indiana, you're on the air with Anthony Comey on CompoundMedia.com.
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:31.440]  Hello, gentlemen.
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:32.440]  Go ahead.
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:33.440]  Hi.
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:38.360]  First of all, I'd like to give a shout out to everyone in the YouTube live stream chat
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:39.560]  on your channel.
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:41.680]  So what's up, everyone?
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:46.200]  And that was the biggest dog and pony show ever, man.
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:52.040]  Giant Kami, James Comey, I mean, he's committing open perjury up there and all those people
[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:55.840]  questioning him know this, why don't they bring it up and pull them through the ringer
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:24:56.840]  for it?
[3:24:56.840 --> 3:24:59.080]  And what's up with that in hiding with his wife and stuff?
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:00.080]  What's up with that?
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:01.080]  Let me say this.
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:04.200]  Like I said about Humpty Dumpty, all the King's horses, all the King's men couldn't
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:07.760]  put him back together again, despite all of them up there, except a few, kissing his
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:09.760]  butt, trying to prop him up.
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:13.480]  He was just train wrecking, train wrecking, but I guess that's because we're informed
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:14.480]  and intellectual.
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:18.560]  We just think of ourselves as regular guys with families, but we're actually into politics.
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:23.000]  So we know what a train wreck it was, maybe the idiots that never watched a baseball game,
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:26.960]  maybe they think you're supposed to hit the ball and it gets caught by somebody and then
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:28.240]  you don't make it around the bases.
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:31.360]  I mean, maybe they think that, Anthony.
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:37.920]  You know, why isn't the media all over the, the, what, who was the head, the director
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:44.120]  of the federal bureau of investigation, leaked, leaked information to the media?
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:45.120]  I've never heard of that.
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:52.560]  There's something done and it's not the biggest thing right now on every single newscast.
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:59.200]  The biggest thing that is such a breach of, of the public trust.
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:04.560]  I don't even know how this isn't immediately criminal, how he wasn't taken out of there
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:05.560]  in cuffs.
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:08.640]  Well, I think we should start a hashtag jail, jail, jail coming.
[3:26:08.640 --> 3:26:13.240]  I mean, instead of Hillary for president, he's the deep throat of the deep state.
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:16.440]  Because remember, deep throat, they said, well, let's start, let's start it on real
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:17.440]  Alex Jones.
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:18.440]  We can all retweet it.
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:19.440]  How about, how about jail?
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:20.440]  Comey.
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:21.880]  We can link it to an article pointing out how this is criminal.
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:24.240]  The U.S. today right here, the president's going that direction.
[3:26:24.240 --> 3:26:25.240]  Yeah.
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:26.240]  One more caller.
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:27.240]  I'm going to let comey and take over.
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:28.240]  He's done a great job here letting us board.
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:29.240]  I need to get him back on.
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:30.240]  She's a guest.
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:31.240]  We can do it.
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:32.240]  Rod in North Carolina.
[3:26:32.240 --> 3:26:33.240]  You're on the air worldwide.
[3:26:33.240 --> 3:26:38.000]  Well, Alex, Anthony and David, God bless you.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.080]  I'm happy to be on you guys team.
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  Thank you.
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:47.160]  I want to talk about this war that we're in and how, you know, we're surrounded.
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:48.160]  Trump is surrounded.
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:49.160]  We're surrounded.
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:58.600]  We're surrounded by the globalists, the deep state, the Democrats, you know, news media
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:05.160]  and worst of all, the establishment Republicans.
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:13.120]  We need to get united as Trump voters and, you know, strike a blow for the president.
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:22.600]  I think if you look at all of these surrounding us, the one that we could really strike a
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:27.880]  blow and deal with is the establishment Republicans.
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:35.480]  We could get a theme and a meme where we, the theme would be like to have a pledge or
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:41.040]  a declaration, something along the declaration of independence where we lay out the grievances
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:47.520]  where, you know, we've elected the Republicans over and over again and they've screwed us,
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:48.840]  you know, once they get in office.
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:51.920]  And Trump's finally trying to, we're going to make this color, boss.
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:52.920]  Stay right there.
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:55.400]  I want to comment on this, Rod, and get their comments.
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:59.000]  I said, go protest the media as the enemy, the Kathy Griffin $200,000 contest, but I
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  said it's expanding and we're about to play some of those clips and some of the winners
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  here.
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:06.600]  There's already been a few, but I agree, Soros is targeting Republicans to make them
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:07.840]  turn against Trump.
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:11.640]  We need to be targeting establishment Republicans to make them back Trump and the Bill of Rights
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:12.640]  and Constitution.
[3:28:12.640 --> 3:28:17.800]  So I'm saying $1,000 against our national TV of an establishment Republican being exposed
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:23.520]  as an anti-Trump, anti-American globalist, 2,500 if you get it hardcore, themfullwars.com,
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:25.640]  all over the news, that's part of the contest as well.
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:26.640]  This color is a genius.
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:27.640]  David Knight.
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:28.920]  You know, Alex, I think we're at a tipping point.
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:32.920]  We had NSA whistleblowers like William Benny and Thomas Drake.
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:38.200]  Now we have the FISA court acting as a whistleblower saying, look, these people, the intelligence
[3:28:38.200 --> 3:28:40.320]  state is working like Watergate burglars.
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:41.320]  We're at a tipping point.
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:45.440]  If we keep pushing on this, we can get good people in Washington to do the right thing.
[3:28:45.440 --> 3:28:46.760]  I think it's very important at this point.
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:47.760]  No, that's it.
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:48.760]  That's it.
[3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:52.560]  Comey had his own secret server and the deep states acting like Watergate burglars.
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:53.400]  That's right.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:54.400]  Thank you so much.
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:28:55.400]  Rod, anything else?
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:29:01.440]  I'd like to say that, you know, if we did this, if we had a pledge that every Trump
[3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:06.840]  voter could get on board and sign it, we could shoot it to these people via email, call them
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:11.680]  on the phone, and not just the establishment of Republicans, just say to the Republicans
[3:29:11.680 --> 3:29:12.680]  as a whole.
[3:29:12.680 --> 3:29:13.680]  Sure.
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:15.880]  Call it the pledge to make America great again.
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:16.880]  We all take it.
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:17.960]  Trump takes it.
[3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:18.960]  They better take it.
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:19.960]  That's a great idea.
[3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:20.960]  Anthony Cummings.
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:21.960]  What's coming up next?
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:22.960]  You're taking over.
[3:29:22.960 --> 3:29:30.920]  Well, obviously, this whole story with Comey and the hearings, Trump, the fake media, there's
[3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:36.520]  just a bounty of material from that and a couple of other things on the hypocrisy of
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:39.320]  the left and the intolerant left.
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:41.240]  We've got all the clips, whatever you want, they're there.
[3:29:41.240 --> 3:29:47.960]  Anthony Cummings with compoundmedia.com coming up from the great state of America.

[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:54.680]  Even the EPA has admitted that more than 800 million pounds of pesticides is dumped in
[3:33:54.680 --> 3:33:59.640]  the US every year and 80% of these pesticides are used on our crops.
[3:33:59.640 --> 3:34:01.680]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:06.440]  No matter what you do, it's virtually impossible to avoid all the toxic metals and chemicals.

[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:08.400]  Uh, man, this has been some day because, uh, uh, it starts watching by watching the, uh,
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:17.680]  Comey hearings and, um, man, you sure know what side, uh, what team the, uh, Congress
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:22.120]  person, I want to be politically correct, the Congress person is on when they throw
[3:35:22.120 --> 3:35:23.120]  the questions out.
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:29.560]  I don't need the D or the R next to their name because the Democrats, uh, well, they're
[3:35:29.560 --> 3:35:36.360]  questioning, uh, Comey, just vicious, uh, vile, a lot of lying coming out, a lot of
[3:35:36.360 --> 3:35:42.200]  leading questions, trying to, uh, put their point of view out there.
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:44.880]  Um, this should be about fact gathering.
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:49.480]  And boy, I know I've seen Republicans do the same thing when, uh, these shoes on the other
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:56.000]  foot, as they say, when Hillary Clinton was up there, uh, you know, uh, the, the Republicans
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:59.960]  were a lot more, uh, vicious with her, well, they should be.
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:05.000]  Uh, but, uh, I want to know facts.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  I don't want to know, uh, a party line, uh, of, of why a person did something that they
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  did.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:15.960]  They, they asked Comey a question and they want an answer.
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:17.760]  They want a certain answer from it.
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:19.320]  They don't want the truth.
[3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:25.000]  They want him to say something that bodes well for their team.
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.880]  And that is against what this whole thing is supposed to be facts, finding facts, getting
[3:36:31.880 --> 3:36:33.600]  them out to the American people.
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:40.640]  So we could decide who, uh, is, is a best to, uh, uh, run, run the government and who
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:43.920]  should be thrown the hell out and who should go to jail.
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:44.920]  That's what I want to know.
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:46.360]  I want the facts.
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:55.920]  So when, uh, they sit there and talk about feelings and by opinion of an idea that some
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:37:04.880]  I don't care if Donald Trump said he hopes they could wrap up with the, uh, Flynn, uh,
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:11.000]  investigation, I hope we can, you know, get through this, get, get past this, whatever
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:14.080]  that is him saying, I hope we can.
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:17.680]  Does anyone doubt that he hoped they could get through that?
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:19.160]  Of course he did.
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:26.080]  He had said numerous times that the investigation, uh, on the whole was, uh, uh, interfering
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:29.720]  with his ability to do the job he was elected to do.
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:35.440]  So of course he wanted it over with any hoped to the guy running the investigation that
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:38.800]  it could be remedied as quickly as possible.
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:47.840]  Well, let's bring on the mainstream media to say, what does that mean?
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:51.960]  Well it means he hopes it could be wrapped up.
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.600]  That's what it means.
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:38:00.280]  But the interpretations you will hear from mainstream media and the brainwashed minion
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:07.280]  or the paid Soros minion on social media is just one of the most frustrating things.
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:12.120]  I really got to just sit back and throw my phone away from me at some point, because
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:20.400]  I can't stop trying to beat it into these people's heads that they are being manipulated
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:22.840]  by mainstream media.
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:27.320]  They hear what they want to hear on the news and the news feeds it to them as they want
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:30.940]  to hear it and they just think it's fact.
[3:38:30.940 --> 3:38:37.720]  The truth of the matter is, Comey got up there and said, uh, that Trump wasn't being investigated
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:46.600]  at no time during his tenure as director of the FBI was Donald Trump being, uh, uh, investigated.
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:53.800]  That right there was giant, a huge statement to make because we had heard from mainstream
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:59.480]  media that, oh, look out, a president that's under investigation, this is unbelievable.
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:01.080]  Well it wasn't happening.
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:03.680]  Just one of the many lies.
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:11.280]  Oh, was, uh, was he involved, uh, colluding with the Russians, uh, to, to, uh, affect
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:15.120]  the, uh, change, uh, affect the election who was elected?
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:17.200]  No, no.
[3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:24.920]  Well, was there any evidence that anybody in Trump's, uh, circle during the campaign
[3:39:24.920 --> 3:39:30.640]  was involved in any way of the, uh, with the Russians trying to affect the election?
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:33.160]  No.
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:36.960]  What does that mean to a liberal impeachment?
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:38.040]  It's impeachment.
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:40.240]  It's happening.
[3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:48.240]  I don't understand how you can look at something so clear cut, so simple and get the complete
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:54.720]  opposite, uh, idea of what, what was just said.
[3:39:54.720 --> 3:39:59.960]  This, I really see this as being a modern, recent thing that is happening.
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:09.360]  And I put the blame squarely on mainstream media years ago, uh, they were able to manipulate
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:15.520]  people's opinion and they saw that that was, uh, good for them, um, whoever the powers
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:20.600]  that be were in place at the time would give information to the media.
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:21.600]  They would put it out there.
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:24.840]  They would manipulate, uh, hearts and minds.
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:29.840]  Well, recently they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:36.960]  They are blatantly lying to drive people's opinions in a certain direction.
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:42.480]  And people are being misled and lied to and given information that they then spread on
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:45.600]  social media as fact.
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:49.040]  We saw this with hands up, don't shoot.
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:56.560]  We see this with Trump, it's all during the campaign, um, and now during his, uh, presidency
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:00.280]  just blatant lies and then they're exposed.
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:08.040]  Lies were exposed this afternoon during the Comey hearings exposed and they weren't lies
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:09.800]  that Donald Trump was telling.
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:15.520]  They were lies that the media was telling the people of this country and they were called
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:17.040]  out who they were.
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:23.680]  The Washington Post, the Huffington Post, uh, mainstream news, CNN, they are being called
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:24.680]  out.
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:33.080]  You can see screen caps of their ticker on the bottom saying one thing and it being disproved
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:38.960]  today during the hearings, yet people still won't believe it.
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:41.760]  I don't know what it's going to take.
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:50.000]  Now watching these, uh, mainstream media, uh, uh, broadcast, uh, it's, it's detrimental.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:58.280]  If you're not watching it as sole research into how the media is corrupting the population
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:04.560]  of this country and the world, if you're watching it to actually get news, uh, that's a huge
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:06.840]  problem and you should probably stop.
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:14.360]  I feel like I, I have to do an intervention here and tell you, please, please turn away.
[3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:21.520]  If you're watching for research on how poorly they are presenting news to people, then there,
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:25.320]  there's plenty to, plenty to chew on as far as that goes.
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:34.560]  Uh, we also learned that, um, Russia was indeed, uh, using, uh, computers, cyber attacks
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:38.160]  to somehow affect the election.
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:41.040]  I don't know what side they were gunning for.
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:46.440]  As Alex has said, probably playing both sides of the fence, see who gets in there.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:55.120]  But, uh, uh, apparently the Democrats and the DNC made it so easy for them to get information
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:03.040]  and, uh, uh, emails and memos and everything else from their team that that's what was
[3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:12.240]  put out over, uh, WikiLeaks, uh, why, why blame the people that are ripping off, uh,
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:16.120]  your information out of your computer when you, you left the doors open.
[3:43:16.120 --> 3:43:21.480]  If I leave my doors open in my house, not even a lot unlocked wide open, my windows
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:24.280]  are open and I don't have a car in the driveway.
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:30.240]  Let me pile up some mail and newspapers by my mailbox and then I play the victim when
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:37.920]  someone comes in and steals my stuff, they, they almost put a sign out saying here, take
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:40.400]  our stuff and release it to the people.
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:48.360]  Also, they never once denied any one of those, uh, emails that were released, um, as part
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:54.000]  of this Russian, uh, intrusion on the election.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:56.960]  Never once did they deny one thing.
[3:43:56.960 --> 3:44:00.400]  So again, who's the bad guy here?
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:03.200]  Look, we're not fans of the Russians here.
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:07.800]  They've made an interesting adversary over the decades, but we don't sit there and go,
[3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:14.160]  yeah, look at them go, hack our computers, get into our intelligence, uh, undermine our
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:15.160]  military.
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:20.400]  No, we have to look at who they're taking stuff from and say, Hey, what?
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:21.400]  Come here.
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:22.400]  Come here.
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:24.200]  What are you doing?
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:25.520]  Lock your junk up.
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:32.920]  The moron, but again, and, and man, the left is great at doing this.
[3:44:32.920 --> 3:44:37.080]  The victim, he broke me.
[3:44:37.080 --> 3:44:38.880]  They love playing the victim.
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:40.520]  Even call me today.
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:41.520]  Even call me today.
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:44.520]  Well, I'm a bit of a coward.
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:47.400]  Oh, Lordy, I hope there's tapes.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:49.200]  Oh my gosh.
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:52.960]  Oh, I should certainly, uh, I wish I was stronger.
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:55.120]  I wish I was stronger.
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:02.880]  It's this victimization that the left will pull and it really resonates with their followers.
[3:45:02.880 --> 3:45:09.880]  It disgusts real men, by the way, to see a man just going like, Oh, really?
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:14.480]  Buck up, get in his face and say, Hey, I don't like what you were doing.
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:15.600]  I don't like what you're saying.
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:20.080]  I think there's some, uh, problems with us having a conversation like this.
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:21.080]  Do something.
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:28.400]  I think you sit in front of Congress and oh my gosh, oh well, wish I was a little stronger.
[3:45:28.400 --> 3:45:36.040]  It's embarrassing, but it plays well to the left because they are a collection of perpetual
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:38.560]  victims.
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:42.560]  Now you look at, uh, what the Russians were doing again, just wide open doors.
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:44.640]  They came in and took stuff.
[3:45:44.640 --> 3:45:46.000]  You can't blame them.
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:51.720]  But to say they had an effect on the election because that was released and not put an ounce
[3:45:51.720 --> 3:45:58.800]  of blame on the who, who could possibly be the worst candidate ever to run for president
[3:45:58.800 --> 3:46:06.600]  of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton and, uh, her merry men, uh, like Podesta and
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:11.960]  and, uh, the rest of the clowns that ran one of the worst campaigns ever, uh, that's why
[3:46:11.960 --> 3:46:12.960]  she lost.
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:19.240]  But the excuse is again, perpetual victimization coming out of the left.
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:27.320]  You never hear how, uh, how, how she had no agenda, how she was literally, and I hate
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:31.240]  when that word's used because it's used so improperly and much too often these days,
[3:46:31.240 --> 3:46:38.360]  but with Hillary, a few things can be literally, literally falling down on the job, literally
[3:46:38.360 --> 3:46:39.840]  falling down.
[3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:46.000]  Uh, these were things we didn't like to see in, uh, a potential president of the United
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:49.200]  States and we voted accordingly as a nation.
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:55.200]  We were also very tired of business as usual, uh, we felt for decades that we're getting
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:46:57.120]  screwed by Washington.
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:03.040]  They are not representative of the people, which is what they're supposed to be our representatives.
[3:47:03.040 --> 3:47:07.280]  I can't go over to Washington and go, Hey, Hey, Washington, I need this.
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:09.680]  So people represent you.
[3:47:09.680 --> 3:47:11.520]  Are you seeing that?
[3:47:11.520 --> 3:47:16.840]  Are you seeing somebody talking for you in Washington and going, Yeah, that's exactly
[3:47:16.840 --> 3:47:18.440]  what I wanted to say.
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:19.880]  That's exactly how I want this.
[3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:21.760]  No, I want more regulations.
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:26.520]  I want to have to pay an inspector so I could cut a tree down in my own yard.
[3:47:26.520 --> 3:47:29.320]  Is that really what we want our government doing?
[3:47:29.320 --> 3:47:33.040]  Well, our representatives are supposed to represent us.
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:34.400]  They don't do that.
[3:47:34.400 --> 3:47:39.160]  And Donald Trump is, uh, is the exact thing we needed.
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:44.920]  I get crucified all the time on Twitter and other social media because when I talk about
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:49.760]  Donald Trump and having voted for him and I talk about these hearings and saying that
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:55.720]  there is no evidence of collusion or, um, obstructing justice, people go, why do you
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:47:58.520]  have to kiss Donald Trump's ass so much?
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:01.200]  I'm like, I'm not kissing his ass.
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:05.120]  I don't even really like or dislike Donald Trump.
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:12.160]  I voted for him because I was tired of being screwed by every single elected official.
[3:48:12.160 --> 3:48:18.560]  And I thought a Donald Trump presidency is the best way to, uh, show them that we are
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:27.960]  sick and tired of, of us being their cash cows, uh, being led to slaughter.
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:32.680]  And we wanted a change, a big change, not these little changes that have gone on over
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:35.560]  the years, the same, same problem.
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:36.560]  Oh, is it Republican?
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:37.560]  He's a Democrat.
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:38.560]  He's this.
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:41.800]  Donald Trump showed them just how mad everybody was.
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:48.200]  Sure, I like some of his policies and ideas, uh, but I mostly liked that he wasn't any
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:50.400]  of them.
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:57.160]  And, uh, it really upset, uh, the, the whole Washington establishment.
[3:48:57.160 --> 3:49:05.240]  The left who loves, loves government buried deep inside them, loves it, can't stand this
[3:49:05.240 --> 3:49:09.280]  is happening because he just wants to stop big government.
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:17.000]  He wants to stop everybody telling you that you can't do this and that and pursue happiness
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:23.520]  in this, uh, great country that I have to pay a fee to cut a tree down in my yard.
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:29.160]  And I never told a politician to go to Washington and tell, tell whoever's in charge that I
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:32.800]  want to pay when I want to cut a tree down in my yard.
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:40.360]  That's the type of thing we needed changed was the government just so deep in, in us
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:44.080]  that, uh, we needed to show them something different.
[3:49:44.080 --> 3:49:47.240]  That's why Donald Trump won, not the Russians.
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:52.880]  It was Hillary being a lousy candidate and Washington screwing us so badly over so many
[3:49:52.880 --> 3:49:57.360]  years that we wanted Donald Trump, but the establishment can't take it and they will
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:50:00.960]  continue to try to come up with anything they can.
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:06.560]  So when you look at something like today with the Comey hearings and start seeing, hey,
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:11.000]  wow, he's really kind of exonerating, uh, Donald Trump here.
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:15.960]  He's vindicating him by saying these things and they turn it around still.
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:25.080]  They try to take any crumb of out of context conversation or an aside or a, I think I hope
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:30.960]  and turn it into a fact that he has, uh, committed some crime.
[3:50:30.960 --> 3:50:37.160]  It's I called it a mental illness in the past when I have chit chats with, uh, these people
[3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:41.760]  on, on various social media, I'm like, this is a mental illness.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:46.480]  It's childlike, it's immature, it's based solely on emotion.
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:47.960]  I want facts.
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:55.280]  I want facts and I want real court admitted evidence of collusion or obstruction.
[3:50:55.280 --> 3:50:58.960]  And we will never get that because it didn't happen info wars dot com.
[3:50:58.960 --> 3:51:02.240]  This is Elizabeth McCabe, AKA lucky one of truth frequency news.
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:06.360]  I wanted to tell you all about extendivite from heart drop.com y'all know I check everything
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:07.720]  before I air it.
[3:51:07.720 --> 3:51:12.120]  When I heard about extendivite on TFR, I went to heart drop.com and started my research.
[3:51:12.120 --> 3:51:13.360]  It's got cayenne.
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:14.680]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[3:51:14.680 --> 3:51:16.160]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[3:51:16.160 --> 3:51:20.320]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics and it blowers the cholesterol
[3:51:20.320 --> 3:51:21.320]  and blood pressure.
[3:51:21.320 --> 3:51:24.080]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best he talks for liver.
[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:27.120]  I couldn't wait to try it out and I'm glad I did four months ago.

[3:51:28.620 --> 3:51:30.280]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.

[3:52:07.280 --> 3:52:08.780]  to detoxify the body.
[3:52:08.780 --> 3:52:11.120]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:13.640]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:15.160]  It's made in the USA.
[3:52:15.160 --> 3:52:20.040]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:52:20.040 --> 3:52:21.880]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:52:21.880 --> 3:52:24.120]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:28.600]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:52:28.600 --> 3:52:33.200]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:34.200]  get.

[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:25.720]  Introducing the new EmRick's Essentials line of organic household products at infowarsstore.com.
[3:54:25.720 --> 3:54:31.000]  For over two decades listeners have been asking me and Alex why we don't carry our own line
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:37.120]  of organic household products like bug spray sunscreen and body wash at infowarsstore.com.
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:40.920]  The answer quite frankly because even after trying out hundreds of different brands and
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:44.280]  speaking to dozens of manufacturers there was always a deal breaker.
[3:54:44.280 --> 3:54:50.120]  Either products contain hidden toxic ingredients or they were way too overpriced, don't want
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  that.
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:56.160]  After 23 years I founded out about a company run by fellow patriots that was dedicated
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:55:00.840]  to producing high quality organic products that were even better and cost far less than
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:02.000]  other leading brands.
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:07.400]  They agreed to launch a new private label line with us called EmRick's Essentials and
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:11.360]  give us the best exclusive pricing that's about 20% less than many of the brands you
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:13.440]  see in major grocery stores.
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:19.320]  We're proud to introduce an entire new line of organic based household products at infowarsstore.com
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:26.280]  including non-nano SPF 30 sink oxide sunscreen, DEET free herbal bug spray, you don't want
[3:55:26.280 --> 3:55:32.640]  that DEET and concentrated peppermint mouthwash, pure unscented body wash, pure tea tree shampoo,
[3:55:32.640 --> 3:55:36.640]  long lasting natural deodorant and a lot more at infowarsstore.com.

[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  that's infowarsstore.com.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:54.880]  We got a couple of minutes left here and I got a hit on this story.
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:58.480]  This is beyond all reason.
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:03.920]  Kids are usually crucified these days for, you get an eight year old, nine, ten year
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:07.360]  old kid, a son and his dad.
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:12.880]  They're interested in going to the range and shooting rifle, teaching the kid about firearms.
[3:56:12.880 --> 3:56:14.680]  And oh my God, that's terrible.
[3:56:14.680 --> 3:56:17.200]  The kid should be taken away from his parents.
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:18.200]  That's crazy.
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:22.680]  Oh, the kid went to school today with a shirt that had the US Marine Corps on it.
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:23.680]  Why?
[3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:24.680]  He's crazy.
[3:56:24.680 --> 3:56:25.680]  He's a wild man.
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:26.680]  He's a potential murderer.
[3:56:26.680 --> 3:56:28.880]  Get him some psychiatric help.
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:31.040]  Oh my God, he got a flag.
[3:56:31.040 --> 3:56:33.680]  He has an American flag on his vehicle.
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:39.400]  Oh my God, your son is a maniac.
[3:56:39.400 --> 3:56:44.760]  The gay media, I don't know what the gay media is, but it's the gay media promoting an eight
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:47.640]  year old drag queen.
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:56.080]  This is an eight year old boy that is being gussied up as a girl and celebrated.
[3:56:56.080 --> 3:56:58.080]  This is celebrated.
[3:56:58.080 --> 3:57:03.520]  Now as far as gay rights go, I don't care what the heck you do with yourself.
[3:57:03.520 --> 3:57:04.840]  It's fine.
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:09.120]  But I absolutely see this as some form of child abuse.
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:17.520]  An eight year old is in no frame of mind to decide if he wants to be gussied up and paraded
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:24.680]  in front of a bunch of men that are also gussied up like a woman.
[3:57:24.680 --> 3:57:26.600]  This is insanity.
[3:57:26.600 --> 3:57:33.280]  And as I said, you will get kids, will get in trouble if they just do what is considered
[3:57:33.280 --> 3:57:40.800]  traditional activities with their dad or what have you.
[3:57:40.800 --> 3:57:46.840]  I remember going out and going shooting with my father and it was just a great experience.
[3:57:46.840 --> 3:57:52.920]  And now if this kid decided he wanted to go to school like that, do you think any school
[3:57:52.920 --> 3:57:59.760]  would throw him out or would they have to embrace it and take him in and show that it
[3:57:59.760 --> 3:58:01.840]  was all okay?
[3:58:01.840 --> 3:58:04.280]  The left is losing their mind.
[3:58:04.280 --> 3:58:07.280]  We are beyond the slippery slope here, people.
[3:58:07.280 --> 3:58:08.640]  We are well beyond.
[3:58:08.640 --> 3:58:13.720]  When you look at something like that, we are way beyond any slippery slope.
[3:58:13.720 --> 3:58:15.080]  We've slid down it.
[3:58:15.080 --> 3:58:16.560]  We've gone off the jump.
[3:58:16.560 --> 3:58:20.480]  And if you remember the old wide world of sports, agony and defeat, that's where we
[3:58:20.480 --> 3:58:21.800]  are right now.
[3:58:21.800 --> 3:58:28.600]  Head over ass over the edge of the ski jump in for the agony of defeat.
[3:58:28.600 --> 3:58:30.240]  I don't get it.
[3:58:30.240 --> 3:58:35.480]  All values are looked at as horrible things and get an eight-year-old boy dressed like
[3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:38.960]  a girl and be paraded around in front of other men.
[3:58:38.960 --> 3:58:40.760]  It's ludicrous.
[3:58:40.760 --> 3:58:45.120]  Anthony Kumia in for infowars.com, catch me on compoundmedia.com.
[3:58:45.120 --> 3:58:46.520]  We'll see you next time right here.
[3:58:46.520 --> 3:59:02.600]  Thanks, Alex.
