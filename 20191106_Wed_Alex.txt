[00:00.000 --> 00:29.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is 362 days from the 2020 election.
[00:29.280 --> 00:36.080]  And this country, this planet, is in a civil war between good and evil.
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.920]  No one could say that this is not edge of your seat, suspense, and it's for all the
[00:41.920 --> 00:42.920]  marbles.
[00:42.920 --> 00:47.800]  I'm going to have to break down this incredible transmission when we come back from this special
[00:47.800 --> 00:52.880]  report, but ladies and gentlemen, it is all coming down.
[00:52.880 --> 00:55.760]  We have reached the global tipping point.
[00:55.760 --> 01:03.720]  You think about men and women coming together, the ancestral line of the woman, the ancestral
[01:03.720 --> 01:11.360]  line of the man, coming together and creating a new creature that can experience the universe,
[01:11.360 --> 01:17.400]  beauty, pain, exaltation, it's all a giant experience.
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.560]  It's God's dream becoming consciousness and life throughout the universe and free will.
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.280]  But because that exists, there is also those that will dial into very, very bad things.
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.080]  They can't create anything good that can only defile.
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.840]  I think we're almost 24 hours away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the
[01:36.840 --> 01:37.960]  United States.
[01:37.960 --> 01:41.240]  Where does he stand in an open society?
[01:41.240 --> 01:49.920]  Well I have described him as an impostor and con man and a would be dictator.
[01:49.920 --> 01:56.280]  He would be dictator if he could get away with it, but he won't be able to.
[01:56.280 --> 02:00.040]  It's a public exercise of power.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.040]  It's a ritual.
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.040]  It is a defiling.
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.440]  You know, you look at the classic satanic rituals, but most people get into it because
[02:06.440 --> 02:08.360]  they think you're going to get to have sex with hot chicks or whatever.
[02:08.360 --> 02:09.720]  That's just low level.
[02:09.720 --> 02:12.600]  That's like chicken feed to get the chickens into the weasel dens.
[02:12.600 --> 02:22.040]  The weasel can eat you.
[02:22.040 --> 02:27.640]  But it's all about humiliating people, hurting people, and it's all about defiling God.
[02:27.640 --> 02:29.160]  Christian religion teaches good things.
[02:29.160 --> 02:30.160]  It teaches good morals.
[02:30.160 --> 02:31.280]  It teaches a good way of being.
[02:31.280 --> 02:34.720]  So why are you opposing that?
[02:34.720 --> 02:35.720]  Sometimes it does.
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.720]  Some of us came out of superstition ourselves and found it very liberating to be able to
[02:39.720 --> 02:41.520]  embrace the blasphemous.
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.440]  And it came out the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania alone.
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.400]  This came out in the report last year, 3,000 plus priests in the state police state report
[02:51.400 --> 02:56.800]  who had confessed to sex with children, mainly little boys, and that they would have black
[02:56.800 --> 03:01.200]  masses in the churches and then they would give them the sacrament.
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.400]  This is my body.
[03:02.400 --> 03:05.720]  This is my this is my blood.
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.080]  And in many cases, they gave the little boys HIV.
[03:09.080 --> 03:18.300]  One priest raped and assaulted and abused five sisters in the same family.
[03:18.300 --> 03:25.080]  One priest so violently raped a young boy that he had to get treatment for his back
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.400]  injuries as a result of that abuse, treatment that involved opioid painkillers that ultimately
[03:31.400 --> 03:34.120]  he got hooked on and died from.
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.000]  We saw Catholic priests weaponizing their faith.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.320]  Using their faith as a tool of the abuse.
[03:42.320 --> 03:49.200]  And all the while, the bishops, the Monsignors, the Cardinal covered it up.
[03:49.200 --> 03:53.520]  Why do you think Bill Clinton for 15 years no only shipped out factor 8 blood product
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.280]  with HIV and hepatitis in it?
[03:55.280 --> 03:56.760]  They knew it had it in it.
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.440]  And the executives, it turned out, in their transcript said, good, there's too many hemophiliacs.
[04:02.440 --> 04:08.240]  It was a blood ritual to hurt so many people infected with HIV by a transfusion.
[04:08.240 --> 04:10.880]  How many people have to die?
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.360]  It was the beginnings of what would later be defined as the deadliest medical scandal
[04:15.360 --> 04:17.320]  in this country's history.
[04:17.320 --> 04:20.920]  The public has a right to view this as a mass murder.
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.800]  In the mid 1980s, a horrifying discovery, the very blood that was intended to save people
[04:26.800 --> 04:27.800]  was killing them.
[04:27.800 --> 04:30.640]  If I fed my son poison, I'd be in jail.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.400]  How come the Red Cross can feed him poison and get away with it?
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.880]  It's the openness of our free society to the extreme to bring down our free society.
[04:38.880 --> 04:42.080]  And the high priest running this whole thing, now tell us, your children belong to us.
[04:42.080 --> 04:43.480]  Your speech is ours.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.480]  You will do as we say.
[04:44.480 --> 04:45.480]  Your money is ours.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.480]  Your guns are ours.
[04:46.480 --> 04:48.600]  They want absolute total power.
[04:48.600 --> 04:59.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:59.040 --> 05:03.360]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:03.360 --> 05:05.240]  I don't care what your views are.
[05:05.240 --> 05:08.480]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.480]  That's important.
[05:09.480 --> 05:10.800]  But we have something in common.
[05:10.800 --> 05:14.880]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[05:14.880 --> 05:20.440]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[05:20.440 --> 05:22.080]  to Congress in the world.
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.560]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get
[05:26.560 --> 05:27.560]  indicted.
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.320]  But word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.960]  My new home in New Zealand, I will...
[05:33.960 --> 05:40.600]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[05:40.600 --> 05:42.480]  Not so fast, criminal.
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.440]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[05:46.440 --> 05:51.160]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[05:51.160 --> 05:56.040]  But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at infowars.com,
[05:56.040 --> 06:03.040]  newswars.com and band dive video.
[06:26.040 --> 06:47.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much incredibly critical news that it makes it hard to even
[06:47.280 --> 06:49.200]  do this broadcast.
[06:49.200 --> 06:52.520]  The old days, people would complain that, oh, it's a slow news day.
[06:52.520 --> 06:58.200]  That just simply meant whatever the main corporate press was putting out was thin and was boring.
[06:58.200 --> 07:03.320]  And most talk show hosts, whether on radio or TV, which is simply regurgitate whatever
[07:03.320 --> 07:05.840]  the official talking points were.
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.880]  And that was what they meant by slow news day.
[07:07.880 --> 07:09.720]  There's really never a slow news day.
[07:09.720 --> 07:15.120]  There's so many incredibly interesting things happening, good things, bad things, beautiful
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.360]  things, ugly things, so many wonderful people full of courage and honor and strength, so
[07:21.360 --> 07:31.040]  many bad people filled with evil and an avaristic lust for power control and to cause pain.
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.760]  And then there are so many people that are simply sleepwalking through life.
[07:34.760 --> 07:43.000]  Well, infowars is not sleepwalking through life and our mission is to ignite human consciousness
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.080]  and to get humanity to think about history, to think about our place in it and our place
[07:48.080 --> 07:53.200]  in the future and to think about the real players that are involved controlling the
[07:53.200 --> 07:58.040]  shadow government system.
[07:58.040 --> 08:06.880]  There is a massive quickening, a huge awakening taking place that is driving towards a reckoning.
[08:06.880 --> 08:12.240]  So let me do my best job in this first big segment laying out some of the news we have
[08:12.240 --> 08:19.680]  before us, and then I'd like to try to, as judiciously and as focused as possible, walk
[08:19.680 --> 08:21.880]  through it.
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.840]  I got up very early this morning, did a lot of research, and then I worked out real hard
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.720]  for about an hour.
[08:27.720 --> 08:34.800]  And while the blood was pumping through the brain, I was having explosive understanding
[08:34.800 --> 08:36.920]  of the enemy's operation.
[08:36.920 --> 08:40.880]  I already understand many layers of it and structures of it more than even top generals
[08:40.880 --> 08:48.560]  in the New World Order know their own system, but I can see the fractal design of it and
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.800]  the sickening art form that it basically is.
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.640]  And I have a critical piece of the puzzle I want to talk about that's been hiding in
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.800]  plain view for a very, very long time, and we know this, but I could just see it in its
[09:04.800 --> 09:11.440]  exercise and in their craft.
[09:11.440 --> 09:20.920]  And that, of course, is how they are programming and then creating beta tests to then normalize
[09:20.920 --> 09:26.680]  systems that will remove our values and our freedoms that have been so dearly fought for
[09:26.680 --> 09:32.080]  and how that's done formulaically, and if the public is aware of the continuity of agenda
[09:32.080 --> 09:39.400]  and the formulaic nature of it, that is a great awakening point and also a resistance point
[09:39.400 --> 09:42.160]  that this is not happening by accident.
[09:42.160 --> 09:50.400]  It was Edward Mandel House that said, hell, Roosevelt said it too, that if something happens
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.680]  in politics, you can bet it was planned that way.
[09:53.680 --> 10:01.080]  And let me mention the first thing that I'm going to cover in the next hour when criminal
[10:01.080 --> 10:07.400]  lawyer, constitutional lawyer, First Amendment lawyer, Robert Barnes is in studio with us.
[10:07.400 --> 10:13.000]  And I consulted with several lawyers last night and with Barnes this morning right before
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.800]  I went on air.
[10:16.800 --> 10:24.000]  And George Soros and the little media matters outfit are really upset right now because
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.480]  they want to pull the wool over our eyes as we all know.
[10:28.480 --> 10:35.040]  We had a reporter on your stay who was in the courtroom and it was completely blown away
[10:35.040 --> 10:43.520]  when a known Obama official that headed up a department whose husband is a lawyer at the
[10:43.520 --> 10:58.560]  Justice Department on the Russiagate hoax, specifically, and Stone's lawyers raised this
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.720]  and tried to strike her the first juror they looked at, she was waiting, she'll be the
[11:03.720 --> 11:11.960]  jury foreman, watch, out of 80 people, and they tried to strike this Obama official.
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.360]  Right to you here who she originally works for though, first brought into government
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.400]  by Bill Clinton, worked directly for him in the White House, then worked for Obama heading
[11:21.400 --> 11:32.880]  up the office of budgets PR, that's incredibly critical.
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.080]  But just wait till I get to this next hour because it's not just about his case and it
[11:36.080 --> 11:42.400]  being a kangaroo court and a star chamber and literally a hanging judge and one way
[11:42.400 --> 11:45.480]  railroad to prison.
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.120]  But the fact that they would do something like this in front of everyone, and when I
[11:50.120 --> 11:53.920]  was even reading the media matters article, it's like, oh, this is preposterous.
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.680]  Stone's lawyers can just strike someone they don't like.
[11:57.680 --> 12:05.600]  It's in the Washington Post, it's in Reuters, exactly what our reporters said here on air.
[12:05.600 --> 12:14.520]  They say she headed up the PR for the office of budget management and she's married to
[12:14.520 --> 12:19.840]  a Justice Department lawyer that's running at high levels, Russiagate, we've got his
[12:19.840 --> 12:28.920]  name and she should be struck for being a potential juror and the judge said, no, she's a juror.
[12:28.920 --> 12:31.800]  She questioned the woman and said, do you have a dog in this fight?
[12:31.800 --> 12:32.800]  There's quotes there.
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.440]  No, I don't care one way or the other.
[12:36.440 --> 12:42.840]  She's first in line, ready, brought in, and the judge raises her skirt and pisses on the
[12:42.840 --> 12:44.920]  Constitution and the American people.
[12:44.920 --> 12:52.160]  If someone just has the slightest potential to even potentially have a conflict, they
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.760]  are X'd out.
[12:54.760 --> 13:01.280]  But judge does, they're recused, but this is a judge appointed by Obama with an Obama
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.360]  operative with a husband in the Justice Department and the Russiagate hoax who has everything
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.080]  to make sure they're not discredited and that somebody goes to jail for some Russia connection
[13:12.080 --> 13:13.080]  that doesn't exist.
[13:13.080 --> 13:18.320]  It is a textbook, flagrant conflict of interest.
[13:18.320 --> 13:26.560]  It'd be like having an all KKK jury in Alabama in 1950 in a jury trial against a black man
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.680]  that defended himself against two clansmen and knocked one of them out and the guy fell
[13:31.680 --> 13:33.640]  over and was put in a coma.
[13:33.640 --> 13:35.400]  There were actual cases like that.
[13:35.400 --> 13:41.640]  And the KKK jury goes, you're going to jail for 50 years, boy.
[13:41.640 --> 13:43.800]  This is exactly like that.
[13:43.800 --> 13:45.240]  This is joke level.
[13:45.240 --> 13:51.720]  And the fact that the judge brought this woman up first and had a sycophantic discussion
[13:51.720 --> 13:59.040]  with her, and then media matters goes, Jones should get arrested for jury tampering and
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.600]  harassing jurors.
[14:04.600 --> 14:08.880]  It's completely legal and lawful when someone's a public figure.
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.240]  What if Brad Pitt was on the jury?
[14:12.240 --> 14:13.600]  What if Obama was on the jury?
[14:13.600 --> 14:14.840]  What if it was Robert Mueller?
[14:14.840 --> 14:16.960]  What if it was Hillary Clinton?
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.120]  What if it was Chelsea Clinton?
[14:18.120 --> 14:19.120]  Oh, she got called.
[14:19.120 --> 14:20.120]  Oh, she's on it.
[14:20.120 --> 14:22.360]  Oh, Chelsea Clinton's going to sit on the jury for Roger Stone.
[14:22.360 --> 14:23.360]  You'd say, that's crazy.
[14:23.360 --> 14:24.360]  Get her off.
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.160]  It's the same thing.
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.360]  It's one of their minions.
[14:29.360 --> 14:30.840]  And we've got her name.
[14:30.840 --> 14:37.720]  And we're going to release it because that's what the press does.
[14:37.720 --> 14:43.720]  I know there's a war on the press and WikiLeaks founders and basically on death's doorstep
[14:43.720 --> 14:45.840]  can't even talk from solitary confinement.
[14:45.840 --> 14:51.360]  Julie Assange, but somebody's got to stand up against this and somebody's got to say
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.800]  no to this because you've got ABC covering up the Clintons.
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.560]  We've got everything on the Clintons, black books, blackmail, little kids, kidnapped,
[15:01.560 --> 15:03.120]  photos, witnesses, everything.
[15:03.120 --> 15:04.520]  We were told not to do it.
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.120]  And then the reporter cackles and giggles and she goes, oh, this would have been a big
[15:08.120 --> 15:09.120]  story for me.
[15:09.120 --> 15:11.960]  She ain't even worried about the young women.
[15:11.960 --> 15:18.120]  She just can't believe she couldn't have this big story.
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.800]  And Brian Stelter came out and defended it, the cover-up, and so did AOC, just sick people.
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.640]  So I always said Brian Stelter looks like what I would imagine a child molester would
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.640]  be.
[15:28.640 --> 15:31.720]  I mean, he just looks creepy and sickening and has demonic looks on his face all the
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.720]  time.
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.760]  But now he actually defends a giant sex trafficker involved in the kidnapping of little kids
[15:38.760 --> 15:42.960]  and all sorts of horrible stuff that was done to him.
[15:42.960 --> 15:51.520]  Oh, but wait till you hear who this woman that's going to be, you know, the Jerry Foreman.
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.880]  Wait till you hear where she came from.
[15:53.880 --> 15:55.880]  Billa Melinda Gates.
[15:55.880 --> 15:56.880]  Yeah.
[15:56.880 --> 15:57.880]  Yeah.
[15:57.880 --> 15:58.880]  Hi.
[15:58.880 --> 15:59.880]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.320]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.320 --> 16:04.840]  I sued the IRS and won.
[16:04.840 --> 16:07.800]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[16:48.520 --> 16:52.600]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:52.600 --> 16:54.100]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:54.100 --> 16:57.920]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.680]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:01.680 --> 17:06.040]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:06.040 --> 17:07.240]  So here's what you should do right now.

[18:57.920 --> 19:01.520]  That's last show, the Alex Jones show.
[19:01.520 --> 19:06.920]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[19:06.920 --> 19:11.640]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[19:11.640 --> 19:16.520]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth
[19:16.520 --> 19:17.920]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.720]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[19:21.720 --> 19:26.280]  true, but dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[19:26.280 --> 19:27.280]  you said.
[19:27.280 --> 19:32.760]  I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high quality, nutraceutical grade iodine
[19:32.760 --> 19:36.760]  is because it's why you're so vibrant, why you're so alive.
[19:36.760 --> 19:41.760]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[19:41.760 --> 19:42.760]  your age.
[19:42.760 --> 19:48.400]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that 2 billion
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.800]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.280]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[19:55.280 --> 20:02.160]  Watch it and find out for yourself and now info wars.com.
[20:02.160 --> 20:12.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.960 --> 20:19.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[20:19.600 --> 20:27.680]  the info war.
[20:27.680 --> 20:43.400]  It is Wednesday, November 6, 2019, 362 days until the most important election of our lifetimes.
[20:43.400 --> 20:50.540]  2016 was the most important up to that day, but now it's even more important as you can
[20:50.540 --> 20:55.080]  all see because what we've done is roused evil to know that we're taking humanity back,
[20:55.080 --> 20:56.520]  not just here but all over the world.
[20:56.520 --> 21:01.720]  And so the globalist are turning the dogs of war loose.
[21:01.720 --> 21:05.920]  Now I want to talk about Jeffrey Epstein.
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.880]  It's the number one meme in the world.
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.080]  Number one hashtag Epstein didn't kill himself.
[21:14.080 --> 21:19.520]  The live feed of the show, article on info wars.com and news wars.com is hashtag Epstein
[21:19.520 --> 21:28.440]  didn't kill himself, takes over the planet and that's exactly what's happening.
[21:28.440 --> 21:36.520]  Humanity knows that there are child trafficking vampires, psychic vampires that run the show
[21:36.520 --> 21:39.480]  and they're getting busted all over the country and all over the world and now we know that
[21:39.480 --> 21:42.600]  ABC News understood it was about blackmail.
[21:42.600 --> 21:46.720]  We quote had the Clintons and the blackmail and the powerful people with these kids on
[21:46.720 --> 21:47.720]  these airplanes.
[21:47.720 --> 21:48.720]  They had the witnesses.
[21:48.720 --> 21:51.160]  They had the photos.
[21:51.160 --> 21:58.240]  But ABC News and the rest of them covered it all up and became in the process accomplices
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.240]  to it.
[21:59.240 --> 22:01.120]  But let me tell you about a real accomplice.
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.520]  This is Brian Stelter.
[22:07.520 --> 22:10.320]  Now I have been in satanic rituals.
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.320]  I've left them.
[22:11.320 --> 22:14.320]  I got tricked into being at them twice.
[22:14.320 --> 22:17.520]  I was actually in a Bohemian grove one as well so I guess I said three.
[22:17.520 --> 22:21.320]  And practitioners look like that.
[22:21.320 --> 22:24.720]  And that's what child molesters look like when they come down over to kid to feed on
[22:24.720 --> 22:25.720]  them.
[22:25.720 --> 22:29.200]  Now I've told you this for years.
[22:29.200 --> 22:35.200]  If you want to know what a child molester looks like, Brian Stelter is it, okay?
[22:35.200 --> 22:39.600]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this man.
[22:39.600 --> 22:41.760]  Almost every photo looks like this.
[22:41.760 --> 22:46.320]  When he goes up on the red carpet for the fake glamour shots, he's totally unaware of
[22:46.320 --> 22:49.040]  himself as a psychotic.
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.480]  And he's got the famous Joker meets the penguin look and he's even got some dead skin hanging
[22:54.480 --> 22:56.600]  off and some spit on his lips.
[22:56.600 --> 22:57.840]  Look at those eyes.
[22:57.840 --> 23:01.720]  That's the eyes of a predator.
[23:01.720 --> 23:05.840]  Now I don't know if Brian Stelter is a pedophile.
[23:05.840 --> 23:12.360]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but I can now officially say he defends not just pedophiles
[23:12.360 --> 23:19.320]  but the known king of the pedophiles, Jeffrey Epstein.
[23:19.320 --> 23:25.080]  He's offended him on television and in the CNN newsletter, CNN Stelter defends ABC over
[23:25.080 --> 23:28.720]  Epstein scandal and defends their cover-up.
[23:28.720 --> 23:30.660]  You can go read the full thing right here.
[23:30.660 --> 23:31.660]  He wouldn't link to it.
[23:31.660 --> 23:33.320]  He wouldn't even say the name James O'Keeffe.
[23:33.320 --> 23:36.760]  Then these control freaks think they control all media, all information.
[23:36.760 --> 23:38.240]  They think they can shut everybody up.
[23:38.240 --> 23:39.240]  Good luck.
[23:39.240 --> 23:44.440]  He haunched mighty platforming.
[23:44.440 --> 23:52.160]  So when you see a man with that look, keep your family away and don't turn your back
[23:52.160 --> 23:55.000]  on them for a minute.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.280]  You take one look at Epstein's face, that self-satisfied demonic look on his and know
[24:00.280 --> 24:04.200]  that is a bad dude as well.
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.440]  So just remember, ladies and gentlemen, evil has a face and it can't hide it.
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.360]  Remember that man posing as a woman, simulating the murder of a baby?
[24:11.360 --> 24:12.640]  What face did that person make?
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.640]  Go back to the Joker.
[24:13.640 --> 24:14.640]  You just had up.
[24:14.640 --> 24:16.800]  It's that exact face.
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.300]  That's the face.
[24:18.300 --> 24:20.880]  You want to know what Satanists look like, buddy?
[24:20.880 --> 24:23.520]  You want to know what they look like when they're doing bad stuff?
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.620]  That's the face.
[24:25.620 --> 24:27.480]  You know what we look like when we're taking them down?
[24:27.480 --> 24:35.880]  We're not smiling about it, we're taking them down and they know it.
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.480]  These people are the enemy.
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.080]  We don't enjoy our work.
[24:41.080 --> 24:43.160]  They do.
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.960]  And you watching this show have been called to the truth.
[24:45.960 --> 24:48.640]  You were born to fight these people.
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.280]  That's a demon, an avatar in that body.
[24:52.280 --> 24:55.600]  There is not a human in there, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.600]  Don't sell Diablo in your face, period.
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.920]  Devil's real.
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.000]  And now he is defending ABC and Epstein.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.200]  Of course he is.
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.120]  He defends his father.
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.560]  Even the ABC investigative journalist, head investigative journalist of Good Morning America,
[25:17.560 --> 25:24.280]  one of the biggest shows on mainstream TV left, was just mad that she didn't get the
[25:24.280 --> 25:25.280]  big story.
[25:25.280 --> 25:26.280]  We had them.
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.280]  The Clintons, everything.
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.360]  The blackmail, the powerful men, the photos, the videos, we had it all, but they covered
[25:33.360 --> 25:34.360]  it up.
[25:34.360 --> 25:35.360]  Guess who else covered it up?
[25:35.360 --> 25:36.360]  AOC.
[25:36.360 --> 25:38.640]  The Internet freaked out and said, oh my God, she's got a soul.
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.320]  No, she's got staffers who believe mainstream media that Trump's involved with Epstein,
[25:44.320 --> 25:47.360]  so she ran with it for a few hours.
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.360]  And then they realized, oh my God, this is who the Clintons used to handle people that
[25:50.360 --> 25:55.720]  were blackmailing and Bill Gates, of course, is involved.
[25:55.720 --> 25:58.480]  So they erased it.
[25:58.480 --> 25:59.480]  Everybody was playing the clips.
[25:59.480 --> 26:03.640]  Hell, we'll come back with it after a break of dogs and cats living together from ghostbusters
[26:03.640 --> 26:04.840]  and man, she's got a soul.
[26:04.840 --> 26:11.880]  No, she removed it and is now defending ABC and Epstein and all the rest of it.
[26:11.880 --> 26:12.880]  She doesn't run her Twitter.
[26:12.880 --> 26:13.880]  She's a method.
[26:13.880 --> 26:17.000]  She's a nobody.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.560]  And now the story is up on infowords.com, AOC helped spread Project Veritas Scoop on
[26:21.560 --> 26:25.000]  ABC, spiking Epstein's story.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.480]  Then she removed it quickly.
[26:31.480 --> 26:35.400]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.400]  So they know how their bread is buttered, but listen, they failed.
[26:39.400 --> 26:41.720]  Brian Skelter has maybe 100,000 viewers on the weekend.
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.880]  He's a joke.
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.200]  But he's a fellow spirit with the head of CNN, so they hang out together in their best
[26:52.200 --> 26:53.200]  bodies.
[26:53.200 --> 27:01.760]  So he's like a legged, like speaks for the emperor who had no kingdom.
[27:01.760 --> 27:02.760]  Mr. Zucker.
[27:02.760 --> 27:07.680]  So just remember that and remember who they are and remember when they had all those fake
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.920]  women that turned out are fake and made up and the only one that hasn't recanted is Balazi
[27:11.920 --> 27:15.560]  Ford is admittedly CIA.
[27:15.560 --> 27:23.360]  Remember that the hashtag and the memes of Epstein didn't kill himself are number one.
[27:23.360 --> 27:24.880]  Billions are seeing it.
[27:24.880 --> 27:26.080]  This person has no audience.
[27:26.080 --> 27:27.360]  He has no power.
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.960]  He's clinging on by his fingernails and they know their whole house of cards is coming
[27:30.960 --> 27:31.960]  down.
[27:31.960 --> 27:39.280]  Let's go out to break with the newspaper reporter, Hemingway of the Federalist Senior Editor
[27:39.280 --> 27:47.480]  talking about the fact that they pushed the fake Kavanaugh but covered this all up, making
[27:47.480 --> 27:50.800]  them complicit in the trafficking of little girls.
[27:50.800 --> 27:52.000]  Here it is.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.280]  We did not see reticence from our media about running stories about Donald Trump that were
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.400]  based on, that made him look bad and you saw this profound reticence for any story that
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.320]  might negatively affect Hillary Clinton.
[28:03.320 --> 28:08.040]  She specifically mentions Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, other high profile people.
[28:08.040 --> 28:13.560]  It pays to have friends in high places, I suppose, but this is such a great example of
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.280]  why people have come to just profoundly distrust their media.
[28:17.280 --> 28:18.640]  They know the game is rigged.
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.840]  They know that things are not, that the media get to decide what gets to high play and what
[28:23.840 --> 28:27.960]  doesn't and that who gets destroyed and who doesn't and seeing that power that the media
[28:27.960 --> 28:34.560]  have and seeing how corruptly they wield that power is really eye opening for a lot of Americans.
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.320]  And that's right and now the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation running Epstein is running
[28:39.320 --> 28:46.360]  national TV shows like The Good Doctor Against Me and they're behind and run the woman who
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.600]  worked for Obama at the highest levels who will be the foreman of the jury.
[28:49.600 --> 28:58.440]  You watch because they want to throw it in your face and want to rub it in.
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.440]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.200]  may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there.
[29:07.200 --> 29:12.120]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:12.120 --> 29:15.640]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.640 --> 29:20.160]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:20.160 --> 29:21.160]  across America.
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.160]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.160 --> 29:28.720]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:28.720 --> 29:29.720]  healthier I feel.
[29:29.720 --> 29:32.400]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[30:59.440 --> 31:01.520]  The Alex Jones Show.
[31:01.520 --> 31:06.920]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[31:06.920 --> 31:11.640]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[31:11.640 --> 31:16.680]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[31:16.680 --> 31:17.920]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[31:17.920 --> 31:21.560]  That's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[31:21.560 --> 31:26.280]  true but dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[31:26.280 --> 31:27.280]  you said.
[31:27.280 --> 31:31.920]  And I said, I know honey, that's why I have you take the high quality nutraceutical grade
[31:31.920 --> 31:37.440]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive, it's one of the
[31:37.440 --> 31:42.800]  reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and
[31:42.800 --> 31:49.080]  it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and to know that 2 billion people,
[31:49.080 --> 31:53.120]  ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now
[31:53.120 --> 31:55.240]  because of iodine deficiency.
[31:55.240 --> 31:57.160]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[31:57.160 --> 31:58.160]  Infowars.com.
[31:58.160 --> 32:04.440]  Hosts asked me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[32:04.440 --> 32:10.720]  Well that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.400]  will like different formulas.
[32:12.400 --> 32:14.960]  It's just that simple.
[32:14.960 --> 32:19.600]  This three is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[32:19.600 --> 32:24.680]  all three types to absorb, others like the pure atomic iodine.
[32:24.680 --> 32:29.080]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[32:29.080 --> 32:31.360]  to family or friends.
[32:31.360 --> 32:34.720]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[32:34.720 --> 32:39.040]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[32:39.040 --> 32:42.160]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.160]  It's simple.
[32:43.160 --> 32:47.880]  Try quality iodine at InfowarsStore.com and help fund the Infowars.
[32:47.880 --> 32:48.880]  InfowarsStore.com.
[32:48.880 --> 32:52.320]  We've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end.
[32:52.320 --> 32:54.240]  It's the iodine challenge.
[32:54.240 --> 33:02.160]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[33:02.160 --> 33:14.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.000 --> 33:17.920]  You could accept the fact that the city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[33:17.920 --> 33:18.920]  What do you mean?
[33:18.920 --> 33:19.920]  Biblical.
[33:19.920 --> 33:22.080]  What do you mean this Old Testament, Mr. Mayor?
[33:22.080 --> 33:23.080]  Yes.
[33:23.080 --> 33:27.280]  Real wrath of God type stuff, fire and brimstone coming down from the skies, rivers and seas
[33:27.280 --> 33:28.280]  boiling.
[33:28.280 --> 33:31.760]  Forty years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave.
[33:31.760 --> 33:37.240]  Man sacrificed, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
[33:37.240 --> 33:44.520]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:44.520 --> 33:46.880]  the mind of man.
[33:46.880 --> 33:55.240]  Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:55.240 --> 34:01.640]  We're not just the tip of the spear, we're the sword of truth and you helped forge this
[34:01.640 --> 34:11.800]  operation, listeners and viewers, you are the blade, the hilt, the arm that wields it,
[34:11.800 --> 34:20.240]  the eyes that see the enemy, the guts that force the will, you are the resistance.
[34:20.240 --> 34:24.800]  So you pull back and you go, well, let me see, major Protestant churches, the Catholic
[34:24.800 --> 34:34.520]  church, almost every major university, almost every major local church, sheriff's deputies,
[34:34.520 --> 34:39.520]  truancy officers, homeland security officials have all been caught by the thousands and
[34:39.520 --> 34:47.320]  thousands a year, not just having child porn, but producing it in some cases with one year
[34:47.320 --> 34:54.200]  old babies that they rape till they bleed and their guts fall out.
[34:54.200 --> 34:58.360]  And I'm not trying to be gross here, Hillary Clinton's first job out of college with a
[34:58.360 --> 35:04.720]  law degree, she went to Arkansas to represent good old boys who like to drive around and
[35:04.720 --> 35:10.040]  grab girls off the street, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 year olds and take them out in the
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.480]  woods and rape them half to death, some cases they killed them.
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.360]  And that's how you go down and get your trust when her mob boss daddy sent her down from
[35:18.360 --> 35:19.360]  Chicago.
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.480]  You go down there to where we actually do a lot of the killing and run the operations,
[35:23.480 --> 35:29.920]  if you look at the Chicago mob that were based in Arkansas, not just the Italian mafia,
[35:29.920 --> 35:35.200]  but the Irish mafia, all of them, that's fact.
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.960]  And she went down there to get dirty right up front.
[35:39.960 --> 35:40.960]  That's how this stuff works.
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.000]  You don't think it's just George Lucas that wrote episode three where Palpatine tells
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.480]  Darth Vader, your eyes hadn't turned yellow yet.
[35:49.480 --> 35:55.720]  Yes, you're not fully demon possessed yet, you don't have a big old shark look on your
[35:55.720 --> 35:57.960]  face like Hillary or Brian Stelter.
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.480]  You need to go to the Jedi temple and kill all the younglings.
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.760]  Again, the allegories are in your face.
[36:05.760 --> 36:08.560]  They're telling you how they operate and what they do.
[36:08.560 --> 36:13.800]  And then you wonder, well, everybody said the Catholic Churches run by pedophiles 50
[36:13.800 --> 36:15.960]  years ago and it turned out they took it over.
[36:15.960 --> 36:20.040]  And now it's every institution because remember a few years ago they handed out condoms to
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.880]  people as young as five at the Boy Scout Jamboree.
[36:23.880 --> 36:27.600]  Even the Cub Scouts visited were giving condoms and it turned out it was a mass homosexual
[36:27.600 --> 36:29.320]  orgy.
[36:29.320 --> 36:31.040]  And now the Boy Scouts is being destroyed.
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.520]  But then it becomes too big to fail and it's just, well, it's all run by pedophiles.
[36:36.520 --> 36:39.240]  But that's only the beginning.
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.440]  It's devil worship.
[36:42.440 --> 36:43.840]  And that's also come out.
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.320]  But see, on screen, YouTube took our reports down about that.
[36:48.320 --> 36:51.920]  They don't want you to know.
[36:51.920 --> 36:55.960]  So that's how they take down every good institution is by infiltrating it.
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.880]  And then once it comes out that one child's been abused, the group covers it up because
[37:00.880 --> 37:03.920]  it's for the better of the group, they think, then it's 10 children, then they cover it
[37:03.920 --> 37:04.920]  up.
[37:04.920 --> 37:09.120]  Then they're able to blackmail the leadership for covering it up and then they take it over.
[37:09.120 --> 37:13.480]  And now it's an institution of the Church of Lucifer.
[37:13.480 --> 37:16.240]  The Church of the Devil.
[37:16.240 --> 37:22.840]  That's how the corruptions work, is you get them into the corruption.
[37:22.840 --> 37:28.840]  When they planted the child porn on us this year, we get the calls, oh, off record, oh,
[37:28.840 --> 37:30.520]  you want to fix things now?
[37:30.520 --> 37:31.760]  You want to, oh, this could really hurt you.
[37:31.760 --> 37:33.560]  I'm like, I'm going on air with this right now.
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.160]  I'm not going to corrupt me.
[37:35.160 --> 37:38.960]  I'm not involved in what you're involved in.
[37:38.960 --> 37:42.480]  You're the ones that have got to stand before God, not me.
[37:42.480 --> 37:54.360]  I don't have any spirit in me that wants to hurt children, much less suck their energy.
[37:54.360 --> 37:55.360]  Imagine that.
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.520]  Imagine being turned over to that.
[37:57.520 --> 38:01.720]  Imagine being that.
[38:01.720 --> 38:05.080]  Imagine giving your eyes up for a billion dollars.
[38:05.080 --> 38:06.080]  People say hell no.
[38:06.080 --> 38:13.440]  Well, what would you give your soul up for?
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.320]  But they resonate with this and their main trick is convincing you they don't exist.
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.000]  So I'm going to play the James O'Keeffe interview we did yesterday when we come back.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.040]  It was so powerfully laid out the part two that's coming and then it ties into the president
[38:26.040 --> 38:28.640]  of ABC being confronted about the cover up.
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.680]  But this, you remember me before Epstein got killed and then after you got killed, I said
[38:33.680 --> 38:38.920]  I've never seen anything wake people up like Epstein and I've never seen something bring
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.280]  us more viewers and more listeners because everybody knows I was talking about him by
[38:43.280 --> 38:52.800]  name 13 years ago, getting into the reports he was in 15 years ago.
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.840]  And now it's just meme everywhere and people are jumping on Walmart paging systems and
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.560]  saying and people are putting it into messaging at the airport.
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.400]  Airport is paging Epstein cover up please meet your party at terminal two east by American
[39:08.400 --> 39:09.400]  Airlines.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.400]  It's real.
[39:10.400 --> 39:11.400]  It really happened.
[39:11.400 --> 39:12.400]  We'll play that video and audio.
[39:12.400 --> 39:13.400]  We come back as well.
[39:13.400 --> 39:15.920]  That big list of it up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[39:15.920 --> 39:18.160]  Go share those articles full of those memes.
[39:18.160 --> 39:19.160]  Make your own.
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.040]  AI can't recognize them.
[39:21.040 --> 39:26.160]  All these big online recipe books, everybody's going and uploading recipes with, by the way,
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.400]  hashtag Epstein didn't kill himself at the end.
[39:29.400 --> 39:35.640]  And we're just seeing traffic surge to info wars despite all the attempts to block us
[39:35.640 --> 39:36.640]  and destroy us.
[39:36.640 --> 39:42.080]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.240]  So think about that.
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.160]  But when you sit back and you go, man, it's like every group has these giant pedophile
[39:50.160 --> 39:58.120]  scandals 10 years, 20 years, and then all of a sudden there's a new director of the group.
[39:58.120 --> 40:02.800]  And then that director gets caught being a pedo.
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.440]  And then the group fully falls to the pedos like the Vatican and then the black pope comes
[40:07.440 --> 40:11.440]  in totally takes over says Christ isn't real.
[40:11.440 --> 40:12.440]  The family's bad.
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.440]  Well, abortion's good.
[40:13.440 --> 40:16.800]  World government's good.
[40:16.800 --> 40:17.800]  Communism's good.
[40:17.800 --> 40:22.760]  Christian roots of Europe make him physically sick, he said.
[40:22.760 --> 40:25.920]  He said nationalism is like eating feces.
[40:25.920 --> 40:27.720]  These are quotes.
[40:27.720 --> 40:33.400]  Well, that's openly the devil in the Vatican.
[40:33.400 --> 40:38.560]  Surprise smoke doesn't follow him around, but they're going to take over every institution.
[40:38.560 --> 40:40.160]  It's how they do it.
[40:40.160 --> 40:49.960]  It's a formulae and their sacrament is abusing children.
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.240]  And their favorite thing is to give them hepatitis or HIV.
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.960]  And then they have doctors, Epstein, all these groups have doctors that then drug the kids
[40:59.960 --> 41:00.960]  up.
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.480]  They send them to special psychiatrists and psychologists that cover it up, say that the
[41:04.480 --> 41:05.480]  child's delusional.
[41:05.480 --> 41:13.640]  And it's all just a big machine, ladies and gentlemen, that knows exactly what it's doing.
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.480]  It doesn't control every municipality, doesn't control every judge, doesn't control most
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.640]  police officers, but it seeks control of power positions.
[41:21.640 --> 41:23.560]  Most truancy officers are not pedophiles.
[41:23.560 --> 41:29.000]  You're just statistically going to find the highest level of them there, or in daycare,
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.640]  or in childcare, or in law enforcement, or in juvenile detention centers, because that's
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.640]  where they can get away with it.
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.080]  Because they have authority and the institutions will want to cover it up.
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.640]  Because even though they're not involved in it, they want to protect the structure itself,
[41:47.640 --> 41:51.800]  which then allows the cancer to replicate and fully take the structure over.
[41:51.800 --> 42:00.040]  And now it's launching full assaults directly on letting men dressed as women in clown outfits,
[42:00.040 --> 42:04.600]  in satanic outfits, have access to your children and now even show their genitals to them.
[42:04.600 --> 42:12.360]  In unannounced events, as they fully mark their territory for assimilation and destruction.
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.280]  They're grooming them, and they go to city councils, and they go on TV, and they say,
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.080]  we must have access to your children, the beautiful thing we're going to do with them.
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.080]  This is lovely.
[42:21.080 --> 42:22.080]  This is wonderful.
[42:22.080 --> 42:23.080]  We are here to groom them.
[42:23.080 --> 42:24.080]  They are ours.
[42:24.080 --> 42:32.920]  And sometimes they even go, they're drinking blood and just savagely will murder them.
[42:32.920 --> 42:38.600]  And you see them going, I want to kill them because they're uncloking.
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.760]  They're uncloking.
[42:39.760 --> 42:41.760]  You think they just want to screw your kids?
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.000]  They want to murder them.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.720]  But first, they want them begging alone in the dark, not believing God's real.
[42:49.720 --> 42:51.640]  That's their whale song.
[42:51.640 --> 42:53.640]  And I have a song for them.
[42:53.640 --> 42:57.920]  The fire of God's judgment is coming.
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.280]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[43:02.280 --> 43:04.120]  I don't care what your views are.
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.360]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[43:07.360 --> 43:08.360]  That's important.
[43:08.360 --> 43:09.680]  But we have something in common.
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.800]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.960]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey, thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that
[43:18.960 --> 43:20.960]  he lied to Congress in the world.
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.240]  He thinks committing crimes are funny, and he thinks, if he acts confident, he won't
[43:25.240 --> 43:26.240]  get indicted.
[43:26.240 --> 43:31.200]  But where it is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[43:31.200 --> 43:32.840]  Well, my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[43:32.840 --> 43:39.520]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[43:39.520 --> 43:41.400]  Not so fast, criminal.
[43:41.400 --> 43:45.360]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[43:45.360 --> 43:50.080]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.960]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at infowars.com,
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.520]  newswars.com, and band.video.
[43:58.520 --> 44:00.680]  All of our bodies are different.
[44:00.680 --> 44:03.560]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[44:03.560 --> 44:06.520]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.000]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something that you
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.320]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[44:13.320 --> 44:20.960]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[44:20.960 --> 44:22.280]  completely changes.
[44:22.280 --> 44:23.280]  I'm healthier.
[44:23.280 --> 44:24.280]  I have more energy.
[44:24.280 --> 44:25.280]  I lose weight.
[44:25.280 --> 44:26.280]  I look better.
[44:26.280 --> 44:27.280]  Everybody notices.
[44:27.280 --> 44:34.760]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.960]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from infowars life.
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.840]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[44:44.840 --> 44:50.800]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[44:50.800 --> 44:51.800]  Check it out.
[44:51.800 --> 44:52.800]  There's nothing else like it.
[44:52.800 --> 44:59.800]  That's what I'm talking about.
[44:59.800 --> 45:06.960]  Serving with infowars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee, and luckily,
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.760]  our break room at the infowars headquarters is stocked full of high quality infowars store
[45:12.760 --> 45:15.360]  Patriot Blend coffee.

[45:22.080 --> 45:26.680]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[45:26.680 --> 45:31.960]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.280]  There has never been a more important time to support infowars.
[45:35.280 --> 45:42.960]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[45:59.240 --> 46:03.400]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.920]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[46:06.920 --> 46:12.280]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[46:12.280 --> 46:16.480]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.200]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.920]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[46:24.920 --> 46:26.600]  have you arrested in some areas.
[46:26.600 --> 46:32.600]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[46:32.600 --> 46:33.760]  they're doing.
[46:33.760 --> 46:36.920]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[46:36.920 --> 46:41.140]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[46:41.140 --> 46:46.320]  We have a, it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.960]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the
[46:50.960 --> 46:51.960]  back.
[46:51.960 --> 46:56.480]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting infowars while
[46:56.480 --> 47:02.160]  having a great hat.
[47:02.160 --> 47:16.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.800 --> 47:22.840]  The evil, the wickedness is going to get so out in the open, so rampant.
[47:22.840 --> 47:27.880]  Any people that didn't believe in God are going to start waking up.
[47:27.880 --> 47:32.980]  The pattern follows the same signature every time.
[47:32.980 --> 47:36.780]  And right around the time, the casual society world government is fully implemented, we're
[47:36.780 --> 47:38.480]  getting close.
[47:38.480 --> 47:51.480]  The whole world will marvel at the AI beast who can be everywhere at once and who can animate
[47:51.480 --> 48:00.640]  mechanical, avatars, drones, ground, robots, smart dust, the enemy will be everywhere,
[48:00.640 --> 48:06.720]  watching and tracking and controlling but never able to produce beauty, never able to
[48:06.720 --> 48:16.960]  compose a future for human development only giving out the gifts of servitude and death.
[48:16.960 --> 48:25.480]  All right, I spent most of the hour getting into the firestorm that is Epstein, the procurer,
[48:25.480 --> 48:29.880]  the blackmailer, the controller, they had everything.
[48:29.880 --> 48:34.160]  We had the Clintons, we had all the witnesses, we had the photos, we had the video, we had
[48:34.160 --> 48:36.400]  it all but they killed the story.
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.440]  I would have been a big star, not even worried about the women just, oh, oh, it was so big
[48:42.440 --> 48:47.960]  I would have brought down powerful people.
[48:47.960 --> 48:53.440]  You know why ABC News did that because they're scared because they were put in power because
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.120]  they cover all this up.
[48:56.120 --> 49:02.280]  But now as the evil becomes apparent and people stop living in denial, the smart producers
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.480]  and people that work in these places that aren't pure evil, that had lived in denial,
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.640]  they're going to start whistleblowing everywhere continually and that's going to drive the
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.000]  establishment towards more censorship, more control, they'll start political assassinations
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.680]  even though in the modern surveillance system that's used as blackmail against them.
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.880]  They are organizing a formulaic system and trying to seduce humanity into accepting
[49:33.880 --> 49:38.360]  and I'll talk about that with Barnes in next hour and huge developments in the stone trial
[49:38.360 --> 49:43.920]  that again are a window into the universe and how this all really works.
[49:43.920 --> 49:48.760]  But if you look at AOC helping cover it all up, at first one of her staffers tweets it
[49:48.760 --> 49:52.360]  out because she believed like the media had said that the abscreen was Trump sputting
[49:52.360 --> 49:55.440]  but that's only the surface cover story.
[49:55.440 --> 50:03.520]  Once they realized the cover story wasn't working, they jerked it down immediately.
[50:03.520 --> 50:06.320]  It shows how incredibly soulless these people are.
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.360]  Now I'm going to air five minutes of the James O'Keefe interview from yesterday because
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.480]  it's a prelude of what's about to drop in the next few days and it's really newsworthy.
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.040]  The video of this interview is at banned.video and if people want the rest of the story on
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.320]  Epstein, tell them hey you want the rest of the story on Epstein, here's the guy that
[50:22.320 --> 50:27.000]  first talked about Epstein more than a decade ago, Alex Jones, they'll go oh yeah.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.840]  And now all their demonization of me blows back and backfires like Judo, we use their
[50:33.840 --> 50:36.520]  energy against them.
[50:36.520 --> 50:42.320]  And now is the time to strike while the iron's hot in the information war because he was
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.960]  just a manager, a Mater D bringing these demons, the children.
[50:47.960 --> 50:56.680]  Now please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission and remember
[50:56.680 --> 51:00.720]  your financial support is what makes this possible plus we make it easy.
[51:00.720 --> 51:07.960]  We have really great products at infowarstore.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every
[51:07.960 --> 51:16.520]  year around this time we are able to offer at their cost and then we're given a rebate
[51:16.520 --> 51:21.360]  for the new year when we purchase these, that's without to pay taxes on them.
[51:21.360 --> 51:27.720]  This is 147 is the cost with free shipping, they've never done a deal that good, it's
[51:27.720 --> 51:33.320]  a hot item, they sell tens of thousands of these a year, it's a four-stage iron cluster,
[51:33.320 --> 51:39.000]  other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700, all the markup, no ladies and gentlemen
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.200]  we usually sell these all day long for $250 and they're a great deal.
[51:43.200 --> 51:49.520]  147, I almost, I've told the guy like this cuts into the market so it's slow, people
[51:49.520 --> 51:50.520]  don't appreciate it.
[51:50.520 --> 51:54.600]  Well this is what the info war's audience gets.
[51:54.600 --> 51:59.760]  Warstore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price and then more don't
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.040]  come in until next year.
[52:02.040 --> 52:07.360]  Separately, the everything must go, super sale, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points,
[52:07.360 --> 52:12.160]  40-70% off on all the products has to end by tomorrow.
[52:12.160 --> 52:15.160]  I've quite frankly been so busy with all the breaking news, I haven't come up with
[52:15.160 --> 52:20.960]  new specials yet because so many items are already selling out or have sold out like
[52:20.960 --> 52:25.240]  shipping defense that goes after the parasites, that's sold out, won't be back in until next
[52:25.240 --> 52:27.240]  year unfortunately.
[52:27.240 --> 52:31.840]  Ultra 12 selling out, still 50% off, super blue selling out, the bubblegum isn't, we
[52:31.840 --> 52:35.640]  have plenty of that but that's for children, it's amazing.
[52:35.640 --> 52:40.960]  We have the bio tricillinium with the iodine combo 60% off, that's going to have to end.
[52:40.960 --> 52:44.360]  Ultimate bone broth is selling out, I'll have to put an order in soon, it'll be six months
[52:44.360 --> 52:45.360]  till we get more.
[52:45.360 --> 52:48.840]  Take some three months to get all the ingredients together and then make it and then three, so
[52:48.840 --> 52:52.040]  about six months till we get it, ultimate bone broth selling out, badzo meat selling
[52:52.040 --> 52:57.160]  out, chill force is selling out very quickly, 50% off, it's excellent, vitamin mineral fusion
[52:57.160 --> 52:58.880]  just got back in.
[52:58.880 --> 53:04.320]  We also have just got back into stock, the product that people love so much, it's DNA
[53:04.320 --> 53:08.040]  Force Plus and I'm not going to spend time getting into why it's so amazing and why it's
[53:08.040 --> 53:13.200]  so incredible but you already know about that, you should research PQQ and CoQ10 and the
[53:13.200 --> 53:18.820]  other ingredients and then realize that no other brand has this quality or this much
[53:18.820 --> 53:23.120]  or this synergy of these products together, what it does to the telomeres, making them
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.920]  last longer is the equivalent of making them grow, they don't grow, they just don't shrink
[53:27.920 --> 53:30.120]  as fast which is the same thing.
[53:30.120 --> 53:39.960]  So again ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139 and we have the Trump is innocent
[53:39.960 --> 53:45.360]  shirts, people better start taking serious, the fact that they have a chance, a good chance
[53:45.360 --> 53:54.240]  of removing him because people are so confident, I hear it constantly that Trump is ordained
[53:54.240 --> 54:00.080]  of God and he's invincible and America's back, Trump and what happened was God moving
[54:00.080 --> 54:06.800]  the people to take action and like a chemistry reaction, Trump was one of the key ingredients
[54:06.800 --> 54:11.320]  but they just lost the Kentucky governorship, they just lost the state house in Virginia
[54:11.320 --> 54:17.120]  for the first time in 30 years, this is very dangerous and they're engaged in massive
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.480]  election fraud, they're engaged in massive criminal activity, they are throwing away
[54:21.480 --> 54:28.680]  even the pretense of not being corrupt now and it's extremely dangerous and we'll talk
[54:28.680 --> 54:32.880]  about that next hour, this is so critical when I say that, I mean this is an epiphany,
[54:32.880 --> 54:37.520]  a lot of it's in plain view but the understanding of what I'm going to lay out is paramount
[54:37.520 --> 54:46.000]  in my view, so that's coming up and I will air the Project Veritas interview that's
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.360]  at man dot video but the first thing I need to air here in just a moment is I'm confronting
[54:49.360 --> 54:56.040]  the ABC News president about this, this is just, I'm rejoicing at one level, Ebel's
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.640]  in trouble, it's being exposed everywhere so now instead of hiding it, it's like okay
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.640]  I'm the judge, appointed by Obama, I'm bringing in his former head of office of budget management,
[55:05.640 --> 55:10.520]  PR, her husband works in the deep state, the Justice Department on Russiagate, by the way
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.680]  we both met at Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and we worked for Bill and Melinda Gates as
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.000]  in-beds in the government, that's the lady and the judge just says, you know you're supposed
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.200]  to be able to strike jurors, no, she said no you can't strike anybody and here's my first
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.560]  person, she told him you can't strike anybody, our first person is this lady and everybody
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.280]  finds out who she is and they go my god this is crazy, she works right under Obama, she
[55:33.280 --> 55:39.440]  hates Trump, her husband's prosecuting Trump, her husband's involved in the prosecution
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.120]  of stone, I'm going to show you who these people are next hour with Barnes, nobody else
[55:43.120 --> 55:52.040]  will, they're all scared and the judge said, I have the transcripts here, I'm going to
[55:52.040 --> 55:57.960]  read this to you, the judge says either way with these 80 jurors you can't strike any
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.680]  of them for political affiliation or working for any party anyway, first person they call
[56:02.680 --> 56:07.520]  her up, they search who she is, they go my god she used to run a major department, her
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.440]  husband works at the justice department and is on the Mueller investigation, the judge
[56:11.440 --> 56:18.360]  says you can't strike her and you know she's going to make her foreman, you go that's unbelievable,
[56:18.360 --> 56:25.280]  yes they're now in the rubbing it in phase and they want other judges across the country
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.160]  to see this and say see this is how you get promoted, we're going for broke and they use
[56:31.160 --> 56:36.200]  Roger as like the dog attack training toy, first they have a doll, the dog attacks when
[56:36.200 --> 56:39.760]  it's a puppy that gets food, then they give it a man dressed in a suit, then they have
[56:39.760 --> 56:44.360]  the dog usually attack actual animals to get them used to taste the blood and then they,
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.680]  you know, they're an attack dog, well they've been training people for censorship attacking
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.880]  me, now you learn it was all for you, it's for everybody, okay, but first they make
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.640]  somebody hate it then they destroy them they think and then people accept that then next
[56:55.640 --> 57:01.000]  it's you in the barrel and it's the same thing with Stone, they are going to tear him limb
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.320]  from limb, the whole jury it's flooding in, I can't even, people are scared to even tell
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.760]  me but we've got the intel, they say this judge is crazy and she's literally just laughing
[57:10.760 --> 57:15.240]  and cackling and it's just, you know, it's all Democrats, it's all famous Democrats,
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.600]  it's going to be absolutely a gallery, they might have Hillary Clinton on the jury, I'm
[57:20.600 --> 57:26.560]  not kidding, okay, because, again, they failed to hide it and intimidate you, so now they
[57:26.560 --> 57:30.640]  think, oh we haven't scared them, let's just let everybody know, you cross us ever we'll
[57:30.640 --> 57:37.840]  destroy you, they think America's scared, well you know what, leadership is about doing
[57:37.840 --> 57:43.840]  the right thing when everybody else is scared, so get ready for leadership, hour number two,
[57:43.840 --> 57:50.840]  get ready for total commitment.
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.560]  Have you arrested in some areas, if you do the okay symbol, that's the international
[58:18.560 --> 58:24.440]  sign language symbol for okay, they know what they're doing, these people are authoritarians
[58:24.440 --> 58:29.280]  and they're dangerous and the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their
[58:29.280 --> 58:34.920]  face, we have a, it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white,
[58:34.920 --> 58:39.680]  very nice as the okay symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com

[59:18.720 --> 59:25.040]  to family or friends, bottom line iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it, the globalist

[59:46.320 --> 59:51.640]  percent off together.
[59:51.640 --> 1:00:07.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:12.920]  Well, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas joins us, ABC News and Amy Robot respond to Project
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:17.400]  Veritas bombshell, there it is, a conscientious individual recording that within the system
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:22.400]  when she thinks she's not recording and putting that out, amazing and I'm told more is coming,
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:23.720]  James, thanks for joining us.
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.840]  Alex, great to be on with you.
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:31.400]  Well, lay it out for us and some people are saying, oh, it isn't real, others are saying,
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:33.360]  it's not that big a deal, that's huge.
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:39.840]  Yeah, that's a really big deal, I mean, it's an insider within ABC News has not gone to
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:43.880]  the New York Times or the Washington Post once again has come to Project Veritas.
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:48.960]  I mean, this is a big deal, Alex, she talks about how she thinks Jeffrey Epstein was killed
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:53.440]  at higher ups in the network, these network executives telling her, Alex, to squash the
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:59.800]  story, to spike the story and now, Alex, the lawyers for ABC News have apparently worded
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:03.080]  this very corporate statement trying to cover it up.
[1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:08.040]  I'm a little frustrated that AB didn't double down, AB is kind of backtracking a little
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:09.040]  bit in that statement.
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:14.680]  She's put out an official statement, but we have the insider, Alex, still on the inside
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:19.160]  of ABC News, getting recordings of what everyone is doing.
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:26.400]  The president of ABC News spoke to me and Project Veritas and someone came to our headquarters
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:27.920]  and gave us this statement.
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:32.080]  So we've really shaken the tree, Alex, and they associate a press commenting, this is
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:36.920]  all blowing up, and it's just part one of this Jeffrey Epstein coverup story inside ABC
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:37.920]  News.
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:39.920]  Well, that was my next question.
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:45.080]  You say more is coming, following those breadcrumbs, please give the audience a little bit of view
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:49.080]  on what we can expect and when we can expect it.
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:54.880]  Well, we typically, we do these stories piecemeal, we release one at a time because the media
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  is complicit.
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:58.200]  I mean, let's just be honest about this.
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:01.240]  Everyone sort of saying, oh, I wish it wasn't James O'Keefe that broke this story.
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.120]  Project Veritas should be breaking the story.
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.200]  Well, it's self-evident in the tape with Amy Robach.
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:10.600]  People don't trust the media and this is why they don't trust the media because they sit
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:14.680]  on news, they have the news, they don't break the news, ABC still has.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.200]  There still is tape of this interview with the accusers, they have not aired.
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:23.960]  So what we tend to do, and you know this about us by now, we break part one, we watch the
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:24.960]  reaction.
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:27.960]  It becomes, the reaction becomes part of the story and then we break part two and I'm not
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:29.280]  going to give any more secrets away.
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:33.400]  I'm going to show you, I'm going to tell you that we have the conversation with the
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:37.600]  president of ABC News that we're about to break and we'll just see how people react
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:38.600]  to this.
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:44.920]  But it appears, Alex, this is the biggest story in our organization's history and the
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:47.840]  tape speaks for itself, Amy Robach speaks for herself.
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.080]  By the way, I totally agree with you, this story is even bigger than the last, it was
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:56.000]  bigger than the last, it just is building exponential as the dam breaks and more whistleblowers
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.320]  come out because they can't stand the evil anymore, they can't stand the manipulation,
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:05.960]  they can't sleep at night over what's happening and that statement about, we had Clinton,
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:10.560]  we had it all, we know he was organizing this, we know the Clintons were involved, this is
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:15.400]  really scaring the deep state and has sent a tremor through the force.
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:19.760]  And not just on the right, Alex, I mean, Alexandria Cortez tweeted this story, The
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:25.440]  Daily Beast, everyone is outraged by this, everyone is indignant and the insider told
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:32.840]  me that he was so angry that he or she, because it very well could be a she, was so angry
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.600]  about what they saw in that Good Morning America set.
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:41.600]  That's what compelled them to reach out and I've already had a few insiders come to us
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:44.000]  in the last few hours from within other networks.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.520]  So it's all happening, it's all happening, these are the brave new people and if you're
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:51.520]  watching this program because there's a lot of people watching this and you're on the
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:56.960]  inside, projectveritas.com slash brave, send us an encrypted note, that's what this is
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:03:57.960]  all about.
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:03.960]  There's a movement of heroes who are angry at the system and want to blow the whistle
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:08.520]  with videotapes, I will have their backs and you're going to see this unfold over the next
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:09.520]  few days.
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:13.640]  James, there's only one story bigger than this and that's that the whistleblowers are
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:17.040]  exponential, it's getting bigger, it's getting more powerful.
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.800]  That's really the story, is that mainstream media is finally finding its soul and this
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:27.040]  is an existential crisis, I believe will bring down this whole web of deep state that's using
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:33.800]  sex crimes as the poisonous glue, the satanic glue that holds their empire, a blackmail
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:34.800]  together.
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.520]  Well, I mean, Amy, it's Amy Roback's own words, she says that this guy specialized in
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:40.680]  blackmail.
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:42.400]  She says there's a lot, listen to the changes.
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:47.680]  This is history happening, we've got Robert Barnes here, we're going to reveal the first
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:57.920]  juror chosen by the judge, not by the defense or the prosecution when we come back.
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:03.480]  Here's the bad news, Ultra 12 is selling out at 50% off, double patriot points, free shipping,
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:09.040]  so is Vazo Beach, so is Ultimate Bone Broth, so is Michael ZX, so is Living Defense, they're
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:12.920]  all selling out, but I'm keeping it 50% off till they sell out.
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:19.800]  Here is the good news, ladies and gentlemen, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10,

[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:15.880]  to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:24.040]  I want to slow down here because we released so much bombshell information, it is a continual
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:33.400]  spray, a shower, a fountain, that I really want to slow down and just note historically
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:41.880]  the point we're at and try to quantify it, to recognize it and how we've gotten here
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.640]  and how we have a good outcome for humanity and our children and our families.
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:51.680]  Constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, good friend of mine, really smart guy, popular
[1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:57.040]  guest, he's right up there with Watson, we're the most popular guys on the show, Alex Jones,
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:00.600]  Robert Barnes and Paul Watson, not bragging, wow, I'm popular on my own show, thanks for
[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:06.520]  putting up with me folks, but seriously, I wanted to get you here to town to talk about
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:10.200]  the start of Stone's trial and boy, it's been fireworks like we thought, jury selection
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:14.080]  started yesterday, you're an expert on that, we'll lay it all out in a moment, who this
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:20.240]  judge is, what's really happening, but I wanted to talk about the process within first and
[1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:27.480]  I wanted to talk about this key whole view into another world of what's happening to
[1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:33.280]  Stone and what I would characterize as a complete destruction of the rule of law in this country
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:38.960]  similar to what we see with Adam Schiff and the Intelligence Committee and what it's
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:45.240]  doing in Congress, the usurpation of the Judiciary Committee, the secret trials, the edited transcripts,
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:52.400]  the fake transcripts, the lying about what's in the transcripts, I mean, it's a open exercise
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:59.240]  of how you would textbook, destroy the rule of law and go beyond a banana republic, so
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:03.480]  that's my view, we'll get your view on in a moment and then we'll get into the big story
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:10.800]  and who this first selected prospective juror is, the first to be looked at, being a high
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:18.820]  level Obama department head, her husband working on Russiagate as a lawyer directly at the
[1:08:18.820 --> 1:08:23.920]  Justice Department, unrested in a conflict of interest, and even Reuters admits this,
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:29.400]  I'm going to show it to you, and the judge says no, she can stay but then strikes anyone
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:33.680]  who's a republican, she says, party doesn't matter but then strikes republicans as it
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:39.880]  does if you're that, you say well that's oxymoronic, it's an exercise of flaunting and it hit me
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:45.640]  this morning reading their documents being sued by the very same groups that they de-platformed
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:52.520]  Alex Jones, first they demonized me, de-platformed me, so that people wouldn't support us and
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.480]  then once people didn't support info wars, it set the precedent for everybody else, now
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.640]  including republican congress members, the NRA, everybody's being de-platformed, Gorka
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:08.240]  says I support censorship, he gets de-platformed, so it's a collapse, an avalanche, it's the
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:12.360]  same thing with these judges, overturning everything Trump does, then the Supreme Court
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:16.920]  shoots it down but every other court in unison against Trump, thank God for the Supreme Court,
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:20.400]  so they're trying to set up a judicial tyranny and just like they're trying to overturn the
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:24.080]  First Amendment and getting everybody to accept it with Alex Jones, then it's for everybody
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:29.080]  else, it's the same thing with this judge, why would she flaunt it, why would they do
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:33.200]  it so openly, why would they say that the president has no power over the borders when
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:37.960]  it's right in the constitution, explicit powers, the most important he has, the most
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:44.800]  clear cut and where are they going with this revolution against our most cherished values
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:48.760]  and what we know has made us one of the freest and greatest nations in world history, so
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:53.200]  so how do you quantify the Epstein coming out, it being the top story, the huge awakenings
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:58.680]  everywhere, all these whistleblowers cascading, building towards a crescendo that the system
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:03.200]  can't survive, it's attempt to go from being cloaked out in the open, trying to teach
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:07.440]  all its minions, hey, we win by lying and being criminal, even the New York Times has
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:16.160]  articles, hey, let's lie to defeat Trump, what do you call this conflagration and am
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.560]  I right in that there's a system of open corruption happening because the internal corruption
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:27.480]  failed from exposure, so now they think let's be even worse and that will just normalize
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:28.800]  it when that's not going to work.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:32.120]  Well, it's very much sort of the difference between the rule of law and the rule of power
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:35.520]  and what they're doing, it's the exercise of raw power and it's the corruption of the
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:39.680]  rule of law, the corruption of constitutional principles, I mean for example today, media
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:45.120]  organizations were pushing back saying that the identity of the jurors could not be disclosed
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:49.600]  that somehow it would be a criminal act or a bad act if that took place, that's nonsense.
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.880]  It used to be the media demanding everything be public, now they're the executioners, they're
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:56.560]  the attack dogs of tyrannous.
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:00.880]  Well, if it was one of theirs on trial, they would be demanding disclosure and they would
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.480]  be talking about bias.
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.320]  Imagine if you were in the 1960s and the media came out and said you can't talk about the
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:12.360]  clan connection of a juror in an African American defended case, that's precisely what took
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:17.280]  place here, in fact what happened in the U.S. Supreme Court ruled back in 1984 that there
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:22.560]  is a constitutional First Amendment right to access information in the courtroom and
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:28.040]  that included the right to know the identities, even the addresses of jurors.
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:32.680]  That's a constitutionally protected right since 1984 and it was the press originally
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:36.560]  that helped establish that and now you see the establishment press wanting to be the
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:37.560]  exclusive gatekeeper.
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:40.560]  I think for those that just joined us and we've got huge breaking news bringing it to
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:45.520]  me please right now on drugreport.com, absolutely massive, Don Jr. has outed the whistleblower
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:47.440]  at Rand Paul's encouragement.
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:51.360]  Nowhere in the Constitution do people get to stay secret, again get to face your accusers,
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:56.760]  they're attacking all the fundamental rule of law as you said with an open power grab.
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:01.480]  Exactly just raw power, it's leveraging and weaponizing every form of power that exists
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.200]  within the entire governmental system, whether it's regulatory, administrative, the judicial
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:08.640]  branch, the executive branch, you're seeing things get criminalized.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:13.600]  I was contacted this week by people who were being subject to various kinds of elections
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.880]  investigation when they had nothing to do with the election campaigns that were being
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:22.120]  investigated, just because they want to weaponize the FEC, because the head of the FEC is an
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:25.400]  anti-Trump supporter, anti-Trump Trump hater.
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:29.280]  Here you have, for example, today, the judge said yesterday that, hey, someone's opinion
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.960]  about Trump doesn't matter, they all work for Trump, yeah, everybody in the deep state
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:37.560]  works for Trump but they don't actually work for Trump, that's the problem.
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:41.480]  She says, oh, so their opinions about Trump don't really matter and then what happens
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.200]  today, the U.S. attorney gets up and does in his opening statement, what does he do?
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:48.200]  He attacks Trump, attacks Trump, attacks Trump, attacks Trump.
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:52.480]  How was someone's opinion about Trump not relevant to their ability to be a fair juror?
[1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:54.360]  Well, they're making it all about that.
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:55.360]  Absolutely.
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:58.560]  Let's stop there, let's stop there.
[1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:03.000]  It's big news that Don Jr. has out of the whistleblower, we knew who it was, we'll tell
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  you about that.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.960]  There's been a bunch of whistleblowers, they're all former employees of Hillary, Brennan, Obama,
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:11.960]  who they've told to be the whistleblower, it's the higher ups that made up this whole
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:15.200]  story that's been proven, we said that months ago it's been proven right.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:19.760]  But we are going to out the first prospective juror that media matters and George Soros
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:24.600]  says is criminal if we do when it's not and we're not doing it to intimidate a jury, we're
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:31.240]  doing it so the world knows they are filling that jury as we speak with literal Trump and
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.240]  stone haters.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:35.160]  It'd be like having Hillary Clinton on the damn jury.
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:42.000]  Judge Greenlight's anti-Trump feds as jurors for Roger Stone trial, so when we come back
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:47.080]  we're going to get into Jr. outing the whistleblower, one of the whistleblowers, the one that wanted
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:51.880]  to stay secret and we're going to get in to the first person out of 80 they bring forward,
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:59.280]  the judge tells them you're not allowed to get rid of anybody political and then they
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:04.040]  bring her up and say, oh, she can stay when she again ran an operation for Obama, her
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:09.560]  husband is in the deep state prosecution of the fake Russia gate.
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:10.560]  This is incredible.
[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:14.760]  I mean, this is a pure example of what a railroaded trial looks like.
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.680]  Roger Stone has been unconstitutionally gagged from talking about his own case and defending
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.320]  himself in the court of public opinion by the same court.
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:29.240]  The same court is the disallowed strikes for cause and allowed a jury that hates a stone
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.960]  to be seated and the only Republicans that were in the jury pool, the public reports
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:37.760]  out today are that there are no Republicans left in the actual jury of Roger Stone's case.
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:43.360]  So what you have is just people who hate Roger Stone, hate Donald Trump and they're the ones
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:46.080]  who are going to independently and impartially judge him.
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:47.240]  I mean, it's a joke.
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:48.240]  It's a joke.
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.760]  I mean, it's similar to what the government tried to do in the Wesley Snipes case that
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:57.200]  we prevented them from doing it, but only by going to extraordinary lengths.
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:14:59.680]  This makes a mockery of the judicial process.
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:04.400]  In the number one reason why the U.S. Supreme Court said and other courts throughout the
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:10.700]  country have said it is critically important to allow juror information to be identified
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:14.540]  for the public to discuss and debate them, aside from that always being the historical
[1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:19.920]  precedent going back to the 1400s in our Anglo-Saxon legal tradition that is borrowed
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:25.040]  from our common and constitutional law principles is because of potential jury bias might get
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:28.720]  exposed, because often jury bias was only exposed when the identity of the individual
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:29.720]  was named.
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:30.720]  They're like, hey, I have this information.
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:31.720]  I have that information.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:34.440]  Hey, they misled on this.
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:38.000]  What protects a fair trial in this country is open, free press.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  That's right.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.120]  We're going to bring that power back by sheer force of will.
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:47.440]  We're going to expose this prospective juror, the first one brought up by the judge that
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:52.040]  works for Obama, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whose husband is deep inside the
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:56.400]  operation with the fake Russiagate hoax on the other side.
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:01.400]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:05.200]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:10.080]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:13.600]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:18.120]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:19.320]  across America.
[1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:23.080]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.

[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:28.040]  I feel.
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:30.360]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:35.560]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:38.040]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:17.800]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:22.160]  is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:26.640]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:32.680]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account

[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.400]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:52.400]  before purchasing.
[1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:57.280]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:01.440]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:04.960]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:10.320]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian socialist promised they would
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:14.520]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:18.200]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:22.920]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:24.640]  have you arrested in some areas?
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:31.800]  they're doing.
[1:18:31.800 --> 1:18:34.920]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:39.160]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:44.320]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:45.920]  as the OK symbol on it.
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:49.800]  It's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the back.

[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:56.680]  having a great hat.
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:19:01.040]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:02.920]  I don't care what your views are.
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:06.840]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them, that's important.
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:08.440]  But we have something in common.
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.520]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:18.080]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:19.720]  to Congress in the world.
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:24.200]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:25.200]  indicted.
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:29.960]  But word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.520]  From my new home in New Zealand I will.
[1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:40.160]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand, not so fast criminal.
[1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:44.120]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:49.400]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy, but the American
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:54.800]  people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com
[1:19:54.800 --> 1:20:00.640]  and band.video.
[1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:23.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:27.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:42.680]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:47.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:51.040]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here next segment.
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:21:00.360]  We are going to expose the deep state arrogantly trying to seat a juror who worked directly
[1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:05.480]  for Obama in the White House heading up a whole department and his husband is working
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:12.440]  currently in the Justice Department on the entire situation with the fake Russiagate.
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:16.720]  Can you guys do a document cam shot for me since that computer is not working in there?
[1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:19.000]  This is the supposed whistleblower.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:25.360]  He just type in his name, click images and it comes right up and look at him.
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:26.360]  He looks like a kid.
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:28.000]  I mean, he looks like a hipster kid.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.760]  This is the reason why they won't let, this is the reason why SHIFT doesn't want a public
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:31.760]  hearing with the guy.
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:35.400]  He was glad to have public hearings with Mueller and everyone else, but he puts this kid up
[1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:36.920]  there and they're going to be like, what?
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:40.720]  He's a 30, by published reports, a 30 year old Yalee.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:43.680]  Basically graduates from Yale, he defended some controversial professors when he was
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:44.680]  at Yale.
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:46.880]  He was there many years after I was there.
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:51.200]  And then he, about I knew people who knew him, and then he got a quick job with the
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:52.200]  Obama administration.
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.880]  It's like, how does somebody like that, how does a kid out of Yale, this is goes back
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:22:00.120]  to the 1940s, 50s, 60s when our country went off the rails and our CIA and deep state sort
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:04.400]  of the operations where we're doing coups all over the world, destabilizing democracies
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:08.960]  all over the world, helped unleash debacles that are continuing to be a debacle in parts
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:09.960]  of the world.
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:12.680]  Central American Africa included, Middle East included.
[1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:17.760]  These were all these kid Yalees who got jobs in the OSS and then got jobs in the young
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:18.760]  CIA.
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:22.760]  The old joke used to be that you knew a CIA meeting if they were singing whip and poof
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:27.400]  songs around the table, which reflects an old tradition at Morey's, a dining club at
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:28.400]  Yale.
[1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:33.720]  And it gets worse because it turns out, as Donald Trump Jr. and Breitbart document,
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:40.360]  it turns out that he worked closely with anti-Trump dossier hoaxer, and again, this was all the
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:42.920]  anti-Trumpers were running this out of Ukraine.
[1:22:42.920 --> 1:22:49.240]  He was a mole brought in by Fiona Hill, brought in by McMaster that Roger Stone exposed two
[1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:52.720]  plus years ago here specifically, and then later got fired.
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:56.520]  One reason they want to throw his ass in prison is he dare advised the president and so did
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.080]  we about who was doing it.
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:02.240]  So it's a never-Trumper, a hoaxer involved with the dossier who's already testified.
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:06.800]  I remember saying months ago and then weeks ago and last week, this guy is one of the
[1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:10.560]  quote whistleblowers, but they don't want to say they first initially talked and then
[1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:11.560]  told lies.
[1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:12.560]  It's illegal.
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:16.240]  So they'll claim they're just reporting and confirming what the whistleblower said.
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:19.920]  So he's already testified, and that's why Schiff kept saying we can never release the
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:26.400]  name because it's just staffers of the Clintons and the Obamas and Brennan who work for them.
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:27.400]  That's it.
[1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:28.400]  That's all it is.
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.840]  And we were 100% right dead on next month's news today.
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:39.120]  But again, they follow the same sociopathic criminology, so they just do the same crap.
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:40.800]  The whistleblowers don't exist.
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:41.800]  It's Brennan.
[1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:42.800]  It's Clapper.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:43.800]  It's Hillary.
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:44.800]  It's Obama.
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:49.120]  And they order their underlings that created the fake dossier to activate their underlings
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:50.360]  to say they heard this.
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:54.840]  Yeah, it's very, it's weaponizing whistleblower laws to misapply and misuse them for people
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:56.360]  who are not whistleblowers.
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:24:00.480]  As William Benny said, who's a real whistleblower, this is not a whistleblower claim.
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:02.120]  This is not a whistleblower complaint.
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:07.320]  This is a Obama, this guy was deeply tied to Obama, tied to Brennan, tied to Democrats
[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:08.400]  across the board.
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:12.120]  He gets a job right out of Yale, gets promoted into the Obama administration, sort of has
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:17.160]  this West Wing TV version of politics, sort of personality and profile and resume.
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:21.600]  And by the way, let's put that photo of him next to Ivanka Trump.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:24.680]  I mean, think about how sick all of this is.
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:30.880]  They have to be around these snakes that are double dealing and again, it's all because
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:37.640]  Trump trusted McMaster and who brought a McMaster, Steve Bannon, who now is going to testify
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:44.360]  against Roger Stone and it's now coming out reportedly planted fake evidence against Kushner
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:49.640]  and against Trump's daughter and has been working for the deep state double dealing
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:51.760]  to cover his ass day one.
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:54.880]  Yeah, I don't know anything about the Bannon component.
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:59.880]  What I do know about this component in terms of Eric's, whether it's CIA, Ramella, I mean,
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.360]  it's fascinating the guy has CIA in his name.
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:05.360]  But the reason why they're not putting him up there is he wouldn't hold up well.
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:07.880]  One he looks, he's like, well, what is this young kid doing?
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:12.920]  I mean, the image they wanted to draw was of this longtime career servant caring about
[1:25:12.920 --> 1:25:16.600]  the country, protecting the country, seeing Trump do something bad and feeling obligated
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:22.320]  to report it, not some Obama kid out of a West Wing cast crew that was who was promoted
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:27.040]  by Ben Brennan, who had been leaking information illicitly, who was just trying to protect
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:29.640]  his old connected political patron Joe Biden.
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:34.040]  And again, what they do is they go, oh, a whistleblower heard this transcript, witnesses
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:35.040]  say it didn't happen.
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:38.720]  And then they just keep saying, oh, a new whistleblower heard it and can confirm it.
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:43.120]  It's always third hand, none of it's true, but they just keep re-upping and recycling
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  it.
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.720]  It's not the original whistleblower ever being known because that's just some poor person
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.960]  they ordered to say, you heard this, who now scared to testify, I won't even give written
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.360]  questions to the Republicans, and they're saying, oh, we can't have new process.
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  It's too intimidating.
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:59.200]  Well, there's no doubt he just can't hold up under cross examination.
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:00.360]  That's what they're afraid of.
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:04.560]  He would look bad publicly, given his resume or lack thereof, given his profile, given
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:07.400]  the imagery, given the visuals of the equation.
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:10.200]  But the other aspect is he wouldn't hold up under cross examination of whether he was
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:13.800]  leaking when he was connected to the National Security Council, whether he was having illicit
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:17.640]  communications with Brennan and other people when he went to the CIA after he was removed
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.960]  from the NSC because of the issues related to allegations of leaking, whether or not
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.880]  it was politically motivated, how much it was coordinated, how much it was part of a
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:30.640]  broader pattern, his long, deep political ties, he may be tied according to some stories
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.720]  and some reports to Biden's Ukrainian corruption, and maybe that's what he was trying to curtail
[1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:39.320]  and prevent the investigation of that corruption of the Biden family and their political ties
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:40.720]  to what happened in Ukraine.
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:43.040]  So he just can't hold up under cross examination.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:44.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:46.560]  We know the whole thing is about obstruction of justice.
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:48.600]  Now, we know this is just some low-level minion.
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:52.480]  They said, hey, kid, you're going to be the one that says you heard this third hand.
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:54.040]  But again, who told them second hand?
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:57.960]  That's why they don't want the original person saying it ever to be questioned because they
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:26:59.400]  told them to say it.
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:00.960]  Mike Adams called it two months ago.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.720]  I called it just absolutely because it's the same thing just like the Russia hoax.
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:09.880]  It's just this, there's no route to it because they don't want you to ever find the route
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:11.400]  so you can't ever just prove it.
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:13.440]  It's just totally made up.
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:18.480]  It's what corrupt law enforcement does, portrayed in TV shows like The Wire, part of a special
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:23.960]  that we did, I think a week ago here or two weeks ago here, about that all of these cases
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:28.440]  are interconnected is it's the illicit laundering of information and intelligence in order to
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  hide and disguise the source.
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:34.840]  Because if you saw the source, it would be immediately discredited in terms of the information
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:35.840]  they're given.
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:36.840]  So they've got to mask it.
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:37.840]  They've got to hide it.
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:38.840]  They've got to disguise it.
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:43.000]  They've got to, you know, two, three, four degrees removed from who heard what, when,
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  where.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  So let me ask you this.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.440]  What should the aftermath of this be?
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.000]  Because everybody's missing the point.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.560]  He's one of the witnesses.
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:54.280]  We predicted a bunch of these so-called witnesses are really whistleblowers, the original people
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:55.640]  to say they heard this.
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  But again, they're lying.
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:27:59.840]  So they just want to say they heard it from somebody who heard it because they want to
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:00.840]  escape justice.
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:03.120]  And again, so this guy's already testified.
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:05.200]  He's already been in there in secret.
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:08.640]  And the fact that they tried to trot him in, you know he's met with Schiff in secret.
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:09.640]  You know it.
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:10.640]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.640]  This is a fiasco, but they got away with the last criminal fake investigation of Russiagate.
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:16.280]  So now they've just launched a whole new one.
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:17.280]  Yeah, they just doubled down.
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:20.240]  And I think the effect of it is there's a reason why we have all these constitutional
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:21.240]  protections.
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:26.000]  And those constitutional protections exist in terms of right of confrontation of witnesses,
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.360]  right of public transparency of court proceedings, right of independent impartial decision makers.
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:35.640]  All of those rights are being violated in the impeachment process because the truth
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:42.080]  would expose this as a fraud and a hoax, not as a real independently justified impeachment
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  inquiry.
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:44.080]  That's right.
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:48.680]  Eric, Sir Mala, CIA Ramallah, Sir Mala, I can't pronounce it.
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.280]  The point is, is that this not-nosed individual is where it all hangs on.
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:55.360]  What about your wimps?
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:57.280]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:01.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:02.760]  I sued the IRS and won.
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.720]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.240]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:12.560]  I can help you too.
[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.560]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:17.800]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:26.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:29.760]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:34.680]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:39.240]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier
[1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.240]  heart.
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:41.240]  Don't just take my word for it.

[1:29:53.400 --> 1:29:57.320]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:01.520]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:05.040]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:08.560]  They're waging war on communication itself.
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:12.960]  As the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.560]  base in England.
[1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:18.280]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:23.040]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:24.720]  Have you arrested in some areas?
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:29.960]  Have you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK?
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:31.840]  They know what they're doing.
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:35.000]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:39.240]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:44.400]  We have a, it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:49.040]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the

[1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:57.320]  All having a great hat.
[1:30:57.320 --> 1:30:59.480]  All of our bodies are different.
[1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:02.400]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:05.400]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:08.840]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:12.160]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:19.840]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.120]  completely changes.
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:22.120]  I'm healthier.
[1:31:22.120 --> 1:31:23.120]  I have more energy.
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.120]  I lose weight.
[1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:25.120]  I look better.
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:26.120]  Everybody notices.
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:33.600]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 bodies, ultimate turmeric.
[1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:38.800]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from infowars life.
[1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:43.680]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.

[1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:50.640]  Check it out.
[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:51.640]  There's nothing else like it.
[1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:54.680]  It's 100% off right now, the cells about to end.
[1:31:54.680 --> 1:31:57.040]  Gutfusioninfowarstore.com.
[1:31:57.040 --> 1:31:59.120]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:04.520]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:09.200]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:14.280]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:15.520]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:19.160]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:20.160]  true.
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:24.400]  It's just right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:29.520]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality neuroceutical grade
[1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:34.360]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, why you're so alive.
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.360]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:40.360]  you're age.
[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:46.680]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself that other 2 billion people,
[1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:50.720]  ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:52.520]  because of iodine deficiency.
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:33:22.360]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:36.880]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:42.520]  The establishment, the multinational corporations that love communist China that believe America
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.800]  is theirs for the looting and pillaging.
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:54.320]  Put too much confidence in big tech censorship and mainstream media ability to suppress
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:55.320]  information.
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:01.120]  When you suppress information, it's like a beach ball you put under the pool 6, 7 feet,
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.400]  it explodes up and goes 10 feet in the air.
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:09.440]  When you try to bury the truth, it just comes up even more force later explosively like
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  a volcano.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:15.160]  So you've got Jeffrey Epstein being murdered coming out in the corners, everybody's saying
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:18.760]  it clearly happened and the witness is saying he begs for his life and you've got the child
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:22.640]  kidnapping rings and the Clintons involvement, the blackmail and ABC News covering it up
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:28.120]  and Brian Stelter is out defending it saying ABC did a good job covering it up because
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:33.360]  these people are slaves of the establishment and it's their job to get out there and defend
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:34.360]  it.
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:37.600]  But there's no putting this Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:46.920]  And now Don Jr. has come out and tweeted the Breitbart article outing the whistleblower
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:53.800]  and it's somebody that's already secretly testified, 30-year-old Jaley who said he heard
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:35:00.160]  about it from third parties, it's all a big third party circle jerk.
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:05.360]  So that's come out and now we're going to release because it's the First Amendment,
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.920]  it's the Supreme Court rulings, it's common sense.
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:11.080]  If you couldn't know who jurors were, they could easily pack them.
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:16.040]  They could set up special jurisdictions and special courts and take people to far away
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:21.880]  jurisdictions like as in our Declaration of Independence, one of the big reasons we broke
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:27.080]  away from the crown and King George III was because he set up kangaroo courts and took
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:32.320]  people far away to other jurisdictions to try them and packed juries.
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:35.560]  Read the Declaration of Independence, I'll get to it in a moment, but we have constitutional
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:38.120]  and criminal lawyer here.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  I talked to him last night, he said, well, I remember Supreme Court ruling in the 80s,
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:43.320]  but let me check it, I'm flying in in the morning.
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:46.640]  This morning we had a lengthy meeting, we pulled the Supreme Court rulings, he said,
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:52.560]  absolutely, it's not just your right, Alex, it's your duty to release the name of the
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:57.760]  woman who's been picked as the first prospective juror, they tried to strike her and the judge
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  said, no, wait till Robert Barnes, esteemed lawyer, lays this out for you because this
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.360]  is way bigger than Roger Stone, who we all feel for, we have empathy, because we know
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:14.440]  we're next, myself, literally, when something happens to Roger, it's like it's happening
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.640]  to me, that's what empathy is, it's actually selfishness, good-tuned selfishness.
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:24.160]  When you see somebody else getting screwed over, it's personal, it's going to be you
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:28.960]  next, your children, see, we've been taught not to take other people getting screwed over
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:34.240]  personal, oh, I don't care about the stock market, well, the whole economy, if it collapses,
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:39.360]  the way people are trained though, to be one-dimensional, I don't care if they have a kangaroo court
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:42.880]  with Obama's hanging judge that throws everybody in prison and won't gag them and won't let
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:48.520]  them have their witnesses and just railroad them, I'm not Roger Stone, I'm not in DC,
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:53.080]  he didn't live in DC either, they hauled him there.
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.320]  And now in the second day, I talked to our reporters and Stone's people, and they're
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:00.080]  so scared they won't even talk, no, they said, the judge is going crazy, this is about an
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:04.280]  hour ago, in fact, just about an hour ago, talked during a break, the judge is going
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:08.920]  crazy threatening everybody, we can't talk about anything, well, you know it's about
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:16.240]  this, that we had Mr. Ingalls on, reporter from Florida who was there, and what he said
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:20.840]  was true, it was in Reuters, it was in AP, I'm going to show you what he said, but media
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.960]  matters run by George Soros says, I should be arrested for this, this jury tampering
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:34.960]  that I want you to know that the woman ran a Clinton department, PR, then she moved in
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:39.680]  with Obama, she comes from the Bill and Mona Gates Foundation, works there now, and her
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:45.880]  husband works in the Mueller probe, that should recuse you instantly, even the appearance
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:50.160]  of impropriety and conflict, this is unbelievable, we'll have a top lawyer explain it to you
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:55.320]  in a moment, but everybody knows this, so why would they do it, so we're going to expose
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:59.240]  the identity, because it's the right thing to do, just like Rand Paul said, I'm getting
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:02.960]  ready to expose the identity, it's in the constitution of the fake whistleblower, we
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:07.520]  have a right to face accusers, and now Don Jr. has done it, and now the left saying arrest
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:12.920]  him, because they want to lie about you in the dark, remember Kavanaugh saying he raped
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.920]  women turned out it was all fake, the very same media putting out fake stuff was covering
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:22.520]  up, perhaps deign knowingly, articles on inforwars.com, Judge Greenlight's anti-Trump
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:28.040]  feds is jurors for Roger Stone trial, Stone and Janger are facing deep state jury, it's
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:34.040]  not in danger, it's happening, but the media is so scared that no one dare tell you who
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:39.240]  she is, even though it's the law that we do it, here's the article Alex Jones is trying
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:43.760]  to out the identity of a potential Roger Stone trial juror, the first one they called up
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:49.400]  with the help of Stone's assistant, oh how dare I talk, that's George Soros' mouth,
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:53.080]  Reuters, longtime Trump advisor Stone takes ill, by the way I talked to him, he was already
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:59.120]  sick the night before during jury selection for trial, and look at this right here, at
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:05.320]  the onset of Tuesday's proceedings is yesterday, Jackson said she would not agree to strike
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:08.880]  prospective jurors just because they work for the federal government or because they
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:13.560]  have opinions about Trump, then they called up the first magic person, that warning did
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:20.520]  not stop Stone, oh see he's bad, lawyers from trying to strike the very first one, a woman
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:25.480]  who once served as communications director for the White House office of management
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:29.680]  and budget, that's the most important office folks, that's the money, under Democratic President
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:33.680]  Barack Obama and whose husband is a Justice Department national security attorney, we
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:39.080]  looked him up, we're gonna expose him as well right now, next segment, Barnes is gonna start
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:43.880]  first, here's all the other articles about it and then we're gonna expose this, this
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:49.240]  is unbelievable, Barnes lay it out, so the misleading media stories that are out there
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:55.680]  today were saying oh you should never identify a juror for various reasons, there's nobody
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:00.280]  out there who wants to in any way intimidate the juror or affect the juror at all or any
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:04.580]  prospective juror at all, the point is to know the identities of the jury so that people
[1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:07.960]  can independently make their own inquiries and judgment about whether the process is
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:13.360]  being done fairly, you wouldn't want John Gotti's son as a juror at his trial, exactly,
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:16.520]  you wouldn't want to know his name for the purposes of calling him, you wouldn't know
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:21.120]  his name for the purposes of writing him, none of those things, that's a ludicrous interpretation
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:24.640]  that media matters was trying to impose, instead what you want to know their names for, the
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:28.640]  reason why the courts have always protected the public right to know is you want to know
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:33.040]  are there sources of bias, for example because the public knew the name of jurors they're
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:37.480]  able to identify jurors who had failed to disclose certain biases to the court, because
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:41.600]  the public knew about it, members of the public knew about it, but the lawyers involved in
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:45.800]  the system did not know about it, they were able to expose racial bias, able to expose
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:51.080]  political bias, able to expose a range of biases, we do not have star chamber trials
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:56.240]  in this country, even if Adam Schiff wants to pretend we do, and it should not be happening
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:00.600]  in a federal court, in a federal criminal trial, when more than 30 years of US Supreme
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:06.760]  Court law makes clear that the public is entitled to know the names, identities and addresses
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:11.760]  of jurors, only in select cases where the courts seal those records for extraordinary
[1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:16.480]  reasons, none of which are present here, and none of which has happened here, can that
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:17.480]  information be withheld?
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:22.520]  So it's part of a system why the Democrats are weaponizing the judiciary, and they're
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:27.120]  trying to protect all of their little operatives, and not letting us face accusers, and then
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:30.760]  not letting us know, because if we know the identity and we know that she worked directly
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:35.640]  for Obama at the highest levels, and her husband is in the Mueller investigation after Trump,
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:36.640]  it's outrageous.
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:41.320]  Exactly, I mean I'll read from one of the leading legal scholastic publications out
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.760]  there, which talked about this whole issue in detail, it said, quote, there is a firmly
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:50.600]  established tradition of providing public access to juror identities, and access to
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:55.680]  that information enhances the functioning of our judicial system, because it is a quote
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:00.800]  right of access guaranteed by the First Amendment, and the reason why it's guaranteed by the
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:05.600]  First Amendment is so people can have confidence that someone like Roger Stone is not being
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:11.000]  real-roaded by a partial prejudice jury selection system.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.400]  We don't have any problem with the juror here, we have a problem with the court allowing
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:15.400]  someone like Roger Stone to be the juror.
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:16.400]  Sure, that's them changing the subject.
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:21.600]  How dare the judge not let them strike this individual.
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  How dare the first person that pops up, you know they're going to make her the foreman.
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:28.680]  And now there's a bunch of other bad deep staters we're learning they're picking right now.
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:29.680]  They don't care.
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:30.680]  That's the nature of DC.
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:33.680]  There was no way this venue could have ever been a fair trial for Roger Stone.
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:37.220]  But at a minimum, the only way the judge could have made that even possible is by getting
[1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:40.360]  rid of the political partisan Trump haters from the jury pool.
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:41.360]  To have that.
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:43.920]  Instead there were only two Republicans out of 80 and she struck them.
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:44.920]  Exactly, both gone.
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:45.920]  So it's a joke.
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:47.480]  I mean it's a joke of a trial process.
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:52.960]  If Obama was being tried in a small rural southern county that was all-white that voted
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:54.520]  98 percent against him.
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:42:55.520]  It'd be fraud.
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:56.520]  Exactly.
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:00.440]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:03.960]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.320]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Thabian socialist promised they would
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:13.320]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:17.200]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:21.960]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:23.640]  Have you arrested in some areas?
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:29.640]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:30.760]  they're doing.
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:33.920]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:38.160]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:42.040]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:43.040]  It's black and white.
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:44.040]  Very nice.
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:45.040]  There's the OK symbol on it.

[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:00.920]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:07.240]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:08.920]  will like different formulas.
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.480]  It's just that simple.
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:16.520]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:21.160]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:22.160]  Get both.
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:24.480]  They're both great for you, whichever one you like.
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:27.920]  Choose that and give the other to family or friends.
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:30.000]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:31.240]  That's why I harp on it.
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:35.560]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:37.600]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:38.720]  You don't live as long.

[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.760]  It's the iodine challenge.
[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:56.640]  Five types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:01.000]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:02.880]  I don't care what your views are.
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.120]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.120]  That's important.
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:08.400]  But we have something in common.
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:12.520]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:18.040]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:19.680]  to Congress in the world.
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:24.280]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:25.280]  indicted.
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:29.960]  The word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:36.760]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will, Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:38.260]  to New Zealand.
[1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:40.160]  Not so fast criminal.

[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:48.800]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.

[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:23.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:25.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:34.720]  Well, by process of elimination and going off our own reporters and Reuters and AP, everybody
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.920]  saying it was a woman whose husband works at the justice department on the Mueller case
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:44.080]  in international espionage affairs.
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.920]  There's only one woman who worked as the head of public relations for the office of budget
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:51.440]  management in the Obama years.
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:55.920]  And she was there in 2013 and 2014.
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:59.320]  There's only one woman who's got a husband at the justice department that works on Russia
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:00.320]  gate.
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:04.680]  We've got him as well being sworn in, her being sworn in by Joe Biden.
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:07.800]  Back when he was vice president.
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:14.040]  And so again, imagine in America, everybody knows who this woman is, but oh, we better
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:20.440]  not say when you're supposed to know who jurors are, especially in something political like
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:26.040]  this, to see how this judge is not letting any Republicans on, but you were saying sees
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:28.480]  a woman like herself on another Obama appoint.
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:32.240]  Oh yeah, I mean, her background is professional class background.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:37.360]  Obama appointee sort of looks like what Hillary would look like looks like your iconic demographically
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:42.920]  fits your Obama appointee and Hillary act of like a white cat lady.
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:47.760]  I mean, it's that professional class mindset, I call it sort of like it's people who would
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:49.880]  have otherwise been first grade teachers.
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:54.400]  Now with the power of the judge or the power of the senator, whatever power they have,
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:56.240]  but they tend to leverage that power aggressively.
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:57.640]  They're sending us a detention.
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:59.320]  They put us in prison for speech.
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:03.000]  In essence, that's what's taking place here in the sense of stone is being targeted in
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.960]  ways that very few people are.
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:09.400]  And she's not allowed to defend himself in the court of public opinion has issued gag
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:13.180]  orders that I believe were patently unconstitutional.
[1:49:13.180 --> 1:49:17.920]  And on top of all of that has taken action now to make the jury trial system look very
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  partial and look very prejudice rather than fair and impartial.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:24.200]  So it's a continuing pattern of problematic behavior.
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.840]  And you go back our jury selection system for over a thousand years.
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:29.560]  It was always a public trial.
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:31.400]  It was usually the whole group got together.
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:34.200]  I mean, you anybody can look up the case themselves.
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:39.320]  It's a press enterprise company versus the Superior Court of California for the citation
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:44.400]  and the old Supreme Court citation is 464 U.S. 501 and it goes through all the legal
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:45.400]  history.
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:49.000]  It goes through the history that the jury trial proceedings are always open, open trials
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.400]  reach back to the days before the Norman conquest.
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:53.720]  You're talking about sixth century, seventh century.
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:59.880]  This is before the Magna Carta before the Magna Carta was designed to reform the jury
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:03.600]  system to make sure the jury system was even more open and in Europe and England, they've
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:05.240]  already got rid of this as well.
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:10.160]  So this is a systematic getting rid of due process, getting rid of public trials.
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.680]  It's been essential to fairness is if people do first of all, it's transparency.
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:17.760]  If people don't know who is judging the person, they can't know whether that that judgment
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:22.320]  process is being done impartially and independently and again, this is way better than Roger.
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:28.840]  This is about all this judge is there's 80 people brought in to a Republican.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:32.120]  He says, Oh, you can't have a Republican, you'll be for Roger, but any Democrat, they're
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  not biased.
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:37.320]  Oh, you headed up a department for Obama, your husband's on the Mueller witch hunt that
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:41.480]  that's in the news that the Reuters is like her husband's working on the Mueller case.
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.880]  But it's like the judge says that's okay.
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:46.560]  What the hell have Robert Mueller in there?
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:48.240]  It's about Robert Mueller's wife.
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:50.080]  Well, my you know, the, oh, well, we're all impartial.
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:54.920]  Meanwhile, the whole team states been caught foaming, making stuff up, lying, fake whistleblowers
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:55.920]  just got exposed.
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:00.360]  I mean, it feels like watching the trial process that the only question they didn't ask the
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:03.760]  jurors is did they bring their rope with them to lynch Roger at the end?
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:08.520]  I mean, that's the that's the it feels like a lynching jury process designed to create
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:09.520]  a lynching jury.
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:10.520]  That's what I said.
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:11.680]  I said, why don't you have a guillotine in there?
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:16.240]  Yeah, I mean, it's just it it's designed, our whole legal system is designed to prevent
[1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:17.240]  this from happening.
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:20.320]  Why not just have Hillary on the jury or Chelsea?
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:26.040]  I mean, by the logic she employed, only people with a personal bias against Roger Stone were
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:30.640]  going to be excluded, no one who had a strong bias against Trump was going to be excluded.
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:35.080]  And as you said, the prosecutor has opened up today to the news, making it all about
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:36.080]  Trump.
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:37.080]  Exactly.
[1:51:37.080 --> 1:51:38.080]  Saying it's about Trump lying.
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:39.080]  Trump, there's Trump that.
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:44.240]  So to give the judge the credit, maybe she didn't realize that was the process, but assuming
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:48.040]  even that was the case, by the point the prosecutor issued their opening, she should
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:52.000]  have reopened jury selection or even issued a mistrial because either she was misled by
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:57.200]  the prosecution, misinterpreted, made a bad decision herself, whichever it is, she was
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:01.280]  wrong that Trump said that opinion about Trump was not going to be decisive in how the jurors
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.440]  were going to react and interpret the evidence.
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:04.440]  Clearly they are.
[1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:05.440]  This is a joke.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:08.960]  I mean, this is to have a DC jury, to have the most democratic jury in the country.
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  Why is it so brave?
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:13.480]  Because I have the text and Reuters and others have the same as AP.
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:15.880]  I mean, hell, hell, I can read it to people.
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:20.360]  She's like, of course, it's no big deal if you work for Obama and your husband worked
[1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:23.360]  on the Melier operation, and it's like, what?
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:27.160]  Well, I mean, the most ludicrous statement from my perspective that I didn't think was
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:31.120]  a fair statement by the court was something to the effect of what was reported was, and
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:32.880]  we'll order the jury transcript.
[1:52:32.880 --> 1:52:35.360]  That's part of what the Supreme Court said were entitled to as members of the press
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:38.840]  so that we can find out exactly what happened, what was said, but what was reported as being
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:43.320]  said were comments to the effect of everybody works for Trump.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:44.640]  That's a ludicrous statement.
[1:52:44.640 --> 1:52:48.680]  The idea that, oh, because everybody works for the federal government technically is
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:51.960]  supposed to be working for Trump when they've been betraying him for the last four years.
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:56.040]  It's a sick joke that, oh, well, she worked for Obama, but she's in the government now,
[1:52:56.040 --> 1:52:57.840]  so now she works for Trump, so that won't matter.
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.360]  Yeah, it's a ridiculous interpretation of the evidence.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:02.520]  But what about the husband in the Mueller probe?
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:04.120]  I mean, oh, that's deeply problematic.
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:08.080]  Now that should have been more fully exposed and detailed in the jury selection process.
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:13.080]  What's going to happen is the honest jurors who have a bias will admit that bias, and
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:16.040]  the irony is those are jurors you actually won on your case because they're willing to
[1:53:16.040 --> 1:53:17.560]  be honest about themselves.
[1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:18.560]  That means they'll be honest.
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  Oh, yeah, this woman said, oh, I have no bias.
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:21.560]  Exactly.
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:23.560]  She said, oh, I don't even...
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:24.560]  There's two things.
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:27.600]  Sometimes those people are overtly misrepresenting things.
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:30.720]  Most of the time, they really have convinced themselves they don't have any bias.
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:35.040]  But in almost all the social studies that have been done, unless you're put subject
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:38.520]  to searing questioning, your bias won't be exposed or detailed.
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:41.520]  Well, remember the Milgram studies and others where people feel like it's the right thing
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:42.520]  to do.
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:43.520]  They'll torture people to death.
[1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:44.520]  Oh, yeah, correct.
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:45.520]  Exactly.
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:46.520]  And what happened is...
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:47.520]  And these leftists are all followers.
[1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:48.640]  This is a political case.
[1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:53.440]  No fair ruling or fair trial could take place unless people without a strong political opinion
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:54.440]  works for them.
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:53:56.200]  Okay, so let's get to it right now.
[1:53:56.200 --> 1:54:00.800]  Here is who lines up with the only woman that ran this office in PR, the only one that
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:03.800]  has a husband in the Justice Department and the whole Mueller thing.
[1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:06.040]  Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:09.440]  Sylvia Matthews Burwell.
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:10.440]  There she is.
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:11.440]  1965, she's born.
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:15.320]  She met her husband at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and she was brought into
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:19.920]  government and worked directly under Bill Clinton, you can go read all this, for yourself.
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, her husband, again, works at the Justice Department as a Democrat
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:28.800]  going after Trump in the Mueller probe, and she worked again at the Treasury Department
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:33.840]  for Robert Rubin, Deputy White House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, finally Deputy Director
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:38.880]  of the Office of Management and Budget, did PR there, President of Walmart's Charitable
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:39.880]  Foundation.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:43.640]  She has joined the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation before that, and before the Bill
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.760]  Clinton presidency goes into, back at the Bill and Melinda Gates, her whole life, hardcore
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:53.120]  Democrat, there she is on the screen behind everybody, ladies and gentlemen, and this
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  is just incredible.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:55:02.960]  Now let's show you her purported husband here, that's Stephen Burwell, and here is a photo
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:10.200]  of Stephen Burwell reportedly while she's being sworn in with Joe Biden.
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:16.280]  So he looks like Eddie Haskell on steroids, ladies and gentlemen, so there you go, what
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:22.200]  a nice group we have ruling over us, and so arrogant it looks like that the judge says
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:23.200]  this is fine.
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:24.200]  Should we go to the transcript?
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:25.200]  What did the judge say?
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:27.120]  I mean, or at least it was quoted the same as different publications.
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:32.880]  Here's Reuters, a jury was being chosen from a pool of more than 80 potential jurors, opening
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:37.640]  statements could begin as early as Wednesday, and the trial would last for two weeks.
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:41.560]  At the onset of Tuesday proceedings, U.S. District Judge Amy Brennan Jackson, also appointed
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:45.840]  by Obama, says she would not agree to strike prospective jurors just because they work
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:49.360]  for the federal government or because they have opinions about Trump, but the two Republicans
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:51.720]  were thrown off out of 80.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:56.040]  That warning did not stop Stone's lawyers from trying to strike a very first one, a
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.920]  woman who once served as communication director for the White House, the Office of Budget
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:07.120]  and Management Democrat president, and then it just goes on to say that Jackson just went
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:12.840]  on to say that she's talked to the woman and that she says that she doesn't have any
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:15.800]  views period on this at all, no views at all.
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:16.800]  Which honestly...
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:17.800]  It's an open slate.
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:22.240]  Yeah, I mean, the problem is, maybe she's in her mind, she's being honest.
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:25.640]  The probabilities of it though would seem low because you're talking about someone that's
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:30.920]  politically active, politically involved, and what often is the case, I have an example
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:33.520]  of where they try to do a lynching jury like Stone's case.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:35.840]  I defended the case, it was the Wesley Snipes case.
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:39.240]  They deliberately picked a jury pool that had the highest per capita incidence of racial
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:45.680]  hatred in the country in the prior 10 years, prior to them picking the jury in that case.
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:49.800]  They got rid of all the African American jurors before we even got to jury selection.
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:54.640]  The media story joke was that it was as all white as the snowfall in the prior NFL playoff
[1:56:54.640 --> 1:57:00.120]  game in Green Bay the Sunday before, and up to that point the judge said, hey, I've always
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:04.040]  made my jury selections done within an hour, and the judge made a lot of what I thought
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.720]  was unfair questioning processes where he was trying to minimize the scope of bias.
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:12.880]  And then, fortunately, we were able to get him through a wide range of techniques that
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:17.560]  we utilized to ask meaningful questions, and it turned out over half, and we ended up doing
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:22.080]  three days of jury selection, over half of the jury pool was already biased against Wesley
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:23.560]  Snipes solely based on his race.
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  Sure, sure.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:27.080]  We're going to shift yours to another subject now, and we've got our reporters on the ground
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.480]  at Stone's deal, but again, this is the total overthrow rule of law.
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:35.200]  I mean, my God, the media won't even tell you that she was a high level person with
[1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:38.600]  Obama and that her husband is in the whole Mueller witch hunt.
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  I mean, we have a right to know that.
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:41.600]  It's still America.
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:46.240]  No matter what you dangerous evil left to say.
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:48.320]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:53.720]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:58.440]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and
[1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:03.280]  it says that two billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:04.720]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.400]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:13.080]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:14.080]  you said.
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:19.280]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take a high quality, neuroceutical grade.
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:23.560]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:28.600]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:29.600]  you're age.
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.240]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and to know that two billion
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:39.480]  people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the

[2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:12.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:22.040]  Okay, I just realized I did a whole hour and I didn't plug any and so I was going to leave
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:25.680]  it at this if you want to see independent real media that doesn't back down when nobody
[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:33.960]  else will release who the deep state first juror is being selected in Roger Stones lawyers
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:38.720]  are like we strike her and the judge goes no, you can't and the media matters says arrest
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:39.720]  me.
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:40.720]  I'm intimidating jurors.
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:43.920]  All I'm saying is what the hell is going on when you have Hillary Clinton in there.
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:48.160]  So I'm saying like a John Gotti mob trial and have his son, maybe his brother is the
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:50.200]  jurors, maybe the jury for me.
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:51.200]  This is ridiculous.
[2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:54.640]  Like having Hitler at the Nuremberg trial, he'd be pro Nazi with this.
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:58.120]  I mean, my God, just bring the damn gallows in there.
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:00:59.480]  Like you said, Barnes and hang them.

[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:15.800]  It's amazing.
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.800]  Just look into the ingredients that are in it and find out how good it is for you and

[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:36.680]  Each year they come to us and say, Hey, so we have to pay taxes on this.
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:42.880]  You can have a couple thousand units at cost and this year was even less than that.
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:44.360]  So there's only a few hundred of these left.
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.120]  This is something you and your family need.
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  So be sure and get it.
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.160]  This is the best time to get it in full or store.com.
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:54.160]  But just putting bookends on this as a constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, someone watching this,
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:55.600]  you're saying a lot on air.
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:57.000]  You're being respectful of the court.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.440]  There's no deserving respect in my view.
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:00.440]  It's a swamp court.
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:01.440]  It's a joke.
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:03.760]  But behind the scenes, you've got a few more choice words.
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:07.480]  You warned Stone this was coming and this was political and I'm not trying to put his
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:10.440]  lawyers down, but boy, they have really, he's really in trouble.
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:13.920]  These kind of cases remind people why you have to be very aggressive and very assertive
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:15.080]  out of the gate.
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:20.640]  And it's something I have said for a long time and we created a model for it in the Wesley
[2:02:20.640 --> 2:02:21.640]  Snipes case.
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:23.960]  The reason why I always cite that to people is they say, look at what happened there.
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:26.400]  Look at what was going to happen there and look at how it changed.
[2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:31.080]  And it changed by deliberate decisions made by defense counsel that forced out into the
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:35.760]  public view what was taking place, forced the court to make adjustments, which allowed
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:39.160]  for a much fair jury selection process to take place.
[2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:41.000]  And the same thing needed to happen here.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  It did not.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:45.640]  Now, I think one of the problems in our legal system is that the people who have the best
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.720]  now, I mean, who knows more when a judge or a court is doing something that's really
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:55.280]  against the Constitution and against the rules and maybe politically biased than lawyers
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:57.600]  who are in front of judges every day.
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:03.880]  But guess who it is that the legal system tries to silence, gag, and muzzle a speech
[2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:06.760]  using the threat of revoking their licenses to do so?
[2:03:06.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  Lawyers.
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:08.760]  Lawyers.
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:12.160]  So I mean, it's something I've had a constant problem with.
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:16.560]  So in my view, we need to have more public transparency with courts.
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:20.000]  We need to have more criticism of courts when they're doing wrong.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.200]  And it needs to come from lawyers making it.
[2:03:22.200 --> 2:03:23.560]  And judges can defend themselves.
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:24.560]  They're fully equipped to do so.
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:28.640]  So society as a group, lawyers need to stop being cowards and be defenders of the people
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:33.080]  again so they'd be championed instead of little lap dogs that basically split the baby and
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:34.080]  sell you down the river.
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:37.960]  There's not anybody who I talked to in D.C. that doesn't think that the judge has a political
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:42.640]  bias in a particular direction that is manifesting itself against Roger Stone in this case.
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:47.120]  And yet not a single one of them will go up and say that on any sort of public stage if
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:48.120]  they happen to be a lawyer.
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:51.760]  And the state is marching everyone to her.
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  Yeah.
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:53.760]  Yes.
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:56.480]  The first thing I knew was it was manipulation of judicial selection.
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:00.120]  Had I been Roger Stone's counsel, one of my first motions would have been moved to transfer
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  venue.
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:05.440]  Another one would have been moved to recuse the court because they manipulated how they
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:08.880]  brought the charges to claim there was a related charge to get it in front of their
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:09.880]  desire.
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:10.880]  I've been proven wrong.
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:12.080]  And to me, that's not supposed to happen.
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:16.120]  We're supposed to have impartial selection of judges, supposed to be random selection,
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:17.280]  random assignment of cases.
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:23.040]  But meanwhile, the first juror called is the former head of the Office of Budget Management,
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:25.600]  we are the former deputy director of it.
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:29.440]  Her husband works on the Mueller probe and it's, we're not supposed to tell you her name.
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:31.160]  Even though there's no law, they're threatening everyone.
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:36.520]  Well, we just told you because we're Americans and all this kissing ass and being cowards
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:38.120]  has got us in a bad position.
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:41.560]  What made America great was doing the right thing and being strong and not being a bunch
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:42.560]  of damn cowards.
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:45.600]  We salute Robert Barnes for not being a damn coward.
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:51.800]  Oh, and Shroyer from the trial straight ahead, unbelievable that they get away with this.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:56.640]  These countries have a lot of trouble.
[2:04:56.640 --> 2:05:00.040]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[2:05:00.040 --> 2:05:06.520]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:08.200]  will like different formulas.
[2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:10.760]  It's just that simple.
[2:05:10.760 --> 2:05:15.800]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:20.440]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:21.440]  Get both.
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:27.160]  It's great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:29.240]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:30.480]  That's why I harp on it.
[2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:34.800]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[2:05:34.800 --> 2:05:36.840]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish.
[2:05:36.840 --> 2:05:37.960]  You don't live as long.
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:38.960]  It's simple.
[2:05:38.960 --> 2:05:43.600]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war.
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:44.600]  infowarstore.com.
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:48.080]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:50.000]  It's the iodine challenge.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  Five types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:31.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're now into the third hour and I've spent most of the show
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:37.720]  not on Jeffrey Epstein and the number one meme in the world for multiple days straight,
[2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:41.520]  hashtag Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[2:06:41.520 --> 2:06:42.520]  We're going to create a new one.
[2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:47.640]  Jeffrey Epstein was murdered and now it's coming out that ABC News covered it all up.
[2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:49.520]  We're going to get more into that coming up.
[2:06:49.520 --> 2:06:53.480]  We're going to get into these poor American citizens, including a bunch of children murdered
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:59.080]  in Mexico and how this is awakening people and Joe Scowze is joining us.
[2:06:59.080 --> 2:07:03.480]  We're getting on shore on the line right now from the Roger Stone trial, but I've spent
[2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:10.640]  about an hour and a half the last two hours on the media saying you'll be arrested if you
[2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:16.120]  tell anybody who these jurors are that the judge is telling Stone's lawyers you can't
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:21.080]  challenge, well, they should be able to challenge that and when you learn it's a bunch of Obama
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:25.040]  officials high level and their husbands are, you know, working with a Mueller probe, it's
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:26.040]  like what?
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:28.560]  Again, just have Hillary Clinton as a juror.
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:31.360]  Oh, don't give the identity of Hillary Clinton.
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:33.640]  Oh, don't say who the whistleblower is.
[2:07:33.640 --> 2:07:37.000]  It turns out it's another third party person who heard nothing and who they've already
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  testified.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:43.080]  They're just recycling people calling and whistleblowers that are telling these fibs so that they have
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:47.160]  credibility like calling a bunch of made-up opposition research, a dossier.
[2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:53.240]  So we're going to lay this out here in just a moment, but we have the fact that the deep
[2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:57.160]  state has killed so many people in the Clinton death count.
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:01.280]  It's all just hiding in plain view and there it is and we're supposed to just ignore its
[2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:06.920]  standing there right beside us and just hope it passes over us if we deny it exists.
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:11.120]  Well, we're here breaking the taboo as an exercising pre-speech.
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:15.000]  You just read the Supreme Court ruling, there's many of them at the last one in the 80s that
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.400]  of course you expose who jurors are so that they're open.
[2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:22.760]  There's like a judge's background or lawyer's background or the people that are there are
[2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:24.920]  public.
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:27.360]  But now they want it all to be secret.
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:30.280]  We're going to be talking about that a lot more in just a moment.
[2:08:30.280 --> 2:08:36.520]  You know, speaking of the grim reaper, DNA Force Plus, ladies and gentlemen, is the closest
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:42.360]  thing to what you're going to find out there that's the fountain of youth.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:49.840]  In fact, I would kind of say that it is the opposite, ladies and gentlemen, of this old
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:50.840]  guy.
[2:08:50.840 --> 2:08:54.520]  Now, you know, they actually say the angel of death sent by God that the devil doesn't
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:55.520]  control the angel of death.
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:00.760]  And if you put the red blood of the lambs there, I guess that's Passover, that the angel
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:05.800]  of death will pass over your house when it goes after Pharaoh and the corrupt establishment
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:10.920]  that was about to be dealt with by God, because Pharaoh was demanding the firstborn son of
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:17.560]  every Israelite as a Malachian sacrifice.
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  So there wouldn't be leadership.
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:22.720]  There wouldn't be anyone to resist the crown.
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:28.200]  The boys were attacked by drag queen storytime and the prozac and the Ritalin and the attack
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:30.200]  on boys.
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:35.160]  As was in the past, as is again today, things just repeat themselves as above so below.
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:41.820]  And seriously, DNA Force Plus back in stock 50% off and it doesn't grow your telomeres.
[2:09:41.820 --> 2:09:44.800]  It makes them last longer, which is the same thing.
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:48.440]  You know, a carburetor gets you more gas mileage.
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:49.440]  Does it produce more gas?
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:53.320]  Well, if you're only getting 15 miles per gallon, but a better carburetor gives you 20
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:56.800]  miles, it isn't making more gas in the tank, but it makes it go further, which is the same
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:09:57.800]  thing.
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:00.120]  So the PQQ, the CoQ10 are certified to do that.
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:04.680]  All the other ingredients turbocharged that make it more accessible into the cells.
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:07.240]  And that's what DNA Force Plus was all about.
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:10.960]  But the reason I brought up the Grim Reaper is Epstein, we're going to be getting into
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:14.720]  that more here in just a few minutes and now this big away kidding ties into it all with
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:16.720]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, riding shotguns.
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:18.600]  But I said, you might even plug last hour.
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  I need to really plug.
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:23.000]  You said, well, can I plug, you know, can I talk about one of your products?
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.120]  And you said that was a, I think there's a bottle of it in here.
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:29.000]  That's Brain Force Plus, our new truck.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  It may bring us a bottle.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.120]  Fed it over there in my office right there, guys, please bring me a bottle of that.
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:35.680]  And you asked me what's in it and why is it so strong?
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:36.680]  Why do you like it?
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:37.680]  Yes.
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:40.560]  So the, I mean, as a general rule, I have not used supplements over most of my life.
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:45.720]  I hadn't had much effect on my body chemistry is just the way my brain is organized.
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.240]  But the, I decided to try some of the products and just curious and see what they were like.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:54.120]  And so I tried Brain Force Plus because it had sort of energy and focus components.
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.240]  And there were things I used in law school that were really effective.
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:00.400]  They later banned them because apparently they were too effective.
[2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:06.480]  And I found very, to help create acute abilities to focus at key time periods without requiring
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:10.640]  much sleep as a lawyer you occasionally have when you have trials that happens, when you
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:14.480]  have certain oral arguments that happens, certain preparation that happens.
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:17.480]  So I was trying to find something that could replicate that and been unsuccessful doing
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  so.
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:20.400]  So I thought, well, I'll try Brain Force Plus, see if it works.
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:22.440]  I took it and did forgot I'd taken it.
[2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:25.280]  And about 12 hours later, I was sitting in my movie room.
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:29.200]  I was like, why is my brain like completely buzzing still boom, boom, boom, boom at sort
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:30.840]  of peak activity, peak mindset.
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:32.440]  And then realized, oh, I took it.
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:34.800]  And I was like, wow, and it works fantastically.
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:36.520]  Now I take it every single day.
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:37.920]  And so yeah, that's what I was curious about.
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:41.840]  What is it that goes into it that gives it that capability that no other product that
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:44.280]  I've tried has had that same success?
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:45.280]  Absolutely.
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:48.840]  And the crew's running around wildly for it, wanting to find it.
[2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:51.680]  We had it all over there on that desk a few weeks ago.
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:55.160]  And I said, you know, put this in the conference room because I want to really have it and
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:56.160]  talk about it.
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:11:57.160]  I've got some of my car.
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:01.400]  And it was never in the conference room, it just went like, hey, where'd all the supplements
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:02.400]  go?
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:03.720]  And it was like, you're muted triangle.
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:08.600]  So wherever 20 boxes of it all went, it was there and it just hype because I should have
[2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:10.600]  said, do not put it in the conference room.
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  But you know, it doesn't matter.
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:12.600]  It's gone now.
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:13.600]  We'll get some more.
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:18.800]  But the issue here is that DNA Force Plus really is amazing.
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:25.240]  So let me tell you some of the things that are in DNA Force and that are in Rain Force
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:32.320]  Plus, ladies and gentlemen, because Brain Force Plus has a copa herb extract traditionally
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:40.320]  used as an independent, important neurological tonic and cognitive enhancer.
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:46.040]  Also Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers choline, a water soluble
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:48.320]  essential nutrient across the blood brain barrier.
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:53.560]  So it helps carry the stuff across your bimate leaf powder is well known to be high quality,
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:56.400]  you know, long lasting form of caffeine.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:00.040]  And then it's got a whole bunch of other known compounds that are important chemical that
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:03.920]  responsible for the number of functions with the body.
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:08.320]  And then it goes on known for maintenance of the cell structure in the brain, L-theanine,
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:16.600]  an amino acid that's also a key component of green tea L-theanine transplant nerve impulses
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:17.880]  to the brain.
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:22.680]  Also vitamin B12 promotes energy production through promoting the body's natural process
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:26.640]  of adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and many others.
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:31.280]  Black pepper fruit extract taken from the pepper nitrate fruit.
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:35.080]  Black pepper has been used since Antiquity is a form of traditional medicine and was
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:39.680]  chosen by chemists to give Brain Force Plus an extra kick and a lot of other things.
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:41.400]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:47.680]  All these things synergistically together, turbocharged in a natural, healthy, good way,
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:50.920]  we could make a brain pill way stronger with stimulant and you're like, well, this is great,
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:51.920]  but it doesn't work in two hours.
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  You have a hangover.
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:56.160]  But folks like about Brain Force Plus is it doesn't do the hangover.
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:00.360]  So we went out and looked at some of the top formulas, made it stronger, cut the price massively.
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:04.280]  It's still 50% off, double patriotic points, free shipping on this.
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:07.160]  But this special is going to have to end 1995.
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:11.400]  There's leading brands that are very similar that are sold for $60, $70 when they discount
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:12.400]  them.
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:13.400]  They're, you know, 30 bucks.
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:15.760]  That's because most people mark stuff up five to seven times.
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:20.960]  We only market up 150%, then when we discount it, we're making like 50%, but to sell a lot
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:21.960]  of it.
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:27.280]  But it does fund or operation in full or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:28.280]  three, nine.
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:33.320]  And in the past, they had a 99% rating or highest, but the left ran big articles and
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:41.200]  big national stories and shows on comedy central HBO vice saying, go to his site, downvote
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:42.360]  his products.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:43.360]  That will stop him.
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:45.120]  You've seen the lawsuits, the attacks.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:48.280]  And so they were able to downvote it because these are, you know, public systems.
[2:14:48.280 --> 2:14:50.160]  They do this to 92%.
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:52.080]  So it really, really pisses them off.
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:53.080]  When you do that, you support us.
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:55.560]  And I've ended up doing a long extended plug.
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:14:57.520]  But again, folks found a bottle of it here.
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:01.880]  We don't do an ad where they had comedy central show up and attack my supplements in DC and
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:03.160]  they go, Oh, where's your brain for so?
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:04.400]  Oh, we have a bottle right here.
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:06.160]  It's actually had some of my backpack.
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.520]  I take it as we're dumping it on top of the guy's head as a big joke.
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  Yeah.
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:12.120]  And then he lied and said he took it and then hurt him or whatever.
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.560]  It's just something a fantastic product.
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:17.360]  And the best things that it avoided is usually every other product I had tried was either
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.360]  too much of a stimulant or didn't produce the necessary stimulant effect.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:23.720]  And this had the perfect balance.
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:27.080]  I remember researching all those things and I looked at the sub at the list of ingredients
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:28.080]  because I was intrigued.
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:30.200]  But it's a fantastic product works.
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:31.200]  Works great.
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:32.200]  It's just a great product for people to have.
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:33.200]  All right.
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:34.200]  Absolutely.
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:35.200]  Thank you.
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:36.200]  I'm done plugging me to an extended plug there.
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:37.200]  That's how we find ourselves.
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:38.200]  They're great products.
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:39.200]  Thank you for liking the product, Bob.

[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:17.520]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:32.840]  Amy Berman Jackson thought it was fine yesterday to say that Sylvia Burwell could be the first
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:39.480]  juror pick over the objections of Roger Stone's lawyers, even though she headed up a major
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:43.080]  department for Obama, was brought in by the Clintons and her husband works on the Russia
[2:20:43.080 --> 2:20:45.600]  Gate hoax at the Justice Department.
[2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:46.600]  Wow.
[2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:50.800]  I think people really think we're just going to sit here and go along with this and not
[2:20:50.800 --> 2:20:51.800]  speak out against it.
[2:20:51.800 --> 2:20:57.920]  Then the media is like, Jones is talking about it, arrest him when just a few years ago,
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:02.760]  the press always wanted to talk about jurors and is this a conflict and why is the judge
[2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:03.760]  doing this?
[2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:04.760]  But now, oh, there's the judge.
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:09.320]  She kind of looks like the older sister of the Obama juror.
[2:21:09.320 --> 2:21:10.320]  Yeah.
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:11.320]  She does.
[2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:13.480]  There is an eerie physical similarity.
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:14.960]  And I think there probably is a mindset.
[2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:20.560]  I mean, she's an Obama appointee, comes from the professional class, and that group of
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:24.560]  people demographically have a lot of shared political perspectives.
[2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:27.000]  And it's not one that's favorable to...
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.480]  If you did jury selection, that demographic would be the group you would not want on the
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:32.480]  Rogers...
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.360]  Is it that there's such followers that Democrats are openly embracing lying and corruptions?
[2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:39.920]  They go, oh, because the Republicans are so good at it, we've got to do it.
[2:21:39.920 --> 2:21:43.760]  Is it that they're followers, they're all doing it so openly now, or were they always
[2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:45.640]  like that, and now they're just doubling down?
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:46.640]  It's...
[2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:49.960]  I mean, I started seeing it in law school, amongst the left, the devolution of the rule
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:53.120]  of law, to where there's one rule of law for conservatives, a different rule of law
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:56.640]  for liberals, one rule of law for people that are powerful and connected, a different rule
[2:21:56.640 --> 2:21:58.200]  of law for those that are not.
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:21:59.200]  And it's a...
[2:21:59.200 --> 2:22:01.320]  They celebrate the rule of power more than the rule of law.
[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:06.160]  And again, the 80 juror's perspective, she throws the two Republicans off, but says
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:07.160]  any Democrats fine.
[2:22:07.160 --> 2:22:09.680]  No, the 82 is a ridiculous number, in my view.
[2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:14.560]  Now, it is commonplace for the courts to only do that many, but in a high-profile, politicized
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:18.040]  case like this, they needed to have written juror questionnaires.
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:20.760]  They needed to go out to hundreds of potential jurors.
[2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:22.760]  That was an inadequate jury pool to process their jurors.
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:26.600]  Bob, what's the chances of the first one that comes up being this woman and her husband
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:27.600]  is on the Mueller probe?
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:28.600]  Give me a break.
[2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:30.880]  It needs to be investigated.
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:31.880]  There does need to be an investigation.
[2:22:31.880 --> 2:22:33.520]  You don't think she really got a jury summits?
[2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:34.520]  Oh, it could be.
[2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:35.520]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:36.520]  Because it's...
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:37.520]  Sure.
[2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:40.800]  So the passports of two of the hotjackers unburned were found on the ground.
[2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:43.520]  Well, I mean, I think the problem was, this was from the get-go.
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:46.760]  The jury pool was a 92% Hillary jury pool.
[2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:51.120]  I mean, people were...some people were thinking that reflected racial demographics and strong
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:52.680]  African-American support for Hillary.
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:53.800]  It did not.
[2:22:53.800 --> 2:22:57.480]  That was from the white voters of D.C., where 90% pro-Hillary.
[2:22:57.480 --> 2:22:58.480]  It is literally...
[2:22:58.480 --> 2:22:59.480]  Absolutely.
[2:22:59.480 --> 2:23:03.320]  We're going to go to Owen Schreuer in front of the gallows that they've got set up there,
[2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:04.320]  the federal courthouse.
[2:23:04.320 --> 2:23:05.520]  They've got the gallows being built up front.
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:08.200]  You see Hillary's going in, she's now a juror.
[2:23:08.200 --> 2:23:11.360]  We're told there's more big Democrats seriously that were just picked today.
[2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:15.360]  Owen's going to tell us, we've got the grim reaper here with us on TV because I wanted
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:17.240]  to have that here for Epstein coverage.
[2:23:17.240 --> 2:23:19.040]  No one's buying that he killed himself.
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:21.120]  We're going to find out where that's going.
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:24.120]  But, Owen, what on earth have you seen today?
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:26.920]  Suddenly, reporters, I was going to have on a roll, scared to come on.
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:30.080]  They said the judge has been, quote, going crazy in there.
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:31.080]  What's happening?
[2:23:31.080 --> 2:23:33.880]  Well, we've got reporters inside right now, Alex.
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:38.320]  So when this is closed for the day, we're going to have them discussing this.
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:41.840]  Obviously, we'll have those reports at infowars.com and banned on video.
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:44.160]  They are still live right now inside the courtroom.
[2:23:44.160 --> 2:23:48.280]  But, Alex, I want to say something that I think you'll appreciate here to kind of give
[2:23:48.280 --> 2:23:50.640]  a little more clarity to this issue that you just brought up.
[2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:54.480]  And then I have a legal question for the jury selection for Bob Barnes.
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:24:02.680]  But, Alex, you see all the people upset that you would dare bring up this juror's information,
[2:24:02.680 --> 2:24:09.440]  that you would dare challenge the power of the almighty Amy Berman Jackson, the untouchable.
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:14.160]  And believe me, she's up there with a smug smirk on her face, laughing the entire time
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.240]  we were in that courtroom, just observing the scenes.
[2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:20.960]  And I'll be honest, Alex, it was everything I could do not to rise up and start shouting
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:21.960]  these people down.
[2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:22.960]  But I maintain my emotion.
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:25.000]  So you're saying she's as happy as a pig and poop?
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.880]  Oh, she's very, very smug up there.
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:29.880]  And I think I know why.
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:31.120]  But, Alex, I want to say something.
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:34.640]  I think it'll help add clarity what you're trying to express here.
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:40.400]  You see, let's say that they write every rule in the book saying that you don't get free
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:43.680]  speech and you can't talk about a jury for whatever reason.
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:44.680]  They write it in the law.
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:46.800]  Okay, so, well, wait a second.
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:50.720]  The real lawlessness happening right here is what happened to Roger Stone.
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:53.560]  The real lawlessness happening here is what's happening to Donald Trump.
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:56.320]  The real lawlessness is this show trial.
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:00.400]  That's the lawlessness, not Alex Jones reporting on a juror.
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:01.560]  That's nothing.
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:02.720]  That's free speech.
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:03.720]  That's truth.
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:06.600]  So, this is kind of like the Tommy Robinson thing.
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:07.840]  Here, come here and say that, sir.
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:08.840]  Come say that to my face.
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:09.840]  You coward.
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:10.840]  You're a coward.
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:11.840]  Get out of here.
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:12.840]  You fascist coward.
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:13.840]  You Nazi.
[2:25:13.840 --> 2:25:14.840]  You're a Nazi coward.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:16.760]  Get out of America, you Nazi coward.
[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:18.400]  Yeah, you won't come talk to me.
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:19.400]  You punk.
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:20.400]  Get out of my face.
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:21.400]  Sorry, Alex.
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:23.280]  You had a guy shouting me down out here.
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:24.280]  Punk coward.
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:25.280]  What was he calling you?
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:26.280]  A Russian?
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:27.280]  Other made up crowd.
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:28.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:29.280]  He says how absurd I am.
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:30.280]  Not fascism.
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:31.280]  But so, Alex.
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:32.280]  So, oh, yeah.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.200]  Oh, the big crime is Alex Jones saying the name of a juror that happens to be a public
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:41.480]  person already from the Obama administration selected by the Obama appointed judge.
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:43.160]  No, that's the crime.
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:44.520]  Not reporting on that.
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:46.080]  That's like what happened to Tommy Robinson.
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:50.120]  The crime is the child rape gangs, not Tommy Robinson reporting on it.
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:54.480]  So, it's a weird microcosm here and even conservatives flip out at you, Alex.
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:55.640]  So, that's a weird thing.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:59.000]  But, you know, getting back to this jury selection, I want to ask you a question, Bob
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:00.760]  Barnes, our legal expert here.
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.240]  I think that I'm in agreement with Alex here.
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:10.080]  I think that this judge selected from Obama's administration was literally, they put her
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:11.080]  there to assure.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:13.120]  I mean, the case is already rigged.
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  We know that.
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:15.120]  But when you...
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:17.600]  To terrorize anybody that if you support Trump will put you in prison and to show other
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:19.760]  judges how the kangarooing works.
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:21.240]  This is a big training seminar.
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:22.240]  Well...
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:24.120]  But all you need is one juror.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:25.640]  I mean, Bob, correct me if I'm wrong.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:28.320]  All you need is one juror and you control the whole case.
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:29.320]  It's over.
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:32.760]  Oh, do you mean from a judge's perspective or a defense perspective?
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:33.760]  Yes.
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:34.760]  Both.
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:37.840]  From a defense perspective, you only need one because you can...
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:39.440]  That's why it's all...
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  They'll probably have Hillary on the jury.
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:41.760]  That's why it's going to be their people.
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:43.760]  Well, that's why there's zero Republicans on that jury.
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:44.760]  I mean, the prosecution...
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:46.240]  I mean, they march in, they salute the judge.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:47.240]  We're setting him up.
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:48.240]  He will go to prison.
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:49.240]  They go, I'll hit Lodge.
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:50.240]  He goes, good.
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:51.240]  I mean, that's...
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:52.240]  Oh, I mean, it's that.
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:55.280]  In the Snipes trial, the judge basically, if anybody raised questions about the way the
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:58.440]  criminal justice system worked, he immediately excused them.
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:03.120]  If they said, oh, they had no problem with reading all these headlines of articles that
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:05.240]  would attack them, oh, he'll be a fair...
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:07.480]  You probably just read the headline, he'll be a fair juror.
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:11.720]  Sadly, what people are seeing a sneak peek of is how the federal criminal justice system
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:15.120]  operates in the Stone case and politicized cases.
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:19.760]  And unfortunately, our judiciary, going back 200 years, has failed more often than it has
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:21.480]  succeeded in these contexts.
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:26.400]  The difference is most lawyers don't get to expose it or unwilling to, and most members
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:28.120]  of the public never get to see it.
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:29.840]  And they're just witnessing live.
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:33.120]  This is what a railroaded system looks like.
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:37.280]  This feels like a partial, prejudicial jury process.
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:41.260]  Every member of the jury could sit here and be like, yep, Stone was railroaded.
[2:27:41.260 --> 2:27:42.920]  This is a show trial.
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:46.080]  This was a rig job, kangaroo court, but they've got the one juror.
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:47.080]  That's all they need.
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.960]  They now control the entire thing.
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.280]  They control the judge.
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:52.400]  They control the defense with the Democrat lawyers.
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:54.040]  Now they control the jury results.
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:57.000]  I mean, they literally have every angle covered now.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:58.960]  In political cases, that's the government's goal, sadly.
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:00.520]  I mean, it's the nature of it.
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.720]  As soon as they brought the case in DC, as soon as they, in my view, manipulated the assignment
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:10.560]  of judges so that it was not a random assignment, and it was a selected assignment for a particular
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:16.200]  judge who had already shown a proclivity to be hostile to people in this in Roger Stone's
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:20.720]  situation, how she behaved towards Manafort, how she behaved towards Gates, all kinds of
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:25.260]  unconstitutional gag orders, routinely regularly being entered, not providing meaningful, full
[2:28:25.260 --> 2:28:29.120]  scope of discovery, not suppressing any evidence that was in violation of the Fourth or Fifth
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  or Sixth Amendment rights.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:31.120]  All of it.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:35.440]  I mean, she hasn't given Roger anything, whereas she's given the government almost anything
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  they wanted.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:38.440]  I want to get other observations from Owen Schreuer.
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:39.440]  He's doing a great job.
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:43.360]  He'll be back co-hosting his own show from the ground today, three o'clock Central, the
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:47.200]  showroom, I want to get any other observations he's had when we come back, and then we've
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:50.840]  got Bill Scalzen on these Americans murdered in Mexico.
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:54.040]  He'll give us his expertise on that in Barnes's Rodgers shotgun.
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:56.760]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:29:01.200]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:05.320]  too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:06.320]  Bill Hyde here.
[2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:10.320]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:14.560]  system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:14.560 --> 2:29:18.640]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:20.160]  bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:24.120]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:27.760]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:32.080]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:32.080 --> 2:29:33.440]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:37.720]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.920]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.000]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:48.360]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.

[2:29:55.320 --> 2:29:57.400]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:29:57.400 --> 2:30:02.800]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.480]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine,
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:12.360]  and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:13.800]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:30:13.800 --> 2:30:17.440]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:22.160]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[2:30:22.160 --> 2:30:23.160]  you said.
[2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:28.360]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality, neuroceutical grade.
[2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:32.640]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:37.640]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[2:30:37.640 --> 2:30:38.640]  you're age.
[2:30:38.640 --> 2:30:44.280]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and to know that 2 billion
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:48.680]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth
[2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:51.160]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:53.080]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[2:30:53.080 --> 2:30:56.080]  Infowars.com.
[2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:57.080]  Here's the bad news.

[2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:07.360]  So is Living Defense.

[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:14.840]  Here is the good news, ladies and gentlemen.

[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:34.040]  Get it for your family.
[2:31:34.040 --> 2:31:35.040]  You owe it to yourself.

[2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:38.320]  So please take action.
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:39.320]  Winner.

[2:31:55.560 --> 2:31:59.720]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[2:31:59.720 --> 2:32:03.240]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:08.600]  They're waging war on communication itself as a Thabian socialist promise they would
[2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:12.600]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:16.480]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:21.240]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:22.920]  Have you arrested in some areas?
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:28.920]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:30.040]  they're doing.
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:33.200]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:37.440]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:41.320]  We have a, it's OK to be OK, politically incorrect ball cap.
[2:32:41.320 --> 2:32:42.320]  It's black and white.
[2:32:42.320 --> 2:32:43.320]  Very nice.
[2:32:43.320 --> 2:32:44.320]  There's the OK symbol on it.
[2:32:44.320 --> 2:32:46.440]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:48.040]  Infowars.com is on the back.

[2:32:52.640 --> 2:32:59.640]  while having a great hat.
[2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:33.440]  Serenity will so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:38.800]  Watching the arrogance of the political class, ABC News covering up giant child trafficking
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:42.680]  rings, blackmail the Clintons, all of it coming out.
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:50.320]  Watching this judge, Jackson, let high level Obama officials whose husbands work at the
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:59.560]  Justice Department in Russiagate be the first juror picked, I mean, it's just fantastical.
[2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:00.560]  It's amazing.
[2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:03.520]  Owen Schreuer's moved another side of the federal courthouse where he's there reporting
[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:05.120]  the next few days.
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:06.760]  And I'm going to obviously have to go up there soon.
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:07.760]  This is so out of control.
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:09.960]  We've been going on for a few weeks.
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:14.960]  This miscarriage being done so publicly, the judge kicking the two Republicans out
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:19.360]  of 80 plus perspectives out immediately, but saying Democrats are OK because they're not
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:20.360]  biased.
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:25.680]  I mean, these are exercises, I believe, to show us that they're in power and they're
[2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:30.320]  going to use their judicial jurisdictions to carry out judicial tyranny.
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:32.040]  That's my view on this.
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:34.720]  But Owen, I know Rodgers doesn't feel well.
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:35.720]  That was real to me.
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:36.720]  So that was fake.
[2:34:36.720 --> 2:34:37.720]  They got sick.
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:38.720]  And we've got all this other craziness going on.
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:40.280]  What are other observations?
[2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:46.280]  Well, Alex, I think that we pretty much know what's going on with this court case.
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:49.600]  And it's sad to have to admit how rigged it is.
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:54.600]  And the I think the fate that Roger faces here, it doesn't really matter what evidence
[2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:55.600]  is presented.
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:56.600]  It doesn't really matter the history.
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:00.880]  It doesn't really matter how the whole Russian inclusion thing was fake news and really started
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:01.880]  with Hillary.
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:02.880]  None of that's going to matter.
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:04.560]  This is a rigged trial.
[2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.200]  I love Roger Stone.
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:08.640]  And I hate that to say this, but they're going to lock them up, man.
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:09.640]  I mean, it's it's decided.
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:12.800]  I mean, he'll be lucky if they give him house arrest for a couple of years.
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.680]  He may end up life in prison now.
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:18.320]  Maybe eventually there's going to be a presidential pardon for Roger to try to justify all of
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:19.320]  this.
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:20.320]  But it still can't.
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.840]  You can't justify the dereliction of justice here.
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:25.600]  You cannot justify the miscarriage of justice.
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:30.720]  But Alex, just as an observation and kind of a side note, but it's still the same thing.
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:32.240]  It's because this is how they can get away with this.
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:35.480]  You know, we were doing man on the streets down here.
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:36.640]  We've got hours of footage.
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:38.720]  Some of it is available right now.
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:41.400]  Others were going to upload later at info wars.com and banned out video.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:47.240]  Alex, it's amazing how the average, I don't even know what box I want to put them in,
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:50.400]  call it Democrat, voter, liberal, Trump, paid or whatever.
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:51.920]  It's all the same.
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:56.640]  They literally buy whatever the television tells them without even questioning it without
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:35:57.640]  even questioning.
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:02.000]  So two years ago when I went around Alex, it was Trump's Russian, Trump's Russian, Trump's
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  Russian.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:06.880]  Then then one year ago, it was Trump's groping women, women, Trump.
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:09.000]  Now it's Trump, Ukraine, Trump, Ukraine.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:15.200]  They just jump to whatever stone pun not intended that the media puts out on there, out there
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.560]  for them to land on.
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:18.720]  And then when you try to get them to explain it, they can't do it.
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:23.420]  So the only way they're able to get away with this rigged trial is because the television
[2:36:23.420 --> 2:36:25.560]  media is complicit.
[2:36:25.560 --> 2:36:28.720]  They're the ones putting all the propaganda out there so that the American people can't
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:31.520]  see the real story and they get totally deceived.
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:35.240]  People walking up to me like, oh, it's just a matter of fact, Trump colluded with Ukraine
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:36.240]  now.
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:37.240]  Oh, it's just matter of fact.
[2:36:37.240 --> 2:36:42.120]  And like we said, literally, people testifying have been the so-called whistleblowers.
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:44.720]  They just never wanted to be the person that supposedly triggered it all.
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:47.280]  Now they pick some junior staffer to do it to.
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:48.280]  It's amazing.
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:49.280]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[2:36:49.280 --> 2:36:50.280]  You'll be hosting, co-hosting your show.
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:55.320]  If I can just make one final point here, let's keep in mind the timing of the ABC
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:59.040]  Barry of the Epstein story that was right before the 2016 election.
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:01.680]  They buried that story to save Hillary Clinton.
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:03.440]  That does it for me on the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:07.440]  Bring it into the war room at 3 p.m. central, banned out video.
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.440]  All right.
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:09.440]  Great job, Owen.
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:10.440]  Thank you.
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:16.040]  I want to bring in here now Joe Scalzen, who heads up worldaffairsbrief.com, he's editor
[2:37:16.040 --> 2:37:22.760]  of that, former Marine Corps Naval Aviator and bestselling author, researcher, to get
[2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:25.160]  into the current war of the state that's happening.
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:32.840]  And then also, he is, I would say, a church expert on the Latter-day Saints and what's
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:38.640]  happened down in Mexico with those missionaries being killed and what we're being told there.
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:40.840]  And we've got Robert Barnes riding shotgun.
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:44.080]  Joe Scalzen, what do you want to tackle first?
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:52.040]  Well, let's cover the Mexican tragedy, what we do know about it.
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:55.440]  This I don't believe had anything to do with mistaken identity.
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:38:01.440]  I mean, this was a car, a couple of cars with three women and their children that got
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:08.520]  massacred by the drug cartels with automatic weapons.
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:12.480]  Some of the news has pointed out that these, you know, my first question, what are these
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.840]  U.S. citizens living permanently in Mexico, in Mexico isn't safe, especially in these
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:20.240]  northern territories where the drug cartels are very strong.
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:25.720]  But these are Mormon, ex-Mormon fundamentalists, which believe in practicing polygamy.
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:29.800]  And they've gone to Mexico to avoid prosecution.
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.640]  And, you know, they're very peaceable people, very, very good people.
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:39.920]  In fact, they're more conservative as a percentage than most mainstream Mormons in general.
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:44.960]  So it's a very sad tragedy that they would be killed in such a brutal manner.
[2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:49.640]  And I don't think the Mexican government's got a chance of finding out who did this.
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:55.280]  They're relatively incapable of taking down the cartels because the Mexican and the U.S.
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:00.360]  government secretly support the, at least the favorite cartel, the Sinaloa cartel, which
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:06.800]  has the permission to run drugs through official Mexican channels.
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:11.840]  Trucks are sealed on the Mexican border and allowed to go through without customs because
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:15.320]  they've been sealed on the Mexican side and they're full of drugs.
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:20.440]  And undoubtedly Mexico is entering the most violent phase ever in its 10-year collapse.
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:24.280]  It's not collapsing into the U.S. The media's been trying to cover up all the murders and
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:27.160]  things happening on the Texas side, Arizona side.
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:28.160]  But that's not working.
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:33.560]  Can you give us your take on why things are deteriorating so quickly in Mexico?
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:39.240]  Well, the drug trade is still extremely lucrative and the Sinaloa cartel, the favorite cartel
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:43.320]  of the CIA and the Mexican government, has a lot of competition that keeps rising.
[2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:49.640]  And that's why these drug wars are so dangerous and out of control.
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:55.440]  They're not going to slow down as long as the United States keeps importing drugs.
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:57.400]  There's going to be competition for that.
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:01.320]  And of course, you know about Operation Fast and Furious and all the automatic weapons
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:04.440]  that the United States gave to the Sinaloa cartel down there.
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:10.440]  A lot of that's circulated around tremendous amount of illegal weaponry in Mexico.
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:12.480]  It can be shut down, as Trump said.
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:15.720]  It's got to be a major military operation, though.
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:22.160]  And again, obviously, it's not crossfire with precision killing everybody in the cars, burning
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:23.160]  them.
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:28.040]  I mean, they were exterminated as a message, will kill women and children.
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:31.640]  And from I've seen documentaries about what's happening in Mexico with some of the Mormons
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:37.480]  that live down there and some of those towns, they've been refusing to pay kickbacks to
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:41.960]  the local cartels and also have gotten guns illegally.
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:44.240]  And some law and order has actually been established in those areas.
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:45.840]  There's documentaries on that.
[2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:50.280]  And I've tried to research as I haven't found out, but I suspect that they weren't bound
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:51.280]  to the cartels.
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:54.880]  So they waited until the women and children were alone to send a message, a very cowardly
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:40:55.880]  message.
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:58.000]  Yeah, that's very, very possible.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:06.080]  And even during the Mexican Revolution, the Mormons were targeted by Pancho Villa and
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:07.960]  his guerrillas.
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:13.960]  And their weapons were confiscated, and a lot of them left Mexico and then came back.
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:18.560]  One of the saddest things about it is that these Mormon fundamentalists are persecuted
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:20.120]  by our own government.
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:25.960]  I mean, who allows gay marriage, and yet you have perfectly consensual marriage among
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:29.280]  people who want to be married to more than one woman.
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:33.160]  And it's very sad that these people have to be driven out of the United States when we
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:38.760]  allow deviant forms of marriage all over the United States and are pushing for adoption
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:39.960]  from these people.
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:40.960]  It's a real double standard.
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:45.840]  Well, they're pushing being able to marry a dog or a pig.
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:51.440]  Yes, the world is really getting crazy, Alex.
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:52.440]  Let's shift gears then.
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:56.040]  I want to get Barnes to take on this too, but where you see this Epstein bombshell going
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:41:57.040]  on.
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:41:59.880]  Everybody overuses the word bombshell, but everybody on the streets bringing it up.
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:02.360]  People honking me when I'm walking in the grocery, Alex, you're right about Epstein.
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.600]  They're going down.
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:06.600]  I mean, it's every, you can't open an email, a feed up.
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:12.360]  It's everywhere, people are getting it on to, you know, airport announcements of Jeffrey
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:14.400]  Epstein was murdered announcement.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:16.320]  Please come to the parking lot.
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:20.560]  People are finding people are getting on Walmart, paging Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, paging
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:22.520]  Jeffrey Epstein Incubus suicide.
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:24.640]  It's just everywhere showing people power.
[2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:26.040]  Where is this going?
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:30.720]  What is the deep state going to do the whole fake whistleblower now exposed by Breitbart?
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:35.400]  All of it straight ahead info wars.com news wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:36.400]  And let me tell you.
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:39.120]  Oh, and Troyer's really wound up and he's on target.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:43.200]  Can't wait to be watching the war room coming up today, 3pm central.
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:46.880]  And we got Mike Adams hosting the fourth hour today as well.
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:47.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:48.880]  Stay with us.
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:43:00.080]  The Alex Jones show a few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:04.760]  her digital textbook and she said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table.
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:09.320]  And I clicked on iodine and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:12.720]  retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:14.560]  That's what you say all the time.
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:16.800]  But I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true.
[2:43:16.800 --> 2:43:21.880]  But dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:26.760]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take a high quality, neuroceutical grade
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:30.240]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant.
[2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:31.240]  It's why you're so alive.
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:36.560]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:37.560]  you're age.
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:40.880]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:46.880]  And I know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:49.760]  on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.080]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:53.960]  Infowars.com.
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:58.320]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:00.200]  I don't care what your views are.
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:03.440]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:04.440]  That's important.
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:05.760]  But we have something in common.
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:09.880]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:15.400]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:17.040]  to Congress in the world.
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:21.680]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:22.680]  indicted.
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:27.280]  But word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:31.320]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:35.600]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[2:44:35.600 --> 2:44:37.480]  Not so fast, criminal.
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:41.440]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:46.160]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:51.040]  But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at Infowars.com,
[2:44:51.040 --> 2:44:55.560]  NewsWars.com and Band.Video.
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:59.720]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:03.240]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[2:45:03.240 --> 2:45:08.600]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:12.760]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:16.480]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:21.240]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:22.920]  have you arrested in some areas?
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:28.200]  Have you do the okay symbol that's the international sign language symbol for okay?
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:30.080]  They know what they're doing.
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:33.240]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:37.480]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:41.400]  We have a, it's okay to be okay, politically incorrect, ball cap.
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:42.400]  It's black and white.
[2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  Very nice.
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:44.400]  There's the okay symbol on it.
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:46.400]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:48.120]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:52.800]  Get yours today at InfowarsStore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars.com.
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:55.560]  All having a great hat.
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:45:57.720]  All of our bodies are different.
[2:45:57.720 --> 2:46:00.600]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:03.600]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:07.040]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:10.400]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:18.040]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:19.320]  completely changes.
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:20.320]  I'm healthier.
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:21.320]  I have more energy.
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:22.320]  I lose weight.
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:23.320]  I look better.
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:24.320]  Everybody notices.
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:31.840]  Two months ago, I said on here, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[2:46:31.840 --> 2:46:37.040]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from Infowars Life.
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:42.000]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:47.880]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[2:46:47.880 --> 2:46:48.880]  Check it out.
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:49.880]  There's nothing else like it.
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:52.920]  It's going to be 100% off right now, the cells about to end.
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:58.160]  Cutfusion, importstore.com.
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:27.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:32.040]  Well, the mainstream media said, do not release her name.
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:33.720]  It's intimidation of jurors.
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:34.880]  That's not what we're doing.
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:41.160]  But if they say at Hillary Clinton on the jury for Roger Stone, you'd say we were all
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:44.640]  in danger of having a fair court thrown out the window.
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.680]  Well, the story just went live on Infowars.com.
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:57.360]  Infowars releases name of Obama official chosen for Roger Stone jury.
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:02.240]  And it turns out she headed up health and human services on top of it.
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:07.800]  So this is the only woman that was ever in that position that Politico and the Washington
[2:48:07.800 --> 2:48:13.200]  Post reported as the head spokesperson for office of budget management and the only woman
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:17.200]  who had a husband in the Justice Department working in the Mueller probe.
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:19.680]  And so nobody else will release it.
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:24.360]  That appears to be who it is with about 99% probability.
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:32.240]  And it just is a joke, especially when the judge out of the prospective jury threw Republicans
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:37.680]  off but says, and said reportedly according to the Washington Post and Reuters to the
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:41.720]  woman, oh, well, can you be somebody that's not biased?
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:44.240]  She goes, oh, I don't have a view, any of you on this at all.
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:48.640]  Oh, you just are magically the first person we call up and magically right before we go.
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:52.480]  Oh, by the way, if somebody's political, they can still be in here, but then Republicans
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:53.480]  can't.
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:56.960]  And so I'm going to take Joel Scowles in the world of First Brief.com, the editor.
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:00.120]  I love his take on this and in yours, Barnes.
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:01.880]  Just how they think they're going to get away with this.
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:03.440]  And then Mike Adams is coming up.
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:04.800]  He always breaks huge news.
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:07.480]  But I heard about this yesterday, Watson covered it.
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:10.200]  I saw the report, but I didn't even cover it.
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:11.200]  Well, he did.
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:12.840]  And then he found a bigger paper.
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:13.840]  Okay.
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:14.840]  That is not broken yet.
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:15.840]  He's going to break it next hour.
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:16.840]  Eco genocide.
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:22.440]  11,000 scientists signed order demanding globalists eliminate billions of humans from the earth.
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:23.920]  And it starts with the West.
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:26.760]  Yes, folks, devilish indeed.
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:27.760]  That's all coming up.
[2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:35.280]  And then a new paper is out on 5G triggering mental illness, not just brain tumors and
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:38.120]  even LA Times admits it kills rats.
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:40.280]  Here's the new paper.
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:51.680]  Wi-Fi, an important threat to human health and top scientific studies on the higher levels
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:56.200]  of a chemical in the brain with direct studies to mental illness.
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:49:59.840]  Well, they told us in the Kingsman, you get the Wi-Fi, you start killing each other.
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:01.760]  So they really are up to something.
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:04.840]  But going back to Joe Scowles in the world of first brief, Joe, what would you call
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:10.440]  this period of political time, the Epstein thing, Stone's trial, the Democrats are organized,
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:11.720]  trampling all due process.
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:14.160]  It seems like it's part of a plan.
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:16.800]  Well, the plan is not new.
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:20.280]  It's been around for years and that's what the deep state's all about.
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:25.000]  It's about suppressing our liberty, flooding the country with the aliens, getting us into
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:29.440]  a global government with war, we're just still coming up.
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:31.800]  It's just come out in the open because of Donald Trump.
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:33.400]  I mean, they don't have to hide it.
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:34.400]  They can't hide it.
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:38.280]  They've got to come out the open to stop him and we're seeing all kinds of machinations.
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:44.160]  For example, this impeachment inquiry, we found out this week why, in fact, these hearings
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:50.200]  were held with Adam Schipp of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, Mark Meadows and Jim
[2:50:50.200 --> 2:50:58.440]  Jordan challenged him in the hearing before the former Ukrainian ambassador had her, quote,
[2:50:58.440 --> 2:51:00.440]  deposition.
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:04.760]  Under what House rule are you allowed in the Senate Intelligence Committee to hold these
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:07.520]  hearings about foreign policy?
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:13.000]  And Schipp came back and said, I'm not going to take any dilatory questions as if this
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:16.160]  was just wasting our time.
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:21.920]  And he began to proceed with the hearing and Meadows said, point of order, point of order.
[2:51:21.920 --> 2:51:24.200]  And he said, I won't take any dilatory comments.
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:30.400]  He said, you know the rules, a point of order requires that you stop and handle the point
[2:51:30.400 --> 2:51:31.400]  of order.
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:33.280]  So Schipp says, OK, what is your point of order?
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:37.400]  He says, I want you to tell us under what rule?
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:41.880]  And you have authority to hold these hearings under the deposition rule.
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:46.800]  And Meadows shot back and said, rule number 11, and it doesn't cover anything like this.
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:51.880]  And Adam Schipp just went on, well, the real reason why Schipp and the Intelligence Committee
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:55.600]  were handling it is so that they could do it in secret.
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:59.520]  If this was the Foreign Affairs Committee, they couldn't do it in secret.
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:04.600]  Only the Intelligence Committee has the ability to claim national security and secrecy.
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:10.040]  And that's why they're holding it in the skiff in the big soundproof bubble.
[2:52:10.040 --> 2:52:11.040]  That's right.
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:14.720]  And they wouldn't have been able to justify that if it had not been Adam Schipp in the
[2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:15.720]  Intelligence Committee.
[2:52:15.720 --> 2:52:18.000]  And it's a legal as hell, Alex.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:22.880]  They have no authority to be holding this hearing on a foreign policy issue in the Intelligence
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:23.880]  Committee.
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:26.000]  And isn't that impeachable for Schipp?
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.920]  Well, you know, who runs the impeachment?
[2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:30.920]  Sure.
[2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:36.040]  But speaking of impeachability, let's look at the actual general Trump charges.
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:40.160]  They're trying to get, and they're going to get, some form of evidence of quick pro quo.
[2:52:40.160 --> 2:52:41.160]  All right.
[2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:43.760]  The point is, is that illegal?
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:46.440]  It actually isn't illegal.
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:49.760]  They're making it illegal because it is purely political, they say, because-
[2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:50.760]  That's right.
[2:52:50.760 --> 2:52:53.640]  Kennedy said, we'll pull our missiles out of Turkey if you pull yours out of Cuba.
[2:52:53.640 --> 2:52:55.200]  I mean, that's how foreign policy works.
[2:52:55.200 --> 2:52:58.800]  It just can't be quick pro quo for your personal benefit.
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:52:59.800]  Yes.
[2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:04.040]  Well, the point is, nobody in the Democrats talks about two things.
[2:53:04.040 --> 2:53:10.860]  One, the 1999 treaty with U.S. and Ukraine, which specifically agrees that Ukraine will
[2:53:10.860 --> 2:53:14.840]  assist the United States in any corruption investigation.
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:16.160]  Nobody covers that.
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:18.640]  That makes Donald Trump, I think, illegal.
[2:53:18.640 --> 2:53:25.520]  Now, it was very interesting in the NPR last night, they were showing the rally in Ohio
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:32.080]  where Donald Trump had said, we got the video of Joe Biden admitting to a quick pro quo.
[2:53:32.080 --> 2:53:34.360]  They closed the video.
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:40.280]  This lady, Yamiche, on NPR says, before she shut off, he said, oh, by the way, there is
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:44.600]  no evidence for what Trump just said about Joe Biden.
[2:53:44.600 --> 2:53:46.880]  What do you mean no evidence?
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:47.880]  We have the videotape.
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:48.880]  It's out in public.
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:49.880]  But that's what I'm saying.
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:50.880]  You know what I mean?
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:51.880]  They're now assaulting reason.
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:54.640]  They'll show you a white card and say it's purple.
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:55.640]  What is this, Barnes?
[2:53:55.640 --> 2:53:59.920]  Well, it's a degree to which they believe they are governed by the rule of power rather
[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:00.920]  than the rule of law.
[2:54:00.920 --> 2:54:04.320]  As he's identifying, Schiff is not abiding by any of the rules that govern the internal
[2:54:04.320 --> 2:54:07.120]  processes of Congress.
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:12.720]  The Select Committee on Intelligence is solely there to supervise the intelligence community
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:17.320]  not to leverage the intelligence community to supervise the president.
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:18.880]  That's not what's supposed to be going on.
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:20.000]  This goes back to Frank Church.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  He found it deferred.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:24.280]  There was no intelligence committee, by the way, before 1976 in either Congress.
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:28.520]  It was to control the 1947 National Security Act run amok.
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:29.520]  Exactly.
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:33.360]  It was to make sure what is happening now didn't happen.
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:37.240]  And in particular, the Intelligence Committee has no business doing impeachment.
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:38.640]  That's the Judiciary Committee.
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:40.360]  If they want to investigate what happened in Ukraine...
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:43.120]  So let me ask you this, and then we're going to hold over.
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:44.120]  He says to leave soon.
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:46.760]  And we'll talk about this before Mike Adams comes on, but let me ask this.
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:48.560]  What do you think Trump and we need to do?
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:52.200]  Because the Democrats have always been lawless, but now they're full lawless.
[2:54:52.200 --> 2:54:55.440]  And I think what happened in the committee where the other people say, hey, this is
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:56.440]  over.
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  This isn't real.
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:59.800]  This is wrong and not participate in the fraud.
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:03.960]  Well, I don't know if Trump can refuse to participate.
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:08.400]  I mean, that's the point is the House is in charge of the Democrats are in charge of
[2:55:08.400 --> 2:55:12.960]  the House and got the power to do virtually anything illegal that they want.
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:15.280]  And the Republicans are calling them for it.
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:18.000]  I mean, but it didn't make the news.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  And that's the problem.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  We have to continue.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:25.280]  I'm going to put in the World Affairs Brief this Friday, for example, the entire scenario
[2:55:25.280 --> 2:55:31.760]  between Meadows and Jordan and Zeldin and Schiff and having and seeing him deny the legality
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:32.760]  of their claims.
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:38.280]  But you said the key, the blackout now is Congress and the real hearings, not just independent
[2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:39.280]  media.
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:40.760]  And this is ahead of the removal of Trump.
[2:55:40.760 --> 2:55:44.120]  That's why we somehow somehow have to end the censorship.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:48.000]  Because if we don't do that, Trump is leaving his butt hanging out.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  No doubt about it.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:53.720]  I mean, this is a process that's a wall, absent without leave of law, and it is completely
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:55.520]  continuing to happen.
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:57.760]  And the president's right to challenge it and contest it.
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:02.840]  I mean, he's getting the left is weaponizing every mechanism of government against the
[2:56:02.840 --> 2:56:07.680]  ordinary person and against the president for political partisan purposes without regard
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:08.680]  to the rule.
[2:56:08.680 --> 2:56:09.680]  Because they never get in trouble.
[2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:10.680]  We'll talk about it.
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:11.680]  What happens there?
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:15.840]  Joel, what's your view on the Epstein thing and Veritas and that that is really crippling
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:16.840]  them.
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:22.200]  Well, once again, you know, they're not going to give this any coverage, except on the
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:23.800]  alternative news media.
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.360]  But this shows clear that Epstein was deep state.
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:30.400]  That's the real reason why they buried this, not because Epstein was an unknown, sure he
[2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:31.400]  might have been unknown.
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:36.520]  But since when does that stop, you know, the media from, you know, picking up a very big
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:41.040]  juicy case about underage sex trafficking and things.
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:46.080]  But you know, I don't think, frankly, that we're ever going to see the the videotapes.
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:52.080]  They're not going to indict any of the co-conspirators with Epstein, who are guilty as hell of,
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:55.480]  of engaging in sexual activities with underage girls.
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:58.440]  This is part of the cover up.
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:56:59.520]  I don't know what to do.
[2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:02.920]  What I'm saying is the deep state is in control of media.
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:04.520]  They're in control of judges.
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:09.880]  They're in control of about 75% of Congress and almost the entire White House, except
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:12.560]  Donald Trump and a few key advisors.
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:15.960]  That's a pretty big stack deck, Alex.
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:16.960]  I agree.
[2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:18.960]  I think Trump is in super bad danger.
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:20.720]  People go, oh, you're attacking the president.
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:21.720]  No.
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:23.720]  They admit how much trouble the president's in.
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:24.720]  We don't have a hope.
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:29.600]  All these people just delusionally, he's ordained, he's invincible.
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:33.360]  Let us do five more minutes with Joel Scousy to take on that, and we'll do one segment
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:36.680]  of Mike Adams, but he has got the biggest 5G news ever.

[2:59:48.120 --> 3:00:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, I just want to say something we've got the
[3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:08.480]  best crew ever and I get so angry covering all this that I sometimes snap on there and
[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:09.480]  stuff has nothing to do with it.
[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:10.480]  I'm like, where's my brain for us?
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:11.480]  It was over there.
[3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:12.480]  It has nothing to do with them.
[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:16.400]  The cleaning crew puts to other places and I leave stuff around her like a pig and it's
[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:17.400]  all my fault.
[3:00:17.400 --> 3:00:23.080]  But I mean, I've got to be honest, I'm not going to evacuate the United States, but they're
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:24.680]  coming after me and Trump goes down.
[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:28.440]  They're already coming after me and to see the lawlessness and to hear from our reporters
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:34.800]  that the judge Jackson is laughing and cackling and just it is super arrogant and I'm saying
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:40.360]  really mean things to stones lawyers and just how they revel in the evil is like the added
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:42.160]  thing and it makes me really angry.
[3:00:42.160 --> 3:00:46.440]  Tell Scals that I've I mean, I've never seen you kind of I'm going to say you're hot, but
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:48.600]  I can tell you're angry as well.
[3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:51.440]  And you're saying it's he's it's illegal as hell.
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:55.240]  And as the thing just gets more and more tyrannical and more out of control.
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.400]  Where do you see all this going?
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:03.240]  Well, you know, that's one of the reasons why Alex I concentrate on trying to help people
[3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:06.120]  prepare as well as fight for your liberty.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:11.560]  And you know, I'm trying to analyze why is it that people get angry when I criticize
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:14.840]  Donald Trump on principle and they know that I'm right.
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:17.160]  They know that he's failed to do something.
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:19.160]  Why did they get angry about it?
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:25.120]  And I think the real reason as I've analyzed it is that people don't want to face failure.
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:28.280]  They don't want to face the fact that we're losing.
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:32.360]  I mean, you can only give a certain amount of hope when you're up against the deep state
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:34.360]  as deep as Donald Trump is.
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:39.200]  And the evidence shows, for example, that all his successes are just temporary.
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:43.080]  For example, stopping the climate change and not signing the accord.
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:46.680]  That doesn't go into effect until after the 2020 election when they expect to have him
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:52.080]  out of office, it'll be undone at some point by some future president.
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:58.480]  And so it delays certain things, but it is not stopping and winning the deep state.
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:05.040]  I've criticized the Q phenomenon as a false disinformation campaign to keep up conservative
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:09.800]  hopes, false hopes about draining the swamp.
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:13.840]  And Donald Trump can't drain the swamp, but he can't tell who's in the swamp and who isn't
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:14.840]  in the swamp.
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:20.840]  He has no experience in conspiracy, he has no experience in understanding the deep state.
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:25.320]  And so what I'm saying is I'm afraid people have got a false illusion of hope that we're
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:26.800]  struggling with.
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:31.800]  And that's why they get angry at you when you have occasionally criticized you.
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:36.880]  It's not because we're anti-Trump, we desperately want Trump to do what's right.
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:39.800]  He just doesn't end up doing it most of the time.
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:41.760]  And so we're losing.
[3:02:41.760 --> 3:02:46.680]  And even if he were doing it all right, we may still not be able to overcome the deep
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:47.680]  state.
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:49.000]  It is so powerful.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:55.160]  It is so evil and so powerful, and ultimately it's a satanic conspiracy, which has a great
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.120]  deal of power, a revelatory power, which directs their things, and they've got a lot in store
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:01.120]  for us.
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:05.840]  So what I'm saying is don't count everything on Donald Trump, you must prepare for the
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:10.640]  takedown, you've got to prepare for relocation, you've got to prepare for war.
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:13.320]  Those things are coming, we're not going to be able to stop them.
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:17.400]  Yeah, well, my gut's never wrong, and I think we're winning a lot of big things, a lot of
[3:03:17.400 --> 3:03:23.560]  deep states in trouble, but folks thinking we've got it in the bag is how we're going
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:24.560]  to lose.
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:25.560]  Right.
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:30.400]  I mean, people should not underestimate, as he's pointing out, the scope and scale of
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:31.400]  the opposition.
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:32.400]  This is a reminder.
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.320]  You know, Roger Stone was one of the main people that was a key Trump advocate outside
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:40.120]  of the White House, outside of institutional power, warning him about people like this
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:41.120]  fake whistleblower.
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:45.560]  They're trying to set me up with child porn, and I'm not trying to be a victim here.
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:47.560]  They've tried to take my kids away.
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:49.680]  I mean, these people are evil, folks.
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:54.480]  They have every institutional incentive to de-platform and destroy those people who are
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:58.520]  the most effective political advocates in terms of Democrats and Trump haters that are
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:02.960]  out there in the institutional press and in the political world, and within the deep state
[3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:04.160]  apparatus.
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:07.920]  And so that's what the president faces, and I think what people tend to do, even Trump
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:13.160]  summer Trump supporters, underestimate is the scale and scope of that opposition.
[3:04:13.160 --> 3:04:14.160]  That's right.
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:17.920]  Mr. Joel, come back soon and let's talk about solutions to what Trump needs to do, and is
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:19.440]  there time to turn this around?
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:24.280]  I think them seeing the impeachment officially initiated, when people thought that was impossible,
[3:04:24.280 --> 3:04:28.240]  I think losing Kentucky governorship, losing the Virginia State House, I think a lot of
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:32.960]  conservatives are finally realizing that we are in the middle rounds.
[3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:37.240]  We haven't won this fight yet.
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:40.560]  We're in deep trouble, and we need to really energize our forces.
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:41.560]  Thank you for all you do.
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:42.560]  Thank you, brother.
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:45.920]  I want to win, and I know we can win, and it's only admitting how much trouble we're
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:47.320]  in and maximum effort.
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:50.880]  Yeah, you don't win by underestimating your adversary.
[3:04:50.880 --> 3:04:54.560]  You only win by, if anything, overestimating your adversary.
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:04:58.040]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:04:58.040 --> 3:05:04.440]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[3:05:04.440 --> 3:05:06.120]  will like different formulas.
[3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:08.680]  It's just that simple.
[3:05:08.680 --> 3:05:13.320]  Verse three is the Deep Earth Crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[3:05:13.320 --> 3:05:18.400]  all three types to absorb, others like the pure atomic iodine.
[3:05:18.400 --> 3:05:19.400]  Get both.
[3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:23.680]  They're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:24.680]  or friends.
[3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:27.200]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:28.440]  That's why I harp on it.
[3:05:28.440 --> 3:05:33.960]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons, lower IQ, makes you
[3:05:33.960 --> 3:05:34.960]  sluggish.
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:35.960]  You don't live as long.
[3:05:35.960 --> 3:05:36.960]  It's simple.
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:43.360]  Buy quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the infowar, infowarstore.com.
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:46.040]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:47.960]  It's the iodine challenge.
[3:05:47.960 --> 3:06:05.440]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[3:06:05.440 --> 3:06:09.920]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report.
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:12.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:12.920 --> 3:06:25.640]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and this is a man's game, a man's world.
[3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:30.000]  Unfortunately, most men are sitting there like nothing's going on.
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:33.320]  It's all about their golf game or getting their Porsche waxed.
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:39.680]  A free open society based on liberty and independence and the individual and private
[3:06:39.680 --> 3:06:46.320]  property and the family and a Christian ethos is what allowed this wonderland for people
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:49.400]  that want to work hard and play hard.
[3:06:49.400 --> 3:06:53.400]  Like opening a door on a spaceship, all the atmosphere is going out, folks.
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:57.320]  Trump was, well, Hillary was about to come in.
[3:06:57.320 --> 3:06:58.320]  They were overestimating.
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:04.080]  They thought she was invincible, they had a huge election fraud, and Trump's landslide
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:06.080]  was so mega massive.
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:10.800]  All the internal numbers show and later came out, polls were fake, like a 15-point lead
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:19.280]  with voters or more, that their wall, their seawall of fraud was not high enough to stop
[3:07:19.280 --> 3:07:22.400]  the huge wave, but the wave barely went over.
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:26.720]  And that's why I'm saying, when I get up here and say, oh, Trump's awesome, oh, great
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:30.000]  things are happening, oh, we're going to indict them, oh, we're kicking their ass, everybody
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.720]  loves it, Lister ship explodes.
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:36.880]  And you know, that's good to be positive, and we are on one foot winning the fight.
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:41.040]  We've come from totally asleep to waking up and getting in a fight and winning a few rounds,
[3:07:41.040 --> 3:07:44.600]  but the enemy has now been roused to their full attack.
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:47.600]  And I mean, believe me, I'm not just somebody here on the internet being left alone for
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:48.600]  what I've done.
[3:07:48.600 --> 3:07:49.600]  They're coming after me.
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:50.600]  Okay.
[3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:54.280]  So I know how serious it is and I know how much scum they've got working for them and
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:07:57.920]  then them threatening everybody, all the media is being told, you don't mention who the judge
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:58.920]  is put on the jury.
[3:07:58.920 --> 3:07:59.920]  That's tampering.
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:00.920]  Oh, really?
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:01.920]  Well, put Hillary in there.
[3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:02.920]  I won't say anything.
[3:08:02.920 --> 3:08:03.920]  You put her in there.
[3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:06.720]  You know, no, we are going to tell the truth.
[3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:08.840]  This is America.
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:12.560]  And you can make the whole 300 joke about they come and say, surrender, they go, surrender.
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:15.280]  This is Sparta.
[3:08:15.280 --> 3:08:16.640]  Are we men or are we mice?
[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:19.400]  What the hell have we become, ladies and gentlemen?
[3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:23.160]  And I know our audience is hardcore and you get a lot of your pissed at Trump as he can't
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:24.160]  do more.
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:26.280]  He's completely surrounded by liars.
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:28.280]  I've got a great crew.
[3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:33.640]  I've got the best crew I've had 25 years and they bust their ass and I get exhausted.
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:34.640]  I make mistakes.
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:35.640]  I do things.
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:37.760]  A lot of the times it's, it's, it's, it's my fault.
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:38.760]  Things don't go the right way.
[3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:43.800]  But if they were just 5% against me and just halfway not doing what I said, this place
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:45.480]  would fall apart like that.
[3:08:45.480 --> 3:08:50.400]  So Trump is awesome, but he's not a miracle maker and he's surrounded by enemies.
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:51.960]  I don't know how he's done this much.
[3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:56.520]  I mean, I think if anything, he's slightly underestimated the scale and scope of his
[3:08:56.520 --> 3:08:57.520]  opposition.
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:09:02.080]  I mean, the, the, the deep state, administrative state, dual state, whatever language or lingo
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:06.800]  your phrase you want to use has grown and has entrenched itself at a completely different
[3:09:06.800 --> 3:09:12.240]  level to where they, that where you can have someone who has deep Obama ties, deep, deep
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:18.600]  state ties can go into a, a jury trial and say they have no bias in the case where in
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:20.840]  the most political trial in a hundred years.
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:21.840]  Exactly.
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.320]  But what, that doesn't sound accurate.
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:31.080]  So the, even if they mean the best, it just shows a degree of insolence, a degree of disconnectedness.
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  Insolence.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:33.080]  Exactly.
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:35.400]  And, and combined with arrogance, they are so used, I mean, when you have 30 year old
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:39.360]  kids who think they can take out the president of the United States, it tells you who've
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:42.440]  never been elected to anything in their lives.
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:46.320]  Just because they got a Yale degree, it tells you the nature of what you're dealing with.
[3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:48.600]  We're dealing with just hubris.
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:53.760]  And people who have disrespect for democracy, disrespect for the rule of law, disrespect
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:09:57.120]  for the established principles that made American freedom and liberty the uniqueness
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:09:58.120]  that it is.
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:02.680]  And that's why the president is a bulwark against all of it, but no one should underestimate
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:07.600]  the degree, the scale, the scope, the severity of the institutional opposition to-
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:12.720]  I've tried to think about that date, 362 days out.
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:13.720]  Less than a year.
[3:10:13.720 --> 3:10:18.960]  And gut level, Trump's losing right now, look, the enemy's coming at him everything they
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:19.960]  got.
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:22.600]  Because so many people are like asleep, they think everything's fine, what are they going
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:25.600]  to do when he loses that election?
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:30.120]  Or what are they going to do when they vote to remove him this December?
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:32.400]  What are you going to do?
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:35.440]  People need to be vigilant now and vigilant throughout because that's the only thing that's
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:36.440]  going to keep them alive.
[3:10:36.440 --> 3:10:40.880]  There's been past examples of populist political officials getting elected and the political
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:43.160]  establishment going after them.
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:47.760]  People ranging from Huey Long to Bookie Turner to Big Jim Folsom, all of them faced major
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.040]  efforts by the media to take them out, major impeachment efforts, major efforts to criminalize
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:55.160]  their behavior in ways that had never been considered criminal before.
[3:10:55.160 --> 3:10:59.200]  So this degree of interest, there is a roadmap and there is a template and there is a past
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:01.520]  that is prologued for what's going to happen to Trump.
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:05.720]  The key in all of those cases was that it was his audience and his base sticking with
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:09.240]  him and being vigilant and being vocal about-
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:11.240]  And realizing how dangerous it is.
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:12.240]  Absolutely, exactly.
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:15.120]  He's not in the bag and I cannot stress that enough.
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:16.120]  Exactly.
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:20.240]  You have to use democratic means to fight back against the efforts to undermine and
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:21.240]  corrode-
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:25.400]  Just like that woman, we need to get her on, who went in and screamed at Beto so eloquently
[3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:26.400]  he quit that day.
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:27.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:32.880]  We need women particularly, there's an archetype to that, when the women get active, that's
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:35.120]  why Hillary's tried to harness them, she hasn't been able to.
[3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:37.680]  We need women to get out there and attack too politically.
[3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:38.760]  Yes, exactly.
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:43.220]  People just need to engage the political process, stand up for their rights, expose the system
[3:11:43.220 --> 3:11:48.600]  for what it is and participate in the political process with free speech and free press to
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:52.520]  keep the light of liberty alive in the United States, which the President is carrying as
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:56.520]  well as anyone has in American legal history or political history, but he faces a degree
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:12:00.360]  of institutionalized opposition like no president in American history.
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:04.400]  This deep state didn't exist when George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or Andrew Jackson or
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:06.680]  Abraham Lincoln was there.
[3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:10.080]  This developed post-World War II at its deepest level.
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:13.840]  These are people who are shocked that the President thinks he can dictate foreign policy
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:15.080]  that he was elected to control.
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:18.760]  And look at the shadow intimidation.
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:21.480]  I talked to a lot of members of the press last night today, probably eight or nine,
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:25.280]  they're all like, we can't come on today now, the judge is really mad and you know, they're
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:28.680]  saying we can get arrested if we talk about the jury selection and I'm like, it's a Supreme
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:29.680]  Court ruling.
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:32.920]  I didn't just call Barnes, I called two other lawyers, I looked it up, I found the same
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:34.120]  Supreme Court ruling.
[3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:40.240]  This is horsemener, but just everyone just, let me tell you, I'm not doing it, Barnes
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:41.240]  isn't doing it.
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:45.080]  Owen Schreuer isn't backing down, this place is not backing down, but we're also not going
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:51.320]  to sit here and tell you that, oh, Q says everything's fine, BS, man.
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:55.600]  It's being realistic about the degree of opposition while being optimistic about the ability of
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:59.280]  the American people to rally for freedom as they have for 200 plus years.
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:00.800]  So the both things can coexist.
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:05.360]  At least I wonder why Ann Coulterberg gets so critical of Trump, she's smart, she's trying
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:08.560]  to get him to do more and stand up and fight back.
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:12.240]  I saw people today going, look, Brudge is showing that Trump's losing, that they just
[3:13:12.240 --> 3:13:16.000]  lost elections, people need to know we just lost Kentucky and Virginia, damn it.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.080]  We need to know the enemy's coming over the top to rally people and kick their ass.
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.240]  How do you think you win wars?
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:25.160]  You don't do it to clear a victory, you do it winning.
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:27.760]  No doubt about that.
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:30.680]  I mean, people can't feel what's happening, it's huge.
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:34.920]  Oh yeah, no, and people have to understand, I think what people, like people really wanted
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:38.360]  to believe, a lot of the Q followers really wanted to believe that the elected head of
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:41.480]  the executive branch had true control over the executive branch and understand why they
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:45.160]  wanted to believe it is what they're taught in civics books version of American politics
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:48.240]  and power, that little, you know, the bill goes to Washington, a little ad they used
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:49.240]  to do.
[3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:51.840]  But if your people aren't rolling in the right direction, you don't have control.
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:55.480]  And the reality is that that was not the case when I was in DC, told everybody in town at
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:13:59.320]  the time of the inauguration, the president's greatest threat is this town, the institutional
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:02.240]  influence of this town, the institutional connections of this town.
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:05.480]  They hate him and they'll leverage all of their power to do so because they don't believe
[3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:06.480]  in the rule of law.
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:09.320]  But it's all about them getting in little secret committee rooms and kissing each other's
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:12.160]  asses and carving up and selling off the country.
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.000]  These are the biggest group of fobs and sycophants and unaccomplished people ever.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:22.240]  But that makes them dangerous because they win through their Ivy League snot noses believe
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:23.320]  they own us.
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:24.920]  Do you understand that?
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:25.920]  No doubt about it.
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:28.760]  The kind of people who learn their politics from the Yale political union that I used
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:31.200]  to be a member of, and those were backdoor meetings.
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:36.720]  It's a stasi style mentality, a Soviet style mindset that is not American in its orientation.
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:39.680]  It's sycophantic, un-American, new royalty.
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:40.680]  No doubt about it.
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:44.440]  It's the old definition of the court system, which was the court system came, that word
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:47.920]  and phrase came from when the royal family got together to decide people's lives.
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:49.480]  And that would be the court intrigue.
[3:14:49.480 --> 3:14:50.480]  Yes, exactly.
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:51.480]  And that's what it is.
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:53.880]  In a communist system or anything.
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:54.880]  It's a court.
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:55.880]  Yeah.
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:56.880]  Courty ears.
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:14:57.880]  Exactly.
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:02.280]  And that word, courtier, is attached and associated with corruption for a reason.
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:07.080]  And then all the little sub minions have little court ears to them, and it goes all the way
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:08.080]  down to the...
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:09.080]  It's very anti-democratic.
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:10.080]  It's very anti-truth.
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:11.080]  It's very anti-freedom.
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:12.080]  It's against America.
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  Absolutely.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.480]  It's against all the fundamental freedoms from the Enlightenment to America that define
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:20.280]  the revolution of ideas that made America the country that it is.
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:24.880]  And it all flows from the fetid rear end of the royal system, which is now the Democratic
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:31.640]  Party and the leftist that hand out the tutelage and the baronage and the land and the goodies
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:33.600]  to all their minions and the dole.
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:35.480]  It's just all back to that.
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:36.480]  Thank you, Robert Barnes.
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:37.480]  Great job.

[3:20:21.560 --> 3:20:26.320]  me mic adams I've got big breaking news today I know there's so much happening today Owen
[3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:33.520]  shroyer is live in DC covering the roger stone trial and the rigged jury the rigged broken
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:40.400]  system of justice that looks already predetermined to throw roger in in prison don't miss his
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:45.520]  show coming up war room at one hour from now or 45 minutes from now I should say there's
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:50.920]  a lot breaking today I've got breaking news for you today on a mechanism a new bombshell
[3:20:50.920 --> 3:20:56.720]  study well I should say we discovered it this study recently the study has been out for
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:21:02.360]  a little while but this study explains the mechanism of why people are being driven insane
[3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:09.440]  by 5g networks and how 5g has been weaponized to literally cause neurological changes and
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:16.920]  cellular changes and causing psychiatric disorders across our population now if you're wondering
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:23.040]  why are people going insane across our country especially have you noticed it tends to be
[3:21:23.040 --> 3:21:29.400]  those who have two things in common number one they live in cities where the 5g networks
[3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:34.880]  are being rolled out so they have all of this exposure but secondly they avoid nutritional
[3:21:34.880 --> 3:21:41.360]  supplements because it turns out and this is part of the big news here today it's nutrition
[3:21:41.360 --> 3:21:49.720]  that blocks these toxic effects of 5g radiation and what it does to the human body so remember
[3:21:49.720 --> 3:21:55.880]  these two points if you live in a city where there's 5g you can help defend yourself against
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:01.360]  those effects using nutrition and superfoods and supplements and that's part of the reason
[3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:06.280]  why people who take good nutrition do not exhibit the same psychiatric disorders and
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:11.280]  the madness and even the trump derangement syndrome that we're seeing now across leftists
[3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:17.920]  who live in cities and who reject nutrition now the paper in question is by author martin
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:23.320]  paul it's called wi-fi is an important threat to human health it was published in the journal
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:29.280]  environmental research this paper which I've studied now in some detail talks about the
[3:22:29.280 --> 3:22:35.840]  production of what are called peroxy nitrites now peroxy nitrites are generated under the
[3:22:35.840 --> 3:22:43.880]  skin in the body upon exposure to wi-fi 5g and other emf fields and what happens with
[3:22:43.880 --> 3:22:52.800]  this these peroxy nitrites are toxic to various cells in your body including neurological
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:23:00.720]  cells and this toxicity is achieved in part through a process called quote voltage gated
[3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:05.840]  ion channels now I'm not going to get too geeky on you here but I do want to explain
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:10.240]  this because I don't think this term has ever been discussed before on info wars or even
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:13.840]  natural news we haven't even written about this yet I'm going to but I haven't written
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:20.160]  about it yet here's the deal you have ions in your body you know electrolytes right
[3:23:20.160 --> 3:23:27.000]  so there are ions of potassium and ions of calcium ions of chloride even for example
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:32.800]  that are in your body and the movement of these ions in and out of your cell walls is
[3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:38.000]  absolutely crucial for you to maintain proper brain function neurological function proper
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:44.120]  cell hydration the removal of cellular waste products from you know cellular physiology
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:50.720]  and so on well what happens is when you are exposed to voltage that comes to your skin
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:57.160]  out of the air ie from 5g networks or wi-fi or mobile phones but 5g is the worst because
[3:23:57.160 --> 3:24:02.800]  it is a directional beam that targets you specifically and it has very high energy density in that
[3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:08.000]  narrow beam it's kind of like a like a laser beam almost that focuses on you and your phone
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:12.760]  from you to the tower it's like a little narrow like a like a lighthouse with a light beam
[3:24:12.760 --> 3:24:18.120]  except of course it's not visible light but this creates voltage literal voltage electrical
[3:24:18.120 --> 3:24:26.160]  volt voltage in your skin this change in voltage causes ions that don't belong in your cells
[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:35.520]  to be forced into your cells specifically calcium ions what you get then is calcium ion poisoning
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:40.040]  in the cells of your body now calcium you know it's a mineral that you need in the proper
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:44.160]  amounts calcium is crucial for neurological function calcium is crucial crucial for heart
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:50.560]  function it's not just for your bones calcium is part of the mechanism of every cell functioning
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:56.320]  excuse me this part of the mechanism of cells moving water in and out if you get too much
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:00.640]  calcium in your cells then it becomes toxic just like if you get too much chloride in
[3:25:00.640 --> 3:25:06.400]  your cells it's toxic it's all about the right balance but what 5g does is it changes the
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.280]  balance it puts too much calcium in and then you start getting poisoning and what happens
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:17.400]  when you poison brain cells and you poison neurology with this voltage gated ion channel
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:22.320]  is the channeling of calcium ions in your cells you get mass mental illness and this
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:28.000]  is what has come out in the paper it lists at least seven different things that happen
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:35.200]  to human beings and one of them is quote neuropsychiatric effects so neurological or neuropsychiatric
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:41.580]  effects is due to this voltage gated calcium channel and it's pushing calcium into the
[3:25:41.580 --> 3:25:46.360]  neurotransmitters in your nervous system and as it says in the report calcium regulates
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:51.360]  the synaptic structure and function of your neurology and when that goes into imbalance
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:55.800]  you get mass mental illness you that's exactly what happens and so when you look at people
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:26:00.360]  who now live in the cities and you wonder how is it that these radical leftists are
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:06.800]  totally insane and they hate alex jones selling nutritional products at info wars store dot
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:12.400]  com they say nutrition is bad they won't take nutrition but they're using their 5g devices
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:17.880]  so what's happening to them they're being poisoned through this voltage regulated calcium channel
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:22.320]  the calcium ions being pushed into their brain cells but they don't have the protection
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:28.320]  of super foods and supplement supplements excuse me and nutrients that can help protect
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:32.360]  your body from these toxic effects so that's when they become mentally ill but it's not
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:39.440]  just psychiatric effects that are involved in this it's also infertility elevated spontaneous
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:46.800]  abortions and lowered libido so this is another primary effect of 5g which is the depopulation
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:52.440]  effect and understand I'm going to cover this too you saw yesterday the big announcement
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:58.440]  from eleven thousand scientists signing on to a paper that essentially argues that billions
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:04.120]  of humans need to be eliminated from our planet how are they going to achieve that well this
[3:27:04.120 --> 3:27:13.120]  wi-fi paper this emf paper that also applies to 5g this explains the mechanism the 5g network
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:19.640]  is a weapon system it is a depopulation system and in addition to driving you insane and
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:25.280]  causing psychiatric disorders which leads to the mass psychiatric drugging of the population
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:30.520]  with antidepressants and so on they're also causing spontaneous abortions which is exactly
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:35.480]  what these climate scientists want to achieve they say there are too many humans they want
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:40.680]  to eliminate about six billion people maybe a little bit more some of them think that
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:45.520]  they need to eliminate you know ninety plus percent of the human population well how to
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:52.280]  do that 5g networks get everybody on psychiatric drugs drive everybody insane cause the collapse
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:56.600]  of society and you notice what we're seeing in america today the collapse of rationality
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:28:02.320]  the collapse of reason the collapse of law and order due process the court systems are
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:09.200]  rigged and you can't even argue logic anymore it's an attack on the very human mind the
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:15.360]  ability to think the ability to speak the ability to even function as a human being with a
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:19.320]  functioning brain that isn't diseased that is what's under attack and they're doing it
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:26.640]  all through 5g and the secret to defending yourself against this is nutrition it is nutrition
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:31.400]  and I'll talk about that after this break how certain foods and superfoods and supplements
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:37.800]  can in fact stop this inflammatory or the pro oxidation pro inflammation effect throughout
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:42.800]  the body and protect all of your cells against the toxicity of emf exposure we'll talk about
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:52.240]  that when we return here on the Alex Jones show
[3:28:52.240 --> 3:28:57.160]  we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on your wireless

[3:30:03.040 --> 3:30:08.240]  into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know but I'm here to tell you every
[3:30:08.240 --> 3:30:16.520]  time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis my life completely

[3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:46.720]  that I use I don't talk enough about is gut fusion folks check it out there's nothing else
[3:30:46.720 --> 3:30:54.360]  like it 50% off right now the cells about to end got fusion m4 store.com the Alex Jones
[3:30:54.360 --> 3:31:00.440]  show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook
[3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:05.320]  she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[3:31:05.320 --> 3:31:10.160]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth
[3:31:10.160 --> 3:31:13.760]  because they didn't get enough iodine that's what you say all the time but I've heard
[3:31:13.760 --> 3:31:18.200]  people say you're crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table
[3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:22.960]  when I click it saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have
[3:31:22.960 --> 3:31:29.040]  you take the high quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant
[3:31:29.040 --> 3:31:34.240]  why you're so alive it's it's it's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier
[3:31:34.240 --> 3:31:38.720]  and smarter than most of the kids your age and it just really blew her away to read
[3:31:38.720 --> 3:31:44.720]  it there for herself that other 2 billion people ladies and gentlemen 2 billion are
[3:31:44.720 --> 3:31:48.960]  mentally retarded on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency research
[3:31:48.960 --> 3:31:55.200]  it and find out for yourself now info wars dot com we have strong disagreement on policy
[3:31:55.200 --> 3:31:59.480]  grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here I don't care what your views are I hope
[3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:03.480]  you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them that's important but we have
[3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:07.160]  something in common we have a set of values that are at the core of this country that
[3:32:07.160 --> 3:32:12.880]  hold this place together Clinton deep state bag man comey thinks it's funny that he was
[3:32:12.880 --> 3:32:17.400]  the leaker and that he lied to congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are
[3:32:17.400 --> 3:32:23.600]  funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted word is the criminal investigation
[3:32:23.600 --> 3:32:32.200]  is honing in on him from my new home in New Zealand I will oh and now suddenly he's talking
[3:32:32.200 --> 3:32:38.080]  about moving to New Zealand not so fast criminal we're going to bring you to justice and we're
[3:32:38.080 --> 3:32:43.360]  going to bring Hillary justice as well because if we don't you criminals will continue to
[3:32:43.360 --> 3:32:47.560]  strike back at your enemy but the American people know how much you hate us and we're
[3:32:47.560 --> 3:32:56.320]  fighting back at info wars dot com news wars dot com and band video you're listening to
[3:32:56.320 --> 3:33:18.480]  the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones and now
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:32.760]  your host Mike Adams here you know I am a nutritionist and a health scientist I run
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:37.880]  a mass spec laboratory dealing with food contamination and so on and in the previous
[3:33:37.880 --> 3:33:44.600]  segment we talked about how 5G exposure Wi-Fi and EMF exposure causes the production of
[3:33:44.600 --> 3:33:51.600]  what are called peroxy nitrites in your body which are pro inflammation chemicals that
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:58.480]  are also part of this phenomenon where EMF exposure causes a voltage increase under your
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:05.280]  skin causing your cells to be poisoned through voltage gated ion passage or calcium channel
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:11.200]  movement throughout your body in your cells your neurological cell skin cells and so on
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:16.520]  but the good news is that there are ways to defend yourself against these things and in
[3:34:16.520 --> 3:34:21.360]  years past I've spoken about how to protect your body from all of these pollutants that
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:26.280]  are in our food supply pollutants that are falling out of the air through chemtrails
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:32.160]  and geoengineering how do you do this there are ways to do it for example aluminum is
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:37.320]  toxic to human neurology and aluminum is found in many foods and many supplements over the
[3:34:37.320 --> 3:34:45.160]  counter painkillers and pills and things like that even some baking soda products from the
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:49.560]  grocery store you can get high aluminum certain detox products may contain high aluminum so
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:55.640]  how do you deal with aluminum well it turns out that you can use for example silica silica
[3:34:55.640 --> 3:35:00.520]  binds with aluminum in your blood and it forms what are called hydroxy aluminos silica which
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:04.760]  are then removed by your kidneys and you just urinate them out where do you get silica
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:09.840]  horsetail herb for example so horsetail is a natural source of silica I've also spoken
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:16.560]  about licorice root so licorice root protects your liver from alcohol induced damage and
[3:35:16.560 --> 3:35:21.880]  acetaminophen damage which is Tylenol the over the counter painkiller now if you consume
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:27.120]  alcohol and Tylenol together you will cause permanent liver damage and there are over
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:33.240]  10,000 people every year in America who are severely damaged they have permanent liver
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:38.560]  damage from that combination of painkillers and alcohol well guess what licorice root
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:44.480]  contains a molecule called glycerin which protects your liver cells from alcohol induced
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:50.360]  damage and if you drink any alcohol at all I don't care if it's on a Friday night a party
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:54.480]  a wedding you're just hanging out I don't care if you start drinking at 9am you should
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:59.480]  be taking licorice root to protect your liver you will be far healthier as a result and
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:03.600]  by the way alcohol certain types of alcohol in moderate consumption actually have health
[3:36:03.600 --> 3:36:07.760]  benefits such as wine for example that's also proven out in the science but you should
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:13.440]  protect your liver using licorice root extract now I don't even know if info wars store has
[3:36:13.440 --> 3:36:18.040]  a licorice root product maybe they'll work on one if they don't have one I don't even
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:23.200]  know if they do I'm not you know an employee of info wars so it doesn't matter I'm just
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:28.000]  telling you as a general principle licorice root can protect your liver from alcohol
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  damage now then let's get the 5g how do you protect yourself from 5g when it's causing
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:38.520]  this voltage gating and this calcium poisoning throughout your body we'll see it's also causing
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:44.840]  inflammation through free radical production which means that you need antioxidants in
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:50.840]  your body that can counteract the free radicals that cause cellular damage after exposure to
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:56.600]  5g voltage which is what happens anytime you're swept with a 5g beam remember these are beams
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:01.840]  that are sweeping across you as you move around in a city where there's 5g telecommunications
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:09.520]  operating so it is not an exaggeration at all to state that things like vitamin c can
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:17.360]  help prevent cellular damage caused by the peroxynitrite production and the pro inflammation
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:23.080]  production of 5g exposure in other words certain supplements and nutrients can help protect
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:30.400]  your body from the toxic effects of being exposed to wi-fi emf 5g smart meters and what
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:34.960]  they're broadcasting mobile devices and so on and now we understand the mechanism of
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:42.440]  how that happens so this also explains again why people who take supplements have better
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:49.640]  neurological function they their brains are protected now personally I strongly recommend
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:54.400]  that for example turmeric for neuro protective properties but turmeric is not known as a strong
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:37:59.080]  antioxidant vitamin c is a strong antioxidant and there are many other antioxidants many
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:03.800]  of them come from fruits for example blueberries are loaded with them red raspberries are loaded
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:08.120]  with them you know lemons and oranges and limes and all these things and also many different
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:13.160]  extra extracts that come from herbs and fruits and things like that camo camo superfruit is
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:19.520]  loaded with antioxidants the bottom line is the more nutrition you have oh and acid anthon
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:24.040]  as well other things like that the more nutrition you have the better you're going to be protected
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:30.080]  against 5g and this is why you think about it info war store dot com offers nutritional
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:36.360]  products that help protect you against the threats from the world you probably didn't
[3:38:36.360 --> 3:38:41.840]  know that some of these may be able to help protect you against 5g exposure as well and
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:45.720]  that's actually really exciting news that's really good news and it probably explains
[3:38:45.720 --> 3:38:51.040]  why you feel like if you live in a city and you're surrounded by crazy people you realize
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:54.800]  gosh you're the only sane person in this group why is everybody else crazy because they're
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:59.520]  not taking the vitamin c or the supplements they are they are literally being poisoned
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:06.560]  by 5g so nutrition is an essential component for patriots anybody who wants to maintain
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:12.560]  your sanity and not dive into the mass mental illness that's characterized by trump derangement
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:17.920]  syndrome and other things wire left is going insane antifa the violence the psychiatric
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:23.920]  disorders the mass mental illness it is being induced it's induced by the pollution and
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:29.440]  the heavy metals in the food supply and the pharmaceuticals that are just inundating everything
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:34.400]  including the public water supplies and the pesticides and the herbicides in the foods
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:41.000]  as well the food is toxic the medicine is toxic the skies are being made toxic by globalists
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:45.240]  with their chemtrailing and their geoengineering and their stratospheric aerosol injection
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:51.520]  experiments to dim the sun and this is all being done deliberately that's the thing
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:58.120]  deliberately to dumb you down to drive humanity insane to cause spontaneous outbursts of violence
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:04.360]  and perhaps civil war to make everybody crazy so that then they can be molded by cnn and
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:10.200]  the false narratives and the lies so that they don't even recognize rationality anymore
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:14.840]  if they take your brain away then how can you function in a society how can we even
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:19.160]  have a civil society when you're under assault through all of these vectors simultaneously
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:23.880]  and they're adding 5g to it as well and you can bet they're going to up the ante on this
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:28.880]  they're going to roll out more 5g towers have more devices you know the internet of things
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:34.480]  they're going to be 5g beams to everything in your home if you're foolish enough to fill
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:40.880]  your house with devices that talk to the 5g towers you know an amazon echo device a video
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:47.800]  cameras doorbells you know anything in your home that has a 5g antenna in it is broadcasting
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:53.640]  a beam which means even while you're sleeping you may be damaging your brain and making
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:59.120]  yourself mentally ill unless you have sufficient protection from antioxidants such as simple
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:04.520]  vitamin c i mean it really is simple to protect yourself from this so you don't you don't
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:09.320]  necessarily have to move out of the city but you do have to take precautions to protect
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:14.200]  yourself and this is how it's done we now understand the mechanisms of how this is happening
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:18.160]  but one of the keys is when you're taking supplements you've got to make sure they're
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:22.840]  clean and i know i've tested quite a lot of the info wars products and they're all super
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:29.080]  clean they formulate with extreme care about the ingredients and and so do i that's what
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:33.640]  i that's what i specialize in by the way and the reason that's important is because if
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:39.680]  you go to amazon wall street journal did a big story on amazon i think it was over 4000
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:44.280]  toxic and illegal products sold on amazon many of the nutritional supplements loaded
[3:41:44.280 --> 3:41:48.800]  with lead and aluminum and toxic substances some of them banned by the fda some of them

[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:27.560]  run a science lab so i know exactly what i'm talking about where iso accredited nobody
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:32.000]  else in the industry does as much testing as i do on on all these products so take this
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:37.400]  seriously you can defend yourself you live in a toxic world but there are solutions that
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:41.320]  can work to help you and those solutions are readily available and you can support this
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:45.400]  network at the same time and no i wasn't paid to say any of this this is just what's breaking
[3:42:45.400 --> 3:42:55.120]  news right now i'll be back after this break with much more folks ask me alex why do you
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:00.680]  have two different types of iodine well that's because different types of physiologies different
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:07.440]  types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just that simple
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:12.760]  x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[3:43:12.760 --> 3:43:19.400]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for you
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:25.240]  whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:30.600]  is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:35.920]  of reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high

[3:44:54.040 --> 3:45:00.680]  john show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook
[3:45:00.680 --> 3:45:05.520]  she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic table and i clicked on iodine and
[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:10.400]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth
[3:45:10.400 --> 3:45:14.280]  because they didn't get enough iodine that's what you say all the time but i've heard people
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:18.640]  say you're crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when
[3:45:18.640 --> 3:45:23.320]  i click it saying exactly what you said and i said i know honey that's why i have you
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:29.280]  take the high quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant

[3:46:50.600 --> 3:47:20.560]  while having a great hat war has been declared on humanity by the climate lunatics
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:26.520]  the so-called scientists 11,000 of them have reportedly signed on to a paper a demand really
[3:47:26.520 --> 3:47:33.600]  published in the journal bioscience it's called world scientists warning of a climate emergency
[3:47:33.600 --> 3:47:38.600]  and essentially they're calling for the mass extermination of the majority of the human
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:43.560]  population in order to quote save the planet from humans now i'm going to go through some
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:49.960]  of the points of this incredibly alarmist paper and debunk them right here on the alex
[3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:54.360]  jones show it's not it's not difficult to debunk them they make enormous mistakes right
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:58.680]  from the start first of all they claim carbon dioxide is a poison a pollutant that's destroying
[3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:04.080]  the climate carbon dioxide of course is the greening nutrient for all plants and you need
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:11.000]  co2 to grow food you need co2 to support food crops rainforest reforestation grasses you
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:16.200]  know herbs everything how do you even grow all the soybeans that the globalists want
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:21.240]  to grow so they can feed you fake meat soy burgers how do you even grow that well you
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:27.120]  got to have co2 but they're at war with co2 they say co2 is bad which means that there
[3:48:27.120 --> 3:48:33.360]  are 11,000 scientists who signed this paper who do not understand photosynthesis which
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:39.080]  i learned in the 10th grade by the way in the 10th grade science class yeah we learned
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:43.200]  about photosynthesis well apparently today's scientists have forgotten all about it but
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:48.800]  they are determined to kill you to kill all of you i mean look they're demanding that
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:54.880]  governments kill off billions of humans essentially now democide is the term that describes government
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:49:00.360]  mass debt and according to a university of hawaii research that was published a couple
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:07.200]  of years ago governments have killed 262 million people in the last century and a half or so
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:11.240]  i mean that's a quarter of a billion people have been killed by governments that's you
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:16.360]  know the nazis it's polpot it's the communist revolution it's the Stalinist purge all these
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:22.320]  things you put them all together it's a quarter of a billion people more actually 262 million
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:30.280]  well today's climate science lunatics demand far more deaths than just a quarter of a billion
[3:49:30.280 --> 3:49:35.560]  they want to eliminate six billion people i mean the the holocaust of world war two was
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:42.080]  six million people right that's the historical record six million jews marched into gas chambers
[3:49:42.080 --> 3:49:48.200]  and concentration camps and exterminated because of who they were well now the climate scientists
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:55.040]  want to exterminate a thousand times more people six billion people because of who you are
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:59.360]  because they say it's bad to be human they even mentioned that directly in the paper
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:05.200]  they say humans are bad essentially and livestock are bad i mean i'm paraphrasing but this is
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:09.440]  what they say they say well greenhouse emissions are are rising it's because there's too many
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:16.160]  people and because there's so many people and so many livestock they say and and people
[3:50:16.160 --> 3:50:20.520]  are riding on airplanes and producing too much co2 they say the planet's going to be
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:24.240]  destroyed if we don't do something it's an emergency it's going to be a catastrophe they
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:29.800]  say but again who's riding in the planes the most it's the globalists who are calling for
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:36.280]  climate change it's the hollywood celebrities like leonardo de caprio claims to be so concerned
[3:50:36.280 --> 3:50:41.480]  about the planet while he's on his private jet producing 10 times the co2 actually more
[3:50:41.480 --> 3:50:47.880]  like 100 times the co2 of somebody on a regular commercial jet it's al gore who produces all
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:53.920]  just hot air from speaking nevermind the co2 that's what these people do but they but these
[3:50:53.920 --> 3:51:00.000]  scientists say that that's bad and they say they have to remove carbon dioxide from the
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:05.680]  atmosphere well if you remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere how are plants supposed
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:12.440]  to grow how are you going to grow the soy burger soy beans without co2 right and plus
[3:51:12.440 --> 3:51:18.560]  on top of this don't forget that bill gates is funding the scope x project which aims
[3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:23.040]  to pollute the stratosphere with the help of harvard scientists probably some of the
[3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:28.840]  same lunatics who signed this paper they want to pollute the skies and block the sun so
[3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:32.440]  wait a second they're going to take the carbon dioxide out of the air and they're going to
[3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:39.120]  block the sun and yet plants need carbon dioxide and sunlight in order to grow well how are
[3:51:39.120 --> 3:51:45.280]  you supposed to grow food then and that's the answer you're not you're not supposed
[3:51:45.280 --> 3:51:51.320]  to grow food you're supposed to starve and die that's what the globalists want this is
[3:51:51.320 --> 3:51:56.320]  listen carefully this is a plan is eleven thousand scientists what they're essentially
[3:51:56.320 --> 3:52:03.280]  calling for is a plan to shut down food crops all around the world by starving the plants
[3:52:03.280 --> 3:52:09.720]  of carbon dioxide and blocking the sun shutting down photosynthesis this my friends is a mass
[3:52:09.720 --> 3:52:17.240]  starvation agenda to carry out starvation famine pestilence disease the collapse of human
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:23.560]  civilization in the name of saving the planet and they demand you obey them and they demand
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:28.760]  that you be censored maybe even jailed if you don't agree with their plan to collapse
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:34.480]  human civilization because you might be a climate skeptic oh and and little Greta thunder
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:40.360]  pants says that you shouldn't be allowed to speak on facebook if you disagree with her
[3:52:40.360 --> 3:52:46.520]  because censorship must now censor all opposing views so if you believe that humanity should
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:50.960]  survive if you think that carbon dioxide is good for plants because it is the number one
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:56.360]  nutrient for plants if you think that photosynthesis is good for our planet then you are bad and
[3:52:56.360 --> 3:53:01.320]  you are evil say these eleven thousand scientists and you should be de-platformed you should
[3:53:01.320 --> 3:53:06.280]  be shunned in fact it's going to get even worse as paul joseph Watson wrote in a story
[3:53:06.280 --> 3:53:12.640]  today on summit dot news in the uk they are now denying health care services to individuals
[3:53:12.640 --> 3:53:19.520]  who they say are engaged in hate speech that's right if you're a racist or if you don't honor
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:23.920]  a transgenderism they're going to kick you out of the hospitals under the socialized
[3:53:23.920 --> 3:53:28.560]  medical system they're going to say you don't even deserve to be kept alive anymore well
[3:53:28.560 --> 3:53:31.720]  they're going to say the same thing that's where this is going they're going to say if
[3:53:31.720 --> 3:53:38.440]  you don't go along with the climate engineered collapse of human populations by these climate
[3:53:38.440 --> 3:53:43.640]  lunatic scientists they're going to say well you're hateful against the planet and we don't
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:48.000]  provide health care services to people who are hateful against the climate so if you're
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:53.680]  a climate denier and you show up in an emergency room with a gunshot wound because an illegal
[3:53:53.680 --> 3:53:59.200]  alien broke into the country broke into your house and shot you and your dog and you show
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:02.920]  up in the emergency room and you say I don't believe your climate change lunacy they're
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:07.320]  going to say you're not welcome here you go home you're engaged in hate speech you don't
[3:54:07.320 --> 3:54:11.800]  get emergency health care services that's where it's going don't believe me it's already
[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:17.040]  begun in the UK that's where this is going and there are already lunatics out there these
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:20.800]  these climate change lunatics who say that you should be jailed if you disagree with
[3:54:20.800 --> 3:54:27.040]  them and we're already living under mass censorship by the tech giants based on what they consider
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:31.320]  to be hate speech and what is hate speech to the tech giants well it's anything that
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:37.840]  they don't like to hear so if you say well transgender is not natural they say well that's
[3:54:37.840 --> 3:54:43.120]  hate speech and you're deep platform and by the way everyone who is opposed to GMOs should
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:47.960]  be opposed to transgenderism you know why because I remember a day when the GMO activists
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:52.280]  used to say well we should we should protect mother nature and the seeds and the genetic
[3:54:52.280 --> 3:54:56.920]  code of the seeds and the sustainability of the plants and the integrity of the crops
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:02.080]  that's its mother nature and we should protect that right remember that those same people
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:08.120]  now saying well let's inundate the children with chemical castration drugs to alter their
[3:55:08.120 --> 3:55:13.440]  genetic expression and turn little boys into little girls these are the same people I thought
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:20.240]  you respected mother nature when you were fighting against GMOs no you weren't you have no philosophy
[3:55:20.240 --> 3:55:26.000]  you have no integrity you have no ethics these people are just so corrupt they just basically
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:32.720]  they hate humanity they hate life they hate children being born as a male or a female
[3:55:32.720 --> 3:55:37.680]  and living out their life with the appropriate gender that they were born with you know consistent
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:43.320]  with their biology they hate that they hate people being informed and aware they hate
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:49.520]  people just being alive like this science paper says how dare you exhale carbon dioxide
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:57.400]  how dare you have an eco footprint you don't even deserve the space to live how dare you
[3:55:57.400 --> 3:56:02.760]  just respirate that's what they seem to be arguing that you're human you're bad you shouldn't
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:07.560]  exist on their planet and they're going to get rid of you and I've spoken about this
[3:56:07.560 --> 3:56:11.680]  at length by the way and I find it fascinating that for the last couple of years as we've
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:17.120]  warned you about this genocide and this depopulation agenda of course we've been mocked by the
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:22.040]  lying fake news media which said oh that's a conspiracy there's no depopulation agenda
[3:56:22.040 --> 3:56:29.480]  now 11,000 scientists depopulation is necessary they say to save the earth wow well where's
[3:56:29.480 --> 3:56:34.720]  the apology to Alex Jones right where's the apology to myself Mike Adams because we warned
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:40.880]  about this we knew that this was their true agenda they really are trying to destroy humanity
[3:56:40.880 --> 3:56:44.760]  and they really do think they're saving the planet some of these people guess what they're
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:49.400]  not even saving the planet they're not they're not and I've I've spoken about this in other
[3:56:49.400 --> 3:56:55.440]  videos what they're doing is eliminating humans for another purpose that has something way
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:00.640]  beyond just globalism by the way maybe I'll talk about that in a future broadcast but
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:06.800]  this is about exterminating humanity and eliminating human civilization from this planet without
[3:57:06.800 --> 3:57:12.120]  destroying the planet itself that's what this really is and climate change is just the excuse
[3:57:12.120 --> 3:57:18.160]  so that's the bombshell from today there's much more to come keep reading info wars.com
[3:57:18.160 --> 3:57:22.960]  naturalnews.com Owen shroyer is coming up next with live reports from DC on the Roger Stone
