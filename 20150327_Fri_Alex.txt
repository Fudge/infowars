[00:00.000 --> 00:29.080]  We've got SSR drugs, that's the first thing I thought linked to German Wings Kamikaze
[00:29.080 --> 00:37.160]  crash, Lufthansa knew about the depression and the killer in the cockpit, co-pilot tore
[00:37.160 --> 00:46.040]  up door, co-pilot tore up doctor's note excusing him from work, captain took axe to cockpit
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.960]  door as passenger screamed and as I said yesterday that now the press is figuring it out, knee
[00:50.960 --> 00:58.880]  jerk reaction 9-11 enabled mass murder because when you put a armored door there where people
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.200]  can't get in it then allows a whole new set of problems, so any security fix will then
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.280]  cause a paradigm shift that will have other problems, the people don't think about that
[01:10.280 --> 01:15.040]  and I used it as an allegory yesterday of the police state we've set up supposedly keep
[01:15.040 --> 01:21.360]  it safe and of course it's that police state historically that is the greatest danger but
[01:21.360 --> 01:26.640]  the independent gets it right, the knee jerk reaction 9-11 enabled mass murder, if you even
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.920]  believe the official story, I'm not saying I don't, I just can't believe governments
[01:30.920 --> 01:37.560]  known for constantly lying and caught lying, who knows if it's true, more will come out.
[01:37.560 --> 01:43.120]  I've talked about hundreds of news articles, there's got to be hundreds in the Texas news
[01:43.120 --> 01:46.280]  alone, I mean it's in every major paper in Texas that I've looked at, Dallas Morning
[01:46.280 --> 01:53.880]  News, Houston Chronicle, San Antonio Express News and they all go with the same story, Alex
[01:53.880 --> 01:58.840]  Jones said he had a secret document but it's not secret, the police knew all about it,
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.960]  changing the subject or Alex said the feds would seize Texas this year that it was an
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.480]  actual invasion, no I said it was training for that, so see they built straw men to try
[02:08.480 --> 02:16.960]  to discredit us and it is the same attack piece over and over again, Jade Helm the pretend
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.000]  invasion of Texas that's driving the web crazy, now we all know what they first did
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.320]  last week, they first said we didn't have a document and it wasn't real, then they
[02:24.320 --> 02:27.880]  said they couldn't confirm the document, then they said okay we've got the document but
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.480]  it's for overseas training even though it says it's for domestic as well as overseas,
[02:31.480 --> 02:36.320]  so they changed the subject over and over again and then Fox News following the same
[02:36.320 --> 02:44.200]  talking point, the same talking point says well there's a talk show host and who said
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.760]  it wasn't a secret document but it wasn't, they don't say who I am or show what I said
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.160]  because you actually don't hear what I said, they just misrepresent and they go in another
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.000]  site picked it up, they're talking about drudge and then that's when everybody went crazy,
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.120]  here's the clip with Megan Kelly on Fox News yesterday.
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.440]  Jade Helm 15, while the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.920]  of war, critics say the army is preparing for modern day martial law, Trace Gallagher
[03:09.920 --> 03:13.640]  live in our West Coast newsroom with the story, Trace.
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.720]  Megan Summer calling it a Texas takeover, what's happening is between July and September a
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.000]  bunch of green berets, Navy SEALs and special ops from the Air Force and Marines are conducting
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.720]  some realistic training exercises across the Southwest including 17 different Texas cities.
[03:29.720 --> 03:34.600]  The goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.400]  without being noticed, you know blend in so they can place themselves in strategic positions
[03:40.400 --> 03:42.680]  to handle different threat scenarios.
[03:42.680 --> 03:47.360]  The military says these are vital skills when it comes to an ever changing threat but in
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.440]  the slide show of the training exercise it says Texas will be simulated hostile territory.
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.000]  While that hostile characterization didn't sit well with a far right radio host in Austin
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.960]  who told his listeners that he had access to the secret document that details of federal
[04:02.960 --> 04:04.440]  takeover in Texas.
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.840]  A libertarian website also picked up on the plan and before you know it, rallies were
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.840]  being held against the event but apparently the so called secret document was published
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.840]  weeks ago several local newspapers letting the public play very well in Texas.
[04:19.840 --> 04:22.600]  Trace, thank you we'll be right back.
[04:22.600 --> 04:26.680]  Alright that clip's a little choppy we're going to try to re-download that but there
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.160]  you go ladies and gentlemen, that's the anatomy of the deception and notice it's not Fox
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.840]  getting it wrong, that's the same disinfo in the hundreds of newspapers.
[04:35.840 --> 04:41.120]  What you heard is directly from the Pentagon deceiving the American people.
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.680]  We did not say it was secret, we said it was public.
[04:46.680 --> 04:47.680]  That's what we said.
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.520]  See they won't name the websites, they won't name the host because they don't want people
[04:51.520 --> 04:54.920]  actually coming to hear what we really said or wrote.
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.280]  They want to misrepresent straw man it's deception.
[05:00.280 --> 05:03.920]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.320]  At the same time they're restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:08.320 --> 05:10.320]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.920]  Infidel body armor can stop every round including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds is reasonably
[05:15.920 --> 05:19.040]  priced and fully legal but for how long?

[09:26.760 --> 09:32.080]  between Southcom Northcom Homeland Security local police departments around the nation
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.560]  with quote the military infiltrating towns and doing suspicious things and seeing of
[09:36.560 --> 09:43.560]  the public basically calls the police this is 100% for the homeland they are going to
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  be doing other drills as well that do interchange training overseas I shot a special report last
[09:52.480 --> 09:59.480]  night for the nightly news that we are going to repost to the front page of info wars dot
[09:59.480 --> 10:06.480]  com and prison planet dot com it went up last night but already scrolled off that deals
[10:07.320 --> 10:14.320]  with all of this and if you go to one of our main YouTube pages you can find it entire
[10:14.360 --> 10:21.360]  martial law plan exposed and we need to tweet this out at real Alex Jones and then beg people
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.160]  to retweet it you to put at the top of Facebook you to have a maximum push on this 19 minute
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.160]  video that we're going to play at the bottom of the hour than David Knight's coming in
[10:33.160 --> 10:39.760]  because we show the total proof from the Pentagon's own documents source the names of the public
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.760]  documents so that folks can go look it up for themselves now how do you counter something
[10:48.600 --> 10:54.760]  like that when we have hundreds of mainstream articles Washington Post New York Times Army
[10:54.760 --> 11:01.760]  dot mill army manuals that are public see that's when they're selling it is good isn't
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.560]  it great homeland security is trained to take on veterans and gun owners who they believe
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.000]  the next terror group Washington Post isn't it great the number one enemies the tea party
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.320]  southern poverty law center agrees with the Pentagon's plan to take on American conservatives
[11:17.320 --> 11:24.320]  we've got them all on MSNBC NBC CBS CNN and even Fox News saying the army's training to
[11:26.720 --> 11:32.720]  take on dangerous malicious I've got O'Reilly saying that that we put together a video of
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.160]  all of those clips saying we need the army to take on Ron Paul supporters their planet
[11:37.160 --> 11:44.160]  terrorism that's Clint Beck at CNN I mean I just live this every day watching them prepare
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.160]  for war with the American people watching them try to train the military to accept this role
[11:49.160 --> 11:56.160]  and it's the military for 20 years that has been giving me the information really 18 the
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.160]  first two I wasn't big enough to be on the radar but within two years of being on air
[12:02.160 --> 12:09.160]  everything I know came from people inside the government basically FBI federal marshals
[12:09.160 --> 12:16.160]  U.S. military so we're not attacking the military it's the military at the mid level and low
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.560]  level and in many cases the high level you've seen general Boykin the former head of special
[12:21.560 --> 12:24.840]  forces come out and say there's a purge the military and Obama might be planning to take
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.840]  over that's the former head of special forces one of the most decorated living people saying
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.840]  what I'm saying I mean there's a major fight right now for this country you notice the power
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.960]  grabbing on the borders and the FCC and and freedom of speech and the global treaties
[12:45.960 --> 12:50.120]  being signed that Congress can't even see the FCC chairman came out and said I won't
[12:50.120 --> 12:55.240]  testify I won't release documents to the Congress and one congressman said you're not God two
[12:55.240 --> 13:02.240]  days ago when agency start acting like God that's called totalitarianism it's called
[13:07.760 --> 13:14.760]  despotism it's called tyranny it's here and people are finally really listening and so
[13:17.320 --> 13:22.920]  now they'll undoubtedly scale back these exercises and go see nothing happened or they'll go
[13:22.920 --> 13:29.920]  show parts of the drills that are legitimate I've been covering this for 18 years so the
[13:30.440 --> 13:34.240]  way they deceive and you notice I covered this yesterday in the Houston Chronicle and
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.920]  the Dallas Morning News everywhere's the same article same different writers but written
[13:38.920 --> 13:42.840]  the same Jones claimed there was a plan to take over Texas this summer that would bring
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.320]  in martial law this summer and that he had a secret document but it wasn't secret here's
[13:47.320 --> 13:51.320]  all these mayors and police chief saying for two weeks they've been meeting with the military
[13:51.320 --> 13:56.440]  about the plan I never said it was secret I said it was about conditioning local police
[13:56.440 --> 14:02.440]  to work with the military and that it was a conditioning operation which is what it is
[14:02.440 --> 14:09.000]  I know the Rand Corporation called for it the CFR called for it in the special report coming
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.120]  up in 15 minutes we will go through all of it so this isn't just about info wars being
[14:14.120 --> 14:20.480]  attacked it's about the anatomy of a deception how many times have you heard me the last five
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.240]  years tell you that Saudi Arabia has nuclear weapons and that they're going to announce
[14:25.240 --> 14:30.920]  they have nuclear weapons how many times probably 500 any regular listeners heard that
[14:30.920 --> 14:37.920]  neurotically I said it on Monday and Tuesday top story drugs report right now Saudi Arabia
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.800]  says it won't rule out building nuclear weapons Israel declassified yesterday that they have
[14:47.800 --> 14:53.480]  nuclear weapons they've had nuclear weapons since the late 1960s is why did Israel just
[14:53.480 --> 14:58.040]  announce they have nuclear weapons why did the US just declassified yesterday as well
[14:58.040 --> 15:04.800]  because they're they're saber rattling and they're also letting Iran know well let me
[15:04.800 --> 15:08.120]  give you the newsflash I've been told by very trusted sources that have turned out to be
[15:08.120 --> 15:14.240]  on target every time that Iran has news and so does Saudi Arabia for 10 stinking years
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.200]  it was a conspiracy theory until yesterday that Israel had nuclear weapons now it's
[15:19.200 --> 15:26.440]  admitted everybody knew they had weapons back in the 60s so they arrest Israeli Jews
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.720]  that talk about it it's like talking about the sun coming up in the morning if the government
[15:30.720 --> 15:37.720]  says the sun didn't come up I'm still gonna say it came up I mean it's out there so that's
[15:37.720 --> 15:44.720]  that's the reality here South Africa's got a bunch of nuclear weapons South Africa's
[15:44.720 --> 15:51.320]  got race a specific weapons that's come out but the average person doesn't know that when
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.840]  I'm getting in here is we're watching a giant movement to militarize police to get rid of
[15:56.840 --> 16:01.760]  freedoms to spy on the people that warrants it's all been done we've been taken over now
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.280]  as they tighten down the vice grips we're in the cage but the cage is getting smaller
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.920]  people are starting to squirm and the Pentagon and the willing accomplice media is going
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.920]  come on there's no plan to take over but notice they say a Texas talk show host on Fox News
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.280]  they don't want people to actually come here and they say then a libertarian site picked
[16:23.280 --> 16:30.280]  it up it's not drudge but guess what it wasn't secret no we never said it was secret so the
[16:31.280 --> 16:35.560]  first lie a week and a half ago with stars and stripes and the Pentagon saying we don't
[16:35.560 --> 16:41.240]  think that's really the document that says hostile we think they may affect those slides
[16:41.240 --> 16:46.160]  we didn't fake jack squat it was on the website army dot mill of course they then firewalled
[16:46.160 --> 16:50.560]  it so people couldn't go find out if it was real we we tracked all that we know all the
[16:50.560 --> 16:58.040]  tricks silly rabbit tricks are for kids straight ups the way to win freedom straight ups got
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.040]  the power straight shooting's got the power in this universe not a bunch of creeping around
[17:03.040 --> 17:10.400]  creeping around only works for a while you can work in the dark against your fellow man
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.440]  but sooner or later God's going to cut you down like we come in with Johnny Cash next
[17:15.440 --> 17:23.320]  segment please so I want to play this Fox News clip because it's the anatomy of the
[17:23.320 --> 17:29.880]  BS machine and CNN MSNBC they're all attacking us right now but they won't actually play
[17:29.880 --> 17:35.600]  me saying it they just lie let's go to the Megan Kelly clip here it is jade helm 15 while
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.520]  the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war say the army is preparing
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.120]  for modern day martial law trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with the story
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.040]  trace he's laughing Megan summer calling it a Texas takeover what's happening is between
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.960]  July and September a bunch of green berets Navy SEALs and special ops from the Air Force
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.440]  and Marines are conducting some realistic training exercises across the Southwest including
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.120]  17 different Texas cities the goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.440]  around the civilian population without being noticed you know blend in so they can place
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.960]  themselves in strategic positions to handle different threat scenarios the military says
[18:16.960 --> 18:21.640]  these are vital skills when it comes to an ever-changing threat but in the slideshow
[18:21.640 --> 18:26.920]  of the training exercise it says Texas will be simulated hostile territory right there
[18:26.920 --> 18:33.400]  that hostile care I will show off the Washington Post own graphic in the segment coming up
[18:33.400 --> 18:37.880]  where Oklahoma and Texas have gotten right at double the quote free military hardware
[18:37.880 --> 18:43.000]  California has because it's for the American people and they show troops training in the
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.800]  desert to imply that's what's going to be happening here in Texas when it's going to
[18:48.800 --> 18:55.760]  be an urban surroundings so everything is flawlessly deceptive to manipulate the catatonic

[25:39.960 --> 25:45.040]  see when they put it in a good light they just admit it but then when we point out it's
[25:45.040 --> 25:52.680]  not good they attack us we have congressional hearings admitting it uh... we have ron paul
[25:52.680 --> 25:59.400]  talking about it police now armed for war against returning veterans cbs news we've
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.640]  got a marine corps highly decorated combat colonels interviews that we should add the

[26:37.560 --> 26:43.880]  readying for domestic unrest for decades but then we add the caveat i'm adding this the
[26:43.880 --> 26:52.600]  headline and preparations are accelerating exponentially and preparations are accelerating
[26:52.600 --> 27:01.320]  exponentially the growth curve is parabolic straight up they tried this under clinton
[27:01.320 --> 27:07.000]  and then it just exploded under obama bush was more worried about global domination
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.280]  and taking over and they did a lot of police state stuff that grew as well hugely the bipartisan
[27:11.280 --> 27:17.320]  patriot act the rest of it the nsa spying but now it's in hyperdrive and they don't
[27:17.320 --> 27:20.620]  want to have a debate like all there's no death panels all it doesn't increase your
[27:20.620 --> 27:24.200]  prices all the insurance companies didn't write write screw you over don't listen to
[27:24.200 --> 27:28.600]  those racists we were reading the stinking bill they just hoped you wouldn't go look
[27:28.600 --> 27:33.480]  at it's the same garbage they get on the news and go there are no death panels one week
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.000]  after it passed newsweek had the headline the case for killing granny and said you know
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.400]  what there are death panels and so did bill gates a month after laughing at everybody
[27:43.400 --> 27:54.280]  okay remember obama i don't want your guns i'm not going to get rid of the borders
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.040]  look at how they're doing everything by the executive now even congress people are calling
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.960]  it the beginnings of a dictatorship it's not the beginnings we're here so the detailed
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.600]  report from info wars nightly news is coming up and then david night will start quarter
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.480]  backing and take over at that point as i'm flying out to california to kill many birds

[28:25.600 --> 28:32.200]  authoritarian you know autocrat broadcaster the authority figure and he just laughs and
[28:32.200 --> 28:38.320]  says they're just trained for foreign operations and this host in texas said it was secret
[28:38.320 --> 28:44.560]  it wasn't the local police know megan of course they know they're being usurped that's the
[28:44.560 --> 28:52.680]  whole point so that's how they lie to their audience cnn msnbc fox news we've got all
[28:52.680 --> 28:57.800]  the clips they are attacking us dallas morning news houston chronicle the only publication
[28:57.800 --> 29:02.040]  that did a fair job and showed both sides was the daily mail and that's why they're
[29:02.040 --> 29:05.840]  one of the biggest papers in england as people know they can go there and get both sides
[29:05.840 --> 29:09.520]  and i i just didn't see the daily mail really do a great job you also find out about the
[29:09.520 --> 29:15.000]  latest uh... you know plastic surgery of hollywood stars but special forces set to swarm south
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.920]  west and operate undetected among civilians and massive military exercise and then it
[29:20.920 --> 29:26.560]  just goes through the whole thing they're gonna be simulating doing illegal things
[29:26.560 --> 29:30.880]  what they're doing is practicing taking over cities and towns and right now they're getting
[29:30.880 --> 29:35.480]  relationships with the cities and towns so they won't have to win the martial law directive
[29:35.480 --> 29:40.280]  comes down it'll be called civil emergency so that's what's going on we're trying to

[33:22.240 --> 33:26.600]  to the alex jones show i'm david night i'll be hosting the rest of the show paul joes
[33:26.600 --> 33:31.280]  of watson will be joining us in the next hour what alex is pointing out here is something
[33:31.280 --> 33:36.120]  that i've seen going on for a long time and of course we all know that clip from about
[33:36.120 --> 33:41.360]  i think it was last summer when the pentagon was having a meeting talking about how they
[33:41.360 --> 33:47.080]  were not effective in terms of getting people to understand and to agree with them and one
[33:47.080 --> 33:54.320]  girl got up and said nobody believes us they look at this as just mindless propaganda remember
[33:54.320 --> 33:59.520]  that clip that's exactly what's been going on with this first coming out with the ridiculous
[33:59.520 --> 34:05.880]  claims that well we can't really respond to this because we can't look at that site come
[34:05.880 --> 34:09.360]  on they could look at the drudge site they could look at scribed they just didn't want
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.000]  to acknowledge that that existed and as alex pointed out they gradually start to roll this
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.960]  thing out that's why they have no credibility we're going to talk about what unconventional
[34:18.960 --> 34:25.360]  warfare is this isn't simply another training exercise we need to understand how profoundly
[34:25.360 --> 34:29.840]  disturbing this is even some people on the left understand that now gocker understands
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.680]  that they said you know you don't have to be a right wing conspiracy site like info wars
[34:34.680 --> 34:38.920]  because they can't really say that they agree with us they have to use those kind of labels
[34:38.920 --> 34:43.360]  listen the way megan kelly is rolling this stuff out remember it was just a couple of
[34:43.360 --> 34:48.880]  weeks ago that she was the cheerleader for the big brother or well in state when it came
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.320]  to mandatory vaccines when it came to taking away your right to informed consent when it
[34:54.320 --> 34:59.720]  came to forcing medication on you remember megan kelly just came out and said well you
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.800]  know it's kind of like big brother but sometimes you need big brother you know when you need
[35:03.800 --> 35:09.520]  big brother it's when your boss who's in bed with big pharma tells you you need big brother
[35:09.520 --> 35:15.280]  when big brother pharma pays for most of your network that's when you need big brother and
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.920]  when it comes to the military industrial complex you're not going to get any objective analysis
[35:20.920 --> 35:26.760]  from fox news they're pushing every war they can because that's where the profit is and
[35:26.760 --> 35:30.360]  we're going to break down exactly the way they were spending this course there's a lot
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.720]  of different ways it's been spun the right-wing heritage foundation put out a article not
[35:35.720 --> 35:41.840]  directly addressing us but talking about jade helm and said training exercises are not
[35:41.840 --> 35:48.920]  a violation of posse cometatus we never said they were but what they're training for is
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.360]  a violation of all the principles this government was set up with we're going to talk about the
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.400]  dangers of standing armies that are meant to protect us from foreign enemies abroad
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.920]  but always wind up being used for tyranny at home that's something that has long been
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.800]  established that's a pattern of behavior that our founders had recognized in previous
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.360]  empires in the roman empire they set up a system of checks and balances they set up
[36:13.360 --> 36:19.120]  a prohibition against perpetual standing armies against perpetual state of war abroad because
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.880]  they knew exactly where this is going to eventually end up we had eisenhower very nervously talking
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.040]  about the military industrial complex and what this could become we know where this
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.560]  is headed but i want to play this report that alex put together because it's very important
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.520]  for you to understand this is something that's been developing a long time we've been pointing
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.440]  out that this is going on for a long time we haven't been saying that marshal law hammer
[36:41.440 --> 36:47.240]  was going to drop it is a gradual progressive rollout this is the next step that course
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.000]  you always have to be concerned every time they do a major drill because major drills
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.760]  have accomplished a company things like nine eleven and seven seven bombings and the uk
[36:58.760 --> 37:02.560]  so many times these false flags have also been that's one of the ways that they cover
[37:02.560 --> 37:06.160]  up that's one of the ways they compartmentalize people they say we're running a drill that's
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.760]  exactly like such and such and then they run this drill but this is i think really going
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.720]  to be a training exercise but we have to question why they're training like this let's go to
[37:15.720 --> 37:24.120]  that clip right now
[37:24.120 --> 37:31.040]  this is an emergency broadcast this is a direct message to the department of defense all four
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.240]  branches of the military active duty service members veterans their families state governments
[37:37.240 --> 37:45.760]  local governments and the media we are going to display one hundred percent irrevocable
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.360]  proof that there is a global move not just here but all over the world to militarize
[37:52.360 --> 38:00.680]  police and to put standing armies on the streets to suppress the population and to carry out
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.480]  political operations they have recruited in the last decade clergy response teams preachers
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.080]  to spy on their flocks and to order their flocks to turn in their guns and go to femacamps
[38:13.080 --> 38:18.600]  during civil emergencies the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's walk and get
[38:18.600 --> 38:22.840]  this thing over with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over such
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.520]  clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[38:27.520 --> 38:32.440]  the wishes of the public in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.200]  neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation for the clergy one
[38:37.200 --> 38:42.640]  of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law
[38:42.640 --> 38:49.680]  is the bible itself specifically romans we have seen gun confiscation during emergencies
[38:49.680 --> 38:55.520]  in canada and the united states during flooding going into high and dry areas and taking guns
[38:55.520 --> 39:02.400]  beta testing if troops would follow the orders this is part of a long term societal slide
[39:02.400 --> 39:08.880]  we're not becoming a police state we're not in danger of being under globalist rule we're
[39:08.880 --> 39:15.760]  already here the president opens the borders without any law shuts down power plants without
[39:15.760 --> 39:22.640]  any law the FCC refuses to testify and seizes the internet obama care has death panels veterans
[39:22.640 --> 39:29.600]  are put on no treat death list by every historical measurement we're already in a tyranny and
[39:29.600 --> 39:37.200]  then operation jade helm gets announced it was put on the army website last week we reported
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.600]  on it first it became a big huge national news story they've had army time stars and
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.160]  stripes hundreds of newspapers come out and say jones said that the military would take
[39:48.160 --> 39:55.600]  over and have martial law for obama this summer now we said we said jade helm infiltrating
[39:55.600 --> 40:01.760]  police departments practicing taking over america interfacing the condition the public
[40:01.760 --> 40:07.840]  was part of a long term strategic plan to sell the military on this new unconstitutional mission
[40:09.040 --> 40:14.400]  if we're against transvestites in special forces dressed like women it isn't because
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.200]  we're against the military it's because it will wreck the military but they pose it like you're
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.560]  against the troops because you don't want trainees in commando gear or you're against the troops
[40:24.560 --> 40:31.840]  because you don't want them training in your city yes because military and police exposed this to me
[40:31.840 --> 40:38.240]  back in the 90s i interviewed the san antonio police chief and others how delta force came to
[40:38.240 --> 40:44.880]  them it made the associated press my interview and said we want to pay you 200 000 to work in
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.760]  covert operations to compromise him that's what this 10 state operation it was eight states
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.720]  is all about is finding out who will work with them during a martial law takeover most the
[40:56.720 --> 41:02.160]  military is not involved in this notice that special operations navy seals green berets
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.600]  delta force and others that are running this because they're the ones historically that
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.440]  i've run up against doing this back like it's a detriment that i've been warning of this for 20
[41:13.440 --> 41:20.400]  years in the houston chronicle they say decades it all came true we're already in the police state
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.080]  we're already going under a form of martial law so let me show you some of the news we already went
[41:26.080 --> 41:31.280]  to an earlier report then i'll go to a smattering of the other evidence right here much of it from
[41:31.280 --> 41:37.520]  the department of defense's own website you have massive military gear being cached armored vehicles
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.200]  machine guns helicopters night vision humvees with the police departments around the country california
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.520]  has gotten the majority of it along with oklahoma and other areas to population texas has gotten
[41:49.520 --> 41:54.000]  double what california has gotten we have 10 million less than them oklahoma got basically
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.080]  doubled what california got even though the crime rates are very low because it's about suppressing
[42:00.080 --> 42:06.880]  the patriot population just like they have on the map in jade helm showing texas utah and other
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.400]  areas is hostile this is precaching to fight real americans that won't go along with gun
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.120]  confiscation you name it now when you see info wars dot com articles i'm going to show you you
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.240]  can go directly to the site click on it go to the department of defense's site do d training

[42:53.440 --> 42:58.800]  for the takeover and that's in the john warren defense authorization act of 96 97 they admit for
[42:58.800 --> 43:04.160]  insurrection by legislatures and governors they just hope just like obama care you don't actually
[43:04.160 --> 43:11.280]  go read this stuff now here it is out of the army times conspiracy groups question south com's mission
[43:11.280 --> 43:17.360]  in texas they've been trying to deny it's even going on defense department guide calls founding
[43:17.360 --> 43:23.920]  fathers extremist fusion centers expand criteria to identify militia members tracking american people
[43:23.920 --> 43:29.760]  u.s. military to assist in vancouver again this is years ago our military being used in canada
[43:29.760 --> 43:35.040]  because under these deals and paul wassens doing an article on this the generals admit their training
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.400]  to bring in foreign troops to suppress insurrection i'm going to go to that in a moment
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.200]  look at this in the new york times scouts trained to fight terrorists and more
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.400]  disgruntled veterans read it for yourself gun owners that's who they train nationwide to fight
[43:50.400 --> 43:57.280]  right wellness checks is code for gun confiscation now a national guard going door to door asking

[44:03.200 --> 44:08.160]  guns when they're legal troops in door to door wellness checks in virginia ohio
[44:10.160 --> 44:16.000]  and remember what we saw happen in katrina so that's just some of what we've covered to recap
[44:16.000 --> 44:22.400]  that it's a compendium it's the body of what's coming on it's the frog in the pot where it's
[44:22.400 --> 44:29.040]  done incrementally so that people become accustomed and they admit in the jade helm report that it's
[44:29.040 --> 44:37.600]  about interfacing with the public and local police it's a psi op now let's go directly to the massive
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.640]  documentation i'm just going to show you all these exhibits and again the pentagon counters
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.800]  saying oh look it's info wars these articles all link directly to the article below which is army
[44:48.800 --> 44:55.760]  dot mill yes the reeducation camp manual does apply to mess with the u.s citizens three years ago
[44:55.760 --> 45:02.880]  in 2012 they started massive advertising for career specialists in the u.s to run quote
[45:02.880 --> 45:09.760]  reeducation camps they even use the communist soviet term you cannot make this up it's like
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.720]  the nazis didn't call their death camps death camps this would be like them actually calling
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.240]  them death camps to call them reeducation camps because that's a soviet term for a torture
[45:18.880 --> 45:26.000]  basically death camp so in the soviet reeducation term reeducation is death camp you cannot make
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.200]  this up they actually use that term it has the social security numbers how to process everybody
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.440]  how to break up the families we've even filmed the drills not just the manuals and they counter
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.640]  and go oh it's for overseas no it it talks about working with local law enforcement social security

[46:28.960 --> 46:37.440]  to control the us and then nato has contingents of our army and military inside of it so the us

[56:27.840 --> 56:33.040]  you need to go to info wars dot com look at this article share this article beyond denial
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.800]  preparations for martial law in america we need to understand that this is a progression that
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.040]  has been going on for a long time just as alex shows just broke that down for you let me point
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.480]  this out when making kelly is saying they have to prepare for the realities of war what they're
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.920]  saying is they're preparing for unconventional warfare now if they'd gone to these different
[56:53.920 --> 56:59.200]  localities and instead of telling them we we're going to be doing some military training exercises
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.080]  here if instead of doing that if they had defined what unconventional warfare is if they'd come in
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.200]  and said you know we're going to have forces with objectives that are covert we're going to have
[57:09.200 --> 57:15.040]  tactics and weapons and intensify environments of subversion or intimidation in your area and our
[57:15.040 --> 57:22.240]  general goal our long-term goal is a coercive or subversive of the political body that's the
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.960]  definition out of wikipedia of unconventional warfare look it up they're talking about how
[57:26.960 --> 57:32.000]  they want to achieve military victory through acquiescence capitulation clandestine support
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.840]  that's what this is about when they say they're going to go in and set up cells with people
[57:35.840 --> 57:39.360]  they're going to test how well they're able to move about without getting too noticed in the
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.560]  community that's what the victoria county sheriff's office said after they were briefed by the people
[57:44.560 --> 57:50.800]  conducting unconventional warfare how does that help them when they conduct operations okonas
[57:50.800 --> 57:56.560]  outside the continental united states if they're able to hone their skills and practice moving
[57:56.560 --> 58:04.080]  about in american cities and looking covertly american how does that help them abroad to that
[58:04.080 --> 58:08.480]  extent it seems to me like that would harm them when they go into an alien culture no
[58:08.480 --> 58:14.960]  you practice for where you're going to deploy if you're going to try to blend in here civilly
[58:14.960 --> 58:19.120]  then that's what you practice for if you wanted to blend in in saudi arabia you wouldn't be

[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.600]  joseph watson with us in the next segment talking about this article that he put together with alex
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.680]  jones we just played alex jones's special report that he did last night and this article is very
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.960]  key you need to get this out to as many people as you can especially to people that are in the
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.880]  military have them take a look at this this breaks down this long progression this gradual
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.400]  movement that is now accelerating as alex jones pointed out it also has a lot of video clips
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.160]  but it has documents links to previous articles this has been going on for quite a long time alex
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.000]  jones has been making documentaries about this for quite a long time we are not saying that this
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.160]  particular incident is going to be martial law we're not saying that this particular incident
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.440]  is a violation of posse comatotus that's the way they're spinning it to try to make it look like
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.800]  we're alarmists no we're talking about what has been going on it's been getting progressively
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.600]  worse let me tell you even gawker is having a problem with this a lot of people are starting
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.080]  to realize that there's something going on with the militarization of the police do you think
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.320]  we've been talking about that for a long time look at all the police say documentaries that alex
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.280]  jones has done over the years people are now gradually starting to catch on about this they're
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.960]  starting to be concerned about why we have this massive pre-deployment of military equipment
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.840]  in small towns where they don't have a crime problem in small towns where they're going to
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.960]  have to maintain the support and the maintenance of these white elephants that are being put into
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.840]  their towns given to them for free you know that's what the the proverbial white elephant was about
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.080]  in india the white elephant was sacred and so the leader would give that to somebody because
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.200]  they would have to feed that thing forever they couldn't kill it they couldn't let it go so
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.200]  that's essentially what they're doing now with these m-wraps that they're prepositioning and a
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.840]  lot of other equipment like that but even left wing gawker is concerned about this and a story
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.760]  that paul joseph watson put out yesterday he said the gawker reporter said this exercise stirs an
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:46.480]  air of creeping fascism exactly that's what we're seeing here is creeping fascism coming out bit by
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.680]  bit he goes on to say you don't need to believe in fema death domes or an islamo fast fascist
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:58.000]  white house to find jade helm a little bit unsettling even if it's just a routine exercise
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.480]  meant to simulate a future middle eastern war zone inside of america really a middle eastern war
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.200]  zone inside of america let's go to this other article that paul joseph watson put up and we're
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.280]  going to talk to him about all of these as well as the master article i mentioned beyond denial
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.960]  preparations for martial law in america in the next segment he's going to be on talking to us
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.080]  i just mentioned this in the last segment this is a quote from a chief deputy with the victoria
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.880]  county sheriff's office here in texas talking about what he had been briefed with the military
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.240]  about what jade helm was going to be he said they're going to set up cells of people and
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.240]  test how well they're able to move around without getting too noticed in the community
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.240]  he said they're testing their abilities to basically blend in with the local environment
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.200]  and not stand out and blow their cover so how does that apply to a foreign occupation zone
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.800]  how does that apply even to a future middle eastern war zone inside of america that's not
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.840]  what they're that's not what they're training for look at the documents we have the documents in this
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.880]  article beyond denial they're not planning for an islamic zone inside of america they said that
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:09.360]  their enemy is not islamo fascist they said that their enemy is are the patriots the christians
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.600]  tea party ron paul supporters they've made that very clear and let me read this to you again this
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.800]  is from wikipedia this is what unconventional warfare is it's an attempt to achieve military
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.240]  victory through acquiescence capitulation or clandestine support for one side of an
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.280]  existing conflict it's very interesting isn't it that these maps they show texas is being hostile
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.200]  but then they come in and say well you know we'd like to have your support because we're going to
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.480]  play and some audio clips from when they came in and talked to the brazos county commissioners
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.320]  we're going to play some of what they're telling these commissioners we need to have your permission
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.320]  we need a letter of invitation why should they need a letter of invitation if there's no problem
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.920]  with this but they've already got the agenda worked out just like agenda 21 stay with us
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.800]  you're going to be right back we're going to talk to paul joseph watt so we're going to break this
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:03.760]  down further for you the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo

[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.120]  whether or not they're doing that we're going to be talking to paul joseph wasin just a moment
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.600]  we're going to start out with uh this plane crash and his article about the possible ssri drugs i
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.440]  believe that was the case as well and then we're going to continue on breaking down in more detail
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.200]  this jade helm operation also alex is going to have uh we got another special report from alex
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.000]  that's going to be at the bottom of the hour now i didn't do a plug last hour and we need to
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.960]  plug this because this is the way we maintain our organization this is the way we maintain
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.240]  our independence we're upfront about how we're funded unlike fox news they'll tell you to take
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.680]  the vaccines because they're pushing pharmaceutical ads the entire time that's how they support their
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.760]  operation well this is how we support our operation info wars life dot com right now

[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.600]  to paul joseph Watson right now in the uk paul thanks for joining us good to be back david you
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.840]  know i saw your article this morning about the possibility of ssri drugs in this horrific crash
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:34.240]  of the the german airliner and that's exactly what i was telling my family last night i said
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.480]  is we're listening to these these reports that they got back from the black box they hear at
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.880]  first the light knocking on the door from the other pilot then it gets very loud he's screaming
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.280]  let me in let me in and at the very last minute you hear people screaming but throughout all of
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.360]  that paul they said that the biometric sensors that they had showed that the guy who was flying
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.160]  the plane they said he didn't pass out of the controls they saw though that his biometrics
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:06.080]  were calm he didn't change his breathing he didn't change his heartbeat and when i said that i said
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.840]  how could you under those circumstances where the guy's banging on the door you hear people
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.960]  screaming in the background and you're flying this into a mountain how could that be unless the
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.240]  guy was on ssri drugs and we know that he was under psychological evaluation we know that is
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.600]  the favorite treatment of the psychiatrist is ssri drugs well yeah for those who don't know the story
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.160]  of course it came out yesterday that this plane crash was deliberate the co-pilot locked the pilot
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  out of the cockpit when he went to the bathroom and then calmly engaged in this eight minute descent
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.080]  into the mountain while as you said the microphones that the air traffic control picked up and that
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.680]  were on the cockpit voice recordings proved that he was breathing calmly throughout that whole
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.400]  procedure so he was obviously aware of what he was doing he was calmly crashing the plane
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.720]  into the side of a mountain they've since searched his apartment they found no political or religious
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.840]  motivation for him to commit not only suicide but of course mass homicide so now questions are being
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.520]  asked about you know should should we readdress the the situation with the cockpit doors because
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.280]  of course before 9 11 the cockpit doors in most airlines remained open and accessible to the pilots
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.280]  after 9 11 they introduced this rule whereby the door is automatically locked and you can only get
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:36.080]  in if somebody within the cockpit lets you in or if you enter a code so that's being discussed
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:42.560]  also being discussed is whether we need to you know have psychiatric evaluations for all pilots
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:50.640]  before they fly what's not being discussed as is the case after every incident of mass homicide
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:57.440]  particularly with mass shootings is whether or not this german wings pilot andreus lubitz
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:04.400]  was on psychiatric drugs and i sent out a tweet um five hours ago saying you know tong in cheek
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.760]  saying surely after the german wings kamikaze crash we need a total ban on all assault style
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.680]  airplanes absolutely because it's a reference to how the media frames the conversation after
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.720]  every mass shooting event to blame the gun the weapon and not to analyze what the motivation
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.880]  what the biochemical condition of the person committing the atrocity actually is that's
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.880]  we should just ban planes that's the solution because just altogether not even assault planes
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.280]  because they're all dangerous they can all be crashed and we just need to ban them as you point
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:48.160]  out this kind of detachment uh from reality this kind of detachment from what they're doing that
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.760]  is the hallmark of these drugs we've seen this over and over again we've seen this with people who
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.560]  have done this with done similar things with automobiles so it's not just guns it's not just
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.360]  planes it's automobiles it's everything the problem is the drug that's the elephant in the
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.040]  room that they won't talk about but of course they'll talk about how they're going to manipulate the
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.840]  door they'll talk about so many different other things but they won't talk about that Paul yeah
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.200]  which is interesting because it's already been confirmed basically by build which is a big respect
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:23.840]  to german newspaper that this co-pilot that crashed the plane andreus lubitz had spent 18 months
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:30.000]  under psychiatric treatment he had recently split up with his girlfriend he was suffering from quote
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.240]  depression and actually today they found documents within his apartment that suggested he was being
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.800]  treated for a mental illness which he had hidden from his employers so of course the relevant
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.760]  question to ask given that he'd been under psychiatric treatment for 18 months and in
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.560]  fact that he was under treatment during his six-month break in his flight training when
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:59.520]  his friend said he was depressed is whether or not he was on ssri drugs and what specifically
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:07.120]  those drugs were now cnn is walking back and reporting that he was never under any psychiatric
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.280]  evaluation whatsoever contradicting all these other reports which has he alluded to is interesting
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.480]  because they never talk about this link to ssri drugs in the aftermath of these mass homicide
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.840]  events and i asked the question again and again do you think it has anything to do with the fact
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.880]  that you know pharmaceutical giants who produce these psychotropic drugs like zolof prozac and
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:42.080]  paxil spend 2.4 billion dollars a year on direct tv advertising with big mainstream networks and with
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.480]  news networks like cnn and this never is a part of the national conversation after these mass
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:56.080]  homicide incidents so we can go back and look at the history of this you know james holmes the the
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:03.040]  aurora theater batman shooter yeah it took nine months for us to find out that he was on zoloft
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  which of course is directly linked through numerous studies with incidents of mania violence aggression
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.720]  homicide and suicide but they kept that under wraps for nine months until it was finally
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.080]  revealed and there are numerous other cases like that oh absolutely you know i i stopped we stopped
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.520]  watching in my family stopped watching television in terms of just sitting there and having the
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.120]  entire feed go through with all the commercials everything of course i keep abreast of what's
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.320]  going on i typically do that by watching news clips on youtube but i don't just sit there
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.240]  and leave fox news on a television channel we we couldn't get television where we were in 1993 so
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.240]  uh since that point i haven't basically listened to it so when we travel and we go into a hotel room
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:55.680]  i'm absolutely amazed paul at how one commercial after the other is about drugs and that was not
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.480]  even uh that was not done at all when i used to watch television when i would just sat there and
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.880]  watch through sat through the commercials uh that's something that's uh happened i i guess
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.360]  it's about 10 years or so ago but as you point out that's their major uh sponsors so they're
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:16.160]  going to try to walk this back we know that ssri drugs are the favorite uh candy that's
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.960]  handed out by the psychiatrists and we know the side effects of this are to exacerbate
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.440]  the very conditions that people go to the psychiatrist for if they've got depression or
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:32.080]  suicidal thoughts they hand them an ssri and if you look at the insert it says that it increases
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.240]  the likelihood that's one of the side effects that it might increase that especially if they go off
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:44.720]  of this after they become dependent on it exactly there are 22 international drug regulatory warnings
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:53.200]  on these psychiatric drugs citing effects of mania hostility violence homicidal ideation
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.120]  and that's why in dozens of examples over the past two three decades they've been linked
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.200]  with these mass shooter incidents i mean look at adam lanza look at sandy hook they kept his
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.040]  medical records under wrap despite the fact we know he had asperger's syndrome we know he was
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.640]  being treated but they covered up his medical records even after a freedom of information
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:23.360]  act request which we reported on in 2013 because according to assistant attorney general uh
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:29.680]  patrick b quaneshi if we found out what pharmaceutical psychotropic drugs adam
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:35.680]  lanza the sandy hook shooter was on it would quote cause a loss of people to stop taking their
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.240]  medication yeah you think i think we have to really question what's going on when we've
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:46.160]  got a uh a drug that's being so widely used as you pointed out 22 different places talks about
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.440]  how violent it can make people how uh suicidal it can make them how the homicidal it can make
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:57.680]  them and we see this linked in one shooting after the other yet we want to shut down medical marijuana
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.480]  we want to use violence to shut that down but send out the drug that makes people violent

[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:23.920]  the uk is paul joseph watson of course paul and alex jones have put together a very detailed report
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:31.200]  with both text and links and videos breaking down how this has been developing for several years
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:37.120]  and i want to talk to paul in this segment about how our reporting is being spun by the mainstream
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.960]  media and then we're going to talk in the next segment we're going to play some clips on the
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.640]  next segment from the way this is being sold at the county commissioner level by the military so
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.240]  we're going to play a few clips and and comment on how they're conducting this psychological
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.760]  operation and that's what it is that's what unconventional warfare is it is a psychological
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.200]  operation it is an info war they know they've been losing the info more we can see how
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:07.680]  they've been mismanaging this for example by first claiming that it doesn't exist that it's just a
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.800]  figment of our imagination oh they can't see the documents they can't follow the links to
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:18.240]  scribed let alone come to our site and then we see that same approach being done by the mainstream
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:25.040]  media most of them refusing to even mention info wars or tell people where they can see our presentation
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.920]  of what's going on here of course they even when they do they usually spin it about the only one
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:37.280]  that i've seen that was fair and balanced was a daily mail certainly not fox news paul what about
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:42.560]  the way they're spinning this they're really creating a straw man saying that you know we're
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.400]  claiming that the government is going to mark launch marshal law this summer that was never the claim
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  they're saying that once everybody sees that marshal law doesn't happen this summer than
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:56.080]  everything that we've been telling people all the documents that we've been showing people
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.720]  that'll all be discredited well yeah as you mentioned you know fox news last night came out and
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:10.800]  named a libertarian talk show host in austin texas they dare not name alex jones or info wars
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.600]  they're perfectly happy to do so if they're demonizing us yeah of course then they'll throw
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.480]  alex's name all around but if you know if we've actually got some content and some information
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.760]  that's serious and important i wouldn't mind it uh i wouldn't mind it at all if they had said libertarian
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:32.480]  but actually they said he was right wing i would say that fox news is right wing r e i c h but uh
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.280]  yeah they said we were right wing and then i got picked up by a libertarian source meaning uh drudge
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.000]  is what they were saying on that pretty so they then even mentioned drudging out it's amazing
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.600]  yeah they didn't mention you know you were talking about it earlier in the show even gawker came out
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:54.080]  last night and said that it was quote unsettling and gawker is a left wing washington dc i think
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:01.520]  is based in dc gossip rag that routinely sides with the democratic party and normally repeats all this
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.880]  you know right wing conspiracy rhetoric about us being extremists and you know fringe believers
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.720]  so the fact that even they called it unsettling and they drew attention to the logo for this exercise
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:19.120]  which is um i think it's a knife surrounded by arrows which is pretty creepy they called it creeping
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.000]  fascism i think that's a perfect description of this i think that's a perfect description this
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.160]  this article that you put together with alex jones really does lay out the creeping fascism that we
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.800]  see developing here i think that's very important i think that was a a wonderful way to characterize
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.960]  that if you want to put it and boil it down to two words it is creeping fascism we're not saying
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.880]  that it's going to be martial law we're not saying that training is against posse comitatus but you
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.400]  know there's something wrong when you're training to take over the country when you're training
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:56.560]  against americans and that quite obviously is what they're doing here paul you cannot deny david that
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:02.320]  this training is at least dual purpose obviously yes it's designed for foreign occupations which
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.840]  have been pretty disastrous over the past 10 years i think you will agree so even that in
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.920]  and of itself is a concern but it's also domestic to claim that this is not also for domestic
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:21.120]  preparation is completely deluded if you actually read the army's documents which have leaked over
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:28.240]  the past several years specifically the 2012 us army military police training manual civil
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:34.880]  disturbance operations the the clue is in the name civil and throughout that document they
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:41.600]  make clear that this is for yes overseas operations but it's also for conus within the continental
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.680]  united states and when that came out i was neurotic about documenting with screenshots which
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.960]  can see in the linked original article where they repeatedly mentioned that this is for
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:29:00.320]  for within the united states or us territories during civil support operations that's a direct
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:07.280]  quote and of course it lays out plans to kill rioters to reeducate people who resist to support
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.960]  quote us policies so this is domestic and that's what this whole article is about
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.840]  is about pinpointing the fact that this whole preparation over the past 10 20 years has been
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.840]  for domestic purposes but according to the mainstream media that's a fringe conspiracy
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.480]  theory we got to go to break we're going to come back and we're going to listen to what
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.080]  they're telling people at the county commissioners offices and of course as you point out in your
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.000]  other article paul that in jade helms and jade helm the troops are going to be operating undetected
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.840]  amongst the civilian population how does it help them to practice their ability to blend in in the

[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  know as we're talking about the many things that can happen whether it's a financial breakdown
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:03.520]  whether it's a a grid breakdown of power supply or whether it is some kind of martial law in the
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:08.880]  future you need to be as healthy as possible if you're not if you've got major health problems
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.040]  you're not going to make it very long because there isn't going to be any health infrastructure so
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.800]  one of the ways that you can prepare for yourself prepare your family prepare your loved ones is to
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.920]  maintain your health so the way we support the operation and we need your support let's go back
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:29.760]  to paul paul i've got some audio clips here from the presentation that was made to brazos county
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.480]  this is uh these are some audio clips as they made their case and i wanted to play a little bit
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.400]  of these things and get your response to this let's go to the first audio clip here this is where
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.680]  they introduced themselves to the county commissioners i just want to bring greetings from fort bragg
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.680]  north carolina and lieutenant general charles cleveland commander of united states army special
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:58.720]  operations command uh at fort bragg uh my name is tom mead i'm a retired 20 year veteran of
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:07.120]  united states army special forces we're we're here to discuss and exercise and the purpose for
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.400]  for us being here today is we're seeking written up uh invitation approval from local officials
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  to be able to conduct a realistic military training exercise within brasses county within
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.320]  the process one of the biggest things is obviously the letter of invitation from local officials
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.280]  from the county commissioners also we coordinate very closely with all of our law enforcement folks
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.240]  we've already met with the state dps yesterday i had the privilege of meeting with the sheriff
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:42.720]  and the chief deputy and explaining the exercise in thorough depth with them okay so he's already
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.080]  met with the state officials he's uh met with law enforcement he needs a letter of invitation
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.720]  um don't you think that's kind of unusual i mean if i was a county commissioner i would kind of
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.040]  ask him uh you know why is it that uh he's going to tell them in the next segment he's going to
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.800]  tell them oh yeah we do this kind of stuff all the time but they don't do this kind of stuff
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.040]  all the time the fact that they need a letter of invitation to do this i think is kind of amazing
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.240]  but paul they also have their agenda completely planned out they know exactly where they're
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.360]  going to go what they're going to do the rest of that meeting is basically telling them
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.880]  what they're going to do but just like agenda 21 they need to ask your permission for it make
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.320]  it seem like it's coming from you yeah that's that's the classic method they use it called the
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:30.320]  delphi technique if you involve people with that decision make them feel part of it make them feel
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:35.120]  you know joined together with you then you know they're invested in it so that gives them more reason
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.880]  to not only go along with it but promote it and um you know be a be a part of it themselves
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.080]  but the important point here and you touched upon it before the break is okay there's firstly
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:51.600]  a contradiction in the army says this won't affect americans day to day they will they will
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:57.360]  barely even notice that these training exercises are going on yet we're going to infiltrate troops
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:05.120]  amongst the local population to try and trigger them to report suspicious activity if these infiltration
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.560]  techniques fail which they're trying to perfect so that's a contradiction but then the biggest
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:17.680]  contradiction is that they claim this is for overseas operations yet they're infiltrating
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:24.880]  people within the the community of american citizens if they try and infiltrate people in
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:31.120]  cities and towns abroad in places like iraq and afghanistan of course they're going to be unsuccessful
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:37.120]  they have different cultures different customs and you know most of the us military is either white
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.640]  black or hispanic so of course they're not going to successfully infiltrate themselves
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:49.680]  amongst local populations in middle eastern countries so how on earth can they claim that
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:56.720]  this is directed towards overseas operations when such training would be it just wouldn't apply
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.680]  because of course they'd be they'd be ratted out and known for infiltrating foreign populations
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.040]  when they're white black or hispanic it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever very true is
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:13.360]  geared towards domestic infiltration and and civil operations if they're going to dress up
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.080]  in a manner that they would blend in in a middle eastern country they would stick out like major
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.480]  store thumbs and vice versa if they're going to practice blending in here with americans and
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:27.760]  then go abroad that isn't going to help them at all but paul we know as they were running these
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:33.360]  drills in the last couple of years in major urban cities in cooperation with the police
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:38.000]  they said if you're going to attack the mountains you train in the mountains if you're going to
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.240]  attack in the desert you train in the desert we train for where we're going to fight that's why
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.920]  we're here in the cities working with the police and we said at the time you're not going to be
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.360]  working in cooperation with the police when you invade iran or whatever right that's but
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.920]  this even goes beyond that when you look at this gocker article one things he said here well
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.880]  if even if it's just a routine exercise meant to simulate a future middle eastern war zone
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:08.560]  inside of america i've never seen any scenario come out that they have a future middle eastern
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:13.600]  war zone inside of america that's nonsense they've never planned for that they've always planned
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.120]  for domestic operations and that's what they're doing at these forts like ap hill camp lejeune
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.320]  when we went to the asymmetric warfare center that's the thing if he thinks that this is kind of a
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:31.920]  creepy unsettling fascism he needs to go to that asymmetric warfare center that bigs and i walk
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:36.720]  through and look at how they've got a detailed model of an american city if you wanted to do
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.280]  practice urban warfare you could do that like they've done in the past set up a bombed out city in
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:46.480]  the desert that's just walls and with no windows or doors and they can practice going house to house
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:52.560]  they have a very detailed very detailed model of an american city with everything intact they go
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.920]  there they train with the military they train with police forces in these asymmetric warfare centers
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.400]  they're trying to move out take it to the next step move out of those local training facilities
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.360]  because even though they've got bases everywhere now they're working on a warfare scenario that's
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.240]  going to last a couple of months yeah and in the past they have had those you know remote locations
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:21.040]  where they just set up temporary building structures to approximate middle eastern towns and cities
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:27.120]  now as you saw with the fake city in virginia you know the subway signs were in english
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.480]  there was a if i remember correctly a christian chapel there the media report said it was a
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:37.600]  mosque maybe there was both you could clear that up in a second they had both of them there yes yeah
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  but on again on that point they're talking about we need to practice infiltrating local populations
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:50.080]  overseas how could you possibly practice that if you're infiltrating local populations in america
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.280]  where the race of people is completely different the customs the culture are completely different
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.920]  it's as ridiculous if you remember the movie team america where the special forces agent goes and tries
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:07.440]  to infiltrate the terrorists he goes to like a bar or a cafe and he's just repeating over and over
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.440]  again alorak bar alorak bar it's as ridiculous as that how can they be training to infiltrate
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.720]  you know foreign populations by infiltrating americans who are completely different in race
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.760]  culture and customs it makes no sense yes they train how they're going to fight we all know that
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.640]  that's common sense but they're trying to obfuscate that and let's go to this clip on unconventional
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.360]  warfare this is when he defines for them what they're really going to be doing because that's
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:39.520]  essentially it's not realistic military training megan kelly it is unconventional warfare look it
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.520]  up here's what he says about it to put unconventional warfare into a perspective you you see it a
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:50.240]  couple different places up there unconventional warfare and i'll explain that from a historical
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:57.280]  perspective so um conventional warfare is troops on troops tanks on tanks uniform enemy
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:03.600]  against uniform enemy is the way conventional warfare is is generally defined unconventional
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:10.080]  warfare from a historical perspective if you think of world war two germany came in and they took
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:16.240]  over france the french did not want them there they formed the french underground the french
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:24.160]  underground conducted activities such as subversion and sabotage they would hit logistics lines to uh
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:32.800]  to to demoralize the the um germans so what a lot of folks don't know is there were american
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:39.600]  advisors with the french underground throughout world war two assisting them in planning and
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:46.880]  conducting those types of activities since 1952 united states army special forces has had the
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:54.000]  charters conduct unconventional warfare throughout the globe the last 15 years we have been in afghan
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:00.880] istan and iraq we've been doing more of a counterinsurgency role rather than being able to enable
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:08.160]  an insurgency across the globe so there you go he talks about the french underground he talks
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.080]  about an insurgency said yeah we were with the good guys we were with the french trying to kick
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.120]  out the people who had invaded their country but of course now lately we have been on the other side
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.600]  we've been on the counterinsurgency and when you look at asymmetric warfare that's what they are
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:28.320]  totally obsessed with is is counterinsurgency but paul i want to read again this excerpt from
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:33.520]  the wikipedia article about unconventional warfare basically drawing on pentagon documents
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:40.320]  unconventional warfare is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence capitulation
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:46.080]  or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict so if these guys had gone into the uh
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:52.320]  to the county commissioners and shown them this map that has texas listed as hostile and said you
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:59.360]  know we're practicing uh uh covert uh tactics and weapons to create an environment of subversion
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.360]  or intimidation we've got the general long-term goals of coercive or subversive uh uh that are
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.920]  to a political party and here's the map where you're considered to be the hostels do you think
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.000]  that uh they would approve that i mean maybe they would but i mean that would be pretty unsettling
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.600]  and if people understood what unconventional warfare is it would be unsettling but people
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.400]  don't bother to even look at what the military is talking about when they talk about unconventional
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:30.800]  warfare no they it's it's a surface level understanding they don't even scratch below
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.920]  the surface and it's just you know rah rah rah we must support the u.s military and then in even in
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:41.200]  that clip you played you know he's obviously trying to associate the u.s army with the venerable
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:47.440]  historical example of the french resistance but as he said that's not how it works anymore no
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  we advised or the u.s government advised and funded the ukrainian opposition which was staffed by
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.800]  neo-nazi paramilitaries which overthrew a democratically elected government so to compare
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.600]  what the u.s army and the u.s government does now and compare it to you know the french resistance
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:13.280]  who fought the nazis is completely hypocritical you know the u.s government supported the radical
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:19.360]  jihadists in libya to overthrow that government which led to complete disaster throughout the
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:26.480]  region and the rise of isis so really to make that um connection between you know supporting
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.000]  the french resistance to what we do now is completely asinine yeah it's totally a sigh-up
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.600]  and remember that when we started reporting on this that uh joe begs got a email from a friend
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.920]  of his now works for socom he says shut up you're going to ruin the sigh-up well of course that's
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.640]  what unconventional warfare largely is going on with this wikipedia article for example which
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.280]  again is drawn from pentagon documents they say unconventional warfare targets civilian
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.640]  population psychologically psychologically to win the hearts and minds it only targets military
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:04.000]  and political bodies directly seeking to render the military proficiency of the enemy irrelevant
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.920]  limited conventional warfare can be used unconventionally or to demonstrate might and power so
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.760]  how they're going to demonstrate their might and power how are they going to use this sigh-up on
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:20.960]  the people here in texas let's play that clip where they were talking about who to hit and kind
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:26.000]  of describes what they're going to be doing to put unconventional warfare into a perspective
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.640]  you see it a couple different places up there unconventional warfare and i'll explain that
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:36.720]  from a historical perspective so um that's the answer that's the uh unconventional warfare
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:44.160]  let's go the one who to hit coming in doing the hit and extract uh time on ground would be maybe
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:50.400]  15 to 20 minutes of exposure then that's it never got can we recommend some places to you to hit
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:58.640]  you know every county that we have briefed has done that for us also or maybe places our people
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.280]  yeah there you go so he says they're going to be popping in and popping out just going to be a
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.840]  few minutes there you know let's pick up the texans that are on the red list or the blue list
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:16.000]  and then you got a politician there saying can we suggest some people or places to hit and he says
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.360]  yeah everybody says that can we give this presentation there you go paul your comment
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.640]  it's amazing and you know again it has to be backed up by this history which we've documented
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:34.320]  over the past you know alex has done it for 20 years in this article and info was i go back
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:42.960]  probably 10 11 years to things such as the 2006 um pastor training program which femur ran which
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:49.200]  climatized people to follow the herd to obey the religious representatives in the community
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:55.440]  when the government declares martial law for over a year afterwards we were called conspiracy
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.680]  theorists paranoid right-wing lunatics just as we are being called now for even talking about that
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.760]  because i think it was it was alex's family members and people that called into the show that
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:11.200]  blew the whistle on that over a year later the mainstream news station reported on it and alex
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:18.320]  has played that clip numerous times confirming that this indeed was a program to um hire recruit
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:26.000]  religious representatives in communities across america to force people to obey martial law dictates
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.240]  during civil emergency conditions in the united states so again we were proven right and of course
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:37.600]  to identify paranoid lunatics at the time a year later it's confirmed by the mainstream media
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.680]  that's right paul and of course i as alex has pointed out to identify the people who are going
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:46.800]  to be willing participants to work with them just roll it out as some kind of an emergency
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:51.520]  operation as opposed to a martial law and of course that's one of the objectives of unconventional
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:50:00.320]  warfare to train equip any and advise locals who seek regime change that's it seek regime change
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:05.440]  so uh yeah can we suggest for you some people in places to hit that's the way they joke about it
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  it walking right along the same page with these people it is very disturbing to see this happen
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.160]  it is very disturbing to see them increasing the militarization of the police increasingly
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.200]  using the military and training the military here in in conus and continental united states
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.560]  this is what we're concerned about and many people are starting to see this it isn't just
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.320]  people on the left or on the right or libertarians everybody is starting to see this militarization
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.160]  that we've been talking about for a very long time that alex jones has done documentaries
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:43.440]  about police state america for a very long time this is how it breaks down it is a creeping fascism
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.880]  stay with us we're going to be right back with paul joseph watson we're going to continue to break

[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.320]  welcome back to the alex show i'm david night and joining me from the uk is paul joseph watson
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:24.800]  and of course there's the article on info wars.com that's put together by paul and alex jones breaking
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:32.560]  down what the writer from gawker very accurately termed a creeping fascism beyond denial preparations
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.520]  for martial law in america the federal government of the u.s army have been readying for domestic
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:44.720]  unrest for decades and preparations are accelerating exponentially that's the point that's what we're
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:48.640]  saying and of course they're creating a straw man and saying well info wars are saying that
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.800]  there's going to be a martial law breaking out in this summer we never said that we never said
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.000]  that that's a straw man that they created so they could then pull that apart very easily no this is
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.960]  something that has been developing for quite some time it was disturbing enough last year to walk
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:11.520]  through the streets of a replica american city where they were training to take it over with
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.960]  military as well as law enforcement that's where they trained for that they don't need to do that
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.200]  if they're training for a foreign war when you look at these burned out shells of buildings
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.600]  that's the kind of warfare they could easily train for in a desert environment for where
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.480]  they would be fighting in the middle east but of course they tell us that the enemy and this is why
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:37.600]  the people on the right who love to back this up all think it's for the muslims abroad so they're
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:44.000]  all for it no this is for you you just don't realize it it's just a beard and so this is an
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.960]  article that paul joseph watson has put together with alex jones take a look at this pass this
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:55.680]  around especially if you know somebody that is in the military in the in law enforcement show them
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.000]  this article that's what they need to understand is the background behind this how this has been
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.360]  building for a very long time and it becomes more and more obvious with every exercise that they do
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.600]  paul you talked about one of the articles that you've got in here is a pentagon this is back in
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.840]  2008 for example there's so many of these things that we could pick up here here's just one pentagon
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:24.000]  to detail troops to bolster domestic security now back in 2008 they were saying that by 2011
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.680]  they would have 20 000 uniformed troops inside the u.s trained to help state and local officials
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:36.240]  respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophes so we see this convergence
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:41.760]  of the military and of law enforcement very troubling to anybody who understands history
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:49.120]  exactly and actually a couple of years after that in um february 2013 the department of defense
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:55.520]  and this was also in the article issued a quote instruction which altered the u.s code applying
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.440]  to the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement which basically they gave themselves
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:09.520]  permission to quote quell civil disturbances domestically without presidential authorization
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:15.760]  so again completely over overriding posicumitatus and then you have things stretching back to the
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:22.320]  60s operation garden plot this was a department of defense civil disturbance plan to deal with
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:30.640]  expected racial unrest in america in the 1960s of course since ferguson last year we've seen that
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:36.800]  build up primarily as a result of the holder justice department and the obama administration
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.480]  fueling it they had that plan in place to deal with civil disturbance domestic unrest they also
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:48.320]  had rex 84 which was based around an influx of illegal aliens but eventually geared towards
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:55.440]  locking up dissidents within the united states so all of these programs have domestic applications
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:01.520]  and this is partly what the army is training for they're expecting widespread unrest in america
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:06.000]  and then of course they spin it they say well your training is not a violation of posicumitatus
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.480]  and it's like no but you are training to violate posicumitatus you're training for martial law
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.880]  that's the problem stay with us we're going to be right back talking to paul joseph whatson about

[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:34.320]  going to be with us we're going to take some of your calls on operation jade helm or the jade
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:44.240]  helm exercise i guess that's the way the military would put it 800-259-9231 that's 800-259-9231 now of
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.040]  course we also have some specials i want to get to that before we get to go back to paul
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.320]  we have dna force is just a couple of more days that is on special uh it's for the first time ever
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:01.920]  it's below 100 30 off its dna force at info wars life dot com very important to preserve your
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.200]  mitochondrial health well what is that you might say well that's your dna if you look at the
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.800]  telomeres and the dna that is a very accurate predictor of the length of life that you have
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:19.280]  left you need to protect your dna from the kinds of toxins that we find in the air in the food that
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:24.080]  we drink and boost its health that's one of the best things you can do is try to keep yourself
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.760]  healthy instead of trying to address problems after they've developed so right now you can get dna
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.160]  force 30 off under a hundred dollars for the first time and it's very expensive because of the bio
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:44.080]  qq that is a pq that's in there it's a very um it's bio pqq i'm sorry it's very important
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:51.920]  essential element that's there that's a formula that we don't have available in any other format
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:02:00.560]  so that's in the dna format dna force available for 30 off i want to go back paul to talk about
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.600]  how this has been rolling out i think a lot of people woke up when we saw indefinite attention
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:11.440]  without by the military without a trial the fact that they could render people out that appeared in
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.320]  the india just a couple of years ago and of course obama first said he wasn't going to sign it
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.800]  and then he signed it on new year's eve and then he said don't worry i'm not going to use it no it'll
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.160]  be for somebody else coming in but you know paul there was something else that happened that wasn't
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.320]  widely reported last summer there was also a uh prepositioning as they're positioning these
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:36.080]  m wraps to these police stations everywhere and everyone's getting concerned about that
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:41.680]  there had been a program for decades going back to 1950s where they were supplying firemen fire
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:47.280]  stations small fire stations with surplus military equipment because they really need to help you've
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.880]  got these small rural fire departments that are putting out about 80 percent of the large wildfires
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.200]  and they don't have large budgets so they were getting surplus military equipment and the pentagon
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.480]  shut that down as they were trying to push these m wraps to every police department throughout the
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.680]  country i thought that was amazing that they would shut that program down of course they got it put
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:14.240]  back in the firemen the local firemen are very vocal they got that uh reestablished but to me
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:19.520]  that showed that they were really focused on equipping the local police departments for martial
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:28.320]  war and martial law exactly and that's proven by what the new hampshire police chief said in 2013
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.800]  and this was the subject of former marine corps colonel peter martino's testimony at that council
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:42.000]  meeting because the police chief in his application or his justification for purchasing this bearcat
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:49.600]  armored vehicle was quote the threat posed by libertarian sovereign citizens and occupy activists
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:56.000]  in the region so this was specifically targeted not at criminals who would you know commit mass
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.120]  rampages and gun crime but at political activists in the region of new hampshire so it was in it was
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:08.400]  in plain sight that this what this was what the militarization of the law enforcement in that
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.760]  region was geared towards so that's not us saying it that was the police chief of new hampshire
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:19.840]  saying it yes and it was also uh someone who was a former marine who was very very concerned but he
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.160]  came in the studio and talked to us about that he said why do you need to be more heavily equipped
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:29.200]  than my soldiers were when they were fighting in iraq let's go to anthony and michigan anthony

[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:48.560]  phone call right now we had to go to break anthony but you were just talking about operation jade
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:55.360]  helm go ahead yeah on your page there and it said you're the um jade helm emblem there right at
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:01.680]  the bottom of the emblem there it says control human domain i mean you know we're 18 trillion in
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.440]  debt now how can we let the government have our health care and everything else i mean
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:10.640]  we as american people need to wake up and start taking more control of our lives absolutely it's
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:18.320]  not to be anti-military to say that there has to be some uh some understanding of what the scope
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:22.400]  and the mission of the military is that should be determined by the people we should have this
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:27.840]  discussion but if you have that discussion you're not a real patriot are you let's let's play that
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.640]  clip that we have where this is uh we played several clips in the last half hour from the
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.320]  military making the presentation to a uh one of the counties around here it was brazos county
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:45.040]  and i want to play this clip here where he basically appeals to them they want to have a
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.480]  permission to come in they want a letter of permission but they've already worked out
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.680]  what they're going to do but he says why are we coming to texas here's what he says why did we
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:11:00.640]  choose texas number one we've done exercises within texas we've been doing them here in texas for
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:09.200]  years uh the uh one of the things that we have always found about coming to texas and i know jr
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:14.560]  and i i if you count all the mileage that he and i have done we've probably traveled back and forth
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:21.600]  across the state of texas probably about 10 times already uh since uh july of last year um but
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:29.520]  we have not ran into anyone who is not willing to help us out because they understand texas
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:35.920]  understand that we're training these guys to go out and be able to prepare our airmen soldiers
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.880]  and sailors to be able to go out and do the business of the united states military across the globe
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:51.040]  and we appreciate that um texas are very supportive of everything yeah they're not training people
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:57.280]  to go out and support america across the globe they're practicing for operations here in america
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:04.800]  as we just said in the last segment uh they're practicing on how to blend in and operate covertly
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.760]  in america that's not going to help them abroad but of course real texas support the military no
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.120]  matter how vague no matter how secretive their mission is no matter how obvious that mission
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:23.680]  is targeted towards domestic operations this is a sigh out paul well exactly david and there's
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.400]  more information coming about this there's a mint press article which you know kind of
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.880]  blames us for saying it's the apocalypse and a martial law takeover which we never said
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:39.040]  but also some interesting commentary on what these exercises might entail quote america's
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:44.800]  special forces will most likely have to evade capture by local law enforcement suspicious
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:50.880]  citizens and whatever military unit is turned loose to try to catch them one source believes the
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:58.400]  force from the joax will become the quote bad guys and try to catch the crf troops while they
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.720]  attempt to make their way undetected to a safe country which translates as the blues the blue
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:10.400]  states on the map the non hostile state but again this is being conducted in america which is
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.960]  completely removed completely different from the environment the customs the culture that they would
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:22.000]  be expected to encounter overseas in places like the middle east so as he said it appears to be
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.600]  geared towards infiltrating america more so than overseas countries because the the environment
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:32.000]  would be completely different the people would be completely different it makes little sense
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.080]  absolutely and of course these uh labels of hostile and friendly are drawn along political
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.360]  lines for the most part even using the what's now become the traditional colors of blue and red
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:49.360]  for different political factions any other comments anthony before we move on i was just
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:55.360]  wondering you know why you know us as american people we can see this going on but our politicians
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:59.280]  just starting to wait till what's going on and standing up for our rights and privileges they're
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:05.040]  just being bought and controlled by we need end lobbying we need to stop lobbying period let's
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.960]  file some petitions and let's let's stop lobbying altogether period well you know i think that a
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.320]  lot of these you know anthony i think a lot of these politicians uh are are not really understanding
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:20.640]  what's going on they're being given one line by the military they're being manipulated as we talked
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:25.840]  about earlier there's a very uh obvious ran corporation technique the delphi technique
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:32.240]  they use it for agenda 21 they know that they can get these uh people uh to buy into this agenda
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.680]  thinking that uh they're this part of their agenda we need to come to them you need to come to the
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.320]  people in your area if you're in one of these areas and try to educate these county commissioners
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.880]  tell them what this is really about have them look at what unconventional warfare is they're not
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:52.400]  even questioning what that is and of course they're giving a different version of this as we played
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:55.920]  for you when they present this to the county commissioners they're not breaking down for them
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:01.120]  really what unconventional warfare is they're not really showing them what that is let's go to uh
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:10.000]  michael in wyoming michael uh go ahead michael you're glad to be on glad to be on the show i
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:20.960]  appreciate your time thank you uh i am a uh 21 year veteran uh in the navy and i i retired in 2013
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:27.520]  and lately i've just been listening to the show and gathering it all in and trying to figure out
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:31.760]  what i can do you know to kick it into action because i feel like i need to do something
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:43.120]  um i heard sheriff mac on the radio the other day with the csp oa and i realized that it is pretty
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:48.880]  much my duty since i'm not on the wrong side of the law and i live in a rural area and i happen
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.840]  to know that my sheriff is a conservative that i needed to approach him and make sure that he
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:16:02.640]  was aware of what was going on with jade helm and all this um and i felt like i wanted to reach out
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:09.040]  to other veterans and let them know that they're important and they have a duty still even though
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:15.040]  they're retired or they've returned and they're inactive they need to get with their local
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:20.480]  peace officers especially in the rural areas where it is more conservative and make sure
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.840]  that they can give whatever support that they can give their their sheriff's department and their
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:31.120]  peace officers absolutely i think it's very much an educational issue i just as i was just saying
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:36.320]  in many cases they're being given disinformation they need the other side they need the fact so
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.880]  that they can make a decision they're going to get a very skewed presentation from the
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:44.720]  military as we were just playing for you they're not going to get all the facts there certainly
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.360]  aren't going to have the background to see where this has all been coming from so many of these guys
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.280]  they look at the military equipment that's coming to them from the pentagon that surplus i go hey
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:58.080]  this is great they're just going to give this to us for free they don't see many of them what's
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:03.040]  going on and so if we educate them and they know what's going on and they still agree with it then
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:09.920]  that's a different scenario but in many cases they don't even know what's behind this paul yeah i think
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:16.000]  that's the point and also you know some of the people involved in this drill in 10 15 years time
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:21.600]  they're going to be the ones who are demonized as disgruntled violent veterans by the department of
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:28.800]  homeland security you know this this kind of came to fruition in 2009 when the dhs came out and said
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:34.960]  that veteran returning veterans were disgruntled about the takeover of the united states that was
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:40.160]  in their own document they didn't put the word takeover in quotation so it wasn't as if this
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:46.000]  was a claim that the veterans were making it was as if that yes it was the dhs saying this is a
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.840]  takeover the veterans are concerned about it this is why we need to combat them and repeatedly we've
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:58.160]  seen demonizations you know dhs intelligence assessments the boy scout explorers being trained
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:04.400]  to kill quote disgruntled iraq war veterans according to the new york times so that first
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:12.000]  kind of emerged back in 2009 it's an intensified sense with police being quote armed for war to
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.440]  take on returning veterans so some of the people involved in this exercise are inevitably going
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:23.360]  to be demonized later on when they return to the civilian population so absolutely you know we need
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:28.720]  to reach out to them and take hope in the fact that a lot of these surveys they do about you know
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:35.360]  will you disarm the american people the majority of um us army individuals say no they won't so
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.160]  that's a positive thing to hold on to they do seem to be more educated than the general population
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.200]  yes it's an information war it's an information war for the veterans it's an information war for
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.320]  your local politicians who are buying into this and especially for local law enforcement they
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:55.760]  need to understand how important it is that they maintain local control of law enforcement that
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.600]  they don't get everything in a hierarchical structure under homeland security that they
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:04.880]  don't militarize local law enforcement that's very very important let's go to uh land shark in
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:13.760]  Nevada land shark hi how are you hey go ahead hi uh my name is uh well land shark um i'm a former

[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:45.440]  that if asked by the president to disarm the american population you would do so and you
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:49.920]  had to sign it and you had to turn it in well half the guys threw them away and the other half

[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.920]  we have paul joseph watson with us from the uk and just before we went to the break we had someone
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:35.600]  calling us from nevada landshark saying that he was a former navy seal landshark can you go back
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:39.920]  and break that down from the point you were talking about your experiences a navy seal especially the
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.640]  documents that you said that they gave you to sign we didn't have time to uh to go through that before
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.880]  we had to take a commercial break and a lot of people uh are joining us now so could you begin
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:55.680]  that from the beginning uh yeah we were handed a stack of papers to sign and this is about the
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:01.760]  dozen or so guys that i was working with directly and we were told we had to sign them if we didn't
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:06.880]  sign them then uh we would no longer have the positions that we had meaning the tactical
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.840]  positions that we had uh so a lot of people signed them mickey mouse donald duck and put
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.640]  him back and everybody went to lunch came back and the stack of papers was gone um i managed
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:22.640]  to throw mine away but i became incredibly disillusioned with my job uh a year later i
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.320]  wanted to get out you know i just i discovered that i was no longer supporting and defending
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:36.000]  the constitution i was suddenly going to be a pawn for for the politicians and and what were
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.520]  these papers that you had to sign what were they saying that you would do or would not do
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:46.240]  stating that we if we were asked to we would uh go door to door and disarm the american population
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:52.160]  yeah that's what we've been saying a lot of people have reported that how do you feel about
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:57.280]  this jade helm exercise because this is all special forces this is a couple of months this
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:03.360]  is in america do you find it credible that they are working uh to practice uh covert operations
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:07.520]  their ability to basically blend in in the local community that that's going to be helpful for them
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:15.440]  abroad i think it's a test run um it's a test run for future events um we want to see how this goes
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:20.000]  just like when they handed us the pieces of paper and asking us to sign that we would disarm the
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.160]  population or should they just wanted to see what kind of reaction it would get and they got the
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:31.920]  reaction and realized they couldn't do it back in 1995 96 back when i was when i was in that's right
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.760]  this is a test for the military as well as for the local areas where they're going to be having
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:41.680]  these exercises this is a scyop that has uh many different objectives doesn't it yes they're uh
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:48.000]  they're just uh they want to see how this one goes and texas is probably going to be one of the
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.640]  more difficult states because you have a lot of people that believe in the constitution there
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:56.240]  yes yes uh paul did you want to ask uh lane shark anything
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:02.560]  yeah just to touch on that again this this whole idea of military officers being asked if they will
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.720]  fire upon and disarm american citizens has repeatedly cropped up of course ben smith the
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:14.480]  former um navy seal came on the alex germshaw and affirmed that that was indeed the case that
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:20.240]  they were being asked that we also had nobel peace prize nominee jim garrow who said that the
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.760]  new litmus test for military leaders would be whether or not they will obey this order to fire
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:34.800]  on us citizens then the 29 palm survey in california may 1994 asked the same question would they fire
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:40.640]  upon us citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms so the fact that that was leaked by
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.360]  members of the military who were incensed that they would even be asked that question is a very
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:51.280]  positive thing because it shows us where their loyalties lie absolutely thank you so much land
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:55.920]  shark uh thank you for your loyalty to the constitution and thank you for adding your
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:02.160]  voice to yet another uh saying that this is what they are asking of officers in the military thank
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:10.960]  you so much uh let's go to md in istanbul md yes hello good good morning for you guys for me
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.880]  it's already evening uh what are you doing in istanbul are you uh do you live there are you in
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:23.040]  the military no i'm not in the military i live here i work there and i'm as a matter of fact
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:30.720]  not an american nor am i related to america okay i do know certain stuff and i would like to
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:38.960]  share that with you guys sure go ahead and all those purges uh operation dates the helmet and all
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:44.800]  these uh other stuff like when you guys talk about globalist and stuff like that it's all
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:51.600]  related to one global system and i'm i'm calling you guys because i believe that our state is
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:57.840]  interconnected the people in the united states are the only people who are armed to the peace
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:06.960]  the government has no control over them and you have served your useful time uh lifetime
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:13.760]  and this is why at the end of the resistance of the three people american people have they
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:21.680]  have to get rid of the american people and the system is being controlled in uh in the united

[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:27.680]  with operation j tam now people are waking up all over the world so they are expecting some sort of
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:34.960]  a resistance all over the world this is why we're heading towards a global conflict yes absolutely
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:39.520]  and you know it's it's not just you saying this in istanbul we had james madison essentially
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.800]  say that if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will come in the guise of fighting a foreign
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:51.600]  enemy paul your comments before we go to alex's report well basically america is the bulwark
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.160]  against tyranny there's never going to be a hot tyranny in america so long as you're armed you know
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:02.880]  there are 70 to 80 million gun owners 300 million guns in the united states that's 300 times the
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:09.280]  amount possessed by the police you can't have a tyranny so long as that's the case so it would be
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:15.280]  absolute lunacy for the law enforcement authorities or the military to conduct these disarmament
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.320]  procedures these door-to-door procedures which is why for the moment it's not going to happen
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:25.760]  and that is your main protection against it absolutely they're looking for a way to not
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:29.840]  have to go to the door they can just take all of our ammunition that's why they focus that on
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:35.040]  gun control let's go to alex jones report thank you so much paul joseph watson from the uk this is
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:50.960]  alex jones on russia's underground shelters building built in anticipation of a nuclear war
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.880]  america is a captured nation to a great extent we're dominated by foreign offshore corporations
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:07.040]  that's not even a secret anymore cnbc you name it comes out admits we're under global government
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:14.560]  run by private offshore central banks is this global governance at last is it one world the
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:19.600]  central bankers in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do of
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:25.520]  course we are we are absolutely slaves to central banks and that's how it always works when we were
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.240]  trying to expose the globalist takeover 20 years ago they said it wasn't happening we said that it
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.040]  was specifically not just a global corporate conspiracy but that it was run by private families
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:40.720]  owning the world's central banks and now it's admitted we told you there was a plan to militarize
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:47.440]  the police 20 years ago and were attacked all over the national news now it's admitted they don't
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:54.000]  want to debate something before they've completed its establishment they want to debate it after
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.480]  it's in place and then ridicule those that dare even criticize it these are the tactics used we
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:05.600]  knew obama care had death panels we knew it had all these nightmarish provisions in it to
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:12.000]  raise taxes on poor people and the middle class alike but the system played us like fools the
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  general population and kept denying denying denying that it was in the bill even though the bill was
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.120]  public but with things like the north american union treaty and the security and prosperity
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:28.720]  partnership and the asian union they're just keeping those completely secret now i'm going to
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:38.080]  get into a story an issue that if we can understand this it's what i call a rosetta stone it will
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:43.040]  decode everything else and there are a lot of these stories out there but this one is one of the
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:47.440]  biggest and i've talked about it before but never never shot a special report so i'm going to spend
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:54.800]  a few minutes tonight talking about an issue that is one of the most important on our planet and if
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:39:00.320]  we understand this it's a doorway to a wider world and that's what we're trying to do here at
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:06.160]  info wars.com we wear our bias of telling the truth and being pro-human and pro-freedom on our
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:12.720]  sleeves openly we're here to show you the hat trick we're here to show you how the scam works
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:19.440]  because we believe in economies based on quality and honor and innovation and renaissance not
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:26.160]  economies based on war and deception and fraud and surveillance and crony capitalism and gains
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:34.800]  now that said i want to discuss the issue of russia's gigantic megabunkers that they've been
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:44.480]  building one of them the pentagon reports and the russians confirm is 400 square miles in size
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.400]  we're not just going to look at the bunkers we're going to give you the rest of the story
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:56.400]  as paul harvey would say so before we get to the bunkers let's just review some recent
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:02.720]  mainstream news reports you heard us tell you this five years ago now it's in the guardian
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:08.720]  just a few weeks ago as an equity source the nervous super rich are already planning their
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:14.320]  escapes mainly two new zealand as i told you years ago james cameron and others are fleeing
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:18.320]  they believe the us will collapse i have that from internal sources i've talked to other billionaires
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.960]  two new zealand with armored redoubts their own airfields it's all in this article
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:28.080]  years after i told you and i'm gonna have the crew and these taped shows go back and just show you
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:33.280]  everything i'm claiming the past is now happening not because i'm saying i'm mr fancy pants know
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:38.320]  it all this stuff's hidden in plain view we're telling you the truth about what's going on
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:46.400]  here's another report swiss info bunkers for all switzerland is unique at having enough
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.480]  nuclear fallout shelters to accommodate its entire population should they ever be needed
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:58.800]  new york times swiss ready to face armageddon in comfort science world goes over this as well
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.640]  and how the elites are building a Rockefeller funded emergency seed vaults animal and dna
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.920]  emergency arcs all over the world i mean this is amazing what they're doing they're spending
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:15.120]  billions and billions on this every year inside the secret luxury survival bunkers for millionaires
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.200]  you know i'm good friends with joel scowls and probably the top bunker builder in the country
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.280]  and he won't talk about his clients but he will talk about the facts there's a major uptick
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:31.520]  in billionaires but also former cia fbi you name it building smaller ones under their houses
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:36.160]  and they're some of the biggest preppers and why is that we're going to talk about that in the
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:41.600]  moment but when we have some extra water or say get guns or have water filters we're cooks and
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:47.520]  crazies and you know bad people seven million americans died during the great depression from
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:53.440]  malnutrition in major university studies broke that down 90% were self-sufficient back then
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:58.960]  five percent are self-sufficient today look it up continuing u.s. department of defense
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:02.960]  russians still building bunkers so there it is directly from the department of defense
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:08.800]  when they have army psyops come out and say we made all this up now let's move to the actual article
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:12.560]  from michael schneider end of the american dream blog
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:19.040]  republishing info wars dot com excellent excellent article and when i read this this morning i said
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:22.720]  i've got to talk about this in more detail because he absolutely hits the nail on the head
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:29.680]  and the whole article is lengthy as his articles are and he documents it and links to the department
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.440]  defense and the russian government itself we just showed you some of those links did you know the
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  russians have a massive underground complex in the url mountains that has been estimated to be
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:45.280]  approximately 400 square miles in size and then they go through the fact that it's roughly as big
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:53.120]  as the area inside the dc beltway and that they've got at least five other major systems now here's
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:43:02.000]  the rest of the story switzerland has bunkers for all their people with anti-tank weapons
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:11.280]  guns with food with water with generators and with sniper rifles assault rifles heavy machine
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:16.560]  guns for every man and woman in the country and in their homes bylaw they've got to have hidden
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:20.640]  weapons in case the tyrannical government took over which has happened in switzerland
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.640]  in the time of william tell that's where their whole culture came from that our culture is based
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:29.520]  in part on so you won't get taught that in school but look it up it's a historical fact
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.800]  they'd had a takeover and william tell started an uprising against him when they made him shoot
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:39.360]  the apple office son's head with the cross probe that's all a true story folks but they don't want
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.400]  you to know those art types that were taught in schools until the 60s they want you to just
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:48.800]  believe this fake plastic culture just came out of nowhere it was scientifically designed
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:55.600]  why are the russians spending the equivalent of some estimates over a trillion dollars in
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:01.440]  the last decade building this giant bunker complex and they've got subways in them we'll
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:08.080]  show you some of those in the articles they've got you name it because they know that the globalists
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:11.680]  are planning a nuclear war with russia again i'm not saying russia's even the good guys they're
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:17.840]  their own predator class but not as sophisticated russia's more like a raccoon when it comes to
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:22.640]  being a predator and the globalists are like a tyrannosaurus rex i mean they are the vicious
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:28.080]  offensive attackers but the russians are a tyrannosaurus rex when it comes to their nuclear
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:33.200]  forces but they're not offensively trying to do anything they're under attack having all their
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.360]  soft underbelly attack by radical islamists and others and they're actually fighting back against
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:44.080]  it in the united states congressional reports have come out we know there's been massive underground
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.840]  bunkers built we know there's underground railways from fort hood where i live close to in austin
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:55.280]  texas out to the old sack base at murkstrom i had a family that saw it back in the 60s i've had
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:58.880]  family currently in special operations that you know yeah that's there but i'm not going to talk
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:04.240]  about it you can see the snorkels on 290 out there to get air for the underground railways
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:12.480]  where they move nukes back and forth uh 60 70 miles up to fort hood so all of this is happening
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:19.040]  all of this is is is going on beneath the surface and here's the big issue russia's
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:26.880]  bunkers are for their people switzerland's bunkers are for their people our bunkers are luxury
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:32.960]  cog for the government and the elite but the elite know that living in a bunker isn't very fun so
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:38.560]  they're moving to new zealand good luck moving to new zealand or the cook islands or grand cayman or
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:46.320]  or barts or whatever ivy or luxembourg if there's a nuclear war i mean it's ridiculous
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:53.120]  elites are even moving out of england and israel and switzerland but they're so
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:58.800]  hutzpah driven so arrogant that they've got to control everything they've got to take over the
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:03.280]  world even if it means they could destroy it so so this is really a message in the establishment
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:10.000]  listen your best plan is restoring freedom and restoring transparency in the west and not starting
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.640]  war with the russians and not going for global domination like hitler and so many other thugs
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:19.680]  of history like napoleon you're not going to be safe in new zealand you're only going to be safe
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:26.880]  not incinerating the globe and that leads me to the tragic jetliner downing where they claim the
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:34.400]  pilot nosedived it uh into the ground because he was depressed whether that's true or not i don't know
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:41.280]  what i do know is that's an example of how one of the most trusted industries out there professional
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:47.360]  pilots some of the best people psychologically out there can still have bad actors and historically
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:52.000]  dictators always think that they're invincible and they can crash entire civilizations into the
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:57.680]  ground they can bring down whole empires whole countries until nuclear weapons came along now
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.800]  they can bring down the whole planet don't think ladies and gentlemen that will always be here
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:13.200]  here i've never in all my years studying history saw a general or a admiral or a president
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:18.560]  cavalierily say we came we saw qaddafi died oh we ought to just kill a bunch more russians
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:26.800]  and body bags and ship them back we came we saw he died the only way the united states can have
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:31.920]  any effect in this region and turn the tide is to start killing russians killing russians by
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:37.600]  uh killing so many russians that even putin's media can't hide the fact that russians are
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:45.520]  returning to the motherland and body bags people like general scales are out of their minds just
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.960]  cavalierily talking about attacking russia and they're sending an armor brigades to fight them
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:55.680]  right now in ukraine that is their historical birthplace and doorstep this is the type of
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:02.240]  megalomania that destroys countries and destroys planets and we are now at the crossroads and our
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:08.320]  elite don't have bunkers for us the russians in the swiss do we don't have bunkers you know what
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.120]  the designated fallout shelter is growing up in dallas we see these now it's not even there that
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:18.560]  they've taken the signs down designated nuclear fallout shelter is underground parking garages
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:27.680]  where you go to sleep out the nuclear winter and starve to death with 90 plus of the public
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.320]  urban and not self-sufficient can you imagine a depression all hell would break loose
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:38.800]  we have 50 million people in soup lines they're just digital now can you imagine the breakdown
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:42.960]  and then when individuals try to prep and get prepared we're cooks and we're crazy while the
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:47.840]  government is digging in like it's the end of the world and carrying out policies that could
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:53.200]  trigger that so we're living in unprecedentedly dangerous times our borders are wide open but
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:58.160]  they've got all these military drills going on to take on the tea party and gun owners we have
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.920]  an insane ruling class they hate the russians because they're independent they hate texas
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.720]  because they're independent they hate anybody that wants to be sovereign they hate anybody that
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.040]  doesn't want to be a slave they hate anybody that's got a fighting spirit they hate anybody
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.560]  who's manly anybody who's strong these people are crazy they already rule the planet pretty much
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.720]  but they gotta mop up the few areas they don't dominate and when they do get full control what
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:27.760]  do they do jack up the taxes break up our families we have an evil elite a bunch of
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:35.200]  unaccountable crazy bankers who when they make bad bets like john corezine of goldman sacks
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:40.400]  steal people's accounts to pay it off and don't even get in trouble they're dangerous they're
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:48.000]  running a global Ponzi scheme with nuclear weapons that's it for this report the russians have
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:54.960]  bunkers they're building more everybody else has bunkers for you know some of their population
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:50:01.920]  at least we have nothing nothing while our elite push world war three and have pentagon reports
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.560]  going a nuclear war would be survivable and quite reasonable we should start using tactical nukes more
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:12.560]  often in generals on tv talking about killing more russians and starting a war with them it is very

[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:18.720]  helm the jade helm exercise but before we do i want to put this in kind of a perspective you
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:24.080]  know we need to talk about what the size the scope and the mission of the military should be
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:29.600]  that's a discussion that if we still have a country that is not a dictatorship we should
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:34.720]  be able to have that kind of discussion and not be labeled anti-military not be labeled as
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:42.400]  unpatriotic we need to ask is there any limit to the size of the military what is that limit if
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:49.920]  such a limit does exist you know we just had a new budget come out a quarterly through through
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:56.640]  february they said 1.2 trillion dollars a record amount of federal taxes brought in 1.2 trillion
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.640]  dollars yet that still doesn't cover the tab we're still running a 386 billion dollar deficit
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:08.800]  so you've got ram paul proposing that we do what that we increase military spending that's what
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:14.240]  ram paul did according time magazine said in an olive branch to defense hawks hellbent on curtailing
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:19.040]  his white house ambitions the libertarian senator ram paul introduced a budget amendment late
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:25.280]  wednesday calling for nearly 190 billion dollar infusion and the defense budget over the next
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:33.280]  two years roughly a 16 increase now in fairness to ram paul he is trying to offset some of that
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:39.520]  with cuts elsewhere there was a battle that kind of came up between paul and rubio that politico
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:44.480]  reports about a they say a 2016 brawl breaks out on the senate floor between potential presidential
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:50.000]  candidates marcos rubio tid crews and ran paul of course ran paul they all want to increase the
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:56.800]  defense spending but rubio did not want to have any of the cuts that ran paul suggested and what
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:02.160]  ran paul wanted to do was to cut some money 21 billion dollars from foreign aid 14 from the
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:07.600]  national science foundation climate change operations 10 billion from the epa the department
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:12.400]  of commerce 20 billion from the department of education you get the idea about 106 billion
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:19.920]  dollars ran paul would cut but he would still be increasing the defense budget by 190 now he said
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.920]  we can't keep borrowing more money from china to send to pakistan but you know we can't keep
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:30.640]  borrowing more money period the bankers have us essentially on a reverse mortgage loan that's
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.880]  what the federal reserve has been doing they basically we haven't been covering our bills
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:39.920]  for any of the years for a very long time that's why we have such a large debt you know the debt
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:45.360]  is the accumulation of the annual deficits that we run and so we're still running through that now
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:50.720]  as politico points out with these three republicans you got marco rubio who basically didn't want to
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:56.320]  have any cut you got ran paul who would basically offset half of the increase and then where was
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:01.360]  ted cruise well he kind of vacillated in the middle and then essentially wound up siding with marco
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:07.520]  rubio and lindsay graham that's right the uh the neocons who want to run this through an interview
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:12.640]  with politico ran paul lambasted his foes and said that they were engaging in reckless irresponsible
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:17.040]  behavior showing that they lacked the courage and the conviction to reign in the country's mountain
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:25.120]  of debt well i agree but i think we need to set step back and we need to say how much more are we
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:30.160]  going to grow the military that's a very concerning thing and and that's what reason points out as
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:34.400]  they talk about yes okay fine it's fair to say that ran paul would offset some of this increase
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:40.240]  but they say more than ever we need someone who's going to argue that six hundred billion dollars
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:47.280]  is more than enough to secure the safety and the security of us citizens and interests well you know
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:52.400]  i don't think that it's necessarily securing our safety it may actually be working against it to
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:58.880]  have a standing military we need to go back to what james madison said human nature doesn't change
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:04.080]  it hasn't changed in 200 years and he knew from history how this is going to break down and he
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.400]  said a standing military force with an overgrown executive in other words the kind of guy we've
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:13.680]  got right now the kind of guy we're likely to have uh or woman if we replace him with jeb bush or
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:18.560]  with hillary clinton will destroy liberty he says the means of defense against foreign danger have
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:24.480]  always been the instruments of tyranny at home he points out that happened in the roman empire it
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:30.400]  was happening in his day in europe and it is happening right now in america stay with us right
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:34.720]  after the break and callers i'm going to come back to uh doug wane will and then tonio stay with us

[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:19.280]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:23.840]  host for this last hour we're going to go back to our callers who've been patiently holding we've
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:28.720]  been talking about the jade helm exercise and of course there's a very important article put
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:35.200]  together by paul joseph watson and alex jones pushing back against the strawman arguments
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:39.920]  are being made in the mainstream media you need to understand what is going on with this this is
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:44.400]  as the gawker writer put it a creeping fascism this is something that has been going on for
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:51.040]  quite a long time and this is a very lengthy article with links with videos that shows that
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:57.440]  this is a long pattern of escalation that is now accelerating exponentially so you need to
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:02.080]  pass this on to people because they're pushing back and creating saying that we're saying
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:06.800]  that this is going to be a martial law enacted by the government in a couple of months and soon
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:12.080]  everybody will see that we're just nonsense conspiracy theorists here that's not what
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:18.400]  we're saying we're saying that this is an increasing training towards martial law towards
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:22.560]  using the troops in america and of course they're talking about how they're going to practice
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:28.400]  in civilian clothes within the population here so they're not detected this is something we see
[03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:33.040]  them training for over and over again their training scenarios their asymmetric warfare
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:37.600]  centers that they have in military bases now they're taking it out to the next level they
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:42.160]  are planning these operations in the continental united states this is not something that is going
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:46.800]  to help them it would actually hurt them if they train this kind of way and then presented themselves
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:53.120]  as americans in a foreign country you need to understand how this is being how this is who
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:58.320]  this is directed for and how this has been escalated over the years as an excellent article
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:02.720]  uh look at that yourself pass that on to other people let's go to your calls right now a dug
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:09.360]  in minnesota dug hey how you doing guys doing good thank you for holding um
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:18.240]  a couple things um as far as you know everybody's saying well what can i do what can i do how many
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:27.200]  people across this entire country have printers in their house if they go in and make up little
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:33.200]  fires they put them out for car washes for everything else in this country that doesn't make
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:41.520]  you know make a difference if they go out put it in on there and just put google this across the top
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:49.760]  and then put key points going down everybody loves to google generation lives on google
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:55.840]  and that's who we need to wake up as well absolutely and this and this article that we've
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:03:01.680]  got up in infowars right now that paul put together with alex jones is very important because it
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:06.960]  already does a lot of the work for people they don't have to google or look that hard it's all
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:12.320]  laid out there they've got a lot of articles as well as videos that lay this history of what's
[03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:17.520]  been happening down for people and i think it's an information war it's very much an information
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:23.680]  war so we you have to get this out to other people because they're not referring to alex they just
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:30.080]  refer to some obscure right-wing host in austin they're not directing people to our website i think
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:36.800]  it's important for people to see what we're actually talking about go ahead here in fact this
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:43.440]  morning and i asked him i says how do you how do you reach people just being a civilian i says

[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:54.640]  to him he said if you can bring a book with that he wrote and he said talk to him and he said in the
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:04:01.920]  first three minutes you'll know if they're pro or not that's true just by their attitudes and
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:10.560]  you know we got homeland security and and brock obama put in people from the muslim brotherhood
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:16.480]  in key positions in homeland security doesn't that tell people anything i know i didn't know
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:23.600]  about that till this morning no absolutely and if you if you look at their scenarios what they're
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:28.720]  training for i mean it's there it's right out in the open but people just ignore it they just dismiss
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:33.920]  it most people won't even bother to look up what the definition of unconventional warfare is but
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:39.280]  yes it's an educational issue stay with us we're going to be right back we're going to talk about

[03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:18.640]  a war on for your mind welcome back to the alex jones show let me go one more segment because
[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:22.880]  we had so many people that have been on hold to talk about the jade helm exercise i'm going to go
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:28.000]  right back to the callers but before i do there's a very important article that we just didn't have
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:34.240]  time to cover earlier as we're talking about removing our informed consent forcing mandatory
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:41.200]  vaccinations on people talking about this whole idea of herd immunity there is no such thing as
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:46.240]  herd immunity if you don't have individual immunity if these vaccines don't work you don't have herd
[03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:51.280]  immunity here's a good case in point this is an article from adan salazar students contract
[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:59.360]  hooping cough at a school with a 99.5 vaccination rate 99 and a half percent now this is in salinas
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:04.880]  california uh they have a vaccination rate of 99 and a half percent nevertheless one of the kids
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:12.000]  who had been vaccinated came down with the hooping cough and shortly thereafter three or more
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:17.520]  of his or her fifth grade peers also acquired the disease see that's the way that breaks down
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:25.520]  and so we need to have the ability even if this was 100 effective and i have to say that if it's
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:31.600]  100 if it's safe and effective we don't need things like the vaccine courts and if they're going to
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:35.920]  stand behind their product and not have legal immunity from the federal government like they
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:40.800]  do through the vaccine court uh then we can start to talk about that but until they take that away
[03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:45.360]  until they take away the legal immunity of the vaccine companies you don't even need to talk to
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:52.960]  me or my family about mandatory vaccines mandatory any kind of health care treatment
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:59.120]  should be anathema to us all we should understand that that was one of the key things that came
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:04.560]  out of the nuremberg trials the nuremberg code says you never take away people's informed consent
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:10.640]  never under any circumstances for any reason whatsoever and we need to make sure that we
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:16.000]  don't get talked down about that with this nonsense about herd immunity we know there's uh
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:22.480]  efficacy issues with these vaccines but we also know there's a lot of safety issues with them well
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:27.440]  i am informed and you don't have my consent i want to go back to our callers who've been patiently
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:35.840]  waiting on this last section of uh overdrive let's go to wane in texas wane yeah hey can you hear me
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:44.720]  david i got you go ahead hey look i was in the military back in uh 86 to 91 i was a tank
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:53.120]  mechanic at ported and also drove a m88 tow tank the tow team won we trained for desert training
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:11:04.720]  at border when in late 89 we went back and uh i'm sorry early 89 and then late 89 we went back
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:13.200]  again and trained and then and uh right before we went to desert storm we went a third time
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:19.120]  and on that third trip i asked myself what are we going back to desert training for a third time
[03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:24.880]  so they were gearing up for all that but they didn't let us know what was going on yeah they knew
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:28.560]  where they were going to go and they've actually they've got a long list of the different countries
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:31.520]  in the middle east that they want to take down westley clark put that out go ahead sorry
[03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:38.160]  yeah so i mean you know they they they always gear up and train ahead of time but what i saw
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:44.160]  yesterday i live out here in mylon county which is about 70 miles northeast of y'all there in
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:51.920]  austin and uh on the way into town i saw six hardened jeeps uh humvees i had the the hard
[03:11:51.920 --> 03:11:59.920]  armored doors on them uh coming up highway 36 and uh when we went into a uh divided highway
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:07.280]  with four lanes they decided to take the fast lane and uh i couldn't see on their vehicles what
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:12.080]  unit they were with because the unit numbers usually on the driver's side so i couldn't
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:20.080]  get my eyeballs on that but coming back from town i saw another i'm going to say about eight vehicles
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:28.640]  and these are like cargo carriers they uh like like they could carry a small container uh you know
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:34.400]  and so they're on a uh road march up toward probably fort hood i'm guessing but
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:41.440]  if you go down 36 to rockbell and you shoot over the highway 77 77 runs right down the
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:46.960]  bass drop well i think that the main thing wane is that they want us one of the objectives of
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:53.360]  unconventional warfare is to make sure that they get acquiescence and capitulation if we can get
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:13:02.000]  used to massive military exercises targeting domestic cities they've won and most people don't
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:09.360]  realize that this is training that isn't going to serve them abroad but i've walked through ap hill
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:14.400]  i've looked at their asymmetric warfare center where they're training for american cities i stood
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:20.720]  with uh uh joe biggs on the corner of first and main i mean they have an american city there that
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:26.000]  they're practicing on it's not a foreign city and we need to understand that these that the
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:32.080]  standing militaries have historically been used for tyranny at home that's the way it has always
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:38.000]  gone throughout history it is human nature it is a very dangerous thing and they're doing it right
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:48.080]  in front of our faces and hoping that we're going to just get used to it well um they the uh yeah
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:52.720]  you're you're right about that and and you know i'm i'm really wondering if this bass drop bar
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.680]  had something to do with them getting set up down there um you know if they were clearing out some
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:03.600]  areas or something or maybe they wanted to burn that forest down so that nobody could uh sneak up
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:08.240]  on them and see what they're doing well you know but you know people need to keep their eyes open
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:12.560]  and once this thing actually starts in a couple of months we are going to need to have a lot of
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:18.640]  citizen eyes on the ground reporting what they see we need to put some heat and some light on the
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:24.960]  county commissioners who have okayed this who sent a letter of invitation i think we need to be very
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:28.400]  involved but we also need to educate them we need to understand that a lot of them don't really
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:33.200]  understand how they're being played so you need to come in with the approach that they really
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:38.080]  are trying to act in earnest and they just don't know what's going on and try to show them the
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:42.240]  information one of the best ways you can do that is with this article that paul and alex jones
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:48.000]  put up a very detailed article showing how this is a gradual progression thank you so much wane
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:52.480]  i want to get some of the other callers in in this last segment let's go to antonio and fema nine
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:15:00.240]  antonio hey david how's it going doing good go ahead okay yeah i just had a quick question there are
[03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:04.160]  a few questions actually you know what's your thought on their jam with the churches you know
[03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:09.520]  david or not david alex really put together a good report and in the report how do you talk
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:16.640]  about the church that will go along with the roman 13 and you know uh there's a lot of them that i
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:21.840]  think would go along with their what are your thoughts well my understanding roman 13 is that
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:27.440]  when the bible talks about the government being created by god it's talking about it being his
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:32.400]  agent for good and when you start looking at that passage if you read that passage and substitute
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:38.240]  for government or for authority if you substitute hitler for example okay you put that in there
[03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:42.320]  there's a real cognitive dissonance you really ought to understand that so what they're talking
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:47.600]  about is that a legitimate government i think it's descriptive uh saying that a government
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:52.240]  can be god's agent for good but we need to understand that when god sets up an authority
[03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:58.560]  when he sets up a family with parents uh with a father with a mother if they start abusing that
[03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:04.480]  authority then they no longer have legitimate authority you understand it's just like if a
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:10.960]  government abuses its authority and becomes a force of evil as uh hitler did in nazi germany
[03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:17.200]  then people like detrick bonhoeffer who or pastors they need to get involved in taking that person
[03:16:17.200 --> 03:16:23.200]  down you need to protect the innocent that is the overriding principle here we're not to be blindly
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:29.600]  subservient to an immoral government so if this government is immoral you have an imperative duty
[03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:35.440]  to take it down and as alex has pointed out what is the legitimate government here in america what
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:43.280]  is the king the king is the law the king is the constitution as the founders said at the time of
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:49.520]  the american revolution they had a saying they said lex rex in other words the law is king that was
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:54.960]  like kind of a latin version of that the constitution is the king every person that has elected office
[03:16:54.960 --> 03:16:59.840]  takes an oath to the constitution just as they would take an oath to a king and so when they
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:05.760]  violate their the constitution when they violate their oath to office they are an unfaithful steward
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:11.440]  and they have no legitimate authority so think of it that way if you can't get past the idea that
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:20.000]  your moral obligations are are stronger than any political body just understand that even on that
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:25.280]  political basis once they violate the constitution and it's pretty clear that they have in pretty
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:31.840]  much every way whether it's at the tsa or in other respects you have to understand that when
[03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:36.000]  the government is doing something that is morally wrong that is violates the constitution that they
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:39.920]  don't have any legitimate authority i think that's the most important takeaway we can
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:43.760]  have from that let's go to uh steven in florida thank you antonio let's go to steven in florida
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:49.280]  i want to try to get everybody in if we can this last segment go ahead yeah hey david good afternoon
[03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:55.600]  hey um uh first of all i wanted to say uh i was talking about this preparation for marsh law i just
[03:17:55.600 --> 03:18:02.480]  wanted to say first of all as a bible-believing christian and an american i'd rather die standing
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:08.960]  in defiance than kneeling in compliance yeah that's my modern version of patrick henry's give me
[03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:14.880]  liberty or give me death yes now what i wanted to mention is that uh there's a guy i think alex
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:20.320]  has interviewed him before and his name's william jasper he's a uh journalist and correspondent
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:26.480]  for the uh john broode society yes a new american really powerful yeah he wrote a really powerful
[03:18:26.480 --> 03:18:32.480]  book in the early 90s called global tyranny step by step i was trying to find it in all my books to
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:38.560]  quote from but basically from memory what he cut uh chronicles in there one of the sections is
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:49.600]  way back in 1951 and 52 our government had our army troops with un blue helmets and the un flag
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:55.840]  invade 12 american cities six of them i believe were in texas one was water town new yorkish
[03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:00.720]  and state and there was a couple other ones but several were in texas what they did was they and
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:07.520]  this is in the 50s now they went in they took down the american flag at city hall put up the un flag
[03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:14.960]  they took over the city hall all the government the police the schools everything as a mock drill
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:21.360]  for what they said is coming here this is back in the 50s now so don't think this is anything new
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:26.400]  all they're doing now is just ramping it up well absolutely what they've been planning for decades
[03:19:26.400 --> 03:19:32.400]  it becomes more and more obvious and that's why it is imperative imperative for you to take a look at
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:37.440]  and pass this around the article beyond denial preparations for martial law people need to see
[03:19:37.440 --> 03:19:44.000]  how this is a pattern that has been building that is escalating they're taking the mask off
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:48.720]  that's what we need to understand this is a scyop operation and you need to see
[03:19:48.720 --> 03:19:52.720]  how this has been put together over a long period of time well that's it sorry we couldn't get to
[03:19:52.720 --> 03:20:08.640]  other callers join us again on sunday 4 p.m central standard time
