[00:00.000 --> 00:24.760]  Well, there isn't just evil in this world and yours being the sleeping giant that is
[00:24.760 --> 00:29.580]  the American Republic rising again like the mythical phoenix from the ashes.
[00:29.580 --> 00:32.300]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:32.300 --> 00:38.460]  We are sending the collapse of the globalist program all over the planet.
[00:38.460 --> 00:43.800]  Here we are live from Washington, D.C. We're right out the window from our humble studios
[00:43.800 --> 00:44.800]  here.
[00:44.800 --> 00:50.280]  I can see the Washington Monument and in fact it'll be tomorrow that Donald Trump is
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.960]  going to come right down the road and go to the nation's capital to be sworn in as the
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.040]  45th president of the United States.
[01:01.040 --> 01:04.400]  Now I don't want to sit here on the show every segment and say see I told you so over and
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.880]  over again but I've warned everybody if they were going to try to take the president out
[01:08.880 --> 01:16.600]  they would use COG and when we come back from break we have CNN reports and others licking
[01:16.600 --> 01:22.560]  their lips, promoting the idea, normalizing the idea that if Trump gets assassinated or
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.880]  if Trump gets removed because he's a Ruski agent, Obama will appoint the new president.
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.760]  So they're selling that idea right now and it's very interesting that you're seeing
[01:33.760 --> 01:38.720]  a bunch of Democrats not show up to this and you're seeing John Kerry not show up.
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.800]  If a nuclear weapon goes off, big one, small one, so-called improvised, one cooked up by
[01:44.800 --> 01:52.480]  jihadis, if a nuke goes off you can 100% know it was the criminal elements that have
[01:52.480 --> 01:55.520]  infiltrated the deep state, the shadow government.
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.960]  We set up a shadow government after the atomic bomb was created under mutually assured destruction
[02:02.960 --> 02:08.240]  or under really the Mexican standoff the nuclear weapons created where that if the government
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.480]  got knocked out in a sneak attack there would be a backup emergency government to reconstitute
[02:13.480 --> 02:14.480]  the republic.
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.640]  The problem is anything like that can always be used to take the government over.
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.360]  An example is Operation Valkyrie using the Valkyrie system that Hitler set up for COG.
[02:24.360 --> 02:27.440]  They tried to use it against him and I'm not saying Hitler's good.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.840]  The point is you can see how this can be used here either for good or bad.
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.200]  This is how they will go at him.
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.760]  It was declassified back in the 80s that some people looked at overthrowing Reagan using
[02:38.760 --> 02:40.000]  COG.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.800]  So we know that COG has been looked at as the prime way to overthrow a president and
[02:45.800 --> 02:52.400]  sure enough here it is the day before the inauguration they're floating and I said first
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.080]  they'll say he's a Russian agent then they'll say he's illegitimate then they'll say that
[02:56.080 --> 02:59.920]  we've got to have a civil emergency and suspend the election and have no elections.
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.720]  Once they start talking about that they'll want to federalize the election so that the
[03:03.720 --> 03:08.160]  quote feds of the people Obama controls the globalist control will oversee the election.
[03:08.160 --> 03:10.120]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:10.120 --> 03:11.760]  Every bit I told you has now happened.
[03:11.760 --> 03:17.480]  Now, they're going up against a rock and a hard place, they're going uphill because
[03:17.480 --> 03:21.320]  most of the intelligence agencies are away, most of the military is away, the American
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.000]  people are somewhat away so if they do this they're doing it at high noon with their goods
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.400]  hanging out okay and their big fat ugly butts hanging out.
[03:29.400 --> 03:35.240]  So we let them know we're watching you, we're aware of you, we see you so they do not pull
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.240]  it off.
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.160]  But let me tell you something, it's very worrisome that we now have 50-something members of Congress
[03:41.160 --> 03:44.960]  that aren't going to be at this thing and I'm sitting here just a few hundred yards
[03:44.960 --> 03:45.960]  from the Capitol.
[03:45.960 --> 03:53.200]  It is very, very worrisome that they're all openly talking about him, Trump dying tomorrow
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.080]  and how Obama will just install someone new and it's completely normal and no big deal
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.920]  because he hasn't gotten any of his committee people, any of his cabinet people approved
[04:02.920 --> 04:09.720]  yet so sorry the Trump administration never existed, it's going to have to be people Obama
[04:09.720 --> 04:19.880]  appoints and it turns out Obama has people designated waiting at a facility outside of
[04:19.880 --> 04:26.280]  the District of Columbia at Site R out in Maryland and then also out in Colorado in
[04:26.280 --> 04:32.240]  Colorado Springs, they've got the new government just waiting, it hadn't even been activated
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.640]  in a long time but magically for this inauguration it's been activated and the people are in
[04:37.640 --> 04:45.080]  the bunkers, is this a little bit suspicious, you'd have to be insane as a COG historian
[04:45.080 --> 04:53.360]  like I am to not understand this is dangerous so again I told you COG, COG, COG, COG is
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.480]  the way they're going to go, I'm not saying they're going to pull it off tomorrow but
[04:56.480 --> 05:00.040]  they're sure thinking about it, we'll be back.
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.200]  Migrants are racing for the US border right before Trump is taking office there's an article
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.880]  that's up on the Drudge Report that talks about how illegals are coming for the US border
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.200]  in lieu of a Trump victory, he's taking office tomorrow folks, migrants that are trying to
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.560]  sneak into the US on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.080]  is in fact coming, these challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.440]  soon US President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out all together
[05:26.440 --> 05:30.880]  so before Trump takes office tomorrow they're racing against time, riding a freight train
[05:30.880 --> 05:36.200]  up to the border to look for a way across, in the town near a frontier group of Hondurans
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.440]  warned themselves near a fire, a trash in the early morning cold, there's an article
[05:40.440 --> 05:45.400]  that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train and the event that
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.480]  it slows down and I've got news for you folks, that wall is coming but it looks like migrants
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.960]  are feeling the burn literally and racing for the border, I'm Margaret Hale reporting
[05:54.960 --> 06:01.960]  for info wars.com.
[06:24.960 --> 06:52.920]  I'm Alex Jones, jumping on the airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump, pray

[08:06.760 --> 08:09.600]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[08:09.600 --> 08:14.600]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[08:14.600 --> 08:18.760]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[08:18.760 --> 08:24.280]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war.
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.560]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls and our minds.
[08:28.560 --> 08:30.840]  We have to be good.
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.840]  We have to be pure.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.840]  We have to be strong.
[08:32.840 --> 08:36.640]  We have to build prosperity and we have to bring every one of every race, color and creed
[08:36.640 --> 08:42.320]  together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail,
[08:42.320 --> 08:44.920]  who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[08:44.920 --> 08:53.160]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just become it.
[08:53.160 --> 09:12.960]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you are losers from the day you were born.
[09:12.960 --> 09:23.520]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[09:23.520 --> 09:24.520]  Move, bitch!
[09:24.520 --> 09:27.320]  Get out of the way!
[09:27.320 --> 09:33.360]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.760]  Info wars helped to rule the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.280]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.280]  I will not let you down.
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.800]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.800]  Another trope in Alex Jones.
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.400]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[09:55.400 --> 10:03.080]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 19, 2017.
[10:07.680 --> 10:14.240]  We are less than 24 hours out right now from the beginning of the inauguration of President
[10:14.240 --> 10:16.840]  Trump 45.
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.680]  This is so historic on every front.
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.440]  And the corporate dinosaur media keeps trying to say it's not historic that Trump was elected
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.520]  when it is completely historic.
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.640]  It was historic in a very negative way that the establishment, by the time Kennedy was
[10:34.640 --> 10:40.280]  assassination, began to install presidents that they controlled.
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.920]  To a certain extent, Reagan tried to be his own president, and so they attempted assassination
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.520]  on him and pretty much got control of him from that point on.
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.760]  Then with George Herbert Walker Bush and his pro-doge Bill Clinton and then his son and
[10:55.760 --> 11:07.680]  then Obama, we have had 30 years, 30 years of an intelligence agency coup d'etat in
[11:07.680 --> 11:11.640]  this country.
[11:11.640 --> 11:17.840]  Rex 84 was declassified in congressional hearings, parts of it, in the late 1980s during the
[11:17.840 --> 11:20.400]  Iran-Contra investigation.
[11:20.400 --> 11:27.520]  It was discovered under Rex 84, Operation Cable Splicer, Operation Garden Plot, and
[11:27.520 --> 11:34.600]  others that there were COG plans being hatched by George Herbert Walker Bush on basically
[11:34.600 --> 11:41.280]  overthrowing the government using continuity of government systems, or COG.
[11:41.280 --> 11:50.360]  It had actually been L. L. Limnitzer in 1962, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[11:50.360 --> 11:59.040]  that had proposed the plan to John F. Kennedy, a plan to stage terror attacks in America,
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.720]  blame it on Russia and start a nuclear war.
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.480]  Kennedy discovered the plan, fired L. L. Limnitzer, but L. L. Limnitzer had stay-behinds
[12:08.480 --> 12:17.240]  in the Pentagon who became the corporate officers over two people, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.720]  Cheney.
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.640]  So they sat at the feet of individuals and their names were on reports that even came
[12:24.640 --> 12:32.200]  out in the 1980s that in the mid-60s and 70s, they were inside the Pentagon and inside the
[12:32.200 --> 12:39.200]  Gerald Ford administration cooking up and selling the plan of COG takeovers using continuity
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.400]  of government emergencies.
[12:40.400 --> 12:46.280]  So this group of neocons is obsessed with this, and they understand that Hitler was
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.680]  almost taken out using a similar COG system, Valkyrie.
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.120]  The reason I've obsessed over COG is because when you hear them start talking about it
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.520]  and you hear them start selling it to the public, that means they're preparing the
[13:00.520 --> 13:08.080]  mind, they're preparing the soil of the brain so that these seeds will sprout and so we
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.600]  just think it's normal if there's a terror attack taking out Donald Trump tomorrow or
[13:13.600 --> 13:21.680]  taking out Donald Trump in Congress maybe at his first State of the Union in a year.
[13:21.680 --> 13:30.280]  And then, oh, now there's a new COG made up of career bureaucrats and others waiting to
[13:30.280 --> 13:37.560]  come in if the main body of patriots is taken out in Congress and in the executive branch
[13:37.560 --> 13:44.040]  as well as the judiciary, it would be a perfect time to do it during an inauguration, during
[13:44.040 --> 13:51.840]  a State of the Union, but here's the problem, here's a little telltale sign, and I've laid
[13:51.840 --> 13:52.840]  this out in detail.
[13:52.840 --> 13:56.560]  If you're a regular listener, you know I've covered this the last month at Nauseam.
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.040]  I said they'll start hammering, he's a Russian spy, I said this before the election, they'll
[14:01.040 --> 14:06.960]  announce they've got to federalize the election even after the election because Obama's still
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.760]  in for two months.
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.040]  Then they start to say the president's illegitimate, they start to say he's really a Russian
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.200]  agent, they start to say we need a civil emergency, a national emergency, then you'll start hearing
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.560]  people are going to boycott the inauguration, then you hear if he's killed at the inauguration
[14:23.560 --> 14:29.440]  or if he's indicted days before or the day of the inauguration, it's okay because COG
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.560]  will step in, the president will appoint a new president, Obama won't stay on, he'll
[14:34.560 --> 14:41.440]  appoint a new president, and then Homeland Security with their people in that they've
[14:41.440 --> 14:47.440]  put in, Loretta Lynch and others, or the stay behind folks they've put in, they will
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.160]  then hold the new free fair election like they have in South Africa or Venezuela or
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.360]  Cuba, and that's the rest of the story.
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.640]  And now they have said everything I said they would say and do if they were planning
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.160]  a coup d'etat against the peaceful transfer of power.
[15:08.160 --> 15:17.160]  Now I want to be clear, I'm not saying that they're going to do this, clearly bare minimum
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.640]  it's about delegitimizing Trump ahead of an impeachment which they're also beating the
[15:20.640 --> 15:28.400]  drum for, but that's kind of like the field goal they're going for, okay, if they can't
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.000]  get the touchdown they just want a field goal, the field goal is building up the discrediting
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.800]  sabotage the agenda of getting the economy going to undermine Trump because it's not
[15:37.800 --> 15:40.680]  about the economy, it's about power, because if you control things it doesn't matter you
[15:40.680 --> 15:47.360]  get the money anyways, DC is the richest city in the world now, and the people here from
[15:47.360 --> 15:52.000]  the establishment have literally been hissing at me like vampires when you open up their
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  crypts, happened last night I'm still debating whether I should tell the story, but a prominent
[15:59.000 --> 16:09.840]  member of the media, a media owner, a media mogul literally disdainfully hissed at me
[16:09.840 --> 16:16.560]  from a very arrogant evil position, and again I realized evil people it's like a power trip
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.040]  they're on an arrogance trip and they're so arrogant they're like mentally ill, I mean
[16:22.040 --> 16:28.920]  you should have seen this guy just sit back and just go like he hated my guts because
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.600]  I guess to him I'm like a monster like Frankenstein just came walking in and I've been running
[16:34.600 --> 16:38.800]  into him on the street man these lobbyists and people see me and they go and just pull
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.680]  back in horror, now I've run into some patriot lobbyists and of course they're big listeners
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.120]  and big fans, but the vast majority of them Republican and Democrat who think they own
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.520]  this country think they run this world, they are so mad the American people might try to
[16:55.520 --> 17:01.640]  come in and take their country back, they are so incredibly upset, so we've heard the build
[17:01.640 --> 17:05.160]  up for impeachment, we've heard the build up for civil emergency, national emergency,
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.480]  we've seen the push saying he's really a Russian agent, but the Maxine Waters and everybody
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.760]  coming out saying Putin directly tells him what to say and came up with the term cricket
[17:14.760 --> 17:19.840]  hillary and drain the swamp, because again none of us could say draining a big corrupt
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.680]  body that's what you say about a corrupt city council we need to drain the swamp or
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.360]  you've got a corrupt corporate board it's called draining the swamp, I mean this is
[17:27.360 --> 17:34.040]  like a cleaning house, spring cleaning, it'd be like if Trump said we need spring cleaning
[17:34.040 --> 17:40.600]  oh you got that from the Russians did you, like if I said boy that's another kettle
[17:40.600 --> 17:47.320]  of fish, oh that's a fancy term to get that from Putin, yeah, Putin's a thesaurus, he's
[17:47.320 --> 17:53.120]  like an encyclopedia, I don't go to the encyclopedia and pull out the book and look something
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.400]  up, I just go Putin, I call him up and I say I know you're not busy the president of Russia
[17:57.400 --> 18:02.200]  what do I say to there and he goes comrade you will say this today, but he gets his phone
[18:02.200 --> 18:07.760]  and he goes listen to me, this is what you need to do, you need to tell Trump, I mean
[18:07.760 --> 18:16.360]  Trump, you need to go on there and you need to tell them, you need to tell them that she
[18:16.360 --> 18:23.040]  is crooked, I'm gonna skip this break, but we make jokes about this, we laugh about
[18:23.040 --> 18:29.000]  this, we say this is silly, it's not silly because they're so delusional and so disconnected
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  from reality, I didn't sound like, I didn't sound like Putin did, I sounded like Cookie
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.280]  Monster, I don't really do a good Russian accent, I can do other really good accents,
[18:38.280 --> 18:42.280]  you know the globalists are like Cookie Monster, except they're eating the constitution, the
[18:42.280 --> 18:49.480]  prosperity, oh, free country, I mean we can again make jokes about this all day, but my
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.480]  year old daughter still likes the way I do Cookie Monster, but let me get serious, we're
[18:54.480 --> 19:00.560]  talking about nukes going off and COG, let me give you the big giant announcement, let
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.640]  me give you the huge announcement here, and I'm gonna play this clip from CNN and come
[19:04.640 --> 19:15.600]  back and get into it more, if a dirty bomb goes off or a truck bomb full of plastic explosive
[19:15.600 --> 19:24.640]  or nerve gas, you know if ISIS got in and fires a mortar of nerve gas into the crowd,
[19:24.640 --> 19:34.800]  you better know 110%, the Democratic Party, the globalist, the Soros crowd are where you
[19:34.800 --> 19:46.200]  go looking, 110%, if that happens we need to understand who had the motives, who had the
[19:46.200 --> 19:52.560]  means, who had the history, who prepared the ground and who called for it, it'll be a
[19:52.560 --> 19:57.000]  false flag, they will blame it on some foreign enemy or they'll claim it's some right wing
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.640]  group, it doesn't even have to make sense, because they think they've got the corporate
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.040]  media behind them and they'll just go with the big lie and get everybody to buy into
[20:04.040 --> 20:10.720]  the hype, it's not going to happen, and because of that they may back off, they may not pull
[20:10.720 --> 20:14.560]  something tomorrow, in fact I think it's probably a 70% chance they're not gonna pull anything
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.680]  tomorrow, but still they're hyping it and pushing it and hoping it happens and hoping
[20:19.680 --> 20:24.960]  some deranged lunatic shows up with a truck bomb or with a gun, because then they can
[20:24.960 --> 20:29.760]  demonize the second amendment and say oh look, Trump's for the second amendment but his inauguration
[20:29.760 --> 20:35.320]  got marred by gunshots, you know there's a threat continuum, on the lower end it's just
[20:35.320 --> 20:39.880]  riots and people burning things, and then you move on up, it's a shooting, then it's
[20:39.880 --> 20:44.080]  a mass shooting, and then it's a car bomb going off a mile from the inauguration, where
[20:44.080 --> 20:49.080]  it's a car bomb going off 500 yards from the inauguration, or it's one driving through
[20:49.080 --> 20:54.200]  and blowing up and killing Trump and a bunch of the government, and then COG activates,
[20:54.200 --> 21:00.200]  or it gets worse, a tactical nuke goes off a half mile killing the president and everybody
[21:00.200 --> 21:07.240]  in the surrounding area, or maybe the globalists go big and just a 50 megaton detonates, and
[21:07.240 --> 21:14.040]  they claim the Russians had it buried under their embassy since 1969, the word is they
[21:14.040 --> 21:18.680]  did smuggle one in, the word is there is one under there, I mean who knows, if you don't
[21:18.680 --> 21:22.200]  think the United States has to smuggle weapons into Russia, I mean the Cold War was very
[21:22.200 --> 21:26.800]  serious, but this is what's ongoing ladies and gentlemen, and meanwhile we have these
[21:26.800 --> 21:32.200]  foreign multinationals admitting at Davos we have, in fact let's cue that clip up later
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.960]  in the show if we can, find that, I forgot to tell the crew, so it's no fault of theirs,
[21:36.960 --> 21:41.160]  we have Biden at Davos saying globalism is collapsing, that their whole world order is
[21:41.160 --> 21:46.240]  in great crisis because of nationalism and populism, oh how horrible, thought it didn't
[21:46.240 --> 21:50.320]  exist, I thought globalism didn't exist in the New York Times, and then we've also got
[21:50.320 --> 21:54.560]  the Chinese Communist President there promising to prop up world government, and we've got
[21:54.560 --> 21:59.840]  them all lecturing us on democracy, yes, the Communist Chinese President and Joe Biden
[21:59.840 --> 22:05.320]  about how the democratic world order is in crisis and it's the fault of nationalist
[22:05.320 --> 22:10.400]  movements, you mean we elect a movement to have Brexit, you mean we elect Trump and elect
[22:10.400 --> 22:16.000]  a record number of people to the houses in the states, legislatures, oh you mean that's
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.920]  undemocratic, I forgot, but the Communist Chinese, they're not a problem, right, again
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.120]  people hear Biden going, this is undemocratic, what are you talking about, well now they're
[22:29.120 --> 22:35.800]  saying, in fact what did Biden call it, he called him the semi-president elect, see
[22:35.800 --> 22:39.520]  now they're already getting the idea, because if they came right out and said he should
[22:39.520 --> 22:43.400]  be removed, he is a president, at first you go how dare you challenge an election, you
[22:43.400 --> 22:47.280]  don't say we never should do that, now it's like oh he's semi-president elect, we're
[22:47.280 --> 22:50.880]  not sure, well what if he gets killed, what if he's a Russian agent, well we do need
[22:50.880 --> 22:59.320]  to impeach him, because Putin talks right in his ear, if a weapon goes off, if there
[22:59.320 --> 23:09.840]  is an attack, the motive, the means, the history, the preparation is directly on the globalist,
[23:09.840 --> 23:12.840]  and if they think they're going to get away with it, they think they're going to have
[23:12.840 --> 23:17.920]  some COG and announce that they've got a new provisional government in place, I'm sad
[23:17.920 --> 23:20.760]  you're going to do that, because the stock market will probably crash, it'll be a bunch
[23:20.760 --> 23:26.560]  of other bad stuff, it'll be very destabilizing, but you know what, I'd give your coup about
[23:26.560 --> 23:42.760]  24 hours, and about 24 hours into that, who do you think provides you your security, 100%
[23:42.760 --> 23:51.720]  food quantifiable fact that within 24 hours a chain reaction will be set off, and it would
[23:51.720 --> 24:01.840]  be goodbye, bluebird, bye bye, so you think you're going to do this, you think you're
[24:01.840 --> 24:06.800]  going to run on poison people with polonium and pull this crap against a bunch of Americans
[24:06.800 --> 24:12.000]  that just want prosperity and just want sovereignty and just want to be a prosperous nation, we
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.720]  don't want to be cuckold, we don't want to be dominated, we don't want to be shut down,
[24:15.720 --> 24:22.280]  we don't want to be ripped off anymore, and it doesn't mean Trump is perfect, but he's
[24:22.280 --> 24:27.880]  not out to get us, he's a good guy who wants prosperity and wants what made America great
[24:27.880 --> 24:31.520]  again, but under globalism America isn't supposed to be great, we're supposed to be
[24:31.520 --> 24:35.640]  managed and controlled and have policies in place where we can't even compete, that'll
[24:35.640 --> 24:41.800]  teach those Americans, that's what the multinationals have done, and it's over, because even if
[24:41.800 --> 24:46.760]  you kill me or Trump or Matt Drudge or Ron Paul or Senator Paul or whoever you think you're
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.920]  going to go after, let me explain something, ideas are what are bulletproof, Victor Hugo,
[24:52.920 --> 25:04.120]  no army can stop an idea whose time has come, no army can stop an idea whose time has come,
[25:04.120 --> 25:15.320]  no army, so it got paraphrased in Viva Vendetta, ideas are bulletproof, and we have an idea
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.240]  a thousand times better, a million times better, I mean freedom, open societies, free association,
[25:21.240 --> 25:27.400]  true wealth, true empowerment, men being men, women being women, notice they assault what
[25:27.400 --> 25:32.000]  makes us strong, no if you want to be something else, hell you want to be a dog, that's great,
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.320]  I'm not paying for your sex change, I'm not paying for you to think you're a dog, you
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.160]  understand, but see it's being imposed by the globalist-run media to make us weak, because
[25:40.160 --> 25:45.120]  men and women together with families, and building and being strong, and women challenging
[25:45.120 --> 25:49.600]  their men, and men challenging their women, and culture being strong, and admiring that
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.680]  is what makes us excel, and America was the model of that rugged individualism, they're
[25:53.680 --> 25:59.840]  attacking our strengths, it's declassified, it's in the WikiLeaks, I knew 20 years ago
[25:59.840 --> 26:02.880]  because it was in textbooks, because they bragged about it, but it was declassified
[26:02.880 --> 26:08.280]  two years ago, but for decades the CIA put out ugly art, ugly literature, and then gave
[26:08.280 --> 26:14.840]  it awards to say it was beautiful to twist people's minds and to denigrate things that
[26:14.840 --> 26:21.480]  everyone universally knew were more beautiful and regal, and then now what they do with
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.640]  MTV and all of it is correct brains, this is military technology being used against
[26:27.640 --> 26:31.480]  people, people go oh, I thought the military's good, and they're saying military technology,
[26:31.480 --> 26:36.560]  see the military and military technology are two different things, globalist weaponizing
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.320]  the food, the water, the culture, is it all of us, they hate the troops more than us because
[26:41.320 --> 26:47.240]  they've been allowed to be men to a limited aspect to be used by the power elite who disdain
[26:47.240 --> 26:50.600]  them and hate them, and then now that they're done with them, and the age of the robots
[26:50.600 --> 26:58.320]  is rising, they plan to get rid of them and phase them out, so if a nuke goes off, or
[26:58.320 --> 27:06.960]  a truck bomb goes off, or there's a mass shooting, or chlorine gas is released, you
[27:06.960 --> 27:10.520]  know who did it, just like if the city gets caught on fire, it's admittedly funded by
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.880]  Soros and other Clinton connected groups and refused fascism, saying they're gonna stop
[27:15.880 --> 27:23.360]  Trump being elected, Trump pens regimes, stop it before it starts, bring DC to a halt, take
[27:23.360 --> 27:31.120]  to the streets, every night, every day, growing in numbers, and in the meanwhile they're financed
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.160]  by the big foreign banker, Nazi collaborator, I'd say take the streets and take it back
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.440]  if they declare COG and Obama installs some new person, I'll be in the streets and I bet
[27:40.440 --> 27:47.200]  the cops will be with me, no we sat here and watched people elect Obama because we knew
[27:47.200 --> 27:51.280]  that who he was running against were shills, so it didn't matter, with Trump they're crapping
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.520]  their bridges because it's real, I'm gonna go to break here in a few minutes and I'm
[27:54.520 --> 27:59.040]  gonna come back with the clip I've been mentioning, the full clip, and let me play the shorter
[27:59.040 --> 28:04.880]  clip now, just the 32nd clip, seeing it in, it's up on infoawards.com, it's the top story
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.840]  on drudgereport.com, at least it was 30 minutes ago, you can punch that up on screen for folks
[28:09.840 --> 28:16.920]  up there on the top left hand corner of drudge, and the headline is, pull it up here, seeing
[28:16.920 --> 28:23.600]  in is reporting that Obama will appoint the next president if Trump is killed, if Trump
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.960]  was killed during inauguration Obama appointee would be president and they're licking their
[28:27.960 --> 28:32.080]  chops talking about this and saying he shouldn't be president, and I'm gonna say it again,
[28:32.080 --> 28:38.320]  a bunch of Democrats aren't showing up, what's the number now dude, it was 50 something this
[28:38.320 --> 28:44.280]  morning, oh it's 60 now, oh first it's five and I said this a few weeks ago, first it's
[28:44.280 --> 28:49.760]  five, then it's fit 20, then it's 30, then it's 50, then it's 60, then it's 100, then
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.440]  it's 200, and if you see Republicans, word is I guess McCain's saying he may not show
[28:54.440 --> 28:59.760]  up, oh and John Kerry and oh, the Bushes, Herbert Walker said he didn't want to be six
[28:59.760 --> 29:03.840]  feet under, he said I'd be six feet under if I came to that, was that cryptic from the
[29:03.840 --> 29:09.640]  old crypt keeper, or was it just an old former head of the CIA, being a friendly old jolly
[29:09.640 --> 29:18.760]  old saint, jolly old elf, how many is it now dude, 60 in counting, it was 50 at the hotel
[29:18.760 --> 29:24.480]  an hour ago Buckley, 60 Democrats in counting, you're not attending the Trump inauguration,
[29:24.480 --> 29:30.920]  yeah a nuke goes off, you're all prime suspects, we're gonna come back and play the long clip
[29:30.920 --> 29:36.200]  of the short clip, we've got the Soros busting people in, we caught that on video last night,
[29:36.200 --> 29:48.920]  it's all on infowords.com and drugsreport.com has amazing coverage as well, stay with us.
[29:48.920 --> 30:00.080]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.080 --> 30:03.880]  Democrats are racing for the U.S. border right before Trump is taking office, there's an
[30:03.880 --> 30:08.080]  article that's up on the Drudge report that talks about how illegals are coming for the
[30:08.080 --> 30:12.920]  U.S. border in lieu of a Trump victory, he's taking office tomorrow folks, migrants that
[30:12.920 --> 30:16.880]  are trying to sneak into the U.S. on the last day of what they see because they realize
[30:16.880 --> 30:21.280]  that a wall is in fact coming, these challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they
[30:21.280 --> 30:25.560]  have that someday soon U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.960]  them out altogether, so before Trump takes office tomorrow they're racing against time,
[30:29.960 --> 30:33.840]  getting a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[30:33.840 --> 30:38.640]  In the town, near a frontier group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire, a trash in the
[30:38.640 --> 30:43.520]  early morning cold, there's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants
[30:43.520 --> 30:47.920]  ready to jump the train and the event that it slows down and I've got news for you folks,
[30:47.920 --> 30:53.240]  that wall is coming but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn literally and racing
[30:53.240 --> 31:00.240]  for the border, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infoworks.com.
[31:23.240 --> 31:53.160]  On the web at infoworks.com.
[31:53.160 --> 31:55.160]  That's infoworksteam.com.
[31:55.160 --> 31:57.160]  That's infoworksteam.com.
[31:57.160 --> 32:03.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, our show is here on the road with a very important announcement.
[32:03.160 --> 32:07.680]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available
[32:07.680 --> 32:13.040]  at pre-order at infoworksstore.com, it's the making of a president and it breaks down how
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.600]  Trump really got elected, the inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the
[32:17.600 --> 32:21.800]  future and what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[32:21.800 --> 32:25.840]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium, it breaks
[32:25.840 --> 32:29.680]  down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports him and it
[32:29.680 --> 32:33.240]  supports info wars in our whole operation so it's essential that this book go to the
[32:33.240 --> 32:36.760]  top of the charts in the political area if not to the very top of the charts.
[32:36.760 --> 32:41.160]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing, they are in full crisis mode,
[32:41.160 --> 32:45.800]  nationals movements are exploding, everybody needs to go pre-order so you get it first
[32:45.800 --> 32:49.200]  at infoworksstore.com, the making of a president by Roger Stone.
[32:49.200 --> 32:52.600]  I'm Alex Jones, I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump, pray
[32:52.600 --> 32:57.040]  for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now sir, the first
[32:57.040 --> 33:23.040]  to have it shipped to you.
[33:27.040 --> 33:34.840]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance,
[33:34.840 --> 33:41.200]  you're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:41.200 --> 33:50.160]  Last night in DC left me in a haze, I tell you I'm feeling good, you know what I liked
[33:50.160 --> 33:54.760]  was that intro and that outro last segment where we have that liner that we've had for
[33:54.760 --> 34:00.520]  almost 20 years, about 18 years where we talk about we're on the march, the empire is on
[34:00.520 --> 34:09.400]  the run, that is where it all meets the road folks, that's where it comes down to who wants
[34:09.400 --> 34:14.280]  it more, you want to live in a free society or do you want to be a slave and again we're
[34:14.280 --> 34:18.760]  not offering some utopia, we're talking about rugged individualism, free market capitalism,
[34:18.760 --> 34:23.680]  the family, God what made this country great, if you don't love God, you don't love family
[34:23.680 --> 34:31.080]  that's fine go live your life, don't try to make us live like you do miserable, you don't
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.560]  believe anything so you believe in evil because the truth is if you don't believe anything
[34:34.560 --> 34:42.320]  you just sink to evil, that's what you manifest, that's what you believe in, in fact it was
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.040]  something I was reminded of just a few days ago was that not only were the folks that
[34:48.040 --> 34:53.880]  had the French Revolution called the Jacobins but the Democratic Party for a while here
[34:53.880 --> 34:59.240]  in the United States was called the Jacobins and it got to where basically Thomas Jefferson
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.360]  had to finally start criticizing the French Revolution and come out against it once he
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.400]  was president because it turned out during the French Revolution for a while they even
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.960]  wanted to kill Thomas Jefferson and to explain what happened is he's the founder of the Democratic
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.240]  Party, the Jacobins were the Illuminati, this is in the Encyclopedia, they wanted to overthrow
[35:19.240 --> 35:24.840]  the family, they wanted human sacrifice, they wanted a nine-day work week, no holidays,
[35:24.840 --> 35:32.560]  they wanted to set up basically a council of men as gods over slaves but they sold this
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.120]  as freedom to the people and an overthrow of the church and royalty and I'm not defending
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.840]  royalty or the church, the point is they wanted to overthrow it and create an absolute dictator
[35:43.840 --> 35:50.920]  ship, a cult of power and that very group tried to take over our revolution, they failed
[35:50.920 --> 35:57.040]  so they had their own in France and in Germany to an extent it failed there as well but it
[35:57.040 --> 36:01.440]  was a hell of a nightmare and so when we look at the Democrats trying to overthrow reality,
[36:01.440 --> 36:07.160]  trying to hurt children, trying to bring in jihadis, trying to overthrow the church,
[36:07.160 --> 36:14.440]  trying to overthrow the family, it's because this is a cult, a religion of degeneracy,
[36:14.440 --> 36:20.480]  a religion of corruption and they are Jacobins and you know it's funny I've done my own historical
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.560]  research I started calling them Jacobins about ten years ago and then you research history
[36:25.560 --> 36:30.640]  deeper and you find out whoa I researched them and called them Jacobins but it turns
[36:30.640 --> 36:37.760]  out they were literally called Jacobins, I mean it's just crazy how the more you research
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.880]  history you'll come to your own conclusions about it, really deep stuff and then you'll
[36:41.880 --> 36:49.920]  read more and find out ten years later that it was known then and their whole plan was
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.160]  known then and that you just rediscovered it, you didn't discover it, you rediscovered
[36:54.160 --> 37:02.160]  it, it's like claiming in 1498 or 14, when was it that Columbus discovered the New World?
[37:02.160 --> 37:08.920]  1492, memory fails, that's the most basic stuff now, can't remember sometimes but those
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.600]  little factoids you know like Columbus Tale, The Ocean Blue in 1492 is that it, yeah, you
[37:14.600 --> 37:18.720]  have to have little rhymes to remember it and of course we know they've dug up Vikings
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.160]  now that were here 1,000 plus years ago but who do you think discovered it 15,000 years
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.160]  ago?
[37:25.160 --> 37:30.000]  Mesoamericans coming across the Bering Strait land bridge and paddling in on Canoes just
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.320]  like the folks from Tahiti found in Hawaii 2,000 years ago, Hawaii is one of the places
[37:36.320 --> 37:44.240]  the last to settle, 2,000 years ago is when the Polynesians discovered it then Captain
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.760]  Cook of course later, it's just amazing to think I discovered things and think I figured
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.000]  this out and then later you find out they knew all about it was in newspapers and the
[37:53.000 --> 38:01.040]  Democrats were called the Jacobin Party from about the 1790s to about the 1820s and then
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.680]  they confused Jacobinism with Masonic order and even band masonry in the US for a few
[38:06.680 --> 38:12.240]  decades because and Washington warned of this, he said the Jacobins and the Illuminati are
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.080]  taking over the Masonic order, they're turning it to evil and they mean to bring down the
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.960]  entire order and basically counterfeit and scapegoat us if we don't stop them so people
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.640]  always ask me oh you say you're for the Founding Fathers, they were a bunch of masons, man
[38:27.640 --> 38:31.600]  I've had a lot of family that were masons, great grandfathers that were high level masons
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.760]  and people, masons found in Texas, most of the people that fought against the British
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.920]  Crown were masons and then the British Crown was masons so again it's like saying all of
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.960]  Israel's bad or all Catholics are bad or all Protestants are bad or you know all this or
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.200]  that are bad, it's just not true even with Islam you can't sit there and say they're
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.000]  all murderers or all killers, it just so happens those that run Islam and the dominant orthodox
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.480]  dogma of Islam now that is becoming the dominant form is radical murderous jihad takeover expansionist
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.880]  political Islam so it is an evil weapon now but you can certainly say throughout history
[39:07.880 --> 39:11.000]  there's been lots of Muslims that weren't bad people the point is all these labels mean
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.920]  nothing but we sit here in the nation's capital and it's important to understand that George
[39:15.920 --> 39:21.240]  Washington did found this country he was for real and he was not part of any Jacobin revolution
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.480]  and in fact we would have never had this country had the Jacobins gotten control so thank God
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.720]  for George Washington a true king among men who they wanted to make king and he turned
[39:30.720 --> 39:36.000]  it down they wanted to serve a third term back before there was even a law on that and
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.280]  he said nope I'm gone see that's a real leader folks he wanted to defeat the enemy secure
[39:41.280 --> 39:47.720]  the republic and then retire he was about to come out of retirement over things happening
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.880]  in the country and that's why the word is they poisoned him now let's continue ladies
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.400]  and gentlemen oh poison where have I heard of that before let me start getting to these
[39:58.400 --> 40:06.760]  clips if you just joined us it's important to understand that a whole bunch of democrats
[40:06.760 --> 40:12.880]  60 plus the numbers growing members of house members of the senate or members of the executive
[40:12.880 --> 40:22.240]  branch the head of the state department John Kerry are saying they're not coming if a newt
[40:22.240 --> 40:29.120]  goes off if a bomb goes off the democrats not attending our prime suspects their parties
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.960]  called for trump to be overthrown they said he's a russian agent they said impeach him
[40:32.960 --> 40:36.240]  their own publications have said somebody needs to put a bullet in him somebody needs
[40:36.240 --> 40:43.400]  to kill him hollywood producers have called for his death this is outrageous and notice
[40:43.400 --> 40:47.480]  the public didn't buy your demonization it shows how discredited you are so now what
[40:47.480 --> 40:53.320]  do evil cabals turn to when everything else is failed they turn to the sword oh remember
[40:53.320 --> 41:03.160]  what the bible says those that live by the sword die by the sword and you've been cocooned
[41:03.160 --> 41:09.920]  for so long here in dc interlopers hijackers criminals that have hijacked our nation you
[41:09.920 --> 41:15.440]  and your collaborator media you in the trash pile media you in the garbage media you in
[41:15.440 --> 41:22.320]  the septicon fake news media you in the whore media are done no matter what you do no matter
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.040]  who you kill no matter what you pull off the whole world sees you the whole world hates
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.960]  you by the way trump and his people have started to come out and point out that china and saudi
[41:31.960 --> 41:36.840]  arabia and the e you were heavily involved in our election the russians their foreign
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.120]  minister came out and snapped for meeting with the leader of australia and said how dare
[41:41.120 --> 41:48.480]  you we weren't involved the proof is e you governments admit they meddled so it's good
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.240]  to see that talking point getting picked up and again this is common sense why did anybody
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.680]  else point that out why have i been hammering it for months finally to see people picking
[41:57.680 --> 42:03.520]  it up i'm not complaining here i'm saying this is common sense stuff i'm gonna get to
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.520]  this clip here in the other clips in a moment briefly i want to say about something extremely
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.280]  exciting and i meant to launch this last week i've just been so busy we didn't get to it
[42:12.280 --> 42:19.800]  this is important on a bunch of fronts everybody knows i promote colloidal silver because there's
[42:19.800 --> 42:25.000]  so many bacteria out there that have become drug resistant or disinfectant resistant
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.560]  that's a crisis in the medical world it's a crisis in the military it's a crisis on
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.640]  our families flesh eating bacteria bacteria that can't be eradicated are a plague and
[42:34.640 --> 42:39.480]  the the antibiotics i mean one lady i was reading had to be given 20 plus antibiotics
[42:39.480 --> 42:43.800]  for her tb last week and it wouldn't take care of her another lady was 20 plus wouldn't
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.480]  get rid of flesh eating bacteria i mean this is killing hundreds of thousands of people
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.040]  a year in the us alone and it's just back on the newspaper stuff so i personally have
[42:53.040 --> 42:57.840]  been researching a lot of things i'm just gonna leave it at that through our context
[42:57.840 --> 43:04.360]  this is a whole other subject the fact that we're getting contracts the exclusive distributors
[43:04.360 --> 43:10.520]  of the nano tech to body armor only law enforcement to get that for three years in the military
[43:10.520 --> 43:16.800]  for longer the fact that we're the exclusive sends a big message and it means that we can
[43:16.800 --> 43:22.640]  get a lot of things the public now that we're only available to the military and i mean
[43:22.640 --> 43:26.760]  a lot of that's because obviously the number one listening group we have is the military
[43:26.760 --> 43:31.680]  and former military and who do you think owns these companies so so they they pull out of
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.800]  the strings to make sure people are able to work with us so when you purchase these products
[43:36.800 --> 43:42.360]  you're also helping infowars break into an entire market to bring you these incredible
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.440]  products that the liberals and the globalist don't want the public you know that under
[43:46.440 --> 43:50.160]  obama they've banned the brass that the military has getting recycled out of the public they
[43:50.160 --> 43:55.440]  just basically throw it away so it's a win-win you need to get the body armor that there's
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.840]  a backpack insert or the full body weighs five times less and that's conservative there's
[43:59.840 --> 44:02.840]  all sorts of helicopters out here and you name it i mean i'm right here on pennsylvania
[44:02.840 --> 44:10.560]  avenue here in dc for live coverage the inauguration well now we have something huge we're launching
[44:10.560 --> 44:17.160]  combat one this has now been adopted system-wide the department of defense it has been used
[44:17.160 --> 44:22.480]  for over a decade by special operations that's who they were testing it with this is out
[44:22.480 --> 44:26.720]  of the defense department the defense department develops a lot of things with companies it's
[44:26.720 --> 44:34.080]  been a long term there's a 12 year contract i was told infowars is launching we're launching
[44:34.080 --> 44:38.920]  combat one skin protectant wipes they've got gels they've got a whole line of products
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.560]  and folks these are less expensive because that's part of the contract than like stupid
[44:42.560 --> 44:47.280]  baby wipes that don't do anything or they just lower your fertility but don't kill the bacteria
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.320]  you know the chemicals and those do that this is safe it's a whole line of stuff it's amazing
[44:53.320 --> 44:58.360]  you've got to go research it for yourself this is super advanced this is decades of research
[44:58.360 --> 45:04.160]  with the 12 years overall with the pentagon in the field working with the developers
[45:04.160 --> 45:10.360]  again that's how the pentagon does it that i was previously involved developing battlefield
[45:10.360 --> 45:17.440]  wound sealants that's why he was involved now with dna force you've got to have doctors
[45:17.440 --> 45:22.640]  that are involved even even in taking things through the fda process now our products don't
[45:22.640 --> 45:26.240]  go to the fda systems they're under supplements point is my dad has actually done that program
[45:26.240 --> 45:29.720]  well it's the same thing here and they've got medical doctors they're working with the
[45:29.720 --> 45:34.480]  military to develop this stuff now now my dad's products is a separate deal that's not
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.600]  where it's going from the pentagon to the public but where it's going directly to the
[45:37.600 --> 45:43.480]  pentagon to be prescription but that's a separate product infowars launches combat one skin
[45:43.480 --> 45:49.600]  protecting wipes previously only available to the dod military grade hygiene technology
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.520]  is by special operations amazing pre-preparedness and survival product everyone needs combat
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.800]  one i would buy cases of this for your office cases of this for your family it's a totally
[45:59.800 --> 46:08.880]  new patented secret system that is approved confirmed and i mean dod system-wide in 2016
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.560]  17 rolling out we have the exclusive for like four months and then you're going to see it
[46:13.560 --> 46:19.680]  in major stores okay so we're just giving us the rollout as a thank you for you being
[46:19.680 --> 46:23.840]  patriot seriously and this is what it's like when you fight the new order you defeat them
[46:23.840 --> 46:27.120]  you begin to return the republic it's like oh you want the body armor only police get
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.960]  here oh you want the boom boom boom and so it's it's helping support the info or it's
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.340]  helping support you support us with just amazing products so we're launching combat one skin
[46:37.340 --> 46:43.520]  protection also dna forces back in stock it's 10% off amazing the bio pqq alone is over
[46:43.520 --> 46:48.400]  the top skipping this break then i'm gonna stop it's part of the celebration trump 45
[46:48.400 --> 46:52.640]  info or select storeable food is now this is the big one we haven't done this since
[46:52.640 --> 46:56.640]  december okay we haven't like over a month it was in early december we did this we've
[46:56.640 --> 47:00.360]  gotten authorization for a limited time what happens is there's assembly line gets caught
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.880]  up you know and so now they're allowed to do it again already lowest prices out there
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.320]  on high quality storeable foods and info or select dot com info or store dot com which
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.880]  is my patriot supply their entire catalog just with our label it gets around their contracts
[47:12.880 --> 47:17.640]  with distributors to let us give you the lowest price out there and it's worked like a charm
[47:17.640 --> 47:23.200]  we now sell more food than all the other people combined because i went dub let's take the
[47:23.200 --> 47:27.840]  best lowest cost company and really cut the profit down to almost nothing and then we'll
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.840]  sell 20 times more and dominate the entire market which they didn't agree on about two
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.480]  years ago the first time i did this you notice i'm gonna do it for a day and then it was once
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.000]  every six months and then once you know every two months and then they're like okay you're
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.920]  right cutting the profit down to basically five ten percent really does work you're right
[47:44.920 --> 47:48.440]  which tells you the other companies are making two three four times markup my patriot was
[47:48.440 --> 47:52.040]  only making like thirty four percent profit which you need to pay for things in this country
[47:52.040 --> 47:57.520]  well how about ten percent profit that's what we do to dominate the market again free market
[47:57.520 --> 48:02.360]  very aggressive thirty to forty percent off the entire line in four store dot com and then
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.960]  it ends this weekend the inauguration special let's make our bodies great again we have to
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.440]  end it a lot of stuff sold out but we've got brain force till thirty percent off twenty
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.600]  percent more in the bottle super no vitality thirty percent off secret twelve twenty percent

[48:25.520 --> 48:30.400]  as the inauguration special right through sunday and then it's over it's over we've got some
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.040]  new specials next week on select stuff but this is the big special this is how I'm financing
[48:35.040 --> 48:39.680]  having a big crew here having it does feel weird I mean we do need it because I need
[48:39.680 --> 48:44.880]  to come on to my kids and keep the fight going but you know we've got quite a security team
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.000]  it's like bizarre but I tell you my current security guys they're just a couple of them
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.880]  so we're going to bring in some extra people and it's really great folks so that's going
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.640]  on really smart too it's amazing how smart these guys that have been like Navy SEALs
[49:00.640 --> 49:05.840]  for fifteen years and other guys have been in other special operations ships for twenty
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.760]  years I think they've seen a couple of things I tell you a queue especially just constantly
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.160]  knows exactly what's going on he'll say I bet it's this or look at that then sure enough
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.360]  it is um but that's because the guys that don't have those instincts don't make it you
[49:21.360 --> 49:24.600]  know you learn the more you live it's like all instinct go with your gut go with your
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.160]  gut go with your gut go with your gut go with your gut go with your gut go with your gut
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.520]  anyways folks I went with my gut with Donald Trump and look what's happened the enemy is
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.400]  out to getting because he's so real and they've got their bots over time attacking myself

[52:40.840 --> 52:44.720]  DC the atmosphere what's happening what do you make because I know you sit there listening
[52:44.720 --> 52:48.000]  to show every day and I'm not trying to brag I've just studied them I know how they operate
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.720]  so I tell people this and I remind them so they know I'm not joking I said if they start
[52:52.720 --> 52:57.640]  doing XYZ all the way down and then start saying COG what if Trump gets killed with the
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.000]  inauguration or indicted oh Trump appoints the president I said if they start saying
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.080]  that and they don't show up the inauguration they may try to nuke and I'm not fear mongering
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.560]  here I'm I'm in their head I mean they're this crazy the hell they turn loose jihadis
[53:11.560 --> 53:17.160]  all over the Middle East killing 300,000 people in Syria alone I mean Obama's been caught it's
[53:17.160 --> 53:23.200]  come out audio and video of them saying we created ISIS and al-Qaeda Obama wanted al-Qaeda
[53:23.200 --> 53:27.400]  to grow Sy Hersh was exposed it the military all knows it that's what finally they were
[53:27.400 --> 53:31.600]  so arrogant the military finally said we've tortured people we've done all this crap we
[53:31.600 --> 53:35.600]  thought it was right thing to do now you're actually going to put al-Qaeda in charge of
[53:35.600 --> 53:39.680]  everything after we fought them for all these years what is your you really did work with
[53:39.680 --> 53:44.560]  them on 9 11 so the big tipping points here do but they don't know to jump off the boat
[53:44.560 --> 53:48.160]  swim for sure I think they're gonna try to stay on the boat with us I think so but and
[53:48.160 --> 53:52.800]  look at this this came out of Washington examiner media warns of inauguration drone bombing
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.720]  not safe they have anti-drone technology everywhere around for those that don't know all the commercial
[53:58.720 --> 54:02.440]  drones and the ones you bought the store for two years have stuff that don't let you in
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.400]  these areas right I try to find by the capital in Austin just to get a shot for our show
[54:06.400 --> 54:13.080]  and it just goes you know yeah it stops they have other jammers they have jammers so you're
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.720]  trying to say that oh some technology so probably the Russians are gonna come in and bombed
[54:17.720 --> 54:21.800]  bombed Trump or whatever with a drone it's ridiculous they have so much security set
[54:21.800 --> 54:27.760]  up here it's at least a million times well let's a million times a thousand times a million
[54:27.760 --> 54:32.520]  then then what's going on about it that's that's public budget right do these everywhere
[54:32.520 --> 54:37.080]  exactly yeah we don't see have probably 90% of security going on they're putting up some
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.120]  barriers and fences but beyond that it's the human Intel it's playing clothes cops walking
[54:41.120 --> 54:45.440]  around playing clothes agents walking around we saw we spotted some earlier this week we
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.360]  have we have I'm gonna say I'm gonna tell you I guess whatever but what is the government's
[54:50.360 --> 54:53.840]  already been transferred to Trump right I just want to give you guys a nice flash the
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.560]  commanders are already giving the authorization I don't even know well they're scared of those
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.920]  200 executive orders he wants to sign as soon as he gets it all yeah I gotta say that he's
[55:01.920 --> 55:08.080]  going right over there at least five today yeah at 200 by next week exactly and they
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.880]  are they're literally crapping their drawers at this and and the Democrats are all running
[55:11.880 --> 55:17.040]  around on the span wagon going on Congressman Lewis who's he's he's pretty much a dirt bag
[55:17.040 --> 55:20.400]  I want to play this clip let's play the short one and I'll play the long one I promise next
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.360]  hour right at the start of the hour let's play the 32nd singing in going if he gets
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.360]  killed Obama appoints someone to COG here it is the inauguration you have two lines
[55:30.360 --> 55:34.920]  of succession one for the Brock Obama administration which is still in place and one which really
[55:34.920 --> 55:39.400]  won't be in place until Donald Trump is is inaugurated that comes into office and actually
[55:39.400 --> 55:42.720]  formally nominates and the Senate confirms his people you might actually end up with
[55:42.720 --> 55:47.640]  the president's from the prior administration because of a tragedy adding to the confusion
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.480]  by noon Friday all of Obama's cabinet secretaries are expected to resign John Kerry the current
[55:53.480 --> 55:57.960]  secretary of state would be the first cabinet secretary in the line of succession but he's
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.720]  out of office by noon Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may not
[56:02.720 --> 56:08.000]  be confirmed for another week or two so who would be Secretary of State on Friday afternoon
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.440]  according to State Department sources the job would fall to the highest ranking non-political
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.720]  official in the department the Under Secretary for Political Affairs Tom Shannon one of the
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.720]  most obscure possibilities is that someone who is an acting Secretary of State someone
[56:21.720 --> 56:26.720]  lower down the line and Secretary of State State Department today assumes the acting
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.560]  Secretary of State position is in the line and the worst happens and that person becomes
[56:30.560 --> 56:33.880]  president of these for a while all right we're going to put the full clip cut in the next
[56:33.880 --> 56:37.040]  hour with a bunch of other clips and you know I do folks I did not get to those two later
[56:37.040 --> 56:42.840]  so powerful second hour coming up Rob what do you make of this I mean they're clearly
[56:42.840 --> 56:47.240]  trying to prepare the ground for an attack they're hyping drone attacks they're hyping
[56:47.240 --> 56:51.720]  you know people are going to kill Trump attack the crowd they're hoping it happens hoping
[56:51.720 --> 56:55.440]  a loon does it but what do you make of all the Democrats not showing up to this that
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.560]  makes them suspects if something happens I totally agree and I think it's a fake thing
[56:59.560 --> 57:03.400]  that they that they're saying oh Trump's illegitimate they don't all believe that they're probably
[57:03.400 --> 57:07.040]  being tipped off but look at it this was on the today show this morning with a segment
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.160]  called drone danger at the inauguration and they're talking about a high fly security
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.760]  threat and that bombs have been dropped in Iraq with drones at least once a day when
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.380]  strapped to the bomb and this is a quote a worst case scenario especially with hundreds
[57:18.380 --> 57:23.280]  of thousands of people gathered at one spot like the inauguration the report said so they're
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.480]  late they're there it's predicted programming oh we told you it could happen and look it
[57:27.480 --> 57:33.320]  did well the number one threat would be somebody getting a helicopter with plastic explosive
[57:33.320 --> 57:37.480]  flying in real close to the ground so they'd be hard to be shot down by a missile or be
[57:37.480 --> 57:41.840]  hard to jam it but they've got EMP guns you name it and then this isn't something terrorists
[57:41.840 --> 57:45.600]  don't know where they can just shoot at a helicopter and take it out and believe it
[57:45.600 --> 57:49.440]  they're not hiding it there's guys with service there are missiles out here there's people
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.600]  with you know guarantee with more classified helicopters flying everywhere around here
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.840]  as soon as we walked out on the balcony where we're at they came real close by to see what
[57:57.840 --> 58:00.840]  we were doing because we had a camera out there and they were just checking out see
[58:00.840 --> 58:05.760]  what we're doing and then they flow off well here's the deal they've left our borders wide
[58:05.760 --> 58:10.200]  open they brought in hundreds of thousands of people here jihadis millions in Europe
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.480]  every time they attack the media blames our guns when they're the ones that brought them
[58:14.480 --> 58:18.600]  in so here's the deal when I say it's a false flag they've opened the borders up they've
[58:18.600 --> 58:22.840]  brought all this in and then we've got to be a police state at the micro level it's
[58:22.840 --> 58:26.680]  like leaving your doors open at night without having an arm guard by your bed now you want
[58:26.680 --> 58:30.400]  to lock your doors folks that's the first line of defense all right well tell me about
[58:30.400 --> 58:35.040]  the 14 hour broadcast we come back in 70 seconds in the second hour a lot of guests and a lot

[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:49.600]  got to look at them very carefully these are legal documents they got to make sure they're
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:55.000]  constitutional to just reverse everything obama's done then they've got to go dig the bureaucrats
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.400]  out who look like they're scared to death later in the broadcast I'm going to go ahead
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:08.200]  and tell the story of running into one of the major media owner who I've always been nice
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:14.560]  to and left alone even though I've seen them take some bad turns in the past but talk about
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.840]  democratic party operatives inside the republican party and inside the liberty movement it was
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:27.920]  like it was just crazy and I got to tell you the arrogance of these people they wear arrogance
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:33.240]  like a shield whereas where I'm from in Texas with hospitality and everything the more you
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:38.600]  got and the more you know cattle you got the smaller hat you know you cut you know I have
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:42.920]  a great story with that too I mean well the richer you are the more simple F-150 you drive
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:48.160]  and you don't even wear a cowboy hat or maybe wear a little cap and it's just I'm so sick
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:55.320]  of arrogant people and the arrogance here is dripping it's dripping it's just crazy
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:02:00.280]  I mean you can be around navy seals or delta force guys you name it who are like the top
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:04.720]  of you know and they're real humble and nice and then you're around these little scummy
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.640]  political operatives and they think they're so tough so smart they make me sick these
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:16.880]  people are the swamp and he said Trump behind the scenes the same way so humble so gracious
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:22.000]  so nice that's cuz they have no power those other ones and then the people that run around
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.640]  and go I'm a democratic leader I'm a democratic leader they love to just talk about how powerful
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:31.880]  they are and they really don't have any power they're all sadly like mentally retarded yeah
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:40.360]  that's for damn sure I feel sorry for it's sad and just flying on the plane you could
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:44.440]  tell who was a protester who's gonna be a protester and who was there to support Trump
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:49.360]  and we even ran into a Texas state rep right outside had a big hat on big tall guy too
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:53.240]  and he was proudly wearing his hat and nobody was messing with him because when you walk
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:57.080]  around like you like you know you're ready to kick some butt if anybody touches you nobody's
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:00.120]  gonna mess with you that's right whenever they beat people up it's like real liberal
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:04.200]  hippies yeah they don't mess with you six four but you know you are wearing a purple
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:08.440]  jacket so I am that's that's that's to infiltrate is this for infiltration yeah totally actually
[1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:12.720]  looks sharp purple it off purple revolution see a little short fat guys like me we can't
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:18.880]  pull off peacocking like you well you know that's just you know sometimes you gotta just
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:23.960]  come into Washington new suit I got one tonight too for the deplorable which are gonna be speaking
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:28.160]  yeah which they caught the Democrats at the ping-pong pizza place and that I'm not planning
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:32.560]  to gas us yeah you imagine if we got caught playing to gas people and causing a stamp
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:37.600]  it would be the end of the war I would be arrested the next day I would be in jail yeah
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:42.000]  those guys are walking around it's no big deal no big deal you know well that's because
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.920]  the cops aren't bad but the political bureaucrats above them it's DC they think it's great yeah
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:50.320]  no they want to see it shut down they would love nothing more than to see it all shut
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:54.320]  down notice they try to imply that I was trying to get violence to the ping-pong place yeah
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:57.920]  what I was saying that's probably a distraction from all the other stuff and then meanwhile
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:05.120]  they're at the ping-pong place calling for gassing us yeah exactly it hats off to project
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:08.840]  Veritas they really hit another one out and that's amazing because that probably would
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.560]  have happened had they not had one of their guys on in on the inside that we probably
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:18.840]  would be getting a gas you know this is not a worship Trump event but I gotta tell you
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:21.560]  even a lot of the office wasn't a hundred percent behind me until like three or four
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:25.800]  months for the election now everybody's converted and it wasn't peer pressure people really
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:29.920]  saw what was and I told me I told the office if you want to be against Trump go ahead yeah
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:33.000]  and I had some people that said you know I think I'm just gonna boy my eyes I was like
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.200]  hey I understand and you know what a lot of it was it was watching those debates and watching
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.520]  him because we covered those debates we would sit there and watch him and comment on him
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:45.240]  in real time it was like everybody piling on it everybody lying about it exactly and
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:49.440]  going you were you were never against the Iraq war we have six clips of it right and
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:54.280]  him calling out bush for flying out the bin lives against the back scenes huge huge he's
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:05:00.520]  the real deal yeah oh yeah the vaccine stuff that's a bunch of clips migrants are racing
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:04.640]  for the US border right before Trump is taking office there's an article that's up on the
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:09.440]  drudge report that talks about how illegals are coming for the US border in lieu of a
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:13.560]  Trump victory he's taking office tomorrow folks migrants that are trying to sneak into
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:18.640]  the US on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming
[1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:22.640]  these challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon US
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:26.960]  president elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out altogether so before
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:31.000]  Trump takes office tomorrow they're racing against time riding a freight train up to

[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:39.800]  all right coming up the next hour we're going to have Owen shroyer on the ground reporting live we've got some of the very important reports he's filed last night catching the buses being brought in by the soros group and others with the organizations pledging to stop Trump from being elected or from being actually inaugurated and we also have CNN you name it saying what if there's a nuke attack what if there's a drone attack other publications the hill you name it
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  and well Obama will have to point the next president and there will be a new election and homeland security with their people who federalize the election they will oversee it ladies and gentlemen you're supposed to have separation of powers not just legislative executive judicial but between the federal and state governments it's called federalism
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:16.800]  and people misappropriate the term federalism meaning the feds are all powerful no federalism means it's equally shared with the states with a little leg up on the feds that meaning the state legislatures they elect that gives them real power us senators
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:33.800]  in 1913 same day we got the income tax the fellow reserve late at night they rammed that through and now we live under it so the balance of power shifted you could argue it happened after the civil war but it really happened after that
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  it was a federal power grab for a while but it failed it actually strengthened the states to a certain extent after their rebellion now I look at all these homeland security helicopters flying outside the window it's quite a scene
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:56.800]  maybe next time they fly by the monument but you can watch that up that's amazing out there in fact so look at my ugly head let's get people to watch the monument shot for a minute or so I think helicopters might fly back into view
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:01.800]  and I believe that up there to the right we'll get a shot of that is the post office hotel
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:09.800]  oh yeah there's there's Trump's hotel and we ought to go do a report in his new hotel he did a year early and under budget
[1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:19.800]  in that amazing unlike government work where everything's way over budget right now they're having a crisis in California with this bullet train they keep wanting to build it's hundreds of millions of dollars over budget
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:25.800]  yeah that's why we can't ever have anything like the Japanese or the French now that they're perfect is there's so much corruption
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:33.800]  they just built it and that's a big Democrat thing they love to grab into those money Terry Truman and just siphon it all off for their little campaigns and their friends
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:39.800]  and parties and dinners but they don't ever build anything they don't ever do anything yeah how about we build an incredible spaceport
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:48.800]  but we like build the future instead of just running around acting like thugs have you seen the arrogance around here by these people it's amazing there's all these guys in black trench coats and
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:11:00.800]  $100,000 Rolex is not that Rolex is bad but they just think they're God's stomping around and it's like even if they have $100,000 your job they just act like they're arrogant so that's their power
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:10.800]  and I'm not saying you know it's bad $100,000 I'm just saying they're embarrassing how arrogant they are it is and then you walk around DC and what do you see everywhere not even with the security that they put up
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:19.800]  walls fences so everything's secure it's like we're the government we can be secure you can't be that's right you have a big attitude you can't have a gun you can't have a border
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:27.800]  yeah by the way in Austin because I was trying to buy a condo so when I have family come into town or whatever we have a condo I kind of live outside town I had to place it in town
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:37.800]  so I went around everywhere where all the new condos are being built and I was like I want a condo community that has a gate and they went oh the city council won't give permits for about five years for those you didn't know
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:46.800]  they don't give gate permits anymore to build they think we should all just be together in one community and I went are you kidding if you go over to Territown or the elite areas
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  there are 12 foot gates 10 foot gates and then gates around the houses and they have a one minute I have friends that live in Territown one minute I mean you call the cops are there in 30 seconds
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:10.800]  I mean where I met you call the cops it takes them five minutes which is fine we're not bad the point is the average is 12 minutes I'm talking 30 seconds they say one minute
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:20.800]  so they have a one minute police response time in the rich areas they call it the government district see this is all unspoken but it's actually in the law in Texas they got laws passed
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:31.800]  where Territown and the government district of downtown only part of it is under it under Texas COG and critical infrastructure they call that and it has its own power
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:40.800]  in the grid it took them the main grid but it doesn't lose its power when there's rolling blackouts you know to keep over losing power they keep their power on
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:46.800]  right so they have better police they have better power they have everything bro
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:54.800]  and let me tell you this I taught this guy I sat with on the airplane he's a real estate developer he said they're building two new hotels in Austin and they have no parking
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:03.800]  they have four parking spots out front or handicapped and that's it they won't let him build new parking and that's all and I'm telling about agenda 21 he's like oh I don't know I said
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:13.800]  you're sitting here explaining to me what it is two foot deep swimming pools right they're phasing every apartment he mentioned the coffin apartment he says yeah they're really small we call them coffin apartments I said that's agenda 21
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:24.800]  that's to get everybody out that's my turn what I love is I brand this stuff 10 years ago but I'm not bragging it's just we can fight in the war is what I'm saying we can call it not luxury micro
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:33.800]  no it's a freaking coffin apartment where you pay on average six seven times what you would you know per square foot for something much better they're teaching you to go oh I love my coffin apartment
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:41.800]  instead of having something big and nice while they live in palatial mansion exactly that's the difference they don't do what they say we have to do they don't live in the
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:53.800]  houses they notice they make the hotel fancy and cool that doesn't oh this hotel has dry urinals it stinks isn't that elitist they also set up he was telling me they set up these poop shoes for the dogs are
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:14:02.800]  it cost a million dollars and the dog goes on it goes down to the sewer so people don't have to walk their dogs anymore they could just bring them up to wherever they're at and it just goes right sounds like hell it's really weird
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:11.800]  but he mentioned you know about the regulations and getting the stuff done and how it was hard in the 80 he's been doing it since the late 70s and this guy was super rich and a big Trump supporter
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:21.800]  but he was Egyptian and he got singled out at a Trump rally the one in Austin ABC sat down next to him and asked him a question like oh what do you think about Trump changing the wall plans what do you think about
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:29.800]  he goes and asked him about something else because well I think it's fine that people can change their minds that he's not just it's my way or the highway he can be talked to he can be reasoned with I think that's great
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:42.800]  and the guy asked him a bunch of more questions they didn't put those on the air and later he goes where are you from because I'm from Egypt he just got all mad that he wasn't giving him the answers he wanted because he saw a perceived minority when this guy is you know probably one of those
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:53.800]  well let me tell you if you're a Muslim and you want to have a nice house and have your daughters on tour hoods over their heads and you just want to live in a free country that's the thing actually most Muslims are heretics they don't want to be under this crap
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:15:03.800]  that's why we're like Iran I mean oh yeah they have internal polls they've done like 70% of Iranians love America and they do and they have not want to be under this stuff they do not want to be under this stuff
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:13.800]  well and this guy also mentioned about the Christians he's a Christian he goes Christians are the ones who build the roads who are the doctors who keep you keep everything running in the Middle East and there's 30 million of us out there and we need help
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:23.800]  and he goes the same thing in Latin America it's the Amish that are in South America and they're the ones who aren't corrupt so everyone survives off them
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:27.800]  and they live off them and build them and then they're blind and they go
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  it doesn't matter whether they're white or whether they're Lebanese Christians
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:39.800]  you see it's cultural and I don't mean the fake megachurch folks I mean the real Christians are a stabilizing force in any country it's well known
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:47.800]  exactly and he was repeating that over and over again I'm like yeah exactly I said and our government is going out there and causing the Muslims to get up
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:52.800]  and of course he knows that our government four years ago overthrew housing the barric
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:59.800]  oh yeah and then they killed tens of thousands of Christians blew up hundreds of churches were crucifying Christians upside down
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:02.800]  and then the Muslims revolted and overthrew it they didn't want that
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:10.800]  yeah exactly because guess what as soon as they ran out of other million Christians and all of a sudden you know the trains weren't running on time
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:17.800]  yeah and there's no doctors and there's no lawyers and there's no business people and there's you know nobody's doing anything except the ones who are just running around
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  cutting people's heads off and it was amazing to hear him say that being from the Middle East coming here in the late 70s
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:30.800]  but going back and forth and seeing what it was like and just hearing him talk about the Egyptian Revolution I said that was all our government
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:35.800]  no I said so why don't you think that because he didn't believe that they'd killed bin Laden way back in the day
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:42.800]  he'd never heard about the bin Laden story from the Jerusalem post or figure out the figure out where the CIA came to meet him
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:50.800]  I sat there and read the article to look here it is bin Laden was on dialysis he was he was gone there's no way they they took him out back in
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.800]  see I'm glad you did that we should have put it on tape I know he didn't want me to be you know you guys spend so much time talking about us
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:01.800]  and on air to be on air yeah well that's why I'm sharing the story and you're always better in part you're better than I am as a talk show
[1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:04.800]  I think I think he's gonna host a show by yourself you're not as good
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:11.800]  let's cuz I work off you no you do a great job do you do better than I do I'm serious I hear you all day at the office you
[1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:16.800]  would night walk around educating people smarter than I am that you all you'll never do it on air
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:22.800]  I'll do it on air you're doing it on air right now doing it on air now so I yet we gotta share these stories will you do it live
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.800]  I will do it live I'm gonna be out there live in a second I'm getting my gear to get what's coming up with a 14 hour broadcast
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:34.800]  I'm gonna skip this break last one of the day I'm being bad but it is a big celebration it's my show I want to flush thousands of dollars every
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:43.800]  few minutes I'll do it here come on tomorrow well tomorrow we're gonna start at 8 a.m. and go to 10 p.m. and I'm sure you're gonna have us go longer
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:50.800]  so it'll probably be 14 hours plus but we've got David Deight Lee and McAdoo Margaret Howe back in the studio Ashley Beckford
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:57.800]  will probably be popping in Darren McBreen and then on the ground we're gonna have Owen Schreuer Millie Weaver myself Kit Daniels
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:02.800]  you're gonna be running around during the inauguration and at some point we're gonna get back in here and broadcast for
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:09.800]  I'm sure an extended amount of time talking about the events of what are going on that day we've got some special guests I believe Salente
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:16.800]  is one of the guests hosts for the hour I don't have the full guest list but I'm sure Nico texted to me here in a second
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:21.800]  but it's gonna be an amazing experience to share with everybody out there who can't be here
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:27.800]  even though there's gonna be a million or so people here who are pro-Trump and probably another 300,000 who are anti-Trump
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:33.800]  and of course the big news is they are coming out now and saying that a lot of the protesters aren't showing up
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:40.800]  yeah yeah the J-20 people said they have scaled down their blockade schedule they've scaled it down because
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:45.800]  Zimmerman found that this morning and read it out Zimmerman if you can find that tweet again wherever it was
[1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:47.800]  no I know I saw the story
[1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:52.800]  the reason they're scaling it down is most of the people that are legitimate leftists were Bernie supporters
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:56.800]  I thought Bernie supporters all day come up to me, well all we like to you Alex we know Trump's good now
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:01.800]  wanting to cut prescription drug prices and he's not gonna do it in a Nixonian way with orders
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.800]  he's just gonna bring competition in
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:08.800]  he's gonna say I'm not gonna let you sell the drug in another company for less and then you claim oh it's your drug you own it
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:12.800]  you're going to have to sell at the same price if you do it here that's called competition
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:19.800]  or I'm gonna let him import from the other country your stuff you're making here selling to Mexico
[1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:24.800]  or selling to you know China and then bringing back plus all the tariffs and stuff that China's got on us internally
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:28.800]  he wants to bring back we're gonna have all these drugs and stuff you're gonna make them here
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:29.800]  and it's already happening
[1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:33.800]  or you're gonna pay a damn tariff again folks that's not protectionism we've been screwed over
[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:35.800]  come on over Zimmerman
[1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:40.800]  yeah I love the fact that Trump has just gone out and said you know he's made all these announcements
[1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:45.800]  and he's not even president yet and companies are changing their tune they're keeping jobs here
[1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:52.800]  they're bringing more jobs in the guy from Alibaba said he's gonna make a million jobs a million jobs
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:57.800]  and these are gonna be good paying jobs and when people see people what about these tax cuts
[1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:03.800]  they set up the highest taxes in the world the big corporations did because they wanted to only move to China
[1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:10.800]  yeah Trump makes the tax the same all these other globalist you know the are gonna be forced to then just understand
[1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:13.800]  that they're gonna have to bring jobs back because it becomes a free market
[1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.800]  and when you have more people paying less taxes everybody doesn't have to pay as much
[1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:20.800]  but we still can have all the things that make this country great
[1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:23.800]  and let me add something that's absolutely key a lot of people that are at Davos a lot of people that are
[1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:28.800]  follow globalism it's because they're bullying into it like like Peter teal
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:33.800]  a lot of people do not like what's going on once there's solidarity and support for real free market
[1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:39.800]  which Davos claims it's selling once the real thing comes the counterfeit doesn't have anywhere to be
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:44.800]  it's exposed it's thrown out in the cold so there's a lot of people in the system that do want to do the right thing
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:49.800]  but there's no way they can do it because the public wasn't awake we had to be awake
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:56.800]  we had to start the movement towards nationalism and real competition again to break the globalist monopoly
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:00.800]  of crony capitalists that they claim is free market
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:06.800]  no the heritage foundation and globalism is not free market and it's another great mental screw job
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:09.800]  how they claim they're the great protectors of that when they're the opposite
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:15.800]  now I want to play a clip here because I mentioned this I want to go to a new fail video
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:18.800]  we've seen a bunch of these that are kind of recycled they're powerful
[1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:25.800]  but this is a new one because it goes back in time not just to right before
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:30.800]  let me just go back here not just to right before the election but a year before
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:35.800]  video shows how media hacks how old would laughter at clown trump
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:40.800]  let's play this three four minute clip we're going to come back and get into Owen shroyer on the ground
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:43.800]  with the globalist minions being busted here it is
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:47.800]  actually running for president of the United States
[1:21:47.800 --> 1:21:54.800]  there are no words how do you even have a straight face right now there are no words to describe
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.800]  what just happened
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.800]  Ed Rendell do you have any doubt that this is anything more than a carnival show
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:06.800]  and you watched that speech today we all laugh about it and I'm sitting here laughing out loud
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:10.800]  you know for the entire front part of the show here is we're talking about it
[1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:18.800]  I mean it was a rambling a rambling mess of a speech that said it was very entertaining
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:20.800]  I was howling howling
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:28.800]  he's got gamudgins of money he's got a lot of recognition and he just became the 12th presidential candidate for the Republican Party
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:34.800]  is it typical Donald Trump fashion or is it hilarity run amok
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:39.800]  this morning some Republicans say they're worried Trump will turn the campaign into a circus
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:43.800]  party leaders worry Trump's presence will turn the primary into a joke
[1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:48.800]  America's largest Latino civil rights organization called Trump an exceedingly silly man
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:50.800]  Donald Trump is a fool
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:54.800]  hell froze over and now we're stuck in the ice with Donald Trump
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:01.800]  Chuck you and I have seen this public dance from Trump before I guess the question is is this candidacy for real will it be significant
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:08.800]  it's like I can't I can't tell if this is politics or if this is just PR from a celebrity
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:13.800]  the National Press Corps and other elites Donald Trump's campaign is a pure vanity exercise
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:18.800]  going to target right for outright mockery or low-level derision
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:23.800]  on the one hand he's a late night joke an hour the most beautifully ridiculous jibber jabber
[1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.800]  on the other he's the proverbial skunk at the garden party
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:31.800]  how does the Republican Party handle a political streaker who knows how to get attention
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:40.800]  sadly the biggest bus surrounds Donald Trump how to take Donald Trump hmm well consider the newspapers this morning at least the tabloids
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:49.800]  the Daily News considers Trump a clown the New York Post considers Trump a rich guy who could make it to the White House
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:56.800]  I do not hate Donald Trump but I do not think him seriously I thought you know everything that was garish and ridiculous about him was fully on display
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:03.800]  unconventional will people who love him love it yeah but will it get him anywhere close to becoming the nominee or the president of the United States
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:04.800]  I think not
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:11.800]  I think there is a vein for him to tap and he's going to get some serious votes he can't win but he can get a lot of votes
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:18.800]  while no one expects Trump to get close to winning the nomination that doesn't mean that they're happy he's in
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:22.800]  I mean this is this is the problem with Donald Trump for Republicans of course he's not going to win
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:27.800]  he probably will make the main stage he'll be one of the top ten vote-getters just because of name recognition
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:32.800]  and in our obsession with stardom the problem is he's going to be a flamethrower he has nothing to lose
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.800]  but he says the most provocative things like when Mexico sends its people they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:45.800]  they're rapists and some I assume are good people what is your strategy and how can you how can you succeed when you say things like that
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:49.800]  well you can't again Gail the question is how can you become president you can't by saying things like that
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:55.800]  can we stipulate for the purposes of this conversation that Donald Trump will never be president of the United States
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:03.800]  monument first and ladies and gentlemen here we are with the Washington monument out the windows we're off of Pennsylvania Avenue
[1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:11.800]  we're going to have Owen Schreuer coming up about 15-20 minutes from the ground right in front of the Capitol where the president elect will be
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:20.800]  inaugurated at 12 noon tomorrow they're having fantasy dreams on CNN and other TV channels of the dinosaur pile of garbage media
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:27.800]  the Decepticon Trader Media they're so evil I have to mention all their names Hunk of Devil has a string of names so do they
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  the Abomination Desolation the Old Worm the Old Dragon the Black Serpent the Elsie Bob Bathomet Satan Lucifer the Morning Star
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:46.800]  well they've got a lot of names themselves don't they and we're going to be there covering it all and they're hoping that somebody kills Trump
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:55.800]  so Obama can appoint a new president and then they're going to have a new election that Homeland Security runs totally unconstitutional
[1:25:55.800 --> 1:26:02.800]  over the state governments just that's not how federal law works but Homeland Security wrote a letter to the Associated Press
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:08.800]  two weeks ago just saying that's the way it is because J. Johnson says and you know Loretta Lynch says I don't care what law says
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:14.800]  I'll get on the plane with somebody under criminal investigation I don't even know stinking badges I mean that's how it rolls
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:21.800]  and then say we talked about our grandkids and you've got all these greedy crazy bureaucrats and lobbyist and corporate people
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:28.800]  I'm not saying they're all bad but we've seen them a lot of them are like snakes like Warmer Grimewood or whatever his name is
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:34.800]  Grimer Wormton yeah absolutely another Lord of the Rings analogy I was asked by Vice why so many Lord of the Rings analogies
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:41.800]  I don't really watch the movies much but they're okay movies it's just funny art type characters the art type characters
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  I mean these people are panicking they're scared they're crazy and all Trump wants to do is cut spending by 10%
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:54.800]  because that's because every economist says if we don't do that within a couple years we will be like Mexico or Venezuela
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:02.800]  it's over folks we're going over the edge of a cliff sorry DC you know the average DC bureaucrat is making millions of dollars a year
[1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:10.800]  on everybody's backs we can't do it anymore and if you cut our taxes a little bit and increase the unemployment levels
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:16.800]  you're going to see more money you're going to see more money and you can spend then you can scam even more off the top
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:21.800]  and I'm not saying that's a good thing but a real smart mafia guy wants a big fat juicy pig to bleed
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:28.800]  these people are in competition with flyover country and hate average people having any wealth so they're so dumb
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:36.800]  they want a big poor country to rule over that's what third world jackasses do that's what everybody did before the Renaissance
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:42.800]  Europe dark ages lasted a thousand years because the elite wanted to keep people poor and didn't want them reading books
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:49.800]  and wanted them dumbed down and you're trying to bring back the dark ages guess what we don't want it we don't want it
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:55.800]  we don't want the dark ages we want the light we understand we want it right now we want it right now
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:06.800]  check Tony Montana says hey just like your president Jimmy Carter says I want freedom I want it now I want the world she go and everything in it
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.800]  and the $500 suit look at that pelican fly pelican I think we should have Tony Montana for president hey seriously
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:20.800]  it is we like to have a Trump president I love the way that moment when he called out called him out of fake news did you see that live
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:27.800]  we played that was freaking vacation in Colorado no no no I was actually watching it real time I rolled it back and we shot a video
[1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:32.800]  and just watching that in real time going oh my god this guy is going to be president and he's calling CNN fake news
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:40.800]  and when we landed at the airport they had some CNN story with Obama how he's just not happy with Trump and if he sees any
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:46.800]  meddling in the election he is going to speak out they were the ones meddling with the election that's the funny thing
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:52.800]  they were the ones doing it now they speak out Obama about your own meddling now I was correcting on the video I did like last week
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:59.800]  it said like you know I forget the hell I was like you know six states hacked my feds and I was corrected it's 11 now they know
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:06.800]  that the feds broke into 11 I only knew and in some places like Georgia they broke into dozens of years Georgia was hacked big time
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:12.800]  by DHS and they go well maybe it was a rogue employee maybe we don't and then they never come back with an answer and then now DHS
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:18.800]  fails were like we need to fully take control of it to keep it safe because the Ruskies are so powerful
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:23.800]  and the only way they found out about other states is the guy in Georgia canvassed all the other states and said
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:28.800]  do you guys report any of these problems and three or four wrote back said oh yeah we had the same thing happen they were going in
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:34.800]  and probing our databases probing the databases looking around but what happened in Georgia was unprecedented what happened
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:40.800]  they were going around like two or three times one on the day of the election going into the voter rolls and messing with them
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:45.800]  we didn't even know what they did at the end of the day all right I'm bad again I didn't get any clips we're going to come back with
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:55.800]  the clips I promise or Rob can punch me we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:05.800]  migrants are racing for the US border right before Trump is taking office there's an article that's up on the drudge report
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:11.800]  it talks about how illegals are coming for the US border in lieu of a Trump victory he's taking office tomorrow folks
[1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:18.800]  migrants that are trying to sneak into the US on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming
[1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:24.800]  these challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon US President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall
[1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:31.800]  and keep them out altogether so before Trump takes office tomorrow they're racing against time riding a freight train up to the border
[1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:39.800]  to look for a way across in the town near a frontier group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire of trash in the early morning cold
[1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:45.800]  there's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train and the event that it slows down
[1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:53.800]  and I've got news for you folks that wall is coming but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn literally and racing for the border
[1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:56.800]  I'm Margaret Helve reporting for Infowars.com
[1:30:56.800 --> 1:31:03.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing
[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:11.800]  especially for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems
[1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:17.800]  the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:25.800]  have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you it's yourself your coworkers your family your children
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:33.800]  through the best job you can to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:41.800]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't the Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:48.800]  one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:57.800]  replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today then fullwarstore.com
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:05.800]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:08.800]  Dr. Griff you took years for you to develop DNA force for us
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:13.800]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:19.800]  what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:24.800]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying
[1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:31.800]  we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances in the world
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:36.800]  it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor
[1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:40.800]  so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount it's in powder form
[1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:46.800]  we have so many five-star reviews I take this this is this is the product that I take
[1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:50.800]  infowarslife.com and the profit we make we fight the globals we fight the new world order

[1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:09.800]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up on top
[1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:18.800]  the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:24.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  we are right above Pennsylvania Avenue with homeless Kurdy helicopters flying by looking at us
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:35.800]  and then we've got we've got the Washington Monument out there
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:39.800]  I tell you it's an incredible time to be alive history is happening Trump's for real
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:45.800]  he's anti-new world order he was let in on the whole communist globalist plan
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:51.800]  back in the 60s by the congressional experts that had access to all the classified files
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.800]  and the information I'm releasing here on air nobody else has I just want everybody to know that
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:33:59.800]  I think now is the time to even release that information
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:04.800]  so people understand exactly why Trump has been a patriot sleeper cell
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:09.800]  and I always said what if we had people that went along with the system like the leftist have done
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:12.800]  but were actually sleeper cells the other way around
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:16.800]  and it turns out that that's exactly what Donald Trump is
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:22.800]  Donald Trump is a Americana sleeper cell inside the New World Order takeover
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:26.800]  and that is why they are truly scared
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:29.800]  I love people going oh he's New World Order you know he's been to parties with the Clintons
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:31.800]  what do you expect when you go to these galas
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:35.800]  he had to play along with them he did fight and after he did fight yeah he did some other good stuff
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:37.800]  he's trying to get taxes cut for poor people
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:40.800]  but he's hired record numbers of minorities and women
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:43.800]  and he's put a lot of gay people in charge of
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:44.800]  but he's racist
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:47.800]  well I mean I was sitting there like pander to gay people because I'm not against gay people
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:52.800]  I don't hate them none of that but I shouldn't have to pander and grovel to prove I don't dislike gay people
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:55.800]  it's just like Trump waving rainbow flags and they say he's a homophobe
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:59.800]  and then like it turns out most of his casinos are run by gay guys
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:01.800]  whatever reason Trump said all they're my friends
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:04.800]  they tend to want to work 20 hours a day and really care
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  so for some reason gay men are the best casino runners
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:08.800]  and they're snappy dressers
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:09.800]  and they're snappy dressers
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:11.800]  the point is is that we don't I don't have to sit or go
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:13.800]  I have nothing against gay people
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:15.800]  some of my friends are gay
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:17.800]  I've done anything wrong
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:20.800]  I don't have to sit here and explain to you that I don't dislike you
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:23.800]  if I said I disliked you then you wouldn't know it
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:25.800]  but the left goes no
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:27.800]  everyone that wants to flow taxes really hates black people
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.800]  and I'm so sick of
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:32.800]  I'm so sick of my whole life hearing I hate black people
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:34.800]  and it's gone from making me feel guilty
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:36.800]  I'm like a little kid hearing white people are bad
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:38.800]  from white people and I'm like
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:40.800]  I'm bad as I got this color scheme
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:42.800]  okay and then the black people are hearing I'm bad
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:44.800]  as I'm white so they beat me up
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:46.800]  they've been turned into bad people
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:48.800]  and into what maybe what my ancestors might have done to them
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:52.800]  because they were told I was my ancestors and did something to them
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:55.800]  because yes I'll say probably my ancestors probably did do something to black people
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:57.800]  most whites probably can't say that
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:35:59.800]  but I mean I've been here long enough in this country
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:01.800]  my family yeah sure
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:03.800]  but I mean most white people had no connection to any of it
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:05.800]  but I didn't do any of it
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:07.800]  and my parents sure as hell didn't do any of it
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:09.800]  or their grandparents or their grandparents
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.800]  they were all Christians trying to make atonement for it
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:13.800]  so how do people try to make atonement for something
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  how do we then become the bad guys dude
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:17.800]  well it's because it starts off being white
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:20.800]  and being like what 13% of the world population
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:22.800]  it might be less than that
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:25.800]  yeah we control everything
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:26.800]  we run everything
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:27.800]  we do everything bad
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:29.800]  we created this whole system
[1:36:29.800 --> 1:36:32.800]  with paved roads and open sewers
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:34.800]  and electricity
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:36.800]  and for that we have to be
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.800]  put in our place
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:40.800]  well let's give people the real history
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:42.800]  the Chinese developed technology
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:44.800]  just as advanced as we had 300 years ago
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:46.800]  their elites wrote books
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:48.800]  and said we don't want the public having this
[1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:50.800]  we want to control people
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.800]  Japanese great smart people
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:54.800]  nobody argues they got some of the highest IQs
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:55.800]  they have the same thing
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:56.800]  whites
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.800]  Africans
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:00.800]  Latin Americans was all the same
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:02.800]  the elite didn't want the public having technology
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:04.800]  I mean the Mayans had a calendar more accurate than the Romans
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:06.800]  they had the wheel
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:08.800]  they didn't want to give it to the public
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:10.800]  all the Mayans could even invent the wheel
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  no they didn't want to give it to the public
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:15.800]  so the point is
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:17.800]  yeah we get systems of control
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:19.800]  so can you say whites are more elite
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:21.800]  because they ended up developing
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:23.800]  the modern mathematics and space travel
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:25.800]  and clocks
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:27.800]  you know back 600 years ago
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:29.800]  all of Europe was under total siege
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:31.800]  most people had a very low
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:33.800]  nobody could read like maybe 1%
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:35.800]  but it was on purpose
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:37.800]  the dark ages were admittedly
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:39.800]  installed by the royals
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:41.800]  and the church
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  and it made Europe so weak
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.800]  they couldn't even defeat the Muslims
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:47.800]  and because the Muslim threat got so bad
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:49.800]  there was no innovation
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:50.800]  at least in weapons
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  and they started educating
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:53.800]  so it was just to be able to fight the Muslims
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:55.800]  so dumbing people down made us
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:57.800]  we're about to fall to Muslims
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:59.800]  so over a couple hundred years it developed
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:01.800]  letting some guilds exist
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:03.800]  just to serve us the truth
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:05.800]  because the nobles finally went okay we got it
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.800]  they just took confidence in the hopeful
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:09.800]  we got to do something this is a real history
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  so it forced them competition
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:13.800]  see there was no competition inside Europe
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.800]  everybody was slaves
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:17.800]  the same, the Romans did the same deal folks
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:19.800]  but blacks were too valued
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:21.800]  so they weren't actually kept outside
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.800]  the whites were like cheap slaves
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:25.800]  and the blacks were like the price slaves
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:27.800]  and a lot of blacks were actually free
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:29.800]  but see they create this thing where blacks feel like they're this tip on the shoulder
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:31.800]  you're nobody you were slaves
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:33.800]  everybody was slaves
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:35.800]  now let's continue and expand out and I'll go these clips
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:37.800]  because it's an important history lesson
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:39.800]  for whatever reason
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:41.800]  500 years ago
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.800]  people started to break out of it in Europe
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:45.800]  and a renaissance started
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:47.800]  because people were so oppressed
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.800]  about getting into literature
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:51.800]  and getting into freedom and getting into math
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:53.800]  and getting into science and Europeans
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:55.800]  because of their previous Ice Age brain
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:57.800]  they've done genetic epigenetic tests as well
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:38:59.800]  do obsess more about
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  shelter and designs and hunting
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:03.800]  and preparation and the jokes are in Europe
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  the trains are all on time
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:07.800]  there's an OCD-ness about in the Ice Age
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.800]  if you didn't do stuff just right you were dead
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:11.800]  so selectively
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.800]  Africa might have been strength, stamina or whatever
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.800]  or you died
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:17.800]  there was plenty of that in the Ice Age
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:19.800]  but if you didn't plan stuff out
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:21.800]  just right you were dead
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:23.800]  if you tried to get home 20 minutes late
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:25.800]  from a hunting trip you'd freeze it up
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:27.800]  because it was going to go 50 below zero like that
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:29.800]  and so there is that planning in the western brain
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:31.800]  but see that also gives the western brain
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:33.800]  over to evil
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:35.800]  because if it gets captured by corruption
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:37.800]  then it starts scheming in like 5th dimensional chests
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:39.800]  you understand
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:41.800]  so that's why it takes good westerners
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  who are into freedom to counter western evil
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:45.800]  so yes you can say the west is evil
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:47.800]  let's show the helicopter Buckley
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:49.800]  it flew right out of the obelisk
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:51.800]  anyways I'm ranting I'm sorry
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:53.800]  I apologize for history lessons
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:55.800]  we've got a lot of clips you want to comment on any of that
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:57.800]  well I just I think you're right
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:39:59.800]  it is geographically people do different things
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:01.800]  for different areas and if you're living up north
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:03.800]  you do have to plant your crops on time
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:05.800]  you have to watch the weather
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:07.800]  and then when you're down in sub-Saharan Africa
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:09.800]  or South America
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:11.800]  it's a different type
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.800]  you have to be ready for a predator to come out after you
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:15.800]  you have to be able to defend yourself
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  and you have to be able to be fast and cover long distances
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:19.800]  so all that makes sense
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.800]  and then you see the way it is now
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  and when you talk about elites
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  there's good elites and there's bad elites
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:27.800]  there's a predator class within the elites
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:29.800]  and then within the middle class also that kind of worms their way up
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:31.800]  that serve
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  and then they want to serve that big predator head
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:35.800]  class as the little flying monkeys
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.800]  the elite class should be
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:39.800]  empowering everybody
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:41.800]  to bring them up
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:43.800]  yeah no they should be
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:45.800]  because in our society
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:47.800]  I mean I literally could envision
[1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.800]  20 plus years ago much of it
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:51.800]  and like 90% of my vision but I pictured
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:53.800]  other people rising up who were better than me
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:55.800]  because I wasn't arrogant
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:57.800]  when I struck the alarm bell
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.800]  as Paul Revere I thought it would get other people
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:01.800]  to rise up and take action which it did
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:03.800]  it just took longer but again there's that long
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:05.800]  term planning that patience
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:07.800]  patience is key to anything big
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:09.800]  yeah 20 years it's like you push the
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:11.800]  pebble down the hill and 20 years later it's a
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:13.800]  giant boulder going
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:15.800]  fake news you're fake news
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:17.800]  and just running over people and destroying
[1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:19.800]  yeah right before me the same
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:21.800]  pebble drugs report yeah
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:23.800]  and a bunch of other pebbles so but it was all
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:25.800]  the same it all happened at the same time too
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:27.800]  drugs started about the same time you did
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.800]  well it's like radio got invented
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  by three guys the same week yeah and it's
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:33.800]  just knowledge builds
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:35.800]  like the hundredth monkey to this you know
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:37.800]  I mean drugs kind of comes in
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  like half a like like he was like a
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:41.800]  senior I was like a junior in the same
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:43.800]  that was in the same school kind of the same class
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:45.800]  he was a little bit before me but it was all
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:47.800]  the same wave and then trumps the big mega
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:49.800]  wave you see sweeping and here's the problem
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:51.800]  if the global is trying to block this one
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:53.800]  I almost hope they try to block this wave
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.800]  because they might be able to halfway do it
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:57.800]  that summons the King Kong
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:41:59.800]  I mean if they
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.800]  block this King Kong coming
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  and it'll almost be so free market
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:05.800]  it's cultish
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:07.800]  I mean I I mean I'm really worried about
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:09.800]  oh helicopter by the monolith
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.800]  I'm really looking forward to it
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:13.800]  I'm really looking forward to these next four years
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.800]  King Kong needs to climb that and I hope we get
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.800]  we need to make it to King Kong and we'll reattach Washington
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:19.800]  the climes of Washington monument that'd be badass
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  let's got trumps head on it
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:25.800]  that's it he's King Kong and
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:27.800]  I'm ranting go ahead
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:29.800]  sorry well just
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:31.800]  the fact of of what's been going on
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  the last 20 years
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:35.800]  finally changed
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:37.800]  the sea change go people are just sick and tired
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:39.800]  of it they're fed up with it they're sick and tired
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:41.800]  of being called racist because they want freedom
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:43.800]  they're sick and tired of not
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:45.800]  touting to every little minority that has
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:47.800]  you know a grievance
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.800]  it's like everybody's got a grievance about something
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:51.800]  why don't you put your head in the game and start
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:53.800]  making something happen positively instead of just
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:55.800]  worrying about why you're not getting yours
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:57.800]  the reason you're not getting yours is because you're sitting
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:42:59.800]  out there complaining that you're not getting yours
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:01.800]  instead of doing something that's the big reason
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:03.800]  yeah I mean there's no problem in America if you
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:05.800]  actually try to get yours you're going to get so
[1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:07.800]  much your kids are going to earn a deck of slots
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:09.800]  that will be true and you know
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:11.800]  I have that problem my kids they have so much
[1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:13.800]  I'm like you kids are spoiled
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:15.800]  we take you out on trips we do things with
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:17.800]  you we let you have stuff
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:19.800]  and you know
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:21.800]  and they artificially see some Kim Kardashian show
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:23.800]  right that is a prison of crap
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:25.800]  who wants to a closet with
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:27.800]  200 purses
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:29.800]  you know and then like you know extra rooms
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:31.800]  your dog crap set them you know and it's like
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:33.800]  you know I had a five bedroom house for a while
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:35.800]  and I've downsized to like four or three
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:37.800]  because I mean
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:39.800]  I say four because one of them is a study
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:41.800]  it's a little bit of a room but I mean it's like
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:43.800]  it's a hassle yeah and then who wants
[1:43:43.800 --> 1:43:45.800]  to be around rich neighbors like I know a lot of minorities
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:47.800]  think
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:49.800]  that white people are all racist and don't like you
[1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:51.800]  let me explain something you live into a wealthy neighborhood
[1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:53.800]  and I moved into just middle class ones
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:55.800]  they're all a-holes to each other
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:57.800]  and hate everybody I don't care if you got
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:43:59.800]  blonde hair and blue eyes man
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:01.800]  they're all just mean to each other because it's like
[1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.800]  Washington all they got this weird class
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:05.800]  thing
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:07.800]  and again real rich people
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:09.800]  are cool it's all these fake one of these
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:11.800]  that are like so obsessed with
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:13.800]  my Mercedes and I'm cool
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:15.800]  and it's not that the Mercedes is bad
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:17.800]  it's like
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:19.800]  they want to think they're better than you it's like a cult
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:21.800]  what would you call it
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:23.800]  it is this weird arrogance
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:25.800]  but it's like a powerless
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:27.800]  arrogance because they have that arrogance
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:29.800]  because they really don't have any power
[1:44:29.800 --> 1:44:31.800]  exactly they always want petty power
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:33.800]  like
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:35.800]  what is that truck doing parked on the street
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:37.800]  and I'm like that violates the homeowner's
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:39.800]  rules and I'm like well the homeowner
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:41.800]  rule actually says that you can be parked there
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:43.800]  but that's not my truck that's working
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:45.800]  on the other neighbors in a backyard
[1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:47.800]  they're just like
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:49.800]  I lived in the country for a while
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:51.800]  then I moved back a little bit closer
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:53.800]  and I hadn't been in a place with the homeowner's association
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:55.800]  and it is just a freaking nightmare
[1:44:55.800 --> 1:44:57.800]  I had to deal with it too over a trash can
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:44:59.800]  they don't like my trash can on the side of the house
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:01.800]  I'm like sorry
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:03.800]  that's going to stay there I'm not putting it in my garage
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:05.800]  I've been written up for it on the side of the house
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:07.800]  the damn thing stinks yeah I'm not putting it in my garage
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:09.800]  you can put it in your garage
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:11.800]  it makes your car smell like what exactly
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:13.800]  no it's going to stay on the outside by there
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:15.800]  oh by the way your construction crews have garbage everywhere
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:17.800]  and everybody else is breaking every other rule
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:19.800]  but you're going to single me out no
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:21.800]  the only answer is to start writing everybody up
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:23.800]  they put a sign up saying no parking
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:25.800]  and then if anybody parks
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:27.800]  outside my house the tow trucks come
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:29.800]  then everybody else is allowed to have their cars
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:31.800]  and I'm like I've got to start calling
[1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:33.800]  oh yeah the tow truck
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:35.800]  and so I get back next week I'm just going to call
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:37.800]  tow trucks every day
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:39.800]  the thing is then they'll grovel it's like as soon as you use
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:41.800]  force against them they back off
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:43.800]  but I have to crush them first
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:45.800]  well it's that it's that weak petty power
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:47.800]  that they think they have and they have none
[1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:49.800]  or they think they can they think I'm dumb
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:51.800]  and they control the tow truck company
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:53.800]  it doesn't just have to be the number listed
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:55.800]  under the law you post that I'm going to call another tow truck
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:57.800]  see they think I'm dumb like everybody else
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:45:59.800]  I'm not and guess what
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.800]  I will defeat you just like I defeated the globalist
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:03.800]  what's the same deal we'll defeat every level dude
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.800]  yeah and and we've been doing it we've been
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:07.800]  we're not going to be tired doing it this isn't exciting
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.800]  whether it's Hillary Clinton or a homeowners association
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  move bitch get out the way
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:13.800]  or even a small local government
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:15.800]  a local government that comes after you and tries to
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:17.800]  put these regulations into not let people build
[1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:19.800]  or let people develop their own land
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:21.800]  that's the kind of stuff that we're going to be doing
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:23.800]  and I think you're going to see now that we've got
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.800]  we get Trump into office we settle in
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:27.800]  first hundred days you're going to see
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:29.800]  info wars take on this whole new thing
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  going into more health stories that we've kind of
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:33.800]  let by the wayside during covering a lot of this
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:35.800]  we're also going to keep
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:37.800]  we're going to keep not Trump honest
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  but trying to surveil
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:41.800]  the minions like this one
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:43.800]  for education who's the only bad one because she was for
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:45.800]  Common Core right but she's also for school
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:47.800]  choice of Trump got told to like her he doesn't
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:49.800]  know all this stuff who could
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:51.800]  she gets up there in front of the thing and goes
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:53.800]  oh I agree to say
[1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:55.800]  women grab me they want me I can grab them
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:57.800]  that's the thing a woman's on you of course they want me
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:46:59.800]  you know it's all extinct they're not you know
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:01.800]  like the leftist if a woman's like
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:03.800]  kissing you when you touch her
[1:47:03.800 --> 1:47:05.800]  you're raping her no that's called what mammals do
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:07.800]  she goes yes I agree that's sexual assault
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:09.800]  boom get out of there
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:11.800]  then she tries to go over and shake Elizabeth Warren's hand
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:13.800]  and she won't even do it see she went
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:15.800]  and groveled to them
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:17.800]  threw Trump out of the bus and then
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:19.800]  you know yeah
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  watching these uh these hearings
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:23.800]  like Marco you know they said that famous world war two
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:25.800]  deal of a sailor getting on the boat
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:27.800]  oh kissing the girl that's sexual assault because his hand
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:29.800]  is on her hip yeah I mean take woman jumps on you
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  and starts kissing you and it's your
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  your wife or girlfriend you hadn't seen in two years
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:35.800]  I mean she's gonna get mad you're not grabbing her
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:37.800]  that's what you're supposed to do
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:39.800]  you grab a rider in the back of their neck
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.800]  you grab their butt that's what women want
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:43.800]  it's what mammals do right they're taking
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:45.800]  our normal behavior it's saying it's illegal
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:47.800]  but then teaching your five-year-old how to be a training
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:49.800]  your blow jobs is okay
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  our get a sex change yeah exactly
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.800]  they're now trying to tell 12-year-olds
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:55.800]  out in California right you can have your stuff
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:47:57.800]  cut off if you want outside your parents
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:47:59.800]  so the government cutting your kids weenie
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:01.800]  that's all that's okay but I'm not
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:03.800]  supposed to if my wife leans into
[1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:05.800]  me and I kiss her you know I mean this is crazy
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:07.800]  yeah and you know they interviewed the two people
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:09.800]  that 50 years after that that famous photo
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:11.800]  that you're talking about the rape photo they didn't even
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:13.800]  know each other but they were so happy that
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:15.800]  the war was over they both came to each other
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:17.800]  and embraced it well sure I do
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:19.800]  that's why they're calling it the assault because
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:21.800]  they hate each other
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  well they hate that magnetism she's good looking
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:25.800]  he's good looking wow let's get it let's have a party
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:27.800]  but people were happy
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.800]  in the world war two that's what they were happy
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:31.800]  about I mean this was
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.800]  a huge it was a huge war it was a sexual assault
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:35.800]  yeah
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:37.800]  helicopter by the obelisk
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:39.800]  I'm obsessed with that shot
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:41.800]  man the cinematography we're getting out here
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  it is really good it's amazing even the tunnels
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:45.800]  where they have their the tunnels for the subways
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:47.800]  they have these cool looking catacombs
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:49.800]  looking patchwork or I guess a beak
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  beak out beak beehive
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:53.800]  it's like a beehive underneath the
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:55.800]  ground it's really amazing so
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:57.800]  but you walk around at night
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:48:59.800]  and you see you know how
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:01.800]  the government has everything
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:03.800]  secure it for them they're so
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:05.800]  we can't have that oh it's really
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:07.800]  fine you let the borders open all this crap
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.800]  you probably have to do this now don't take our right
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  to have a gun or lock our door you assholes
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:13.800]  excuse me I apologize we're gonna go to break
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:15.800]  I'm playing clubs I've been back we play the CNN
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:17.800]  COG kill switch
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:19.800]  situation one more time
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:21.800]  and then we're gonna go to break and then I'm gonna
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:23.800]  come back and I'm gonna play Owen Schroder's report ahead
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:25.800]  of Roger Stone Owen Schroder joining us
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.800]  and our reporters are getting in place right now
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:29.800]  so stay with us but let's go out
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.800]  to break with this clip who does
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:33.800]  inauguration you have two lines of succession
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  one for the Barack Obama
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:37.800]  still in place and one which really
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:39.800]  won't be in place until Donald Trump is
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:41.800]  is inaugurated that comes into office
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:43.800]  and actually formally nominates and the senate confirms
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:45.800]  his people you might actually end up with a president
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:47.800]  from the prior administration
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:49.800]  because of a tragedy adding to the confusion
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:51.800]  by noon Friday all
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:53.800]  of Obama's cabinet secretaries are expected
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:55.800]  to resign John Kerry the current
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:57.800]  secretary of state would be the first
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:49:59.800]  cabinet secretary in the line of succession
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:01.800]  but he's out of office by noon
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:03.800]  Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:05.800]  Rex Tillerson may not be
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  confirmed for another week or two
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:09.800]  so who would be secretary of state on Friday
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  afternoon according to state department
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:13.800]  sources the job would fall to the highest
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:15.800]  ranking non-political official
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:17.800]  in the department the under secretary
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:19.800]  for political affairs Tom Shannon
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:21.800]  one of the most obscure possibilities
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:23.800]  is that someone who is an acting secretary
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:25.800]  of state someone lower down the line of the secretary
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  of state the state department today
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:29.800]  assumes the acting secretary
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:31.800]  of state position is in the line
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  and the worst happens and that person becomes president
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:35.800]  at least for a while the uncertainty creates
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:37.800]  the potential for chaos high
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:39.800]  theater or a hit TV drama
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.800]  sir you are now the president
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.800]  of the United States
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  in ABC's designated

[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:20.800]  some of the stories up on infowars.com
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  Trump viewed favorably
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:28.800]  by more than half of the US voters
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:30.800]  we know there were fake polls
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:32.800]  during the election
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:34.800]  it's hard
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:36.800]  to get major polling companies to actually do
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:38.800]  an honest poll for you it's just the demographics
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:40.800]  they use who they target they have a huge
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:42.800]  agenda that's known
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:44.800]  but Trump and others were able to do internal
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:46.800]  polls and other major demographic polling
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:48.800]  agencies and some of the
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:50.800]  internet aggregate numbers we have
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:52.800]  show that Trump's actually
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:54.800]  very popular with black Americans
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:56.800]  Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:58.800]  compared to other Republican candidates
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:00.800]  and other Republican figures
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:02.800]  that's why I got 35% of the vote from Hispanics
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:06.800]  they claim they only got 10% from blacks but we know
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:08.800]  they stole the election in many black areas
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:10.800]  evidence of that came out
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:12.800]  because I've had so many black people shake my hand
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:14.800]  and say they want Trump
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:16.800]  they want me they want prosperity
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:18.800]  and they don't like how Obama
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:20.800]  ignored them for all those years
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:22.800]  that's why the media knows their hold on people
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:24.800]  is falling apart so they're intensifying
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:26.800]  a major major push
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:28.800]  for racial division in this country
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:30.800]  let's show part of a report
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:32.800]  that's up on infowars.com
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:34.800]  from Owen shroyer
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:36.800]  showing the buses being brought in
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:38.800]  last night with the protesters but
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:40.800]  they've already had to scale back
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:44.800]  it's like a group of young millennials
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:46.800]  who are going to be protesting tomorrow
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:48.800]  they're arriving with buses
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:54.800]  oh yeah
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:56.800]  how do you want to get this?
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:58.800]  oh
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:00.800]  why'd you have that one?
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:02.800]  it's cold out here man
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:04.800]  it's gonna be weak
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.800]  they're putting them on buses
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:10.800]  it looks like it's ducks
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:14.800]  there's the bus line right there
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:16.800]  it's loading them up
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:18.800]  they're taking them to some housing
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:20.800]  and then they're going to start positing them around
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.800]  on inauguration
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:26.800]  okay now for radio listeners
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:28.800]  we actually have video of the buses
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:30.800]  for radio listeners we have the video
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:32.800]  it's on infowars.com
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:34.800]  there's a longer report coming up
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:36.800]  from Owen shroyer reporting that was Rob Doe
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.800]  by the way I'm here looking at infowars.com
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:40.800]  right now
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:42.800]  and I'm looking at Belgian
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:44.800]  aristocratic pedophile re-exposed
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:46.800]  boys and girls tortured, killed
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:48.800]  and forced to eat feces
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:52.800]  so they don't just grab your kid out of the
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:54.800]  backyard and rape them for a couple months
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:56.800]  they torture them and they make them
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:56:58.800]  eat crap and they kill them
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:00.800]  after they beg for food
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:02.800]  and reportedly in Belgium where this came out a few years ago
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:04.800]  some of the boys come out
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:06.800]  they sit
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:08.800]  in the room while the toddler cries for mommy
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:10.800]  like a beautiful satanic music
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  and while they beg and beg and beg
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:14.800]  sometimes they'll feed them a little more
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:16.800]  just to get their strength back up to beg and get hope
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:18.800]  and they call it sucking them dry
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:20.800]  it's vampiric, it sucks their soul
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  and that's who's in DC
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:24.800]  that's who Trump's kicking out
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:26.800]  that's why Trump wants to stop the vaccines
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:28.800]  he knows that's a soft kill, a lesser magic attack on your family
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  and I know this is hard to believe folks
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  but there's a new article out
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.800]  that deals with you know
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:36.800]  Merrill Street defending
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  Roman Polanski that you know drugs
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:40.800]  13 year old girls and Aynley Rebsom
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:42.800]  and that's just what he's been caught
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:44.800]  doing
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:46.800]  they want, the globalists want to grab your kids
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:48.800]  this is on record
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:50.800]  and they want to rape them for a few months
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:52.800]  and then make them eat crap before they
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:54.800]  drink their blood
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:56.800]  now I know that sounds insane
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  I'm not the insane one
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  that's what they're into
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:02.800]  people ask why don't you cover this more
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:04.800]  I've been covering the satanic pedophile networks
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:06.800]  for 20 something years
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:08.800]  and
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:12.800]  they're just on such power
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:14.800]  trips
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:16.800]  that they've been let into this thing by the devil
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:18.800]  and that they're on this you know crusade
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:20.800]  against love and light and goodness
[1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:22.800]  it's sick
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:24.800]  just because they've done these horrible things
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:26.800]  that are in these clubs doesn't give them power
[1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:28.800]  but they believe because they do these
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:30.800]  unholy things they are special
[1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  they are great
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  yeah they're great piles of crap
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  I mean you make little kids you torture and eat crap
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:38.800]  God is going to torture you for a trillion years

[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:26.800]  and kisses her it's sexual assault
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:28.800]  but teaching five-year-olds
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:30.800]  how to have sex isn't
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:32.800]  pedophilia in the public schools
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:34.800]  in a daily mail article about
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:36.800]  Belgian aristocrat pedophile re-exposed
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:38.800]  boys and girls tortured killed
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:40.800]  and forced to eat feces
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:42.800]  this is part of a long-term satanic ritual
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:44.800]  that's carried out over
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:46.800]  and over again they've made films about it
[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:50.800]  people then think it's Hollywood movies
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:52.800]  in history the word
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:54.800]  I guess statism does go back to people that wrote
[2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:56.800]  about this type of thing
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:58.800]  but this is all a ritual
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:00.800]  I've read about it going on thousands of years
[2:01:00.800 --> 2:01:02.800]  didn't even know that
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:04.800]  they even codified it into modern times
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:06.800]  that it was going on until more of this came out
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:08.800]  but by defiling the innocence
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:10.800]  they believe they moved themselves
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:12.800]  closer to evil
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:14.800]  they kind of tell you this in Revenge of the Sith
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:16.800]  this episode 3 of Star Wars
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:18.800]  where Darth Vader isn't really evil yet
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:20.800]  number Palpatine goes
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:22.800]  you best go and kill all the younglings
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:24.800]  hundreds of children at the Jedi temple
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:26.800]  only then will you be strong enough
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:28.800]  in the dark side
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:30.800]  that's exactly what they do
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:32.800]  they do these horrible things
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:34.800]  to defile themselves
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:36.800]  believing they're burning away their humanity
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:38.800]  to become stronger
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:40.800]  let's go to a few minutes of Owen Schroyer's report
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:42.800]  from the ground with the protesters last night
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:44.800]  we're going to come back with Owen Schroyer on the ground
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:46.800]  just 600 yards from me
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:48.800]  where the president is going to be inaugurated
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:50.800]  tomorrow
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:52.800]  let's go to that report
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:54.800]  all right ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:01:56.800]  it's Wednesday night
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:01:58.800]  in Washington DC
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:00.800]  Owen Schroyer here the Info Wars crew has just arrived
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:02.800]  we're checking into our place
[2:02:02.800 --> 2:02:04.800]  and we already have protests
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:06.800]  here we go
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:08.800]  this should be good
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:10.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:12.800]  I don't think they know what fascism is
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:14.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:20.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:22.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:24.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:26.800]  Trump and Pence are fascist
[2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:28.800]  hey, what makes Donald Trump fascist?
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:30.800]  Fascist

[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:34.800]  Trump is a legitimate

[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:34.280]  what it's like a group of young millennials we're going to be protested
[2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:49.840]  it's cold out here man
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:04:02.080]  there's the bustlin right there
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:05.680]  It's loading them up and taking them to some housing and then they're going to start
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:09.360]  positing them around on inauguration day.
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:16.560]  Run to reporting for infowars.com and Brigham National Park.
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:22.080]  All right, my friends, we are going to go to break here in just a moment.
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:27.880]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, infowars.com is the news site.
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:29.040]  I know all of you know that.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  I take it for granted, too.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:33.600]  I sit here and hardly promote my own website on air or the incredible stories that are
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  there.
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:37.080]  But it's bigger than the New York Times online.
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.640]  It's bigger than the Washington Post online.
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:39.640]  The enemy knows that.
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:41.120]  They are so pissed.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.360]  They are so angry.
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.960]  Roger Stone is coming up right now, I'm told.
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:49.680]  Owen Schroyer is set to pop in with us in the next segment.
[2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:52.440]  But all this and more is coming up today.
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:57.560]  I'm Alex Jones and we are here for the 45th president to be inaugurated tomorrow.
[2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:58.560]  Stay with us.
[2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:03.120]  Well, the man that was arrested for threatening to kill Donald Trump online?
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  Get this, folks.
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:06.960]  He was, in fact, a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:10.280]  Now, this was reported by the Daily Mail and it's up on our website.
[2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:12.680]  This man once gave 20 grand of the DNC.
[2:05:12.680 --> 2:05:13.680]  Not surprising.
[2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:18.160]  He was arrested by the Miami Beach Police on Tuesday of this week for threatening president
[2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:19.160]  elect Trump online.
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:23.520]  Turns out he's a member of a prominent Northeast family that's close to the Clintons, giving
[2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:24.520]  that whopping money.
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:29.360]  He and his name, Dominic Papulo Jr., he's 51 years old, he's sat near Hillary Clinton
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:33.760]  when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother, who died on one of the jets
[2:05:33.760 --> 2:05:35.680]  that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:40.760]  Now, during the eulogy on October 6, 2001 in Boston, Hillary Clinton actually referred
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:42.920]  to him as a computer wizard.
[2:05:42.920 --> 2:05:46.760]  He's now being held, of course, in the Miami-Dade County Jail after using Twitter to threaten
[2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:48.440]  the life of Donald Trump.
[2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:53.120]  Now, Trump is scheduled to be sworn in this week in Washington, D.C., remains incarcerated
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:55.640]  on the charge of threatening to harm a public servant.
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:06:25.600]  Next, I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:06:26.640 --> 2:06:48.840]  Next, I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:58.520]  Next, I'm Alex Jones, reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:06:58.520 --> 2:07:20.040]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:49.840]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:07:49.840 --> 2:08:16.240]  Next, I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:26.480]  All right, we've got some of the crew coming back in.
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:29.280]  Roger Stone, reportedly, is getting here about to be up here in the building.
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:33.160]  We've got Owen Schreuer, we're about to go to live, about 600 yards away right in front
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:34.160]  of the Capitol.
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:39.400]  We're probably inaugurated tomorrow before I go any further, because I didn't plug last
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:40.400]  hour.
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:43.320]  I did a lavish plug first hour, but first hour is over.
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:44.320]  Second hour is over.
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:45.800]  I didn't plug in the second hour.
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:48.880]  That's how we support the broadcast, is how we pay for the crew on the ground, so we
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:52.720]  pay for the security, it's how we get you the news, the information, the intel, it's
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:57.120]  how we catch the sorrows, people committing crimes, it's how we get the whistleblowers
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:08:59.080]  on, it's how we blow up the new world order.
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:02.320]  We stand up, we fight, we take action, we have victories.
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:06.240]  And to do that, we also bring you products that are game changers.
[2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:13.160]  We are launching today exclusively available to only InfowarsStore.com visitors.
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:20.040]  That one, that is a revolutionary, disinfected, totally healthy, totally safe, 12 years developed
[2:09:20.040 --> 2:09:25.800]  by the Defense Department with a private company, now exclusively available only to InfowarsStore
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:30.560]  visitors in a few months, what, four months, it's going to start hitting big stores, dicks
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:31.560]  and others.
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.880]  The point is, you're getting it exclusively first after 12 years of development, Infowars
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:40.440]  launches Combat One skin, protecting wipes, they've got creams, they've got sprays, they've
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:41.440]  got hand washes.
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:45.320]  And what's incredible is it's a very, very low price, but you buy it in bulk.
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:50.280]  Infowars launches Combat One skin, protecting wipes, previously only available to DoD, military
[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:58.000]  grade hygiene technology used by special operations, amazing pre-preparedness and survival product.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.640]  Just like we've got only to Infowars listeners, the NanoTube, NanoTech products only used
[2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:07.720]  by law enforcement military, it's cheaper than the big steel plates and works better.
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:12.800]  I mean, you can't make that up, InfowarsStore.com, you can't make up a lot of stuff we're up
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:16.520]  to, it's fun to be on the zeitgeist, didn't it?
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:19.720]  We're humble and we appreciate it, we just want to go to the next level and defeat the
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.680]  tyrants for prosperity and freedom for everybody.
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:26.920]  Infowars selects portable foods, already the lowest prices, made in America, they don't
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:31.160]  let me do the special very often because it undercuts their other distributors, but they
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:35.880]  finally have capitulated, so I can do it more often every few months than once a year.
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:40.360]  But also, they get behind we do these sales, they want to ship like same day you order
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:41.360]  or the day after.
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.880]  This is freshly packed, last 25 years is the entire My Patriot supply line.
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:52.600]  It's all available 30 to 40% off, we're only running it until next week, InfowarsStore.com.
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:54.880]  And yeah, we've termed the tide, things are getting better.
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.080]  There's no telling what the globalists might pull.
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  This is insurance you can eat so you basically can't fail, you can't lose when it comes down
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:03.080]  to it.
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:06.920]  It's 10% off, and we're having the end of this Sunday, I've extended the Christmas specials
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:10.320]  and called to make America healthy again special.
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:14.040]  And I've got to stop it, a lot of stuff sold out, some things have come back in like Super
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:20.560]  Mail and DNA Force, it's 10% off, Super Mail 30% off, a bunch of other products 30% off.
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:28.480]  It ends this Sunday, it's the inauguration special and it'll be four months at least
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:31.600]  until I do 30% off on any of these products.
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:33.880]  That's just an algorithm we've got, it's how we work it.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:36.960]  We can't do it, it's already discounted.
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:41.240]  The special isn't coming around until the second quarter of this year, or maybe later.
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:45.280]  So take advantage of it right now, make our bodies great again, the inauguration special,
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:51.240]  brain force 30% off, 20% each bottle, Super Mail 30%, secret 12% 20%, liver shield 20%,
[2:11:51.240 --> 2:12:00.040]  survival shield 30%, knockout 20%, prostate guard 20%, it all ends this Sunday, InfowarsStore.com,
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:05.000]  take your right to the sub page, that's the storeable foods, or we can always answer your
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:08.640]  questions or tell you about other specials we've got, there's too many lists here on
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:12.960]  air, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:17.280]  Now I haven't gotten to Trump actually saying he's going to do 200 executive orders the
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:19.840]  next week, five tomorrow.
[2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:27.200]  I haven't gotten to our report on stone being poisoned that we should air next hour.
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:30.520]  By the way, I love Anthony Cumi, I asked him to host the show twice a month and he did
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:33.360]  it graciously, big syndicated host, but today's super hot.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:37.120]  Have we heard from Anthony yet, whether he wants us to co-host with him next hour?
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:38.120]  Negative.
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:41.800]  I mean, I'm sure he'll, he always invites me on, he probably will, but if Stone's getting
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:45.800]  here late with all these checkpoints, they now, just as we got here this morning, block
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:50.080]  the road, if he doesn't get in, I'm sure Anthony's going to want him on, I'll let him run the
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:54.200]  show, but we can kind of split the show too, just do a Facebook mentions in here, I guess.
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.920]  I've been hearing he's going to be here for an hour, we'll, we'll see what happens.
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:03.880]  But right now I know who is here, the great Owen Schreuer, in DC since yesterday, he's
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:07.920]  witnessed a lot more than we have, just because he was at the right place at the right time.
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:10.680]  He's right there where Trump's going to get inaugurated tomorrow.
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:14.800]  First off before your observations, what do you make of CNN and a bunch of other publications
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:20.960]  saying Trump might get killed tomorrow, a truck bomb, a nuke, a drone attack, and it's quite
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  normal.
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:26.480]  It's no big deal, President Obama will appoint a new president and then Homeland Security
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:30.440]  federalize the elections, so they'll decide of the new election who's president.
[2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:38.320]  I mean, this is all, everything I kind of saw in my, you know, thinking about this,
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:43.680]  a cute call at the Odin sleep, and now we're, we're watching all this unfold.
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:48.040]  So question is, is my spidey sense wrong or is this bad?
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:49.040]  I don't think they're going to pull it.
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:53.040]  In fact, I feel very confident that they've capitulated and they've, they're kind of running
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:57.400]  an old program in case they wanted to do it, but they're kind of, you know, they've already
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:01.000]  paid for advertisements that were still airing after the restaurant closed.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.720]  It's kind of like a dollar short a day later, a day later dollar short.
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:11.520]  I think they're failing, I think they're reorganizing, I think they're, they're, they're under, under
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:16.200]  our control at this moment, but I, I'm feeling good and I see a lot of evidence that good
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:19.800]  things are happening and they're really panicking and look but hurt and there's photos on drudge
[2:14:19.800 --> 2:14:24.680]  of them, you know, the final days, like they're entitled to rule everything.
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:25.680]  But I don't know.
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:30.280]  I mean, there's still, they're setting the table for COG overthrow of Trump.
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:32.240]  They're sure selling they want impeachment.
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:34.720]  They claim every thought he gets is from Putin.
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:36.960]  So oh, and Shroyer, what do you think about that?
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:39.760]  Well, this is the normalization tactic.
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:44.600]  It's a psychological conditioning tactic that they push these narratives out there.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:47.080]  And then if it ends up coming true, it's already normalized.
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.480]  The people have already capitulated.
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:50.400]  They don't want to make a big deal out of it.
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:54.120]  So that's what I think CNN is trying to do here, talking about possible assassination
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:58.920]  attempts, talking about possible Obama appointing a different president and they've done it
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:14:59.920]  over and over.
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  They did it with the Electoral College.
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.960]  They did it the entire election with the polls and they failed at every step of the way.
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:06.760]  So my guess is they're going to fail again, Alex.
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:09.000]  I think that they're setting themselves up for failure.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:13.120]  I think that you might be right and they have accepted that they've lost this battle
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:15.720]  and maybe now they're thinking bigger again towards the war.
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:16.720]  What will they pull next?
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:18.600]  They can't stop Trump from being inaugurated.
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  But it's funny.
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:23.520]  You talk about CNN and if Zimmerman wants to show this, he doesn't have to, but CNN is
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:25.840]  actually on top of a building.
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:32.000]  They've set up their stage on top of a building and we know why because we had people, info
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.440]  warriors like you, get behind their set, troll them, put Bill Clinton as a rapist, shirts
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:39.520]  on air, hold up Trump signs on the air.
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:42.080]  So they had to go up and hide on a roof.
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  So that's what CNN is.
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  That's right.
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:50.600]  We've run them into a fortress mentality, which is the first stage of wanting.
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:56.840]  But from my experience out here, Alex, I will say this, Trumpians have taken over DC.
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:00.760]  The leftist, the protesters, they want to run with all this social media trends like
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:03.360]  Occupy DC, Occupy inauguration.
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:04.880]  I've got bad news for you.
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:06.360]  We are the ones occupying.
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:09.440]  I'm surrounded by thousands of Trump supporters right now.
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:12.600]  I walk around Capitol Hill and people are chanting right now.
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:13.600]  Listen to this.
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  This is crazy.
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:15.600]  I walk around Capitol Hill.
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:16.600]  Bring some of them in, Ellen.
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:17.600]  Bring some of them in.
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:20.280]  Do we have any info warriors that want to give a shout out to Alex Jones?
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:21.280]  Come here.
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:22.280]  He wants to hear from you.
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:23.280]  Look at this.
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:25.320]  Hey, Alex Jones wants to know why you're out here.
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:30.320]  I'm out here because I love Trump and I think he's going to make America great again.
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:33.560]  You know, the protesters are saying that they're going to occupy DC.
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:35.000]  All I've seen is Trump supporters out here.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  What about you?
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  Absolutely.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:40.680]  I've not seen nor have I heard any protesters out here.
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:43.160]  Just tons of Trump supporters.
[2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:46.280]  So I think Alex, and I don't know if anyone's seen it, me and Millie did a video.
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:48.200]  I think they're setting themselves up for failure here.
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:51.800]  I think they're inflating these numbers of hundreds of thousands of protesters.
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:52.800]  I don't think so.
[2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:54.080]  We've seen busloads come in.
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:57.040]  They might get a couple thousand, maybe 10, 10s of thousands.
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:16:58.040]  No way.
[2:16:58.040 --> 2:16:59.040]  Hundreds of thousands.
[2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:00.040]  Look at all these people recording us.
[2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:01.040]  Let me tell you something.
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:04.320]  Nobody cares about any other media organization that comes out here.
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:05.320]  Okay.
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:06.920]  There are all kinds of media people that come out here.
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:08.040]  They've got their cameras set up.
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:09.040]  They've got their microphones.
[2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:11.000]  Nobody goes up to them and shakes their hand.
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:12.560]  Nobody says, hey, I love what you do.
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:15.000]  That happens to us because we relate to these people.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.920]  We talk to these people on the street and we're Americans like these people.
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:20.440]  We elected Donald Trump because we want to make America great again.
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:21.440]  Exactly.
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:24.440]  Why is it dirty to say make America great again?
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:26.640]  Under globalism, you're not supposed to be great.
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:29.720]  You're supposed to just fail and the government rule your life.
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:32.000]  Again, the things people say is Trump real.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:33.800]  What he's saying and doing is real.
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:36.440]  These ideas are cancer to the New World Order.
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:38.160]  They're victory to us.
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:39.160]  Of course he's real.
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:40.800]  He wouldn't be invoking this.
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:43.120]  It's like sunlight to vampires.
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:44.760]  Trump's 100% real, man.
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:50.920]  That is why his only issue is he's a strong man and he believes because he's a good guy
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:52.680]  and he's not going to be a hypocrite.
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:56.160]  He's going to take the gloves off and I agree with that to a certain extent with enemies.
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:00.240]  I'm just saying once the enemies are vanquished, the gloves have to go back on.
[2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:05.400]  Well, and you saw the video that I shot last night as soon as we got here of those protesters,
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:07.080]  they have nothing to say, Alex.
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:08.080]  They have nothing to say.
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:10.680]  It's the same argument that they've been saying for 10 years.
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:12.680]  Racist, homophobe, Russian agent.
[2:18:12.680 --> 2:18:13.680]  Yeah.
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:14.680]  Yeah.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:15.680]  And I say, how is he a racist?
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:16.680]  Nothing.
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:17.680]  How is he a fascist?
[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:18.680]  Nothing.
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:19.680]  How does he hate immigrants?
[2:18:19.680 --> 2:18:20.680]  Nothing.
[2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:21.880]  They cite fake news and you can see it.
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:24.440]  What I've noticed now is they have these handlers.
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:28.800]  So I'll be talking to somebody in these protest groups who's just a regular citizen.
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:29.800]  Perhaps they've been brainwashed.
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:32.800]  They've been victimized by the fake news and they're actually having a conversation with
[2:18:32.800 --> 2:18:33.800]  me and we're talking.
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:36.320]  And all of a sudden, I start to defeat their false narratives.
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:38.320]  Oh, it's always that way with love and kindness.
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:39.320]  The handler comes over and grabs me.
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:41.720]  Oh, you're not allowed to talk to them because they're so worried.
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:45.480]  They have this little brainwashed menu and they work so hard and they paid to be there.
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:47.840]  They might actually start listening to you.
[2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:49.080]  I think that's what's happening.
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:51.640]  And they have these adult handlers or something.
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:55.120]  They come, they grab them, they run them away before they could have a conversation with
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:56.120]  us.
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:18:58.800]  Most people won't even talk to me, but the ones that do, you can tell they're just
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:18:59.960]  regular people.
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:01.600]  They really think that Trump's a racist.
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:02.600]  They've been tricked.
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:03.600]  But when they have a conversation.
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:07.520]  I was talking to some other people, a lot of these people that are out here protesting
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:11.240]  Trump or that voted Clinton, they've never met an actual Trump supporter.
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:13.280]  They've never talked to somebody that supported Trump.
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:14.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:17.240]  I mean, they hate the fact that blacks and Hispanics at record numbers are going to Trump
[2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:18.240]  rallies.
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:22.200]  That's why I think the president, once he's president, president in office should continue
[2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:26.440]  rallies every few weeks or every few months is just to bring everybody together and call
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:31.280]  for everyone of every race, color, and creed to come together to say, see, they don't want
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:32.280]  this.
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:34.360]  You know, when the Republican party was racist, this isn't true.
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:35.360]  We're all together.
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:37.360]  I'm telling you, he has to do unity rallies.
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:41.040]  I'm going to tell him that next time I talk to him, but he's already planning it all.
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  It's crazy.
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:43.040]  He's just like the Trump.
[2:19:43.040 --> 2:19:44.040]  It's like mind meld.
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:45.520]  He's already on the same plane.
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:46.520]  It's like the same frequency.
[2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:47.520]  We have a name for it.
[2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:48.520]  We're all powered by the force, Alex.
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:49.520]  Make America great again.
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:50.520]  Yeah.

[2:27:27.860 --> 2:27:30.220]  Well, let me ask you a question. So did you vote for Hillary Clinton?
[2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:34.180]  Yeah, I kind of did not not with a lot of enthusiasm
[2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:39.020]  So but you do you think Hillary was a better candidate than Trump more character? Yes

[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:52.500]  Yeah, we don't like

[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:05.060]  Donald Donald Trump was against the Iraqi war. I like that about him. See there. There's things I do like about him
[2:28:05.060 --> 2:28:09.460]  But not very much. Why don't you you know, he's a carly man oppressor of women when he didn't dumbass
[2:28:10.100 --> 2:28:14.860]  Not judging by the cabinet people. He's put in by his attitude. He's got a bad attitude, man
[2:28:14.860 --> 2:28:19.300]  He's like a child. He's got a bad attitude. You got to give him a chance man for what?
[2:28:20.020 --> 2:28:25.420]  He's the president America elected in this guy claims he's anti-elitist and then meanwhile the whole elites against Trump
[2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:31.100]  Absolutely, Hillary Clinton got three million more votes. He didn't even win the election. Oh, she stole five states

[2:32:58.100 --> 2:33:13.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:33:16.780 --> 2:33:18.780]  Here I come now, baby
[2:33:19.660 --> 2:33:24.740]  We are back live with the great Motor City madman dead man
[2:33:24.740 --> 2:33:28.740]  Now here I come now, baby
[2:33:30.740 --> 2:33:33.740]  Look, I don't have
[2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:42.740]  Irrational hopes about Trump. I just see the enemy completely panicking entitled out of control arrogant stupid
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:47.740]  And it's exciting
[2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:49.740]  I've looked at Trump's policies. They're good
[2:33:49.740 --> 2:33:54.740]  Our only problem is dealing with the fact that it's going to create such prosperity
[2:33:54.740 --> 2:33:57.740]  That we've been that we are so culturally evil
[2:33:57.740 --> 2:34:02.740]  That it'll cause a lot of problems, but that's better than being super poor and having
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:06.740]  How we're going to live our lives dictated to us by people that are anti-human
[2:34:08.740 --> 2:34:11.740]  So the other choice is a murder
[2:34:11.740 --> 2:34:18.740]  But wealth does have some dangerous byproducts with it as well as many historian as many apparent has noted
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:23.740]  Adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters as I often quote Victor Hugo
[2:34:23.740 --> 2:34:27.740]  It's almost annoying to have to always give credit to quotes because I want to give Victor Hugo quotes or
[2:34:27.740 --> 2:34:31.740]  You know or Voltaire or towards Washington
[2:34:31.740 --> 2:34:33.740]  I'm not going to give Victor Hugo quotes
[2:34:33.740 --> 2:34:35.740]  I'm not going to give Victor Hugo quotes
[2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:41.740]  I need to have to always give credit to quotes because I want to give Victor Hugo quotes or Voltaire or towards Washington
[2:34:41.740 --> 2:34:46.740]  But just like Mark Twain, but it's like some quotes I do like every day and I don't want to like
[2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:48.740]  Come in and say
[2:34:48.740 --> 2:34:52.740]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come
[2:34:52.740 --> 2:34:55.740]  Victor Hugo, this is the Alex Jones show
[2:34:55.740 --> 2:34:57.740]  I think I'm just going to take those names officially
[2:34:57.740 --> 2:35:00.740]  You'll take those terms and put them out there
[2:35:00.740 --> 2:35:05.740]  Norma shroyer is out on the street in DC in front of the Capitol
[2:35:05.740 --> 2:35:09.740]  He's talking to folks out there out of John bound report. I want to get to we got jump
[2:35:09.740 --> 2:35:12.740]  We have Roger stone coming up as well and answer the acumia
[2:35:12.740 --> 2:35:16.740]  And again, I'm going to be out on the streets tonight with a lot of live feeds tape stuff
[2:35:16.740 --> 2:35:20.740]  We'll putting up just watch info wars.com for the latest breaking news
[2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:23.740]  But getting serious, let me go back to drudge report real quick
[2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:28.740]  info wars has a lot of breaking news, but drudge drudge has even more
[2:35:28.740 --> 2:35:35.740]  And let's go over some of the news CNN disaster could put Obama cabinet
[2:35:35.740 --> 2:35:40.740]  In oval office and it shows the Capitol blown up
[2:35:40.740 --> 2:35:44.740]  And that's what they're saying media warrants of inauguration drone bombing
[2:35:44.740 --> 2:35:52.740]  Not safe fortress Washington Guards and prayers itself for days of resistance
[2:35:52.740 --> 2:35:58.740]  Top set up mobile booking stations reveal training camp or protesters
[2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:00.740]  Plans to disrupt we can put all this on screen
[2:36:00.740 --> 2:36:06.740]  LGBT queer dance party outside Pence home
[2:36:06.740 --> 2:36:12.740]  Gennrich skewers boycotting dance
[2:36:12.740 --> 2:36:16.740]  Look, I love a lot of what Gennrich says Gennrich is one of the most eloquent speakers
[2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:20.740]  He's super smart. I give him that
[2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:27.740]  I think Carl Rove is just an arrogant moron who comes up with basic Machiavellian operations
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.740]  But doesn't even know when to deploy him, but but I'll give Gennrich this he's smarter than I am probably
[2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:37.740]  But he's got a dark twist man. He he's a weasel and he comes out and you know says things like
[2:36:37.740 --> 2:36:42.740]  Oh, Trump never meant to drawing the swamp. Oh, it's all fraud to discrediting
[2:36:42.740 --> 2:36:45.740]  And now Trump made you apologize. He doesn't trust you
[2:36:45.740 --> 2:36:47.740]  Of course, Trump always didn't trust you Gennrich
[2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:52.740]  You're just a good guide is the former speaker to help them figure out how stuff works
[2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:58.740]  And as Trump gets deeper into this believe me you're going to see some big developments ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:58.740 --> 2:37:03.740]  And continuing with drudge last call before the wall illegals flood in again
[2:37:03.740 --> 2:37:06.740]  I'm not against poor desperate people from all over the world
[2:37:06.740 --> 2:37:12.740]  But they're turned in to socialist globalist when they get here and brainwashed
[2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:16.740]  And taught all this racial hate stuff
[2:37:16.740 --> 2:37:25.740]  I mean if we had bordering us some country or or a continent with, you know, 600 million white people
[2:37:25.740 --> 2:37:29.740]  But they had diseases they were unemployed they were uneducated
[2:37:29.740 --> 2:37:34.740]  And they were being brought in by a group of people that was going to turn them into America haters
[2:37:34.740 --> 2:37:37.740]  I'd say don't do it well actually a lot of Eastern Europeans are being brought in that actually
[2:37:37.740 --> 2:37:43.740]  Never got out from under communism and just buy it that's happening but the biggest group is the communist Chinese
[2:37:43.740 --> 2:37:48.740]  And they're bringing in people who get their babies free and everything else
[2:37:48.740 --> 2:37:51.740]  They stay here and their kids are citizens and I'm not against Chinese people
[2:37:51.740 --> 2:37:55.740]  I don't want to be under communism I want to be free but I'm not against Latin Americans but
[2:37:55.740 --> 2:38:00.740]  Again as I said a thousand times Latin America is gorgeous
[2:38:00.740 --> 2:38:04.740]  But they never got out from under corruption and colonialism
[2:38:04.740 --> 2:38:07.740]  And so they just have their own form of it it's a hellhole in most areas
[2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:11.740]  But I've been to Central America I've been to Mexico I've been to South America yet
[2:38:11.740 --> 2:38:14.740]  I guess I've been a little bit into something once in South America but
[2:38:14.740 --> 2:38:18.740]  What I'm getting at is it runs from bad to worse
[2:38:18.740 --> 2:38:22.740]  But I don't sit back and go boy we're better than Latin America and Venezuela
[2:38:22.740 --> 2:38:27.740]  I'm feeling real good about myself right now I'm in fear of that
[2:38:27.740 --> 2:38:30.740]  I know our politicians are even worse than theirs
[2:38:30.740 --> 2:38:35.740]  They're just living off such an accruement of wealth and power and chivalry
[2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:41.740]  And the West it's such a depletion they've got that once the corruption runs out of gas
[2:38:41.740 --> 2:38:44.740]  It's going to be the scariest thing you ever saw
[2:38:44.740 --> 2:38:47.740]  Because there's going to be this giant horde of bureaucrats
[2:38:47.740 --> 2:38:54.740]  Their own giant demoralized brainwashed dependent mass of poor white people
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:38:58.740]  Hispanics blacks you name it it's going to be a trash fest
[2:38:58.740 --> 2:39:03.740]  A bunch of entitled spoiled rotten people through MTV that have been given a culture of crime
[2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:08.740]  I don't care if you're poor white people blacks or Hispanics man they teach a culture of fuggism
[2:39:08.740 --> 2:39:13.740]  I mean it's so disgusting and it's all to just prime the underclasses for prisons
[2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:16.740]  Do I then blame the cops who are facing this onslaught of crime? No
[2:39:16.740 --> 2:39:23.740]  It's a larger paradigm playing us all off against each other and the answer is recognizing it
[2:39:23.740 --> 2:39:29.740]  Now if you're a black guy in East Texas at a Dairy Queen walking out of a place at 10 o'clock at night
[2:39:29.740 --> 2:39:34.740]  And three clan members try to mug you and that still goes on you've got a right to kill them
[2:39:34.740 --> 2:39:38.740]  Now it doesn't mean you buy the whole race paradigm but you've got a right to defend yourself
[2:39:38.740 --> 2:39:42.740]  Well the same thing if you're in East Austin and three black racists try to attack you as your wife
[2:39:42.740 --> 2:39:45.740]  And demand your money start trying to assault you
[2:39:45.740 --> 2:39:50.740]  Do what you've got to do it's not racial they were in a race cult they were brainwashed
[2:39:50.740 --> 2:39:54.740]  They were idiots they need to die if they're trying to kill you
[2:39:54.740 --> 2:39:59.740]  But you don't sit there and then turn it into some deal of hating people because of what color they are
[2:39:59.740 --> 2:40:03.740]  You got to understand that that's the globalist winning
[2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:08.740]  Well let me ask you it's no big deal I always love getting stoned we can interview him tonight
[2:40:08.740 --> 2:40:11.740]  On Outly News it was just like it was me here 45 months ago
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:15.740]  I just talked to him he stuck at the Mayflower Hotel and I'm going to try to just go over there and Skype him
[2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:19.740]  That is the answer and we'll do it with Anthony Cummings which I said at the start of the show
[2:40:19.740 --> 2:40:22.740]  He doesn't need to come here let's go to him I'm not mad
[2:40:22.740 --> 2:40:26.740]  I told him that he finally got back and said hey I'm still stuck here at the Mayflower Hotel
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:28.740]  Yeah I knew that would happen just go to the interview there
[2:40:28.740 --> 2:40:31.740]  I don't even care but I need to get my credentials
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:32.740]  Yes
[2:40:32.740 --> 2:40:34.740]  The golden ticket
[2:40:34.740 --> 2:40:36.740]  Alright thank you
[2:40:37.740 --> 2:40:40.740]  I mean I'm not trying to get I'm not trying to get you
[2:40:40.740 --> 2:40:42.740]  Pardon me
[2:40:42.740 --> 2:40:44.740]  Let's get on back on then
[2:40:44.740 --> 2:40:47.740]  I'm sorry he's been holding for 10 minutes I'm ranting
[2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:52.740]  I wouldn't normally want to go to you know any type of a van but this is kind of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory right now
[2:40:52.740 --> 2:40:56.740]  And see I'm not racist I like OOP Olympus
[2:40:58.740 --> 2:41:01.740]  Oompa loompa loompity oom
[2:41:01.740 --> 2:41:05.740]  Have I got some freedom for you
[2:41:05.740 --> 2:41:07.740]  Guns and private property as well
[2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:11.740]  Lots of cool people and we're not selling out the country
[2:41:11.740 --> 2:41:13.740]  No we're not doing it
[2:41:13.740 --> 2:41:16.740]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[2:41:16.740 --> 2:41:19.740]  Oh and look America's got a lot of problems
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:22.740]  Was that not a messed up Oompa loompity
[2:41:22.740 --> 2:41:24.740]  This is totally screwed up
[2:41:24.740 --> 2:41:28.740]  The part is the train wrecking on air listen to this
[2:41:28.740 --> 2:41:32.740]  You know what we're seeing though is a revolution in America
[2:41:32.740 --> 2:41:37.740]  We're witnessing a real revolution a peaceful revolution against the globalists
[2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:40.740]  With the American people the patriots in government and others
[2:41:40.740 --> 2:41:44.740]  Leaking just the right amount of stuff to kick out the corrupt people
[2:41:44.740 --> 2:41:49.740]  Because I'm not somebody who says hold back stuff I say let it all come out just to be done by the heavens fall
[2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:55.740]  But reportedly a lot of the stuff is so horrible that the Democrats have been up to
[2:41:55.740 --> 2:42:00.740]  I mean you know it's beyond succulent hot dogs
[2:42:00.740 --> 2:42:04.740]  That I mean if it came out it would be a civil war
[2:42:04.740 --> 2:42:08.740]  And I'm just saying if they keep pushing or they set off a nuke tomorrow
[2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:11.740]  Or they try something like that to keep Trump from getting in
[2:42:11.740 --> 2:42:14.740]  The gloves are going to completely come off
[2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:18.740]  Because here's the deal we don't want to conquer the leftist and the Soros people and the globalists
[2:42:18.740 --> 2:42:24.740]  We want you to have a wealthy great future and to be free
[2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:27.740]  We're we we don't want them out your head on the wall
[2:42:27.740 --> 2:42:30.740]  We're not in a wee wee contest with you
[2:42:30.740 --> 2:42:33.740]  This isn't about that we just want you to get out the way
[2:42:33.740 --> 2:42:38.740]  Move get out the way you see them headlights hear that horn did you get out of the way
[2:42:38.740 --> 2:42:45.740]  You want to drive slow get in the ditch move get out the way get out the way
[2:42:45.740 --> 2:42:50.740]  China could have coal power plants that are dirty we should be able to have clean ones
[2:42:50.740 --> 2:42:56.740]  China has lower corporate taxes than us we should have a lower so the money comes back in here
[2:42:56.740 --> 2:43:01.740]  That's why like you were mentioned in Alibaba's announced they're coming here
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:06.740]  Hiring a million people that's amazing huh
[2:43:06.740 --> 2:43:08.740]  Steel mills coming back
[2:43:08.740 --> 2:43:12.740]  Chrysler coming back for coming back and Obama's feds go
[2:43:12.740 --> 2:43:16.740]  We're just going to find you four billion a piece now because you're coming back
[2:43:16.740 --> 2:43:19.740]  I mean that's treason that's a military attack
[2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:23.740]  Oh you're going to come back we're going to blow the hell out of you with regulators
[2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:25.740]  And again if Trump tries to shut that down they'll go
[2:43:25.740 --> 2:43:30.740]  Trump was interfered in criminal investigations and was colluding we're going to indict him
[2:43:30.740 --> 2:43:35.740]  Trump's got to be careful man because they have really set him up
[2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:38.740]  And we've got to back him you know we keep calling for this champion
[2:43:38.740 --> 2:43:43.740]  We keep calling for somebody to take him on and then it manifests in front of us
[2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:47.740]  And we're like Trump isn't doing enough for Trump isn't
[2:43:47.740 --> 2:43:51.740]  What I'm doing is the camera died
[2:43:51.740 --> 2:43:55.740]  Oh it died
[2:43:55.740 --> 2:43:59.740]  Oh okay well it's no big deal you know what we've got a lot of reports to get to
[2:43:59.740 --> 2:44:01.740]  You know I should take some calls
[2:44:01.740 --> 2:44:05.740]  800-25-99231 let's talk specifically about them saying
[2:44:05.740 --> 2:44:09.740]  Drones are going to attack, weapons, bombs, don't go, don't go
[2:44:09.740 --> 2:44:13.740]  Given the Democrats cover not to be there so if there is an attack they don't get looked at
[2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:17.740]  I'm telling you or it's just a way to call in a bomb threat basically to the Trump event
[2:44:17.740 --> 2:44:20.740]  Is that what they're doing? I mean any way you look at it it's terroristic
[2:44:20.740 --> 2:44:22.740]  It's a toll free number to join us
[2:44:22.740 --> 2:44:26.740]  800-25-9231
[2:44:26.740 --> 2:44:29.740]  I engulfed that potbelly
[2:44:29.740 --> 2:44:33.740]  Is it called potbelly sandwiches? I had a potbelly sandwich during the break of three minutes and
[2:44:33.740 --> 2:44:35.740]  Loaded with delicious polonium
[2:44:35.740 --> 2:44:38.740]  You know it's a conspiracy theory that polonium isn't good for you
[2:44:38.740 --> 2:44:41.740]  Potbellies are good too we have one in Austin
[2:44:41.740 --> 2:44:45.740]  They're not a sponsor folks 800-25-99231
[2:44:45.740 --> 2:44:47.740]  Potbellies brought to you by polonium
[2:44:47.740 --> 2:44:50.740]  That's a joke for the great copy there's no polonium in it
[2:44:50.740 --> 2:44:51.740]  It's a joke about Roger Stone
[2:44:51.740 --> 2:44:53.740]  I shouldn't be joking about Roger Stone
[2:44:53.740 --> 2:44:59.740]  Speaking of the devil let's go to a Roger Stone report
[2:44:59.740 --> 2:45:01.740]  You're gonna eat first I think over there dude
[2:45:01.740 --> 2:45:05.740]  You're not allowed to eat how close does it?
[2:45:05.740 --> 2:45:10.740]  19 minutes by transit I'm gonna take an Uber to be 15 minutes
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:15.740]  Okay well what about Olin and all that can't we just send our reporters?
[2:45:15.740 --> 2:45:17.740]  I think they're over at the cap I'm a little closer
[2:45:17.740 --> 2:45:19.740]  Yeah I'm a little closer
[2:45:19.740 --> 2:45:22.740]  Okay you go do it do it live as O'Reilly says
[2:45:22.740 --> 2:45:24.740]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip
[2:45:24.740 --> 2:45:26.740]  This is the poisoning of Roger Stone
[2:45:26.740 --> 2:45:30.740]  We make jokes about this I don't want to tell him he looks terrible on air and stuff
[2:45:30.740 --> 2:45:34.740]  But I mean he looks like 10 years older he really last night he was like
[2:45:34.740 --> 2:45:37.740]  He couldn't even drink a glass of wine he had to go
[2:45:37.740 --> 2:45:41.740]  So great job guys you did a really good job poisoning him
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:44.740]  And I think he's starting to really read in the literature about polonium
[2:45:44.740 --> 2:45:48.740]  And how to put a good face on this but I'm sitting there you know
[2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:51.740]  I'm not laughing about it it's more like gallows humor
[2:45:51.740 --> 2:45:53.740]  Because all I can do is make a big joke about all this
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:57.740]  Because we're going to get the people that are up to this
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:46:02.740]  You can bet your bottom dollar that it's not about reprisals it's about the right thing happening
[2:46:02.740 --> 2:46:09.740]  And especially if Roger Stone dies then you can bet the president is going to come after people that are out there
[2:46:09.740 --> 2:46:13.740]  But I ran into this I ran into Christopher Ruddy of the Newsmax last night
[2:46:13.740 --> 2:46:17.740]  And a bunch of people at this table come over to say hi to us I was at the Palm Steakhouse
[2:46:17.740 --> 2:46:21.740]  And I went over and Chris Ruddy who I've left alone over the years
[2:46:21.740 --> 2:46:24.740]  I've seen a lot of stuff he's just looked at me with so much disdain
[2:46:24.740 --> 2:46:29.740]  And started making jokes and just laughing at me like it was going to hurt me
[2:46:29.740 --> 2:46:35.740]  And I was like oh my god this guy's like delusional on a power trip just laying here
[2:46:35.740 --> 2:46:39.740]  And it's all true he gives millions to the Clinton Foundation
[2:46:39.740 --> 2:46:44.740]  And it's like true this guy who did such pioneering work just did it
[2:46:44.740 --> 2:46:50.740]  And then for over a decade it's like a minion of the Clintons and plays golf with Bill Clinton
[2:46:50.740 --> 2:46:58.740]  You couldn't pay me to go play golf with that daughtering zombie and you know the old Jerry Epstein crew out in Florida
[2:46:58.740 --> 2:47:03.740]  So Chris Ruddy man when I came over Stone was what are you doing with those Democrats they hate your guts
[2:47:03.740 --> 2:47:06.740]  And I went no they do it was like god I was horrible
[2:47:06.740 --> 2:47:10.740]  He was like yeah I said well you went over there well I went over there to tell them I know what they're up to
[2:47:10.740 --> 2:47:14.740]  Stone goes over and talks to him and comes back so I go oh that's Chris Ruddy and he goes you're going over there
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:19.740]  And I went over there and it was just like I mean he could want an Oscar for the disdain and the hate
[2:47:19.740 --> 2:47:26.740]  And just I'm like hey I heard he was just like the fact that he thought insulting me and laughing at me would get to me
[2:47:26.740 --> 2:47:33.740]  He hurt me and that a fellow human had fallen that far and that somebody I'd admired 20 years ago was that low
[2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:38.740]  And I was just like he wasn't that bad see I'm being really mean now
[2:47:38.740 --> 2:47:43.740]  But he was that bad he was trying to be disdainful a lot of folks at the table were listeners that came over and got photos with me
[2:47:43.740 --> 2:47:48.740]  And then he didn't like that he was like wait my own entourage likes Alex Jones and some of them were famous
[2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:54.740]  But it's just what world are these guys living on let's go to this boil down of the big interview we did
[2:47:54.740 --> 2:48:00.740]  Just a few days ago with Roger Stone who he's got a good attitude
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:04.740]  It's like these guys that are stage three cancer and are like oh I'm going to be fine I'm going to be great
[2:48:04.740 --> 2:48:10.740]  He's like oh they say it's a small dose time I'll probably be fine and the thing is it kills you over a long period of time
[2:48:10.740 --> 2:48:17.740]  And so the truth is that he's walking around it's a big deal and I'm not trying to be a drama queen here or freak his wife out
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:24.740]  Hopefully his wife's not listening was this beautiful little great lady and I'm sitting there talking to her and he's like he's like yeah
[2:48:24.740 --> 2:48:31.740]  I don't want to get into the polonium too much with my wife I guess it's like code word for don't but I mean we got to report the news here
[2:48:31.740 --> 2:48:39.740]  Took a year to kill Lyntha Niko and I love how it's only like 20 newspapers
[2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:43.740]  That sounds like a big deal it should be in thousands of newspapers that Roger Stone was hit with polonium
[2:48:43.740 --> 2:48:50.740]  And I sit here and make jokes about it myself I mean we have to watch where I get food now all because I just want to cut your taxes
[2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:54.740]  I mean it's BS man
[2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:58.740]  Alright get over there and I'll let Kumi you know he's basically interviewing Roger Stone
[2:48:58.740 --> 2:49:03.740]  Kumi is taking over
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:06.740]  We got a key
[2:49:06.740 --> 2:49:11.740]  Alright we're going to go interview Roger Stone we got Anthony Kumi coming up we got a lot more I know we just gave out the number
[2:49:11.740 --> 2:49:13.740]  Let me skip this break for more time
[2:49:13.740 --> 2:49:16.740]  Yeah I mean the network complains and I skip a lot of breaks
[2:49:16.740 --> 2:49:23.740]  Hey if they kill me there won't be any breaks will there or any ads how's that smell
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:27.740]  Anyways
[2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:30.740]  Let's go ahead and go to this the Poison and Roger Stone report here it is
[2:49:30.740 --> 2:49:35.740]  Roger Stone what do you hope voters will take away from your book The Clinton's War on Women
[2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:40.740]  You're pretty tough on the Clintons on this book you do you think Bill Clinton has not always been a gentleman
[2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:43.740]  No that's really not the point the point is that her narrative
[2:49:43.740 --> 2:49:45.740]  He is saying he raped 27 women
[2:49:45.740 --> 2:49:49.740]  He is a Bill Cosby type sexual predator
[2:49:49.740 --> 2:49:51.740]  Probably Paula Jones said
[2:49:51.740 --> 2:49:54.740]  No she was sexually assaulted pardon me but it's just not bad
[2:49:54.740 --> 2:49:59.740]  Well I don't know if it's Hillary who hires the heavy handed private detectives to silence these women
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:04.740]  The point is he is abused women she's helped cover it up she's an enabler that's what the book's about
[2:50:04.740 --> 2:50:06.740]  My book sounds sort of sh**
[2:50:06.740 --> 2:50:10.740]  F***
[2:50:21.740 --> 2:50:25.740]  Roger Stone about two weeks ago I had just gone on family vacation
[2:50:25.740 --> 2:50:28.740]  A working vacation workcation
[2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:32.740]  He said yeah they just sent out the feds out to my house
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:37.740]  I was in the hospital for weeks he had never been in the hospital in his life since he was born
[2:50:37.740 --> 2:50:40.740]  That was the second time he was in the hospital in his life
[2:50:40.740 --> 2:50:43.740]  And he said he's a Poloni employee
[2:50:43.740 --> 2:50:50.740]  But they're saying it's national security because only a state sponsored actor could happen
[2:50:50.740 --> 2:50:53.740]  The size of each other could only be made in the biggest reactors basically
[2:50:53.740 --> 2:50:56.740]  So it has a signature
[2:50:56.740 --> 2:50:58.740]  He said what do you think is behind it
[2:50:58.740 --> 2:51:02.740]  Clearly it's meant to kill you then they just blend the Russians and say they were getting one of their assets
[2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:06.740]  I said with a living income case it was connected back to MI6
[2:51:06.740 --> 2:51:15.740]  And I wasn't even making the connection then that it was the same MI6 handler spy that was attacking Trump and Stone everybody
[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:18.740]  That was tied to that
[2:51:18.740 --> 2:51:23.740]  I was doing research for it a few days after that and it was like holy Toledo it's the same guy
[2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:27.740]  Roger I know you don't like to speculate but you've been sitting there you've known about this for weeks
[2:51:27.740 --> 2:51:29.740]  Polonium poisoning it's big
[2:51:29.740 --> 2:51:32.740]  Let's talk about you let's talk about why you're
[2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:36.740]  I mean I'm not trying to put you down I mean I can physically see that you've been sick
[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:38.740]  We've seen the photos what it did to you
[2:51:38.740 --> 2:51:43.740]  I mean it really hit you hard and I know it has long term effects
[2:51:43.740 --> 2:51:46.740]  Just other points on polonium
[2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:52.740]  Well look we get down to the fundamental question of who would have done this and why
[2:51:52.740 --> 2:51:56.740]  And I come back to the deep state I come back to our own people
[2:51:56.740 --> 2:52:04.740]  The Russians have no motive to kill me they have nothing to hide or cover as far as I am concerned
[2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:07.740]  You've never heard of Roger Stone? You're in for a treat
[2:52:07.740 --> 2:52:10.740]  Not only did he serve under Nixon Reagan and Bush senior
[2:52:10.740 --> 2:52:13.740]  But he's also a self-proclaimed GOP hitman
[2:52:13.740 --> 2:52:16.740]  It's not a phrase to use dirty tricks to get his way politically
[2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:22.740]  Roger Stone who has been Trump's chief political advisor he is Trump's henchman and dirty trickster
[2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:29.740]  Roger Stone is a super bad guy and he's one of these operatives who works the dark side as Dick Cheney would say
[2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:32.740]  You're a sick dude Roger Stone
[2:52:32.740 --> 2:52:35.740]  You assault me all the time you never give me a chance to restart
[2:52:35.740 --> 2:52:37.740]  I should give you a job
[2:52:37.740 --> 2:52:40.740]  You're a sick man Roger Stone
[2:52:40.740 --> 2:52:48.740]  CNN confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that controversial conservative political strategist Roger Stone is done at the network
[2:52:48.740 --> 2:52:53.740]  A CNN spokeswoman told THR he will no longer appear as a CNN guest
[2:52:53.740 --> 2:53:00.740]  The CIA has been associated with some of the greatest atrocities and lies of the last 40 years
[2:53:00.740 --> 2:53:07.740]  And they're famous for poisoning people so you're clearly saying the rogue elements of that are obviously a suspect
[2:53:07.740 --> 2:53:13.740]  They've been in the news warning Trump, the Associated Press and Reuters, the New York Observer of all places
[2:53:13.740 --> 2:53:18.740]  His son-in-law's paper, you better watch it, the intelligence agency can do things to you
[2:53:18.740 --> 2:53:24.740]  Well then if you've been good buddies with him for 41 years then I think that's a message to Trump
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:26.740]  Isn't this really a message to Donald Trump?
[2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:32.740]  He's taking these shots as antagonism and taunting to the intelligence community
[2:53:32.740 --> 2:53:37.740]  You take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you
[2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:42.740]  So even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do this
[2:53:42.740 --> 2:53:45.740]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were meant to?
[2:53:45.740 --> 2:53:52.740]  I don't know, but from what I am told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them
[2:53:52.740 --> 2:53:58.740]  Stone goes okay give me the medical records and then the guys with the crew cats come back to the house
[2:53:58.740 --> 2:54:00.740]  and they'll have some actual security and blah blah blah
[2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:04.740]  So he's having his lawyers involved and all this because they don't obviously want him waving around
[2:54:04.740 --> 2:54:08.740]  that he was hit with a polonium so he's going to get private tested right now
[2:54:08.740 --> 2:54:09.740]  But I mean this happened
[2:54:09.740 --> 2:54:16.740]  The MI6 guy worked with the murdered Levin Inko guy that got hit with polonium
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:22.740]  I was already connecting the two Holy Toledo Daily Mail out as the man behind the dirty dossier of Donald Trump
[2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:26.740]  which they admit is now fake worked with the double triple agent
[2:54:26.740 --> 2:54:31.740]  I remember at the time it came out that experts believed that there was no reason for Russia to kill this guy
[2:54:31.740 --> 2:54:34.740]  that it was done to embarrass Russia this is crazy
[2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:44.740]  Well it occurs to me that the people who created that document should be ashamed of themselves
[2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:48.740]  Their dossier is rife with misspellants
[2:54:48.740 --> 2:54:51.740]  It wasn't even good for ass wiping
[2:54:51.740 --> 2:55:01.740]  So the idea that James Clapper and the boys down at Langley would include this in a report to President Obama and President Trump
[2:55:01.740 --> 2:55:05.740]  This is a vile fraud
[2:55:05.740 --> 2:55:12.740]  By the way I'm told by three sources low level, mid level and high level in the CIA that the whole agency hates the globalist
[2:55:12.740 --> 2:55:16.740]  wants America to be great, they hate Hillary, they hate it all, they say
[2:55:16.740 --> 2:55:21.740]  And I was told this weeks ago this is all farmed out to subgroups, PR firms as later came out
[2:55:21.740 --> 2:55:24.740]  I forgot how accurate their info was, it's all completely fake
[2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:27.740]  So it isn't even the CIA, the CIA doesn't like this
[2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:29.740]  I think that's why the globalists are in so much trouble
[2:55:29.740 --> 2:55:32.740]  Their own agencies have turned against them
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:42.740]  Well and it would be outrageously unfair to say that everybody who works for the Central Intelligence Agency is in league with the globalist agenda
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:45.740]  No there are patriotic Americans that work there
[2:55:45.740 --> 2:55:51.740]  Just as there are many, many, many non-political patriotic Americans who work for the FBI
[2:55:51.740 --> 2:56:12.740]  But the leadership of these agencies are rotten to the core
[2:56:12.740 --> 2:56:27.740]  I probably should also get punched up on my computer here at the call system
[2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:30.740]  Forgot to do that, let me fire that system up
[2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:36.740]  If not guys, I should have launched this earlier, will you text my phone, the callers as I start going to those please
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:43.740]  Sorry to tell you it was such a late notice, for some reason my phone system isn't launching on this computer
[2:56:43.740 --> 2:56:47.740]  But it's no big deal, we're on the road, it's the fun of it all
[2:56:47.740 --> 2:56:54.740]  Everywhere I go, because every day in an airport or something I see newspapers
[2:56:54.740 --> 2:57:02.740]  And just looking at them, it's like seeing a dinosaur still alive, but in its death rows, it's very rare to see
[2:57:02.740 --> 2:57:05.740]  Kind of like in the old days, 100 years ago, seeing a steam locomotive was probably commonplace
[2:57:05.740 --> 2:57:09.740]  You see one now, you go see it, it's a big event
[2:57:09.740 --> 2:57:14.740]  A couple big steam engines came into Austin a few years ago, I took my kids down to see them, they were amazing things
[2:57:14.740 --> 2:57:22.740]  But these aren't steam engines, these are facsimiles of the old media we had that was competitive that told the truth
[2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:25.740]  That did a lot of things, it was a mixed bag
[2:57:25.740 --> 2:57:30.740]  This new media, we've had the last 30 years, is completely compromised and sold out
[2:57:30.740 --> 2:57:38.740]  But I was walking last night, we did a live video at the news museum, or the news museum, I don't know how to pronounce it
[2:57:38.740 --> 2:57:41.740]  Newseum, the news museum here in DC
[2:57:41.740 --> 2:57:48.740]  And outside they've got like, I don't know, 30 or more everyday frames outside, like movie posters
[2:57:48.740 --> 2:57:52.740]  But inside is the front page of a paper, thank you Buckley has the call system up
[2:57:52.740 --> 2:57:57.740]  And so I walked down and looked at about 20 or the 30 or so
[2:57:57.740 --> 2:58:02.740]  And even though it was mainstream news, you could see here and there everywhere, by their panicking
[2:58:02.740 --> 2:58:08.740]  Trump is about to repeal a whole bunch of gun laws, before he's even in office, they've got the bills in
[2:58:08.740 --> 2:58:12.740]  Obamacare is set to be repealed, they've got the votes, they were told they were totally invincible
[2:58:12.740 --> 2:58:16.740]  And now, look at the cover of the Washington Post
[2:58:16.740 --> 2:58:25.740]  Congress moves to quash DC laws, GOP back legislation would repeal gun rules and ban funding of abortions
[2:58:25.740 --> 2:58:30.740]  Yeah, just say what you want about abortion, I shouldn't have to pay for your birth control
[2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:34.740]  You want to say it's birth control? Okay, you pay for it, you want to cut your penis off?
[2:58:34.740 --> 2:58:38.740]  That's your business, go out back and do it with the chainsaw, I ain't paying for it, got it Jack?
[2:58:38.740 --> 2:58:41.740]  You want to put your arm in the woodchipper, do it!
[2:58:41.740 --> 2:58:44.740]  You want to blow your head off, hey I'm all into freedom, do it!
[2:58:44.740 --> 2:58:55.740]  I ain't paying for the bullets or your burial!
[2:59:14.740 --> 2:59:30.740]  The backpack body armor is only $200
[2:59:30.740 --> 2:59:35.740]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable
[2:59:35.740 --> 2:59:37.740]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it
[2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:44.740]  Again, fund the info or kit the game changing in nanotech boobs, it's a win-win, $200
[2:59:44.740 --> 3:00:10.740]  Go check out all their different products at infoorstore.com, it's amazing
[3:00:10.740 --> 3:00:36.740]  Go check out all their different products at infoorstore.com
[3:00:36.740 --> 3:00:41.740]  And they said, we're environmentalists, we don't want anybody to have prosperity but us
[3:00:41.740 --> 3:00:45.740]  We want you to be poor, and that went over like a lead balloon, didn't it?
[3:00:45.740 --> 3:00:51.740]  And now all over the world from Australia to the UK, from Italy to Brazil to the United States
[3:00:51.740 --> 3:00:56.740]  Nationalist governments are getting elected and the globalist, Biden was just in a debauchery state and said
[3:00:56.740 --> 3:01:02.740]  Our democratic world government is collapsing, it's not democratic dumbass, we don't want it
[3:01:02.740 --> 3:01:06.740]  And we're sick of you, and now we're Russian agents, first it was racist
[3:01:06.740 --> 3:01:15.740]  Anthony Cumia, one of the top talk shows in the country, also fired off Sirius XM for just calling cop attackers animals
[3:01:15.740 --> 3:01:20.740]  I don't care if they're black or white, they're just animals randomly attacking the knockout game
[3:01:20.740 --> 3:01:23.740]  The KKK dragged some black guy to death, they're animals
[3:01:23.740 --> 3:01:27.740]  That's animalistic behavior, got fired from his top red show
[3:01:27.740 --> 3:01:33.740]  So I'm so glad he's got his big last year hit network himself with Gavin McGinnis and so many others
[3:01:33.740 --> 3:01:38.740]  Compoundmedia.com, and he's such a good sport, he's happy for us
[3:01:38.740 --> 3:01:43.740]  Everything gets behind here with the traffic in DC to have Roger Stone on in about 20, 30 minutes
[3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:50.740]  We're going to ride shotgun with Anthony here today, but I'm going to try to be a good guy and not be too OCD about dominating everything
[3:01:50.740 --> 3:01:54.740]  But it's not an arrogance when I dominate, I'm like a little kid obsessed with his hand up
[3:01:54.740 --> 3:02:00.740]  Because Cumia especially will say something I agree with, I'm like, that's true, it's absolutely right, let me back that up until he can't even talk
[3:02:00.740 --> 3:02:06.740]  But Anthony just epic things happening, but now they're all the news going, what if a nuke goes off, what about drones?
[3:02:06.740 --> 3:02:12.740]  Obama will appoint a new leadership, I'm really worried these Democrats aren't showing up because maybe they know something's going to happen
[3:02:12.740 --> 3:02:19.740]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, I'm saying they look really suspicious, so hopefully whatever they're planning they decide to not do it
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:25.740]  Because after all they've said killing, impeaching, I mean this is a frothing group of butthurt losers
[3:02:25.740 --> 3:02:33.740]  What, you're a smart guy, what do your guts tell you? What do your spidey senses tell you as a homeless security helicopter flies by?
[3:02:33.740 --> 3:02:43.740]  Alex first, how you doing? Always a pleasure to join you down there in Washington, it's a ballsy move, I've got to give it to you
[3:02:43.740 --> 3:02:52.740]  Because I don't know what's going on, I've had so many friends that have said Obama's not giving up the reins, not giving up the reins
[3:02:52.740 --> 3:02:59.740]  We're less than 24 hours away from Trump being inaugurated as the new president of these United States
[3:02:59.740 --> 3:03:13.740]  And still, you can't get it out of your head that something's amiss, something's up, and CNN actually saying assassinating Trump could keep Obama administration in power
[3:03:13.740 --> 3:03:32.740]  What type of inciting is that? Could you imagine if a Republican had said something like that when Obama was ready to take the reins that perhaps killing him might, we might be able to continue having the administration
[3:03:32.740 --> 3:03:40.740]  That person's career would be over, but instead no, they just get rewarded, I mean look at Brian Williams is back on TV telling us about fake news
[3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:48.740]  It's astounding to me that they were able to, that they're still on the air
[3:03:48.740 --> 3:03:57.740]  You brought up a great point just before about the newspapers and how archaic it looks when you pass by a news stand
[3:03:57.740 --> 3:04:09.740]  It's like seeing a pony express rider out front, it's archaic, it's done, they just don't know to go to the elephant graveyard and lay down yet
[3:04:09.740 --> 3:04:18.740]  This past campaign showed everybody, some people that had been in the business and been in media kind of knew that the jig was up
[3:04:18.740 --> 3:04:30.740]  We had been bamboozled by the media for years and years, but this past campaign that we saw, they couldn't get it out enough to people that they are liars
[3:04:30.740 --> 3:04:36.740]  They are in collusion with people that serve their agenda and we watched it happen
[3:04:36.740 --> 3:04:43.740]  So the fact that they're still on the air thinking they have any credibility, I'm amazed by it
[3:04:43.740 --> 3:04:49.740]  They're collusional Anthony Cummings, stay there as I'm buzzed by Homeland Security helicopters, protecting us from the Soros terrorists
[3:04:49.740 --> 3:04:58.740]  I'm going to come back and I interrupt you, you want to get back to the COG, CNN salivating, what if Trump's killed? That's the way to fix it, we'll talk about that
[3:04:58.740 --> 3:05:06.740]  Well the man that was arrested for threatening to kill Donald Trump online, get this folks, he was in fact a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton
[3:05:06.740 --> 3:05:12.740]  Now this was reported by the Daily Mail and it's up on our website, this man once gave 20 grand of the DNC, not surprising
[3:05:12.740 --> 3:05:18.740]  He was arrested by the Miami Beach Police on Tuesday of this week for threatening President-elect Trump online
[3:05:18.740 --> 3:05:24.740]  Turns out he's a member of a prominent Northeast family that's close to the Clintons, giving that whopping money
[3:05:24.740 --> 3:05:32.740]  His name Dominic Papulo Jr, he's 51 years old, he's sat near Hillary Clinton when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother
[3:05:32.740 --> 3:05:35.740]  Who died on one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11
[3:05:35.740 --> 3:05:42.740]  Now during the eulogy on October 6, 2001 in Boston, Hillary Clinton actually referred to him as a computer wizard
[3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:48.740]  He's now being held of course in the Miami-Dade County Jail after using Twitter to threaten the life of Donald Trump
[3:05:48.740 --> 3:05:55.740]  It was scheduled to be sworn in this week in Washington DC, the remains incarcerated on the charge of threatening to harm a public servant
[3:05:55.740 --> 3:06:19.740]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com
[3:06:25.740 --> 3:06:36.740]  It's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts
[3:06:36.740 --> 3:06:42.740]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing, they're in full crisis mode, nationals movements are exploding
[3:06:42.740 --> 3:06:46.740]  Everybody needs to go pre-order, so you get it first at InfowarsStore.com

[3:07:54.740 --> 3:08:20.740]  We're calling toll 3-888-253-3139
[3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:29.740]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar
[3:08:29.740 --> 3:08:35.740]  And by the way, this is something on my list, I went to do it months ago
[3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:39.740]  When I get back, I'm cutting liners, I'm writing them for a voiceover guy
[3:08:39.740 --> 3:08:44.740]  For Anthony Kumiya, for the other guest host, the host of the show like Paul Watson and others
[3:08:44.740 --> 3:08:52.740]  And now, Alex Jones, but here's Anthony Kumiya, but hey, so many times, Trailblazers, Mavericks, all of us in the Liberty Movement
[3:08:52.740 --> 3:08:57.740]  We're busy just launching the show before we even get around to dolling it up and packaging it properly
[3:08:57.740 --> 3:09:01.740]  And people know that, we're just in a fight here, but it's good to win
[3:09:01.740 --> 3:09:06.740]  My whole life, I've experienced that when I fight back, I tend to win, I lay down and always lose
[3:09:06.740 --> 3:09:14.740]  I mean, it was Vince Lombardi that said that, I'm probably going to butcher it, but winners never quit and quitters never win, or is that backwards?
[3:09:14.740 --> 3:09:20.740]  Quitters never win and winners never lose, I mean, how do you say it? Let's pull up the Vince Lombardi quote
[3:09:20.740 --> 3:09:26.740]  Winners never quit and quitters never win, no, it's, that's right, but I mean, it's totally true
[3:09:26.740 --> 3:09:33.740]  And again, the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, they've gone from calling us racists to homophobes
[3:09:33.740 --> 3:09:39.740]  And now we're Russian agents, now Maxine Waters literally said this week, we played the clip like five times, maybe we can cue that up next
[3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:46.740]  And says, we need to impeach him because Putin tells him dirt crooked Hillary, that's where that came from
[3:09:46.740 --> 3:09:50.740]  No one believes that, we all know Hillary's crooked
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:57.740]  I mean, Anthony, did you know that when you come up with a clever point, or I do, that that came directly from Vladimir Putin?
[3:09:57.740 --> 3:10:03.740]  Yeah, I got a direct line like the hotline in my house whenever I need to come up with some dirt on somebody
[3:10:03.740 --> 3:10:13.740]  If anyone needed dirt to come up with dirt for Hillary Clinton and needed to go to an outside source, you've been blind for decades
[3:10:13.740 --> 3:10:22.740]  They are the most corrupt, crooked people that have ever had that level of power in this country
[3:10:22.740 --> 3:10:32.740]  Just the fact, this should prove to everybody, the fact that the Clinton Global Initiative was shut down because she has nothing left to sell
[3:10:32.740 --> 3:10:39.740]  She didn't win the election, do you think if she was elected president that the Clinton Global Initiative would have shut down?
[3:10:39.740 --> 3:10:46.740]  Or would more money have been pouring in from foreign entities that wanted access to the United States government?
[3:10:46.740 --> 3:10:50.740]  That's exactly what the CGI is doing
[3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:54.740]  By the way, I heard you a month ago when you were doing the show here on the broadcast
[3:10:54.740 --> 3:11:01.740]  You said, watch this, now that she has nothing to sell, watch how fast that thing implodes and the money stops rolling in
[3:11:01.740 --> 3:11:06.740]  And that's that angle I hadn't really thought about, you're absolutely right, I mean the party is over
[3:11:06.740 --> 3:11:14.740]  It happens so quickly too, like they don't even wait till the new presidents inaugurate it to shut this thing down
[3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:20.740]  Because it must have just been oozing money without any more coming in, because again, she's got nothing to sell
[3:11:20.740 --> 3:11:27.740]  And they announced the shutdown last week, do you see that as kind of a capitulation that they may not try to steal it now that they finally gave up?
[3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:37.740]  I don't put anything past them, the entire term of Donald Trump, they are going to try whatever they can to get him out of office
[3:11:37.740 --> 3:11:46.740]  To bring his credibility down, whatever accomplishments he makes, they will label it as racist, sexist, homophobe, whatever it is
[3:11:46.740 --> 3:11:53.740]  We've seen this happen, how many of these politicians, Democratic politicians aren't showing up at the inauguration?
[3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:56.740]  It was 50 this morning, then 60, now it's 70 something
[3:11:56.740 --> 3:12:05.740]  70 something, these are people that when they're campaigning they say, we're for everybody, we're all inclusive
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:12.740]  We're not Democrats and Republicans, we're Americans, and meanwhile they are coming out
[3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:13.740]  When they go low, we go high
[3:12:13.740 --> 3:12:22.740]  Right, right, and now like children, they're not showing up at someone's party because they don't agree with what they said in class
[3:12:22.740 --> 3:12:26.740]  And they're setting a press for that that's never been done, now let's go back as I interrupt you at the start of the first segment
[3:12:26.740 --> 3:12:33.740]  We're co-hosting here, Paul does for interrupting, Anthony Cumia, compoundmedia.com is gracious enough to co-host with us
[3:12:33.740 --> 3:12:44.740]  Anthony, you were getting into the whole COG, the death threats, CNN salivating, other papers salivating, truck bombs, nukes, drones don't go, run for the hills
[3:12:44.740 --> 3:12:49.740]  I mean, it's bare minimum a bomb threat, bare minimum they're trying to scare people away
[3:12:49.740 --> 3:12:53.740]  Yeah, absolutely, bare minimum they're trying to scare people away
[3:12:53.740 --> 3:13:00.740]  Another thing, I don't understand how CNN gets away with inciting people
[3:13:00.740 --> 3:13:07.740]  This sounds like, they know the desperation in some of these people to not have Trump be president
[3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:12.740]  They've hyped this desperation, they've hyped this that Hitler has taken over
[3:13:12.740 --> 3:13:22.740]  Right, and then to say, hey, and by the way, if he's killed, we don't even have to deal with Pence or anybody
[3:13:22.740 --> 3:13:28.740]  It goes back to one of Obama's people, how is that not criminal at this point
[3:13:28.740 --> 3:13:33.740]  I agree, just by the way, if he was dead, we're still in charge
[3:13:33.740 --> 3:13:36.740]  Who's gonna rid me of this problem?
[3:13:36.740 --> 3:13:44.740]  Yeah, that's it, just put the word out to the multitude of lunatics that we've seen protesting and demonstrating
[3:13:44.740 --> 3:13:50.740]  And the celebrities that we've seen trying to get everything from the initial campaign
[3:13:50.740 --> 3:13:58.740]  I mean, I agree, I've had really creepy people come up to me at restaurants on the street who look completely whacked out
[3:13:58.740 --> 3:14:01.740]  Going, you're really happy aren't you, you think you're with him, watch what happens
[3:14:01.740 --> 3:14:07.740]  I'm like, whoa dude, these people look, I'm sorry, but why are they so buttered, and they get back to the celebrities
[3:14:07.740 --> 3:14:13.740]  Yeah, the celebrities, they tried to stop Trump right from the beginning
[3:14:13.740 --> 3:14:16.740]  And then after he's elected, they try to go to the electors
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:28.740]  And then after the electors, they try to go to, like I honestly believe someone's gonna rush and try to pull the Bible out from under his hand during the swearing in
[3:14:28.740 --> 3:14:36.740]  It's gotten that bad, and they won't stop, that's what it is, they are so psychotic
[3:14:36.740 --> 3:14:43.740]  They don't understand that this is our president, this is the way our country works, and you have to accept it
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:46.740]  We are incapable of accepting this
[3:14:46.740 --> 3:14:51.740]  And by the way you brought this up, it should be illegal, you know, to be doing what they're doing
[3:14:51.740 --> 3:14:58.740]  What about Soros openly funding all these groups that say, quote, they're gonna shut it down and block the White House and keep the inaugurations from happening
[3:14:58.740 --> 3:15:01.740]  That's not free speech, I'm a big free speech advocate as you are
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:06.740]  That's calling to shut down all of our free speech and our right to go to the inauguration
[3:15:06.740 --> 3:15:09.740]  Absolutely, of course we're free speech advocates
[3:15:09.740 --> 3:15:14.740]  I mean, we've paid a price for free speech here
[3:15:14.740 --> 3:15:22.740]  But they don't understand that there is inciting, there are certain, you can't just say anything without consequence
[3:15:22.740 --> 3:15:25.740]  And that should be criminal
[3:15:25.740 --> 3:15:32.740]  People that assume that the right and Republicans, they're so racist and terrible
[3:15:32.740 --> 3:15:39.740]  Obama went through eight years without a serious threat to his life
[3:15:39.740 --> 3:15:44.740]  There have been the nutcases that ran into the White House and over the fence and whatnot
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:46.740]  But no one took a pot shot at him or anything
[3:15:46.740 --> 3:15:56.740]  I am in fear for Donald Trump, because this left, these are people that are out of their minds that cannot accept losing
[3:15:56.740 --> 3:16:03.740]  And I totally agree with you that if the media keeps hyping this, I mean, I'd give it a 100% chance the next four years
[3:16:03.740 --> 3:16:05.740]  There's gonna be a major assassination attempt
[3:16:05.740 --> 3:16:12.740]  We already saw at least two, once where the guy got arrested with the gun in Nevada trying to shoot Trump who came in from England
[3:16:12.740 --> 3:16:15.740]  I mean, you know, it's gonna be on their hands if they kill Trump
[3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:18.740]  And listen, we're not like the left, we're not gonna go out and burn cities
[3:16:18.740 --> 3:16:23.740]  We're going to politically but also criminally come after the people that are responsible for it
[3:16:23.740 --> 3:16:27.740]  I'm just warning the left, they keep wanting to start a fight with a sleeping giant
[3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:31.740]  I mean, don't they know that it's libertarians and right-wingers and patriots that do the hanging?
[3:16:31.740 --> 3:16:35.740]  I mean, do they think they're playing games with the average trendy here?
[3:16:35.740 --> 3:16:39.740]  I mean, we don't want to crush them, but if they really try to have a war with us, it's illegitimate
[3:16:39.740 --> 3:16:42.740]  We're gonna kick their ass up and down the street
[3:16:42.740 --> 3:16:47.740]  Absolutely, I don't think they understand that
[3:16:47.740 --> 3:16:56.740]  Some of the least educated people I've ever seen, they believe they're educated because they go to these indoctrination centers that are colleges
[3:16:56.740 --> 3:17:00.740]  But they know nothing of the system, the way it works, the way it's supposed to work
[3:17:00.740 --> 3:17:05.740]  They know nothing of the Constitution and our rights as American citizens
[3:17:05.740 --> 3:17:12.740]  So when they lose, they're so used to not losing, growing up getting participation trophies and all that
[3:17:12.740 --> 3:17:17.740]  They strike out like children
[3:17:17.740 --> 3:17:24.740]  That's a good point, maybe Trump should give Hillary and the Democrats at the inauguration a participation trophy
[3:17:24.740 --> 3:17:31.740]  They don't understand what it's like to lose gracefully
[3:17:31.740 --> 3:17:35.740]  People, hey, we win and lose through life, that's how it goes
[3:17:35.740 --> 3:17:44.740]  You could be pissed as all hell, very angry, but you have to show some grace, especially at that level
[3:17:44.740 --> 3:17:52.740]  And what we're seeing in these Democratic politicians that aren't gonna show up at the inauguration is just more divisiveness
[3:17:52.740 --> 3:18:00.740]  They say that the country is so divided and they blamed it for years on the right and the Republicans and their racism
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:07.740]  And meanwhile, they're showing a complete lack of interest to get everyone back together
[3:18:07.740 --> 3:18:13.740]  Tim, I totally agree with you, I want to take some calls, I'm gonna skip this network break so we have more time here with you today
[3:18:13.740 --> 3:18:19.740]  But after we take some of these calls from Charles and Cisco and Jimmy and Jim and Mark and others that we're about to go to
[3:18:19.740 --> 3:18:21.740]  So get ready, callers
[3:18:21.740 --> 3:18:26.740]  And as soon as Roger Stogan's on the show, I want to ask you, what else are you looking at?
[3:18:26.740 --> 3:18:31.740]  What else are you concerned about? Because, you know, I can laugh at the leftist and how weird they are
[3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:39.740]  But it also makes me feel sad for my country that this many people are truly, people I've known that are liberal, that I've been friends with
[3:18:39.740 --> 3:18:42.740]  And I tolerated them, they tolerated me, they just said, look, I'm not your friend anymore
[3:18:42.740 --> 3:18:48.740]  They are, and it's the same thing with my wife, you know, they are so, so upset about all this
[3:18:48.740 --> 3:18:53.740]  What do you say to them? I mean, how do you get through to them? Because it's like they're in a cult
[3:18:53.740 --> 3:18:58.740]  And anybody who's ever had family or friends that got into a cult, and I've actually known folks that have been in a cult
[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:03.740]  You just like they're gone, you can't get through to them, I mean, what do we do?
[3:19:03.740 --> 3:19:10.740]  It's, I don't think, it's gotten worse over the course of the campaign and the election and now
[3:19:10.740 --> 3:19:14.740]  It's built up ahead of steam, because these, I know exactly what you're talking about
[3:19:14.740 --> 3:19:20.740]  I deal with them on Facebook and other social media every day, and they can't grasp it
[3:19:20.740 --> 3:19:23.740]  And there's no explaining it to them
[3:19:23.740 --> 3:19:28.740]  I was very proud today watching Trump and his family get off of Air Force Two
[3:19:28.740 --> 3:19:33.740]  And you felt like a new era was coming to America
[3:19:33.740 --> 3:19:35.740]  We're gonna skip this break, guys
[3:19:35.740 --> 3:19:37.740]  Sorry, they didn't have a risk of this break
[3:19:37.740 --> 3:19:39.740]  Continue, continue, Anthony
[3:19:39.740 --> 3:19:44.740]  They just don't understand that, and you can't show them and say, look, give this a chance
[3:19:44.740 --> 3:19:46.740]  It looks like it's gonna be pretty good for the country
[3:19:46.740 --> 3:19:50.740]  They are so alien from losing that they can't deal with it
[3:19:50.740 --> 3:19:52.740]  And let's talk about that
[3:19:52.740 --> 3:19:55.740]  Okay, he's been president elect for roughly seven weeks
[3:19:55.740 --> 3:19:58.740]  Trillion, two hundred plus million is poured into the stock market
[3:19:58.740 --> 3:20:02.740]  Chrysler, Ford are announcing a whole bunch of other factories
[3:20:02.740 --> 3:20:06.740]  The Alibaba is announcing a million jobs
[3:20:06.740 --> 3:20:09.740]  Fifty billion in Japanese funding
[3:20:09.740 --> 3:20:12.740]  And all the new steel mills together, it's another hundred billion
[3:20:12.740 --> 3:20:16.740]  We're talking about almost a trillion and a half dollars
[3:20:16.740 --> 3:20:20.740]  And almost a half trillion of its real jobs, real money, not just stock market money
[3:20:20.740 --> 3:20:24.740]  This is unprecedented, in fact, I'm kind of scared it's so exuberant
[3:20:24.740 --> 3:20:28.740]  People are so sick of hearing how business is over, we're a joke, Chinese century, blah, blah, blah
[3:20:28.740 --> 3:20:30.740]  I mean, this is crazy
[3:20:30.740 --> 3:20:33.740]  They're even trying to raise interest rates to stifle what Trump's doing
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:38.740]  And it's not working, so it's almost like he's got the mightest touch
[3:20:38.740 --> 3:20:42.740]  I mean, this is biblical, I'm flipping out here
[3:20:42.740 --> 3:20:46.740]  This is before he's even president
[3:20:46.740 --> 3:20:52.740]  That's really the kicker here is I've never seen a president work this hard
[3:20:52.740 --> 3:20:56.740]  That's what I mean, you said it looks good, that's what I mean
[3:20:56.740 --> 3:20:59.740]  I mean, people don't know this, but Trump's making, I like to feel special
[3:20:59.740 --> 3:21:02.740]  But Trump's making hundreds of phone calls a day
[3:21:02.740 --> 3:21:08.740]  To business, academia, industry, saying, bet on America, believe on America, I'm gonna cut the taxes, it's gonna work
[3:21:08.740 --> 3:21:15.740]  We've done it before, no one's ever done this, the guy works till, I know people that get calls from Trump at 1 a.m. about business
[3:21:15.740 --> 3:21:17.740]  Business people have called me that have major companies
[3:21:17.740 --> 3:21:20.740]  And I mean, I personally, how the hell does the guy have time to call me routinely?
[3:21:20.740 --> 3:21:24.740]  And he's actually following the show, I don't want to make the media have a heyday here
[3:21:24.740 --> 3:21:26.740]  But he listens late at night, in between phone calls
[3:21:26.740 --> 3:21:29.740]  What do you, I mean, that is an incredible person right there
[3:21:29.740 --> 3:21:34.740]  I mean, I don't want to sit there and bow down to him, but this is almost like too good to be true
[3:21:34.740 --> 3:21:40.740]  We have never seen a president like this because we have never seen a president that hasn't been a politician
[3:21:40.740 --> 3:21:50.740]  This guy enjoys work, he's built a name brand and an empire because of his work ethic
[3:21:50.740 --> 3:21:55.740]  That's it, in fact, I've been told people that really know him well, he relishes sitting down with 100 names in front of him
[3:21:55.740 --> 3:21:59.740]  And literally licks his lips while he makes the phone calls
[3:21:59.740 --> 3:22:01.740]  I mean, that's like Superman
[3:22:01.740 --> 3:22:12.740]  Isn't this the kind of, we've spoken for years with friends and relatives about boy, how come we can't get a president who's a successful guy
[3:22:12.740 --> 3:22:22.740]  Why do they always have to come from these group of people that are lifetime politicians that work their way up by doing favors and payouts and cronyism
[3:22:22.740 --> 3:22:30.740]  Exactly, and by the way, he's got, he's got like the Ivy League degrees, but he admittedly disdains them because he says they never really worked
[3:22:30.740 --> 3:22:34.740]  They just live off family money, and he's going back 40 years, and I've done my research
[3:22:34.740 --> 3:22:42.740]  He's a guy that loves to go barbecue with a construction crew and cook steaks and stay up at night after they work
[3:22:42.740 --> 3:22:45.740]  He's just a regular guy, and that's what they're so scared of
[3:22:45.740 --> 3:22:50.740]  A regular guy who loves energy and loves to win
[3:22:50.740 --> 3:22:54.740]  He respects the working man is what it is
[3:22:54.740 --> 3:22:57.740]  The working man is, put him where he is
[3:22:57.740 --> 3:23:05.740]  He understands delegating responsibility to get these amazing structures built
[3:23:05.740 --> 3:23:15.740]  I never saw him swing a hammer, I've never seen Donald Trump swing a hammer, but he knows how to put people in charge that build these amazing architectural wonders
[3:23:15.740 --> 3:23:19.740]  And he always builds them, you know, under budget and had a schedule
[3:23:19.740 --> 3:23:24.740]  And we clamored for years, why can't we get a guy like this?
[3:23:24.740 --> 3:23:31.740]  Well, here he is, you got him, and there's an element in this country that just does not want to see him succeed
[3:23:31.740 --> 3:23:34.740]  Doesn't even want to see him try to succeed
[3:23:34.740 --> 3:23:39.740]  I agree, I want to go to calls, let me ask you this, what about the arrogance that Obama is Newsweek in time
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:49.740]  Teaching him the survival guide and trying to help him not crash things, and oh, Trump's not qualified, but Obama, a social worker, a community organizer
[3:23:49.740 --> 3:23:56.740]  Like Al Sharpton, I mean, a literal nobody, given his degrees by the CIA, and I've had former high-level CIA on him
[3:23:56.740 --> 3:24:01.740]  Obama's literally given his degrees, he's a total cutout, a pothead, I'm not going to give people the smug pot
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:05.740]  But we've got a pothead guy giving all these CIA commander positions
[3:24:05.740 --> 3:24:10.740]  And then he's just given the presidency and couldn't find his way out of a wet paper bag
[3:24:10.740 --> 3:24:13.740]  And then the media says he's qualified, but Trump isn't
[3:24:13.740 --> 3:24:19.740]  Oh, he's the guy, well, he's already, you know, he's Jesus and Elvis and everything wrapped into one
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:23.740]  So, of course, he's needed to help Trump
[3:24:23.740 --> 3:24:29.740]  Hey, here's your gold watch, go take a hike, you're done, Trump's coming in
[3:24:29.740 --> 3:24:40.740]  Obama, actually, this just came in on my phone, it was last act, Obama cut short sentences of another 330 drug offenders
[3:24:40.740 --> 3:24:46.740]  Now, this sounds all nice when they say nonviolent drug offenders, that's what they were convicted of
[3:24:46.740 --> 3:24:48.740]  These come from people
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:53.740]  He's just doing it as a feel-good stunt, he expands fine on the people while he brings in the jihadis
[3:24:53.740 --> 3:25:00.740]  And then he lets mentally ill Chelsea Manning out, fine, the whole point is to make him look good, it's just a stunt
[3:25:00.740 --> 3:25:12.740]  This is, if you remember during Desert Storm, this is the same tactic the Iraqi army used of setting the oil fields on fire
[3:25:12.740 --> 3:25:15.740]  He wants to leave...
[3:25:15.740 --> 3:25:19.740]  That's what opening the borders up is exactly, it's scorched earth
[3:25:19.740 --> 3:25:30.740]  Scorched earth policy, exactly, he wants to leave disaster in his wake so that whoever comes in after him can't possibly do the amazing job he did
[3:25:30.740 --> 3:25:34.740]  And by the way, I've got to say this, Anthony, I am shocked, we're going to go to one call before break
[3:25:34.740 --> 3:25:41.740]  I can't believe how open the scorched earth is, I can't believe Obama's getting away with this, I think that's a scandal in and of itself
[3:25:41.740 --> 3:25:47.740]  I mean, he's openly trying to wreck this country, why do you think Obama was given everything in this country and then he hates it so much?
[3:25:47.740 --> 3:25:49.740]  I mean, what is his problem?
[3:25:49.740 --> 3:26:02.740]  Well, I've read quite a few things about how influenced he was by his father, who was such an anti-colonialism and anti-democracy guy
[3:26:02.740 --> 3:26:06.740]  And that influence, I believe, made Obama...
[3:26:06.740 --> 3:26:14.740]  Sure, I mean, whether it's the fake Kenyan dad who was a communist economist, and it did do that, or Frank Marshall Davis who was the head of the Communist Party in Hawaii
[3:26:14.740 --> 3:26:19.740]  Either way, you slice it, you're right, both of his dads, he said Frank Marshall Davis was like his adopted dad, probably the real one
[3:26:19.740 --> 3:26:20.740]  Right
[3:26:20.740 --> 3:26:22.740]  Then there's the other, both dads were communist scumbags
[3:26:22.740 --> 3:26:34.740]  Communist scumbags and every other influence in his life had been these militant preachers and other people that have influenced him to hate the United States of America
[3:26:34.740 --> 3:26:39.740]  Hate the power and influence it had over the world and try to bring that down
[3:26:39.740 --> 3:26:47.740]  And when you have the press kissing your ass like that and not calling you out on what you're doing, you pretty much have free reign
[3:26:47.740 --> 3:26:55.740]  But it's a new era, we aren't just puppets to the media anymore, sitting there hypnotized by mainstream media anymore
[3:26:55.740 --> 3:26:59.740]  There's other places to go, InfoWars, Compound Media
[3:26:59.740 --> 3:27:00.740]  Compoundmedia.com
[3:27:00.740 --> 3:27:03.740]  Where people can get information and decide
[3:27:03.740 --> 3:27:11.740]  Anthony, do you think their acceleration of arrogance accelerated the half-life on them and the fact that they went rotten so fast?
[3:27:11.740 --> 3:27:15.740]  I think MSN could have gone a few more years, they'd have been halfway fair with this election
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:20.740]  I think they accelerated their demise and really shot their blood, blew their feet off
[3:27:20.740 --> 3:27:28.740]  They couldn't, they had no other choice, with the likes of Donald Trump gaining that head of steam he was during the campaign
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:31.740]  They had to pull out the stops, they had to weigh it and say
[3:27:31.740 --> 3:27:37.740]  Okay, do we just try to still bamboozle the people and subtly hit him with things?
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:45.740]  Or we gotta pull out all the stops and ops absolutely show we're in collusion with the Democrats and the Liberals
[3:27:45.740 --> 3:27:53.740]  And just hope for the best and they pulled out all the stops, Trump still won and their credibility is zero
[3:27:53.740 --> 3:27:55.740]  That's right, they hail married
[3:27:55.740 --> 3:27:58.740]  When they talk about polls, I laugh now
[3:27:58.740 --> 3:28:04.740]  They're actually showing the poll? Are you crazy? No one believes them anymore?
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:08.740]  Oh another like, Trump isn't popular in polls and on the street he's totally popular
[3:28:08.740 --> 3:28:12.740]  But I mean, I wasn't allowed to talk about this, I was talking to major pollsters, not just some of the Trump people
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:17.740]  They're like, yeah, no, Trump's gonna say that the polls are fake because he's 20 points ahead in these polls and 15 in these
[3:28:17.740 --> 3:28:21.740]  I'm like, yeah, I'm talking to pollsters, they say they just don't publish it
[3:28:21.740 --> 3:28:25.740]  The Republican Party, Democratic Party who traditionally bought the polls, there's always been problems
[3:28:25.740 --> 3:28:30.740]  When they got together and just agreed like a year before the election, we're gonna work together to stop Trump
[3:28:30.740 --> 3:28:38.740]  And it's the collusion, and then meanwhile, oh, he loses, people go, oh wait, the polls said it's total crap
[3:28:38.740 --> 3:28:45.740]  We're gonna go to break with Anthony Comey, I promise to come back and at least talk to Charles, Cisco, Jim, Mark and a few others
[3:28:45.740 --> 3:28:50.740]  And then we'll find out what's going on with Roger who always shows up, we sent over for the interview, we don't know what's going on
[3:28:50.740 --> 3:28:59.740]  The highways are shut down, it's surreal, there's like some beautiful choir singing, so loud next door, I can barely hear myself
[3:28:59.740 --> 3:29:06.740]  They just stopped, there's helicopters circling the obelisk, this is either the new world or the end of the world, we're gonna cover it all
[3:29:06.740 --> 3:29:10.740]  But I gotta tell you, Compoundmedia.com, people ask, Alice, why do you have other house talk?
[3:29:10.740 --> 3:29:16.740]  Well, they have me on, I don't care, they're trying to shut down the media, two weeks ago Obama signed a bill
[3:29:16.740 --> 3:29:21.740]  To start shutting down independent media and have the FCC be over the internet
[3:29:21.740 --> 3:29:25.740]  So when we come back, I'm gonna ask Anthony Comey about that, I got banned by the FCC even more than Howard Stern
[3:29:25.740 --> 3:29:29.740]  I'm going from memory here, but Anthony, aren't you like one of the most banned people ever?
[3:29:29.740 --> 3:29:36.740]  Yeah, companies have paid fines, and yeah, they're not very happy with me because I do speak my mind
[3:29:36.740 --> 3:29:44.740]  Charles, that's a badge of honor, and so now they're announcing FCC over the internet, everything, I'm ignoring them, they're not real
[3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:47.740]  I'll do whatever I want, I mean this is total horse manure
[3:29:47.740 --> 3:30:16.740]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:30:16.740 --> 3:30:21.740]  This week for threatening President-elect Trump online, turns out he's a member of a prominent Northeast family
[3:30:21.740 --> 3:30:26.740]  That's close to the Clintons, giving that whopping money, and his name, Dominic Papulo Jr.
[3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:32.740]  He's 51 years old, he's sat near Hillary Clinton when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother
[3:30:32.740 --> 3:30:35.740]  Who died on one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11
[3:30:35.740 --> 3:30:42.740]  Now during the eulogy on October 6, 2001 in Boston, Hillary Clinton actually referred to him as a computer wizard
[3:30:42.740 --> 3:30:48.740]  He's now being held, of course, in the Miami-Dade County Jail after using Twitter to threaten the life of Donald Trump
[3:30:48.740 --> 3:30:51.740]  Now Trump is scheduled to be sworn in this week in Washington, D.C.
[3:30:51.740 --> 3:30:55.740]  Remains incarcerated on the charge of threatening to harm a public servant
[3:30:55.740 --> 3:31:24.740]  I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com
[3:31:25.740 --> 3:31:54.740]  On the web at InfowarsTeam.com
[3:31:54.740 --> 3:32:00.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the Inauguration Special
[3:32:00.740 --> 3:32:04.740]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the New Year
[3:32:04.740 --> 3:32:10.740]  I'm extending them as the Inauguration Special right through this weekend and then it's over
[3:32:10.740 --> 3:32:14.740]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing
[3:32:14.740 --> 3:32:17.740]  But many of these sales are going to have to come to an end
[3:32:17.740 --> 3:32:26.740]  If you want across-the-board massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like Rainforest 30% off and then 20% more in each bottle
[3:32:26.740 --> 3:32:30.740]  Supermobility 30% off, Survival Shield X2 30% off, here's the bottom line
[3:32:30.740 --> 3:32:34.740]  These are great products that have changed my life and changed some of the other people's lives
[3:32:34.740 --> 3:32:36.740]  Also, it funds the operation
[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:42.740]  This sale ends this weekend after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president
[3:32:42.740 --> 3:32:48.740]  InfowarsStore.com for InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free, triple-A, 253-3139
[3:32:48.740 --> 3:32:55.740]  Yet great products help fund the Infowar and celebrate the election of a populist, a champion against the New World Order
[3:32:55.740 --> 3:33:13.740]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Infowar
[3:33:13.740 --> 3:33:28.740]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studio, it's Alex Jones
[3:33:28.740 --> 3:33:44.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Here's the deal. MSM are such incredible drama queens. I want to ask Anthony Kumi about this. He's co-hosting with me right now from compoundmedia.com
[3:33:44.740 --> 3:33:51.740]  This guy, John Lewis, this congressman comes out who's just famously involved in all sorts of shenanigans
[3:33:51.740 --> 3:33:59.740]  And he says Donald Trump is illegitimate last Friday. He probably works for the Russians. The elections should be overturned. I'm boycotting the election
[3:33:59.740 --> 3:34:07.740]  Trump comes out and says, sir, you're in constituents living in really poor areas. I'd like to bring a factory there, which is just classic old-fashioned American politics
[3:34:07.740 --> 3:34:13.740]  Hey, let's work together. Let's try to get some money, you know, to your constituents. Not in payoffs, but in actual jobs
[3:34:13.740 --> 3:34:22.740]  And he goes, I do not respond to racist. And then they had other reports where they had the new head of the DNC or she's in the running on Fox News
[3:34:22.740 --> 3:34:32.740]  They're like, what about his plan for competition in drugs? It's estimated to drop him half in price. I don't respond to people that attack black leaders on Martin Luther King Day
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:38.740]  Like John Lewis. John Lewis attacks him on Friday. Martin Luther King Day is on Monday. What's it have to do with it? He's black
[3:34:38.740 --> 3:34:47.740]  I mean, he attacks Trump. I saw an editorial cartoon that actually showed like Lewis throws mud at him. Trump throws mud back. The media goes, oh, poor Lewis
[3:34:47.740 --> 3:34:55.740]  I mean, we're talking about the death of common sense here, Anthony. How in this world? That's part one. I'll give you time to answer this, but I'm ranting
[3:34:55.740 --> 3:35:04.740]  Part two is imagine if they passed a law that the right wing was going to shut down all the liberal media and they openly got up on the news and said it
[3:35:04.740 --> 3:35:13.740]  Whoever they listed would be cause celebs. It'd be, oh, this poor person is being banned. That poor person instead, they passed a law saying they're going to start banning independent media
[3:35:13.740 --> 3:35:21.740]  And the dinosaur media goes, this is wonderful. I mean, these are such discredited people and the good news is the population saw it. So can you comment on Lewis?
[3:35:21.740 --> 3:35:28.740]  Because I mean, Anthony, here it is. You kicked my ass. You're a big guy. But if I walked up and punched you in the nose and blooded it and then you hit me back
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:32.740]  Do I get to bitch and say, why did Anthony Cummings just punch me back?
[3:35:32.740 --> 3:35:50.740]  I guess if you're a liberal, yeah, because that's business as usual for them. As far as Lewis goes, he, the reverence people have to give him, no matter how nasty he is to anybody else, the preface, the prefaces
[3:35:50.740 --> 3:36:05.740]  Icon. Icon. Icon. Icon. Yeah, let me say first, he did such amazing work for civil rights over there. And then you have to talk about, oh, but he said this, that and the other thing.
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:24.740]  He is a guy that is another lifer that doesn't understand how the inner cities can be rescued rescued by jobs and perhaps some traditional family values. He instantly calls that racist.
[3:36:24.740 --> 3:36:33.740]  Well, that's business as usual. And as long as they adhere to that, we're going to see more murders in Chicago, more poverty and nothing.
[3:36:33.740 --> 3:36:43.740]  So let me ask you this then. I mean, of the swamp, who are the biggest swamp creatures? Because Hillary's kind of out of the swamp now. I mean, isn't it Nancy Pelosi? I mean, isn't John Lewis one of the main swamp creatures?
[3:36:43.740 --> 3:36:57.740]  Absolutely. Whenever he's, you know, I've seen him more sitting on the floor protesting than doing anything. He looks exactly like Admiral Ockbar from
[3:36:57.740 --> 3:37:18.740]  It's a trap. And I haven't seen or heard him do anything. It's ridiculous. Well, here's the deal. I've had my head split open before by people. It's like in 1965, his head was split.
[3:37:18.740 --> 3:37:30.740]  Amazingly, I walked around going, you can't argue with me. My head was split open. That's the end. They're old way of just saying they can't argue with something. They don't want to discuss it or debate it.
[3:37:30.740 --> 3:37:41.740]  Is to just call someone racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, whatever they want. And that's supposed to stop the argument. Well, that's done. That almost seems nostalgic now.
[3:37:41.740 --> 3:37:47.740]  So what do you think happens to Admiral Ockbar then? What's that? Admiral Ockbar. What happens to him? People like him?
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:38:01.740]  Oh, it's take the trash out. That's done. We're looking at a new thing. And they don't even know how to do it because Pelosi, they had that guy in Ohio that wanted to be a minority speaker.
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:08.740]  And they wouldn't even give him a chance. That's the same old garbage that they want to keep doing.
[3:38:08.740 --> 3:38:18.740]  Isn't that good for us to the Liberty Movement now that we have a big chance that we're faith? I mean, because if he's the swamp man, then the Nancy Pelosi literally looks like a cartoon insane bird.
[3:38:18.740 --> 3:38:29.740]  We know that little, I mean, he sounds like a complete lunatic. I'm sure you heard she said the Democrats didn't do anything wrong in this last election. Did you hear that? They just did a great job.
[3:38:29.740 --> 3:38:47.740]  Oh, yeah, bang up job. Well, that sure says something. They blame everyone except their lousy candidate, the fact that they exposed blatantly that they were in collusion with the mass media, and she was packed with scandal.
[3:38:47.740 --> 3:39:02.740]  But it's the Russians and racists that voted for Trump. I don't think it was one group of 20,000 people that were traveling around to every arena around the country going to see Donald Trump.
[3:39:02.740 --> 3:39:21.740]  Yet the polls told us that nobody was interested in his garbage and Hillary was going to pull this off in a landslide. So, you know, they lie to us and we're on to them now. That can't continue.
[3:39:21.740 --> 3:39:40.740]  I'm just telling me we're getting ready with Roger Stone. I want to go to a few calls. A great point here, but just separately briefly, and I've got to go to these calls. Sure. What do you make of them just briefly openly passing a law to put intelligence agencies quote over deciding what media we allow on air and claiming the FCC suddenly has total control.
[3:39:40.740 --> 3:39:45.740]  And even the deputy have the FCC says this is horrible. This is a takeover.
[3:39:45.740 --> 3:40:01.740]  Well, we've seen this happen before the second the people actually get a little bit of power in their hands and independent media that's separate from mainstream and doesn't have any favors to do for anybody else is dangerous.
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:17.740]  It's dangerous to them and they understand this and the only way to stop it is through horrid regulation of fees and taxes and other things that will put people out of business. That's how they deal with it. This is a threat to them.
[3:40:17.740 --> 3:40:30.740]  They don't like the fact that you're on here speaking the truth about things they want hidden. They don't like that. And, you know, at best, they'll regulate it at worse still do worse.
[3:40:30.740 --> 3:40:36.740]  You know this. Absolutely. All right. So we've got Anthony coming. Normally hosts a couple of times a month is a great job.
[3:40:36.740 --> 3:40:40.740]  We're going to bring more and more hosts on here to the operation we've launched.
[3:40:40.740 --> 3:40:47.740]  Obviously, I plan to probably have radio and TV live 10 hours a day by the end of next year with all these other great folks that are there.
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:51.740]  I don't care. I want to sound the cats and people promote their networks. We're all in this together.
[3:40:51.740 --> 3:41:00.740]  So this is a total fight for the Republic. I would love to be able to cut back to a weekend show and write a book once a year and spend time with my kids.
[3:41:00.740 --> 3:41:08.740]  You know how it is, Anthony. You either as a hardworking guy, you're either totally committed constantly like an insane person, 18 hours a day, you're out of the game.
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:15.740]  My problem is I'm either out of the game or I'm in the game and, you know, it's taking the toll. I'm not bitching. I mean, it's taking the toll.
[3:41:15.740 --> 3:41:22.740]  And I need and I can't get out of the game. I'm obsessed. It's crazy. I eat and sleep this stuff and I don't want to just get bigger and bigger.
[3:41:22.740 --> 3:41:28.740]  I want to get these people off my damn back, you know, and I know you're the same way. So that's why we're all working together.
[3:41:28.740 --> 3:41:44.740]  It's you're never off really. I mean, I'm constantly looking for stories, looking for, I'm pulling over everything from the lying mainstream media down to a blogger and disseminating the whole thing.
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:48.740]  You just get more and more pissed, though, as you have to decipher their crap all day.
[3:41:48.740 --> 3:41:55.740]  It's so obvious when you watch it that it's kind of a joke now, which is good because that exposes it to a lot more people.
[3:41:55.740 --> 3:42:10.740]  But when you see independent media and alternative media and whatnot and how much you get out of that and how deep they go into a story and then the surface glossing agenda driven crap that is on mainstream media.
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:14.740]  It exposes it that much more and that's what we need.
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:15.740]  Here's a quick example.
[3:42:15.740 --> 3:42:17.740]  Talk about sensational Roger Stone.
[3:42:17.740 --> 3:42:18.740]  It's hit with Polonium.
[3:42:18.740 --> 3:42:19.740]  He's really sick.
[3:42:19.740 --> 3:42:21.740]  And I guess right now I'm probably sick.
[3:42:21.740 --> 3:42:23.740]  That's bizarre, by the way.
[3:42:23.740 --> 3:42:31.740]  And then it turns out the British MI6 spy that was over living in Co.
[3:42:31.740 --> 3:42:34.740]  They got poisoned to death in England and was his handler.
[3:42:34.740 --> 3:42:41.740]  He's the guy that put out the PP gate dossier and I was already tying him to it before that even came out.
[3:42:41.740 --> 3:42:43.740]  How do you make that up, Anthony?
[3:42:43.740 --> 3:42:45.740]  You don't.
[3:42:45.740 --> 3:42:51.740]  If there's a connection, it means something.
[3:42:51.740 --> 3:42:55.740]  And that's an amazing connection.
[3:42:55.740 --> 3:42:57.740]  And again, so dangerous.
[3:42:57.740 --> 3:43:00.740]  I mean, these people are playing for keeps.
[3:43:00.740 --> 3:43:02.740]  This is dangerous stuff.
[3:43:02.740 --> 3:43:06.740]  You think you're just, you know, you go on on the air on a daily basis.
[3:43:06.740 --> 3:43:12.740]  You say some things, you expose something and then, you know, your life is being threatened.
[3:43:12.740 --> 3:43:14.740]  And I don't think they get this, Anthony.
[3:43:14.740 --> 3:43:18.740]  The real tough guys aren't looking for trouble and aren't starting fights, but we finish him.
[3:43:18.740 --> 3:43:23.740]  Don't they get that once they start this stuff, if they open up a whole Pandora's box with people.
[3:43:23.740 --> 3:43:25.740]  Let me tell you, people start poisoning my friends.
[3:43:25.740 --> 3:43:26.740]  It doesn't intimidate me.
[3:43:26.740 --> 3:43:27.740]  It makes me start thinking.
[3:43:27.740 --> 3:43:30.740]  It makes me start opening up areas of my mind.
[3:43:30.740 --> 3:43:32.740]  If they think I've been dangerous politically, just wait.
[3:43:32.740 --> 3:43:34.740]  I mean, I mean, you get what I'm saying here.
[3:43:34.740 --> 3:43:38.740]  Yeah, it's not going to, first of all, it's not going to garner any sympathy from people.
[3:43:38.740 --> 3:43:40.740]  That's for sure, for their cause.
[3:43:40.740 --> 3:43:42.740]  And yet it motivates people.
[3:43:42.740 --> 3:43:45.740]  It motivates like-minded people.
[3:43:45.740 --> 3:43:59.740]  And like you said earlier, our side is the side with the real judicial power taking it through the people instead of this, you know,
[3:43:59.740 --> 3:44:02.740]  protesting and burning down a city.
[3:44:02.740 --> 3:44:08.740]  We do tend to get things done when we get aggravated as we saw with the election.
[3:44:08.740 --> 3:44:13.740]  Enough people felt disillusioned and disenfranchised in this country.
[3:44:13.740 --> 3:44:15.740]  People that normally just shut their yaps.
[3:44:15.740 --> 3:44:18.740]  That's another question I don't get why.
[3:44:18.740 --> 3:44:20.740]  I wasn't even going to come to this until I got a bunch of threats.
[3:44:20.740 --> 3:44:22.740]  And I said, that's it. Get the security team. We're going.
[3:44:22.740 --> 3:44:28.740]  I mean, I don't know why they threaten us because I don't, don't they know it doesn't work?
[3:44:28.740 --> 3:44:34.740]  No, threats don't work. They empower you. They make you feel like now you have a mission.
[3:44:34.740 --> 3:44:41.740]  You have to do this. It's to prove a point and be part of a bigger thing.
[3:44:41.740 --> 3:44:48.740]  You're in Washington, D.C. right now. How does it look? Does it look just insane as far as security goes?
[3:44:48.740 --> 3:44:51.740]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff, but you know, it's only Trump supporters here.
[3:44:51.740 --> 3:44:55.740]  The police are being nice and everything. You can go to where cars can't really go anywhere.
[3:44:55.740 --> 3:44:58.740]  I hear that. I mean, but I mean, I'm right by the capitals. That's why.
[3:44:58.740 --> 3:45:01.740]  And they're just, they're not here. They can't even get left us to take money to do this.
[3:45:01.740 --> 3:45:04.740]  All the Bernie supporters have come and said, I agree with you.
[3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:07.740]  You know, they stole it from Bernie and Trump's good.
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:15.740]  And I mean, I have Bernie supporters. I shouldn't be swimming to Bernie, I guess, because his supporters are like, you know, we agree with the prescription drugs, you know, competition.
[3:45:15.740 --> 3:45:20.740]  We agree with draining the swamp. We agree with cutting taxes to bring money back. They actually get it.
[3:45:20.740 --> 3:45:28.740]  I've got to say Bernie supporters are better than Hillary supporters. The Hillary supporters I've met are just, I mean, I haven't met them here, but I mean, like to take Austin.
[3:45:28.740 --> 3:45:36.740]  I've seen hundreds, hundreds, thousands of Bernie stickers. I've maybe seen 10 Hillary stickers the last year. I mean, I have trouble finding them, bro.
[3:45:36.740 --> 3:45:45.740]  That was another thing where we knew that they were lying to us during that campaign. I saw no signs and stickers.
[3:45:45.740 --> 3:45:52.740]  I mean, if you think back to Obama's 2008 and 2012, they were everywhere.
[3:45:52.740 --> 3:45:56.740]  There was Obama's stickers with his little seal on there and everything. It was everywhere.
[3:45:56.740 --> 3:46:06.740]  There was no passion for this woman and every bit of passion for Trump, and they lied and lied to us to try to keep us from going out and voting.
[3:46:06.740 --> 3:46:18.740]  So really, they had to drag voters. Hillary's people had to get buses and drag people out of their houses to vote and Trump voters were chomping to get out and get to those voting booths.
[3:46:18.740 --> 3:46:21.740]  Absolutely. Okay. I've been a pig. People have been holding for over an hour.
[3:46:21.740 --> 3:46:25.740]  In fact, I'm going to go to only five callers, Jim, Jim, Cisco, Charles and Mark.
[3:46:25.740 --> 3:46:30.740]  Every one of them gets a free Hillary for Prison 2017 limited edition shirt.
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:37.740]  George Soros to Port George Soros on the back. So Harmon, I had to give you extra work. I know it's a hassle. Get all their names and addresses and their sizes.
[3:46:37.740 --> 3:46:42.740]  Pleaser. And we're going to mail those shirts. Make sure we do that. I should just plug this hour.
[3:46:42.740 --> 3:46:45.740]  I skip all these breaks. We're skipping this when I'm doing it.
[3:46:45.740 --> 3:46:51.740]  And the argument is if I add like 10 hours a day, who cares for the network because then it's, you know, still got more ads airing than before.
[3:46:51.740 --> 3:47:01.740]  But anyways, the point is, is that in four works live.com 30% off on a bunch of products that ends this Sunday, we'll have big sales like this for probably a quarter or more.
[3:47:01.740 --> 3:47:05.740]  We've got the new storeable food, super high quality 34% off somebody can beat that.
[3:47:05.740 --> 3:47:08.740]  They'd like we raise the price and cut it call to sale. This is the lowest in the industry.
[3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:16.740]  We got a bunch of other specials. We've now got combat one developed by the Pentagon been used for 12 years by special forces now available exclusively to us.
[3:47:16.740 --> 3:47:21.740]  It's going to hit Dix and everybody in like the next four months, Walmart, you name it. But they just said, we want you to have this first.
[3:47:21.740 --> 3:47:25.740]  It's been proven to do things that no other, you know, antibiotics or even clodal silver does.
[3:47:25.740 --> 3:47:34.740]  It's a new this infected totally safe info wars live.com info or store.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 compound media.com.
[3:47:34.740 --> 3:47:39.740]  There's another independent radio slash TV network doing a great job.
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:42.740]  Before we go to these calls briefly, Anthony Kumi, how do folks to check you guys out?
[3:47:42.740 --> 3:47:51.740]  Yeah, just go to compound media.com. It's as easy as that. And yeah, we're doing some pretty interesting stuff over here. Absolutely.
[3:47:51.740 --> 3:47:56.740]  And it's important because look, I mean, I like your shows, but some people aren't going to like us.
[3:47:56.740 --> 3:48:01.740]  We're not going to like me. I get that. That's why we're other people on. I mean, I can't stand to listen to myself half the time.
[3:48:01.740 --> 3:48:05.740]  Other people love it. I don't know what's wrong with them. But but I mean, it's just great to be together.
[3:48:05.740 --> 3:48:08.740]  And don't you feel good knowing I'm there? I feel good knowing you're there.
[3:48:08.740 --> 3:48:13.740]  We're not competition with Drudge or we're not competition with Daily Caller or Breitbart. We're just we're family here.
[3:48:13.740 --> 3:48:21.740]  There's not enough of us to start getting angry with each other. We are in this together and it is a war.
[3:48:21.740 --> 3:48:26.740]  And boy, if we lose it, we're going to lose a hell of a lot.
[3:48:26.740 --> 3:48:29.740]  Isn't it about our kids? Isn't it about our kids?
[3:48:29.740 --> 3:48:37.740]  Well, you have kids and congrats. I've been running solo for quite a while. Hope he has kids.
[3:48:37.740 --> 3:48:40.740]  There's some good sides to that. But the point is it's about family.
[3:48:40.740 --> 3:48:45.740]  Yeah, family. That's, you know, my family is everything to me. And it is. It is about family.
[3:48:45.740 --> 3:48:53.740]  And, you know, it was so refreshing today to see Trump and his whole family getting off of Air Force Two when he arrived in D.C.
[3:48:53.740 --> 3:49:01.740]  I mean, that is a traditional family that I mean, we've seen them through the campaign. They're not dysfunctional.
[3:49:01.740 --> 3:49:05.740]  And notice he shows them off because that's his wealth. His real wealth is that.
[3:49:05.740 --> 3:49:16.740]  Yes. And he shows that and appreciates it. You know, and these disgusting pigs on the left trying to make out some horrible, disgusting thing with his daughter.
[3:49:16.740 --> 3:49:20.740]  He loves his daughter. Wow. What a bad guy.
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:26.740]  Well, he was making a joke. Anybody would say she's such a perfect 10 that even I would date her because he only goes out with 10s.
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:28.740]  He meant like, she's the Creme de la Creme.
[3:49:28.740 --> 3:49:38.740]  Of course, but they can't take, they see a traditional family like that, an extended family that love each other and are there to support each other.
[3:49:38.740 --> 3:49:44.740]  And they don't even know what it is anymore. That's the oddity. They hate it because they never had it. Right.
[3:49:44.740 --> 3:49:50.740]  I mean, I've got family that that I mean, I know I could say, you know, do anything for me. They do it.
[3:49:50.740 --> 3:49:55.740]  They wouldn't even ask because they know I would. And that is a strong feeling when you know other people that will do anything for you.
[3:49:55.740 --> 3:50:02.740]  Because that is because they're family, not because they owe you something or you owe them, it's because your family, it transcends all this crap.
[3:50:02.740 --> 3:50:09.740]  That is exactly it. And that's what's going to be important when money doesn't mean anything to anybody.
[3:50:09.740 --> 3:50:15.740]  If you're on your deathbed or what have you, it's the family that really matters.
[3:50:15.740 --> 3:50:22.740]  Did you see this lesbian and gay activists were in front of the house that Pence is renting in DC?
[3:50:22.740 --> 3:50:32.740]  No, I didn't. They were having a queer love and trans power protest that they decided to do in front of the house that Pence is
[3:50:32.740 --> 3:50:38.740]  renting in the interim until he takes up residence at the vice presidential mansion.
[3:50:38.740 --> 3:50:46.740]  Yes. So they had this big thing and it's like, look, I don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home,
[3:50:46.740 --> 3:50:52.740]  even in public as far as, you know, a public display of affection, whatever that is.
[3:50:52.740 --> 3:51:01.740]  But why do they feel they have to go right into Pence's, like, on his property and have a gay dance party?
[3:51:01.740 --> 3:51:05.740]  Well, I mean, what it is is drama cleaning. I don't care if you're gay or trans.
[3:51:05.740 --> 3:51:09.740]  The point is, it's like, don't teach my five-year-old about it because he shouldn't teach him anything.
[3:51:09.740 --> 3:51:16.740]  You're not, you know, I tell my kids about sex, not you. It's just getting in our lives, getting in what we're doing and just grandstanding
[3:51:16.740 --> 3:51:20.740]  to go, oh, look, we're women that like women. Okay, tell me something I didn't know.
[3:51:20.740 --> 3:51:24.740]  I mean, the big secret is almost all women like women, you know, it just goes on.
[3:51:24.740 --> 3:51:27.740]  I mean, you know, I don't blame them. The point is, it's just...
[3:51:27.740 --> 3:51:32.740]  The second you say something like, oh, my God, why would they do this and have this party?
[3:51:32.740 --> 3:51:35.740]  All of a sudden, you're the bad guy. You're homophobic.
[3:51:35.740 --> 3:51:39.740]  Exactly. They're allowed to go harass the vice president, which is their free speech.
[3:51:39.740 --> 3:51:42.740]  We have a right to say you're a bunch of dumbasses.
[3:51:42.740 --> 3:51:52.740]  Right. But, you know, at least up until now, it's been, you're the bad guy, you're not open-minded, you're homophobic.
[3:51:52.740 --> 3:52:03.740]  But I think in the next few years, you're going to see an attitude take over this country like when Reagan was put in...
[3:52:03.740 --> 3:52:05.740]  I think it's going to be on, beyond Reagan. I agree with you.
[3:52:05.740 --> 3:52:08.740]  I think it's going to be Reagan to the next level. All right, we'll go to some calls here. I apologize.
[3:52:08.740 --> 3:52:10.740]  You're all getting free t-shirts. It doesn't matter. I love you.
[3:52:10.740 --> 3:52:12.740]  Jim in Ohio, you've been holding for an hour.
[3:52:12.740 --> 3:52:16.740]  Go ahead. You're on the air with the founder of Compound Media Anthony Cummings.
[3:52:16.740 --> 3:52:21.740]  Yeah, just real quickly. Have you listened to NPR lately?
[3:52:21.740 --> 3:52:23.740]  It is the worst I've ever...
[3:52:23.740 --> 3:52:26.740]  No, I mean, it sounds like wartime propaganda, but it's against America.
[3:52:26.740 --> 3:52:31.740]  No, it's horrible. Every third segment is a hit piece on Trump.
[3:52:31.740 --> 3:52:36.740]  They're openly talking about how a new world order is what this world needs.
[3:52:36.740 --> 3:52:46.740]  And thirdly, they had a guy actually come out for 30 minutes and talk about all the different ways Donald Trump should be impeached and why he should be impeached.
[3:52:46.740 --> 3:52:51.740]  Oh, I mean, they're calling for him to die. They're saying, if he dies, it'll all... Hopefully someone blows him up.
[3:52:51.740 --> 3:52:53.740]  It's crazy.
[3:52:53.740 --> 3:52:58.740]  Well, that's another thing. They're admitting world government, Anthony. That's a good thing that Jim mentioned.
[3:52:58.740 --> 3:53:04.740]  Yes. You know what? I mean, it's been gone from no world government exists to Trump's ruining it.
[3:53:04.740 --> 3:53:20.740]  Yeah. You know, it's fantastic. All that work that went in eight years of Obama and just bringing down America and its leadership in the world and its respect in the world, all of that is going to be undone.
[3:53:20.740 --> 3:53:33.740]  And they had such a great head start that the fact that that's going to be pulled way back and we're going to feel proud of our country again is terrible to them.
[3:53:33.740 --> 3:53:39.740]  Sure. Let me do this live on air. Let me do this live on air. Network, can you pull all the ads out? I know it will be internet only.
[3:53:39.740 --> 3:53:45.740]  It will still be on satellite stations to pick it up. Can you guys extend this another hour because now Stone's ready to come on.
[3:53:45.740 --> 3:53:51.740]  Plus, I'm going out of the capital after this. I might go live on Skype down there. But it's also on the mainstream and info wars that messes you up.
[3:53:51.740 --> 3:53:54.740]  It doesn't matter. It's not my fault. This train wreck happened. It's a good train wreck.
[3:53:54.740 --> 3:54:06.740]  But I mean, is the network okay to pull ads out or run the next hour with ads? I don't care either way. Can you guys do that?
[3:54:06.740 --> 3:54:12.740]  No, it's on the network only, but we'll we have our own satellite though. We'll be on that too, right?
[3:54:12.740 --> 3:54:18.740]  Oh, it's already programmed. Okay, I got it. We're only paid for that time on our own satellite. Okay.
[3:54:18.740 --> 3:54:24.740]  Well, that's fine. People wanted info wars.com forward slash show. Let's thank you, Jim. That was a great question.
[3:54:24.740 --> 3:54:30.740]  Let's just double down. Let's go to another Jim. Jim in Texas. You're on the air with Anthony Comey. Go ahead.
[3:54:30.740 --> 3:54:38.740]  Thank you, Alex. I'm on my brain force. I hope this will help if you and Roger can share four words with Donald Trump, president of the Senate.
[3:54:38.740 --> 3:54:45.740]  Because Mike Pence is not just the vice president. He holds a dual office. No, they know that he's a tiebreaker in the Senate.
[3:54:45.740 --> 3:54:52.740]  Not just a tiebreaker. If Donald Trump assigns him to sit there every day, he controls the agenda. He controls the gavel.
[3:54:52.740 --> 3:54:58.740]  He doesn't have to have a vote, but he controls the gavel. No, I know. That's why suddenly they're going to be able to repeal Obamacare, gun control, everything.
[3:54:58.740 --> 3:55:03.740]  That's why they're crapping their drawers. Thank you. That's a great point. Let me ask Comey that we have stone here with us.
[3:55:03.740 --> 3:55:09.740]  It's incredible that suddenly it was invincible. Obamacare was invincible. Everything was invincible. Now it's all falling in front of us.
[3:55:09.740 --> 3:55:23.740]  Is that not incredible? I love this. I love the fact that they were completely expecting Hillary to get in and continue this whole thing of deconstructing America's world power.
[3:55:23.740 --> 3:55:32.740]  And it just threw a cinder block in front of them and they don't know what to make of it. That to me gives me joy just on the revenge part.
[3:55:32.740 --> 3:55:41.740]  That's right. And then it's so nice to know that it will make America great again by building us back up and having pride in our nation.
[3:55:41.740 --> 3:55:47.740]  That's right. And belief. That's right. Let's go to Roger Stone. Comey, if you need to, you can stay with us the next time you need to go. That's fine as well.
[3:55:47.740 --> 3:55:51.740]  I actually have to do my show in like three minutes, Alex.
[3:55:51.740 --> 3:55:56.740]  I understand. Well then listen, we're going to let you go. Great job hosting the show twice a month. Hope you'll come back more soon. Thank you.
[3:55:56.740 --> 3:55:59.740]  Love it, Alex. Thanks so much. Take care. Thanks, man.
[3:55:59.740 --> 3:56:03.740]  There he goes. ComPyME.com. What a patriot. It's good to have him there with us walking point.
[3:56:03.740 --> 3:56:08.740]  Roger Stone. Wow. A lot happening. You've been mobbed here. Couldn't get over because of traffic.
[3:56:08.740 --> 3:56:11.740]  In the next three minutes until we got a break, tell us what's happened.
[3:56:11.740 --> 3:56:19.740]  Alex, it's interesting to be in Washington. Obviously, there's a lot of celebration and a lot of revelry for tonight.
[3:56:19.740 --> 3:56:30.740]  But in the background, a struggle is going on over the confirmation of Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's intended Secretary of State.
[3:56:30.740 --> 3:56:41.740]  The pivotal vote is Marco Rubio of Florida. If he abandons the Republicans, this gives John McCain, Lindsey Graham, the opening that they need.
[3:56:41.740 --> 3:56:49.740]  Trump would be short of the 50 votes necessary and will be forced to deal with Democrats for Tillerson's confirmation.
[3:56:49.740 --> 3:57:03.740]  So right now, Marco Rubio is the key man. I'm urging my friends in Florida to reach out to their U.S. senator immediately and tell him to vote for the Tillerson confirmation.
[3:57:03.740 --> 3:57:11.740]  This may be the single and most important pivotal vote coming up and will set the entire tone for the Trump administration.
[3:57:11.740 --> 3:57:15.740]  That's right. Because if this happens where we want, the rest of the dominoes will fall.
[3:57:15.740 --> 3:57:22.740]  I think that's exactly right. So don't give John McCain and his mini-May Lindsey Graham what they're looking for.
[3:57:22.740 --> 3:57:30.740]  It's essential that Marco Rubio, who is a friend of mine, despite the fact that we have some political disagreements,
[3:57:30.740 --> 3:57:38.740]  it's essential that he stick with his party and his president and give Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson the benefit of the doubt.
[3:57:38.740 --> 3:57:44.740]  Well, there's a mandate. I mean, people want Trump. They want this agenda. They want to make America great again.
[3:57:44.740 --> 3:58:05.740]  I think that's exactly right. But I think everybody saw the hearings where Senator Rubio roughed the nominee up, and he has not announced how he's going to vote. I really hope that he will come down on the side of common sense, come down on the side of the popular mandate.
[3:58:05.740 --> 3:58:11.740]  Roger, I'm going to break for 70 seconds. I'm going to break for 70 seconds. We're going to come back, talk to you about 10 more minutes.
[3:58:11.740 --> 3:58:16.740]  I know you're busy and I'm going to be meeting with you soon anyways. I need to talk to you, obviously. A lot's happening.
[3:58:16.740 --> 3:58:26.740]  So we're going to come right back and get into this and also seeing and salivating, hoping Trump's assassinated Amara so that Obama can appoint a new president.
[3:58:26.740 --> 3:58:30.740]  They're actually pushing this now. We'll be back with Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:58:30.740 --> 3:58:48.740]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[3:58:48.740 --> 3:58:53.740]  We have the new product at m4slife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[3:58:53.740 --> 3:59:04.740]  We have so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[3:59:04.740 --> 3:59:09.740]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[3:59:09.740 --> 3:59:16.740]  It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[3:59:16.740 --> 3:59:27.740]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[3:59:27.740 --> 3:59:32.740]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[3:59:32.740 --> 3:59:49.740]  I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring. We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[3:59:49.740 --> 3:59:58.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:59:58.740 --> 4:00:05.740]  We have so many requests that are trying to sneak into the U.S. on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming.
[4:00:05.740 --> 4:00:12.740]  These challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out altogether.
[4:00:12.740 --> 4:00:19.740]  So before Trump takes office tomorrow, they're racing against time, riding a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[4:00:19.740 --> 4:00:32.740]  In the town, near a frontier group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire of trash in the early morning cold. There's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train and the event that it slows down.
[4:00:32.740 --> 4:00:45.740]  And I've got news for you, folks. That wall is coming, but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn, literally, and racing for the border. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[4:00:45.740 --> 4:00:54.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[4:00:54.740 --> 4:01:04.740]  This is the heart of 1776. Get away from me!
[4:01:04.740 --> 4:01:09.740]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[4:01:09.740 --> 4:01:13.740]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[4:01:13.740 --> 4:01:20.740]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[4:01:20.740 --> 4:01:24.740]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[4:01:24.740 --> 4:01:28.740]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[4:01:28.740 --> 4:01:34.740]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[4:01:34.740 --> 4:01:36.740]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[4:01:36.740 --> 4:01:42.740]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[4:01:42.740 --> 4:01:47.740]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[4:01:47.740 --> 4:01:51.740]  All right, in T-minus 20 minutes, I'm going to end this live transmission.
[4:01:51.740 --> 4:01:56.740]  I'm going to call Roger instead of exactly one more meeting tonight with one of the deplorable and more.
[4:01:56.740 --> 4:02:01.740]  Roger knows that about a month ago, I told him, look, I've just got too much family stuff. I'm not going to Washington.
[4:02:01.740 --> 4:02:04.740]  And then when I heard they were threatening the deplorable, I said, OK, I'm going to go now.
[4:02:04.740 --> 4:02:11.740]  And now, since they threatened to gas it and all the rest of the stuff, I said, look, I've got to go.
[4:02:11.740 --> 4:02:14.740]  So we're here. Obviously, there are a bunch of cowards. It's not going to happen.
[4:02:14.740 --> 4:02:17.740]  But this, you know, most of the buses didn't show up.
[4:02:17.740 --> 4:02:20.740]  They admit most of the Soros people, like a handful, showed up.
[4:02:20.740 --> 4:02:22.740]  10% of what they thought showed up.
[4:02:22.740 --> 4:02:25.740]  The police are saying that we didn't catch buses being brought in.
[4:02:25.740 --> 4:02:35.740]  You've got them openly basically calling for a terror attack on Trump, salivating and hypothetically talking about how great it would be.
[4:02:35.740 --> 4:02:38.740]  You know, something happened to him because Obama could then appoint a new cabinet.
[4:02:38.740 --> 4:02:44.740]  And since none of Trump's cabinet's been confirmed, it would be Obama's oyster.
[4:02:44.740 --> 4:02:48.740]  And then, oh, they federalized Homeland Security and federalized the elections.
[4:02:48.740 --> 4:02:50.740]  And so now they're allowed to run the new elections.
[4:02:50.740 --> 4:02:55.740]  They're definitely delusionally in their bunker thinking about how they're going to stay in power.
[4:02:55.740 --> 4:02:58.740]  I want to be clear. I'm not saying they're going to stay in power, Roger.
[4:02:58.740 --> 4:03:02.740]  But clearly, correct me if I'm wrong, and I want to know about your sources, what they think.
[4:03:02.740 --> 4:03:06.740]  They are really wargaming delusional past the power.
[4:03:06.740 --> 4:03:10.740]  Yeah, Alex, what you've got here is hysteria.
[4:03:10.740 --> 4:03:14.740]  Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, will not be at the inauguration.
[4:03:14.740 --> 4:03:17.740]  George and Barbara Bush feigning illness.
[4:03:17.740 --> 4:03:19.740]  They have an excuse for not being there.
[4:03:19.740 --> 4:03:24.740]  What a perfect setup for violence in an attempt to take out the next president of the United States.
[4:03:24.740 --> 4:03:31.740]  The good news is I think the security agencies and those directly around Trump understand this threat.
[4:03:31.740 --> 4:03:37.740]  And I'm still confident that everything will be fine and he will take office as expected.
[4:03:37.740 --> 4:03:44.740]  But I think the establishment and the globalists are wargaming this because the clock is running out on them.
[4:03:44.740 --> 4:03:49.740]  And they see that Trump is going to come to power and he's going to change things.
[4:03:49.740 --> 4:03:57.740]  So you have a near hysteria and then you have propaganda operations like CNN, not a news organization.
[4:03:57.740 --> 4:04:01.740]  You know, trying to whip this into a fervor.
[4:04:01.740 --> 4:04:02.740]  Why are they so scared?
[4:04:02.740 --> 4:04:06.740]  I mean, we know Trump's for real, but he just wants to make America great, cut taxes.
[4:04:06.740 --> 4:04:07.740]  He wasn't even planning on going after them.
[4:04:07.740 --> 4:04:08.740]  Now I think he has to.
[4:04:08.740 --> 4:04:10.740]  He's saying they're never going to stop.
[4:04:10.740 --> 4:04:11.740]  He just wanted to fix things.
[4:04:11.740 --> 4:04:19.740]  Why are they so fundamentally committed to death basically to try to keep this country from writing itself?
[4:04:19.740 --> 4:04:26.740]  Well, because the establishment and the globalists and the New World Order, they don't have any ideology.
[4:04:26.740 --> 4:04:28.740]  They're neither liberal nor conservative.
[4:04:28.740 --> 4:04:29.740]  They're about money.
[4:04:29.740 --> 4:04:31.740]  They're about control.
[4:04:31.740 --> 4:04:38.740]  They're about enriching themselves and their cronies while the working people around the globe and their country suffer.
[4:04:38.740 --> 4:04:47.740]  See, my real problem with the Bushes and the Clintons is not just that their policies have failed, but they've made the country poorer.
[4:04:47.740 --> 4:04:54.740]  But they themselves have gotten richer, that their cronies have gotten richer on the backs of the American people.
[4:04:54.740 --> 4:04:56.740]  And they see their power ebbing away.
[4:04:56.740 --> 4:05:01.740]  They see that they will no longer be able to profiteer.
[4:05:01.740 --> 4:05:05.740]  Let's face it, an expanded proxy war in Syria.
[4:05:05.740 --> 4:05:07.740]  There's big bucks in that.
[4:05:07.740 --> 4:05:15.740]  Humanitions guys, the defense contractors, they were gleeful that Hillary was going to expand the war.
[4:05:15.740 --> 4:05:17.740]  And no fly zone?
[4:05:17.740 --> 4:05:18.740]  Absolutely.
[4:05:18.740 --> 4:05:20.740]  That could lead to World War III.
[4:05:20.740 --> 4:05:22.740]  We'll make a fortune.
[4:05:22.740 --> 4:05:28.740]  They see their power, but more importantly, their money ebbing away and they can't stand it.
[4:05:28.740 --> 4:05:30.740]  That's right.
[4:05:30.740 --> 4:05:35.740]  You know, last night we went to dinner and I went over to say hi to some folks.
[4:05:35.740 --> 4:05:36.740]  You said hi too.
[4:05:36.740 --> 4:05:39.740]  You said, what are you doing with those Democrats over there?
[4:05:39.740 --> 4:05:40.740]  And I said, no, they were really mean to me.
[4:05:40.740 --> 4:05:42.740]  I mean, some of them were nice.
[4:05:42.740 --> 4:05:43.740]  There was a big table.
[4:05:43.740 --> 4:05:44.740]  They weren't all Democrats.
[4:05:44.740 --> 4:05:51.740]  Some were lobbyists, but an individual that has one of the biggest Internet news sites out there, he could be in movies though.
[4:05:51.740 --> 4:05:57.740]  He was a bad looking fellow, but the gangsterous, the arrogance, the way he leaned back and made fun of me.
[4:05:57.740 --> 4:06:00.740]  It didn't hurt me because he said bad things about me.
[4:06:00.740 --> 4:06:05.740]  It hurt me that he was such a fallen person and so arrogant.
[4:06:05.740 --> 4:06:14.740]  And I see that in Washington, this fake, practiced arrogance that they wear like a shield even though I'm more successful.
[4:06:14.740 --> 4:06:17.740]  I'm bigger, in which I don't, I don't have a power trip.
[4:06:17.740 --> 4:06:18.740]  I'm actually humbled because of it.
[4:06:18.740 --> 4:06:19.740]  It doesn't matter.
[4:06:19.740 --> 4:06:24.740]  It was like, when he saw me, he kind of jolted, kind of like, and then put on this face of arrogance.
[4:06:24.740 --> 4:06:28.740]  Like BLZBub had just poofed and smoked in front of him.
[4:06:28.740 --> 4:06:33.740]  Of course, it was Chris Ruddy of Newsmax who had interviewed many times like 20 years ago.
[4:06:33.740 --> 4:06:35.740]  Last time was like 17 years ago.
[4:06:35.740 --> 4:06:37.740]  And I wonder why he never would come on after that.
[4:06:37.740 --> 4:06:39.740]  I've been on Newsmax, been nice to them.
[4:06:39.740 --> 4:06:43.740]  They do a lot of great work, but you had privately told me, look out for Newsmax.
[4:06:43.740 --> 4:06:45.740]  And then the more and more, I didn't know.
[4:06:45.740 --> 4:06:46.740]  I looked it up.
[4:06:46.740 --> 4:06:48.740]  He gives millions of the Clinton Foundation.
[4:06:48.740 --> 4:06:50.740]  What the hell is going on?
[4:06:50.740 --> 4:06:53.740]  I mean, I don't want to just focus on Chris Ruddy while this news is going on,
[4:06:53.740 --> 4:07:00.740]  but what is the mindset that they would think I'm a bad probably that he would, you know, just be so arrogant?
[4:07:00.740 --> 4:07:03.740]  Well, I think you put your fingers on it, Alex.
[4:07:03.740 --> 4:07:06.740]  Chris Ruddy, nominally a conservative or Republican,
[4:07:06.740 --> 4:07:14.740]  gives $1.5 million to the continuing criminal conspiracy that is the Clinton Foundation.
[4:07:14.740 --> 4:07:22.740]  And prohibits you when you're on Newsmax from discussing the serial sex crimes of Bill Clinton.
[4:07:22.740 --> 4:07:26.740]  I've been privileged to be on Newsmax numerous times,
[4:07:26.740 --> 4:07:33.740]  but in every occasion, just before they turn on the camera as a producer or the host would say to me, oh, now remember,
[4:07:33.740 --> 4:07:36.740]  Bill Clinton's rapes, that's off limits.
[4:07:36.740 --> 4:07:38.740]  You can't discuss that.
[4:07:38.740 --> 4:07:44.740]  So the fact that Chris Ruddy is now parading around Washington pretending that he was for Donald Trump,
[4:07:44.740 --> 4:07:45.740]  I think it's very sad.
[4:07:45.740 --> 4:07:52.740]  I like Chris, but he made his bed with the globalists, and now I guess he wishes that he didn't.
[4:07:52.740 --> 4:07:56.740]  I mean, how do you get so arrogant just because he plays golf with Bill Clinton?
[4:07:56.740 --> 4:08:00.740]  I mean, the guy was the most, he acted so arrogant, I couldn't believe it.
[4:08:00.740 --> 4:08:01.740]  And I was just like, what?
[4:08:01.740 --> 4:08:06.740]  Well, the irony of this, of course, is that it's Chris Ruddy himself as an investigative reporter for the Pittsburgh Gazette,
[4:08:06.740 --> 4:08:09.740]  who first uncovered Bill Clinton's multiple sex crimes.
[4:08:09.740 --> 4:08:10.740]  And Vince Foster.
[4:08:10.740 --> 4:08:12.740]  So he knows that it's true.
[4:08:12.740 --> 4:08:14.740]  There's the irony.
[4:08:14.740 --> 4:08:22.740]  Yeah, I just didn't get the personal energy he gave me of just trying to act totally disdainful and make fun of me.
[4:08:22.740 --> 4:08:23.740]  I mean, it went on quite a bit.
[4:08:23.740 --> 4:08:24.740]  I shook his hand.
[4:08:24.740 --> 4:08:25.740]  It was nice.
[4:08:25.740 --> 4:08:26.740]  I said, I like your work.
[4:08:26.740 --> 4:08:29.740]  I want to, he just kept making smart ass comments.
[4:08:29.740 --> 4:08:36.740]  And I think what's really bothering him, Alex, go ahead.
[4:08:36.740 --> 4:08:38.740]  No, I mean, you think what's bothering him?
[4:08:38.740 --> 4:08:43.740]  I think what's really bothering him, Alex, is the fact that you actually have viewers, millions of them.
[4:08:43.740 --> 4:08:46.740]  You actually have listeners, millions of them.
[4:08:46.740 --> 4:08:49.740]  Newsmax television, not so much.
[4:08:49.740 --> 4:08:53.740]  There's nobody watching at his website.
[4:08:53.740 --> 4:08:56.740]  So he wants to be him for wars.
[4:08:56.740 --> 4:08:59.740]  Frankly, if his heart was in the right place, maybe he could be.
[4:08:59.740 --> 4:09:09.740]  But you can't be info wars if you're backing the globalist agenda and you're, you know, you're playing patty cake with a serial rapist and his cover up criminal whites.
[4:09:09.740 --> 4:09:10.740]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[4:09:10.740 --> 4:09:13.740]  But see, the reason I have info wars is I didn't even want it.
[4:09:13.740 --> 4:09:15.740]  I wanted to speak to New World Order.
[4:09:15.740 --> 4:09:17.740]  I would give somebody info wars if they were better.
[4:09:17.740 --> 4:09:18.740]  I mean, I'm sick of this.
[4:09:18.740 --> 4:09:20.740]  I just, I just don't get the arrogance.
[4:09:20.740 --> 4:09:26.740]  I don't know how, see, because you're a strong guy and a smart guy and you enjoy work, but you're not airing it for Roger.
[4:09:26.740 --> 4:09:28.740]  And that's actually where quality nowadays.
[4:09:28.740 --> 4:09:31.740]  There's a disease in DC of just delusion.
[4:09:31.740 --> 4:09:33.740]  Is it narcissism or what is it?
[4:09:33.740 --> 4:09:34.740]  It's Potomac fever, Alex.
[4:09:34.740 --> 4:09:35.740]  It's always been this way.
[4:09:35.740 --> 4:09:42.740]  That's why I moved from here to sunny South Florida, sunny place for shady people.
[4:09:42.740 --> 4:09:45.740]  Washington is not a great place to live.
[4:09:45.740 --> 4:09:49.740]  If you want to find real people, if you're tired of phonies, you've got a better chance of finding real people.
[4:09:49.740 --> 4:09:53.740]  In Hollywood than in Washington DC.
[4:09:53.740 --> 4:09:54.740]  Yeah.
[4:09:54.740 --> 4:09:57.740]  Because the people in DC are nice, but I run into the politicos.
[4:09:57.740 --> 4:10:01.740]  They are just the biggest group of fake posers I've ever seen.
[4:10:01.740 --> 4:10:07.740]  And they're, they're all raw raw for Donald Trump today, particularly the established Republicans.
[4:10:07.740 --> 4:10:12.740]  They seem to forget or think we don't remember that they never supported them.
[4:10:12.740 --> 4:10:13.740]  Sure.
[4:10:13.740 --> 4:10:14.740]  Here's a case point example.
[4:10:14.740 --> 4:10:16.740]  Who's the woman out of Michigan for education?
[4:10:16.740 --> 4:10:19.740]  Who's for a bunch, she's the only bad nominee I think.
[4:10:19.740 --> 4:10:20.740]  Betsy DeVos.
[4:10:20.740 --> 4:10:21.740]  Yeah.
[4:10:21.740 --> 4:10:25.740]  Well, all I know is I saw her on TV when they asked him, is it sexual assault?
[4:10:25.740 --> 4:10:29.740]  It's to, to like, if a woman grabs on you, you grab on her and she goes, yes, it is.
[4:10:29.740 --> 4:10:30.740]  I mean, you know what?
[4:10:30.740 --> 4:10:32.740]  I mean, that's not sexual assault.
[4:10:32.740 --> 4:10:34.740]  Woman's on you and you touch her.
[4:10:34.740 --> 4:10:38.740]  Sexual assault be actually doing it as well.
[4:10:38.740 --> 4:10:39.740]  Unadvanced.
[4:10:39.740 --> 4:10:41.740]  I'm just, I'm glad you're there and others are there.
[4:10:41.740 --> 4:10:45.740]  Not to tell Trump what to do, but to try to spotlight the media.
[4:10:45.740 --> 4:10:49.740]  My biggest concern is it's such a big job filling 4,000 spots.
[4:10:49.740 --> 4:10:53.740]  How does he keep moles from getting in there?
[4:10:53.740 --> 4:10:55.740]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[4:10:55.740 --> 4:11:00.740]  You've identified a key problem and there are a lot of quizlings trying to abort the ship.
[4:11:00.740 --> 4:11:04.740]  Frankly, we have no choice but to put our faith in Steve Bannon.
[4:11:04.740 --> 4:11:06.740]  I'm a Bannon supporter.
[4:11:06.740 --> 4:11:10.740]  I think he's like you and I, he's a fellow revolutionary.
[4:11:10.740 --> 4:11:13.740]  He's not interested in Trump being a transitional president.
[4:11:13.740 --> 4:11:17.740]  He's interested in Trump being a transformational president.
[4:11:17.740 --> 4:11:18.740]  He said that.
[4:11:18.740 --> 4:11:24.740]  And I sleep a little better at night knowing that he's at Trump's elbow reminding him of who the good guys and the bad guys are.
[4:11:24.740 --> 4:11:36.740]  But forming a government, particularly with Barack Obama intentionally vacating all the second and third level jobs on the 21st to try to stop us from governing.
[4:11:36.740 --> 4:11:41.740]  You know, his work is cut out for him and some bad asses are going to get through.
[4:11:41.740 --> 4:11:45.740]  This is the appointment of Betsy, plus Vexisme.
[4:11:45.740 --> 4:11:48.740]  She hates Donald Trump and everything he stood for.
[4:11:48.740 --> 4:11:54.740]  Candidly, I blame Reince Priebus, the former RNC chairman, Trump's temporary.
[4:11:54.740 --> 4:11:55.740]  No, I mean, I agree.
[4:11:55.740 --> 4:11:57.740]  We need to, my writers, is it is a controversy.
[4:11:57.740 --> 4:11:58.740]  We don't make controversies.
[4:11:58.740 --> 4:12:01.740]  We see them when they're being ignored and only spotlight them.
[4:12:01.740 --> 4:12:10.740]  We need to spotlight the sleeping controversy of this woman who's for all sorts of globalism, all for, for common core.
[4:12:10.740 --> 4:12:12.740]  I don't know who advised him on that.
[4:12:12.740 --> 4:12:15.740]  And then she's badmouthing him in a confirmation hearing.
[4:12:15.740 --> 4:12:17.740]  I mean, just get God.
[4:12:17.740 --> 4:12:20.740]  Oh, I mean, it's just, it's a nightmare.
[4:12:20.740 --> 4:12:24.740]  Alex, we're going to have four or maybe even eight years of these kind of fights.
[4:12:24.740 --> 4:12:25.740]  It's the way.
[4:12:25.740 --> 4:12:26.740]  No, I agree.
[4:12:26.740 --> 4:12:30.740]  But why is she so arrogant to throw him under the bus in front of the Senate?
[4:12:30.740 --> 4:12:31.740]  What's her problem?
[4:12:31.740 --> 4:12:34.740]  I mean, he just is giving her this position.
[4:12:34.740 --> 4:12:37.740]  She's going to stab him in the back on TV.
[4:12:37.740 --> 4:12:39.740]  Can she at least do it in closed doors?
[4:12:39.740 --> 4:12:42.740]  Well, that's a question for Ryan's previous.
[4:12:42.740 --> 4:12:44.740]  He's the one who advocated her appointment.
[4:12:44.740 --> 4:12:47.740]  So perhaps he can educate us as to why she's in this position.
[4:12:47.740 --> 4:12:54.740]  It's certainly not because she shares our views on education or because she's a supporter of Donald J. Trump.
[4:12:54.740 --> 4:12:58.740]  Who else is questionable?
[4:12:58.740 --> 4:13:01.740]  Well, it remains to be seen.
[4:13:01.740 --> 4:13:04.740]  I mean, I'm happy with Jeff Sessions appointment.
[4:13:04.740 --> 4:13:06.740]  I think he's a patriotic American.
[4:13:06.740 --> 4:13:10.740]  I don't agree with him on marijuana, but I agree with him, I think on everything else.
[4:13:10.740 --> 4:13:14.740]  Rex Tillerson, like Donald Trump, is his own man.
[4:13:14.740 --> 4:13:17.740]  He's owned by nobody, certainly not the globalists.
[4:13:17.740 --> 4:13:23.740]  He understands his responsibility and the guy he answers to is Donald Trump, his boss.
[4:13:23.740 --> 4:13:27.740]  That's why the globalists are so, so anxious to try to block his promotion.
[4:13:27.740 --> 4:13:32.740]  And the idea that you would attack Tillerson's appointment because he knows Putin.
[4:13:32.740 --> 4:13:33.740]  That's moronic.
[4:13:33.740 --> 4:13:35.740]  That's why you want him.
[4:13:35.740 --> 4:13:37.740]  Because he's got a dialogue going.
[4:13:37.740 --> 4:13:43.740]  I mean, normally you try to get a secretary of state that knows the key world leaders already.
[4:13:43.740 --> 4:13:47.740]  So that's exactly where we are closing here.
[4:13:47.740 --> 4:13:53.740]  I want to hook up with you later today as we talked about do some live Facebook mentions as we go to events as you do things.
[4:13:53.740 --> 4:14:00.740]  As we go to the deplorable tonight is we're going to have record viewers on Facebook mentions and other systems to do that.
[4:14:00.740 --> 4:14:07.740]  But tomorrow by by what 1230 Eastern, we should have a new president.
[4:14:07.740 --> 4:14:09.740]  That I believe is the plan.
[4:14:09.740 --> 4:14:11.740]  I'm I know you're going to be there.
[4:14:11.740 --> 4:14:12.740]  I'm going to be there.
[4:14:12.740 --> 4:14:13.740]  This is very exciting.
[4:14:13.740 --> 4:14:25.740]  I mean, Alex, I have been to, I guess, five inaugurations, two for Richard Nixon, two for Ronald Reagan, and then one for Bush that I must assemble into on my mistake.
[4:14:25.740 --> 4:14:27.740]  But this is the most exciting one.
[4:14:27.740 --> 4:14:32.740]  This is the one where we can really make the country great again.
[4:14:32.740 --> 4:14:43.740]  Bring the fundamental change that the American people voted overwhelmingly for to the shock of Hillary Clinton and her criminal, you know, conspiracy cohorts.
[4:14:43.740 --> 4:14:45.740]  A criminal elite hijacked the country.
[4:14:45.740 --> 4:14:46.740]  I'm going to let you go.
[4:14:46.740 --> 4:14:49.740]  I'm going to call you on the phone in about three minutes so we can talk.
[4:14:49.740 --> 4:14:50.740]  OK, Roger.
[4:14:50.740 --> 4:14:55.740]  Before we go, let me put in a plug for the making of the president.
[4:14:55.740 --> 4:14:56.740]  Oh, let's do it.
[4:14:56.740 --> 4:15:02.740]  So three sales now in info or story available now available at info wars dot com at the store.
[4:15:02.740 --> 4:15:23.740]  Go to the info or store and you can get an advance copy of this book, which tells the inside story of how Donald Trump with the help of Matt Drudge, with the help of Alex Jones, with the help of Breitbart news with the help of the Daily Caller, with the help of the conservative media scored the greatest political upset in American history.
[4:15:23.740 --> 4:15:26.740]  So please, folks, order your copy today.
[4:15:26.740 --> 4:15:30.740]  Well, let me say this and then please redo that because I want to take a minute of that and make an ad for everybody.
[4:15:30.740 --> 4:15:32.740]  We've been pre-selling it now for two days.
[4:15:32.740 --> 4:15:34.740]  We kind of twisted arm if you've been able to do that.
[4:15:34.740 --> 4:15:36.740]  It's not out for a week and a half or so.
[4:15:36.740 --> 4:15:37.740]  It supports our broadcast.
[4:15:37.740 --> 4:15:43.740]  It supports Roger info or store dot com and making of a president such an important film.
[4:15:43.740 --> 4:15:46.740]  And America has been the biggest and the best so far in history.
[4:15:46.740 --> 4:15:47.740]  Nobody can deny that.
[4:15:47.740 --> 4:15:49.740]  The globalists are trying to kill our exceptionalism.
[4:15:49.740 --> 4:15:51.740]  We've been exceptionally corrupt under them now.
[4:15:51.740 --> 4:15:53.740]  We're trying to reverse that.
[4:15:53.740 --> 4:15:59.740]  But the fact that this is one of the biggest political upsets in world history, it may be the biggest because we're the most important country.
[4:15:59.740 --> 4:16:03.740]  The world population is the biggest it's ever been in time and space.
[4:16:03.740 --> 4:16:11.740]  I don't think it's arrogant to say this political upheaval happening worldwide against globalism is the biggest human resistance against tyranny.
[4:16:11.740 --> 4:16:13.740]  We've seen next in history.
[4:16:13.740 --> 4:16:18.740]  It's bigger than Magna Carta, bigger than 1776, bigger than the Renaissance.
[4:16:18.740 --> 4:16:23.740]  This, not just Trump, but this whole movement is the big enchilada, Roger.
[4:16:23.740 --> 4:16:26.740]  What a great, great time to be alive.
[4:16:26.740 --> 4:16:27.740]  That's right.
[4:16:27.740 --> 4:16:28.740]  Thank you, President.
[4:16:28.740 --> 4:16:29.740]  Thank you.
[4:16:29.740 --> 4:16:30.740]  I'll call you in three minutes.
[4:16:30.740 --> 4:16:31.740]  All right, folks.
[4:16:31.740 --> 4:16:39.740]  I'm going to punch you out of here and we're going to go back to rebroadcast where I was breaking down the nuclear threats and Democrats not showing up and all the rest of it.
[4:16:39.740 --> 4:16:41.740]  Briefly, the making of a president is available.
[4:16:41.740 --> 4:16:46.740]  When you buy that book there, obviously supports our broadcast some and supports what Roger's doing.
[4:16:46.740 --> 4:16:50.740]  Amazon makes people sell them the books so low that basically nobody makes money but them.
[4:16:50.740 --> 4:16:51.740]  So we buy it from us.
[4:16:51.740 --> 4:16:53.740]  We at least are able to fund the operation.
[4:16:53.740 --> 4:16:55.740]  Infowarstore.com.
[4:16:55.740 --> 4:17:00.740]  We also have the new Combat 1 skin protecting wipes.
[4:17:00.740 --> 4:17:04.740]  Previously only available and it's got skin creams and sprays and so much more.
[4:17:04.740 --> 4:17:10.740]  The DOD, military grade hygiene technology is by Special Operations, amazing repair and as a survival product.
[4:17:10.740 --> 4:17:11.740]  That's the breakdown.
[4:17:11.740 --> 4:17:12.740]  But Q, doesn't do a whole bunch more.
[4:17:12.740 --> 4:17:14.740]  It kills a whole bunch of stuff, right?
[4:17:14.740 --> 4:17:16.740]  We're going to talk about when we get back.
[4:17:16.740 --> 4:17:17.740]  We probably should do it tomorrow, though.
[4:17:17.740 --> 4:17:19.740]  DNA forces back 10% off.
[4:17:19.740 --> 4:17:22.740]  We're ending the Big Make America Great Special, Make America Healthy again.
[4:17:22.740 --> 4:17:25.740]  We're calling it the Inauguration Special, but it ends this weekend.
[4:17:25.740 --> 4:17:27.740]  30% off, 20% off the nutraceuticals.
[4:17:27.740 --> 4:17:29.740]  Infowarstore.com.
[4:17:29.740 --> 4:17:31.740]  And so much more.
[4:17:31.740 --> 4:17:32.740]  Storeable foods, the big one.
[4:17:32.740 --> 4:17:34.740]  This only happens every few months.
[4:17:34.740 --> 4:17:38.740]  30 to 40% off right now on super high quality made America 25 years shelf life.
[4:17:38.740 --> 4:17:40.740]  And yes, we've turned the corner.
[4:17:40.740 --> 4:17:41.740]  A lot of good stuff is happening.
[4:17:41.740 --> 4:17:46.740]  But you never know what the globalists are going to pull to try to start some new crisis.
[4:17:46.740 --> 4:17:49.740]  It's good for us to be independent, not dependent.
[4:17:49.740 --> 4:17:54.740]  Infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-33139.
[4:17:54.740 --> 4:17:55.740]  I apologize to the callers.
[4:17:55.740 --> 4:17:59.740]  I couldn't get to you after we ended the network show, because that's on network phones.
[4:17:59.740 --> 4:18:00.740]  So that ended.
[4:18:00.740 --> 4:18:06.740]  But again, I've been gone for a week, so it's going to be back here, not in studio, but on the road, actually talking to you.
[4:18:06.740 --> 4:18:09.740]  So I want to take advantage of all of that.
[4:18:09.740 --> 4:18:16.740]  You are the folks out there funding the plane tickets here, the security we have.
[4:18:16.740 --> 4:18:19.740]  Because I kind of got this crazy fatalistic thing.
[4:18:19.740 --> 4:18:20.740]  I'm not scared of dying.
[4:18:20.740 --> 4:18:22.740]  And I don't want to die at the same time.
[4:18:22.740 --> 4:18:24.740]  But this kind of thing, I don't worry about it and don't care about it.
[4:18:24.740 --> 4:18:26.740]  But my kids really do worry about it.
[4:18:26.740 --> 4:18:29.740]  And so I do have a good security team of folks here.
[4:18:29.740 --> 4:18:30.740]  And that's great.
[4:18:30.740 --> 4:18:33.740]  And that augments the security of the whole event as well.
[4:18:33.740 --> 4:18:35.740]  And it takes money for that.
[4:18:35.740 --> 4:18:37.740]  Even though they're giving us the family discount.
[4:18:37.740 --> 4:18:41.740]  It takes a lot to fly here and pay for everything and just do everything we do in the crew members.
[4:18:41.740 --> 4:18:43.740]  So these are great products.
[4:18:43.740 --> 4:18:52.740]  And that's a win-win where you'll want to keep buying them because they work so good, whether it's water filtration or non-gm or aluminum seeds or whether it's combat one or the new body armor that's nanotech.
[4:18:52.740 --> 4:18:53.740]  That's so cool folks.
[4:18:53.740 --> 4:18:56.740]  Check that out with the nanotube technology.
[4:18:56.740 --> 4:19:07.740]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, again, it's the big umbrella site. You can call toll-free, AAA-253-3139. I want to thank the crew back in Austin.
[4:19:07.740 --> 4:19:12.740]  You, the listeners, my family, the sponsors, GCN Radio Network, John Harmon and Scott and all that crew there.
[4:19:12.740 --> 4:19:17.740]  And just everybody, everybody out there that prays for us because big things are happening.
[4:19:17.740 --> 4:19:21.740]  And I can't believe how real and historical these changes are.
[4:19:21.740 --> 4:19:24.740]  That's why the evil forces are really pissed.
[4:19:24.740 --> 4:19:27.740]  Because they know Trump isn't a pedophile.
[4:19:27.740 --> 4:19:31.740]  And you don't get in these clubs unless you torture toddlers and make them eat crap.
[4:19:31.740 --> 4:19:33.740]  I mean, that's actually in the Daily Mail today.
[4:19:33.740 --> 4:19:34.740]  That's what they do.
[4:19:34.740 --> 4:19:39.740]  The judges in Belgium and England and all over, they just, they just, why are there so many pedophiles?
[4:19:39.740 --> 4:19:40.740]  There aren't.
[4:19:40.740 --> 4:19:41.740]  They get control.
[4:19:41.740 --> 4:19:44.740]  They lust after power so they can feed on kids.
[4:19:44.740 --> 4:19:50.740]  Those old Transylvanian legends don't let your kids get near the, you know, near the castle, they'll disappear.
[4:19:50.740 --> 4:19:55.740]  And then it turned out that a lot of those Transylvanian royalty were cutting your kids' head off but in a bathtub and bathing in it.
[4:19:55.740 --> 4:19:57.740]  They thought it was good for their skin.
[4:19:57.740 --> 4:19:58.740]  You know, and that's it.
[4:19:58.740 --> 4:20:00.740]  They want to grab your kid out of the backyard and make them eat turds.
[4:20:00.740 --> 4:20:03.740]  I mean, you know, and of course I'm directly trolling the media.
[4:20:03.740 --> 4:20:05.740]  Go ahead and attack me and say it isn't real.
[4:20:05.740 --> 4:20:09.740]  You know that the astrogens in the water are turning the frogs asexual.
[4:20:09.740 --> 4:20:10.740]  You know we're under chemical attack.
[4:20:10.740 --> 4:20:16.740]  You know your bosses cut kids' heads off and bathe in their blood before they, after they torture them and make them, you know, eat crap.
[4:20:16.740 --> 4:20:17.740]  And you know what?
[4:20:17.740 --> 4:20:18.740]  We're tired of that.
[4:20:18.740 --> 4:20:22.740]  We don't support people that torture children and hang them up by their feet making me crap.
[4:20:22.740 --> 4:20:24.740]  So, you know, that's just how it works.
[4:20:24.740 --> 4:20:26.740]  We're coming for you and you better just get used to it.
[4:20:26.740 --> 4:20:30.740]  The truth is the good guys are a lot meaner than you are when it comes to evil people.
[4:20:30.740 --> 4:20:33.740]  So good luck once you get our hands around your throat.
[4:20:33.740 --> 4:20:34.740]  And that has just begun.
[4:20:34.740 --> 4:20:41.740]  We now are about to have a non-pedophile president who actually likes beautiful women, which I know is a crime according to pedophiles.
[4:20:41.740 --> 4:20:42.740]  Well, great job, crew.
[4:20:42.740 --> 4:20:44.740]  I'll see you back tonight with lots of live feeds.
[4:20:44.740 --> 4:20:48.740]  Watch them FullWars.com for the latest breaking news. I should be live.
[4:20:48.740 --> 4:21:17.740]  Urshun.
