[00:29.960 --> 00:34.880]  2011 we're going to be here for the next three hours you know I covered
[00:34.880 --> 00:40.960]  yesterday an incredible story that got into the communist Chinese at the
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.680]  White House dinner playing one of the most popular communist songs in China
[00:45.680 --> 00:49.720]  since the 50s it's a song an anti-american song about the Korean
[00:49.720 --> 00:57.400]  War and the Chinese military shooting down the jackals which are the
[00:57.400 --> 01:07.040]  Americans and we've got a China expert the editor of epoch times joining us
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.840]  producers did a great job getting him quickly he's the editor of their
[01:12.840 --> 01:16.440]  English version they're published I don't know every major city I go to I see
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.040]  their paper published New York Toronto LA Dallas I see it in Austin just an
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.000]  amazing publication I've been a fan of for more than a decade and Stephen
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.760]  Gregory will be joining us dealing with Matthew Robertson's article Chinese
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.120]  pianist plays propaganda tune at the White House the epoch times.com he will
[01:37.120 --> 01:42.320]  be joining us coming up the middle of the next hour very very important
[01:42.320 --> 01:49.400]  information today with that guest joining us I'm also on short notice working on
[01:49.400 --> 01:56.720]  getting Tarpley Watson or Wayne Madsen on at the start of the next hour
[01:56.720 --> 02:02.240]  briefly because they really are our in-house experts especially Tarpley on
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.800]  all things Russia dealing with the huge airport bombing that's killed at least
[02:07.800 --> 02:17.600]  31 people today over there and of course that's the Damo Devo Airport in Russia
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.760]  the largest airport in that nation very serious bombing there we don't know if
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.880]  this is real Muslim terrorist or the equivalent of a four-leaf clover with a
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.400]  unicorn sitting on it by that I mean very very rare but it's rumored to exist
[02:34.400 --> 02:40.120]  somebody claims they saw one sometime in history the number one suspects are
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.440]  obviously intelligence agencies we know the Russian government going back to the
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.680]  bazaars before the communists took over in 1917 routinely blew things up to
[02:49.680 --> 02:53.800]  blame it on their enemies we know it's very suspicious bombings with FSB caught
[02:53.800 --> 02:58.040]  planting bombs in a fourth apartment building in 99 we've covered that in
[02:58.040 --> 03:02.560]  detail clearly linked to the government as a pretext to have a police state
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.080]  crackdown and then of course we've had some other bombings the last few years
[03:07.080 --> 03:14.120]  that when they fleshed out looked like NATO operations to destabilize Russia
[03:14.120 --> 03:17.760]  so we don't know we don't know right now but we'll continue to look at the
[03:17.760 --> 03:23.600]  earmarks this could be the US government NATO Israel's been caught
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.320]  meddling in and around the borders of course with the case in Georgia and also
[03:28.320 --> 03:35.760]  into southern Serbia and Pristina so right now I don't know who's behind this
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.520]  is it Muslim terrorist well they do exist if it's a woman stabbing 14 people on
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.200]  the bus or somebody suicide bombing themselves I mean that stuff does go on
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.080]  in the Middle East predominantly in areas of Palestine surrounding Israel but
[03:51.080 --> 03:58.720]  outside of that area it's very rare for it not to be a staged event so we're
[03:58.720 --> 04:06.360]  going to be going over that situation as well today continuing we've got a big
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.520]  stack of news of how the government's using the Super Bowl as a end cap or a
[04:11.520 --> 04:17.240]  demonstration of the police state with surveillance aircraft checkpoints face
[04:17.240 --> 04:23.040]  scanning you name it all being announced on that front the Drudge report has
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.120]  given a lot of attention to Eric Blair of the activist post info wars.com a
[04:28.120 --> 04:33.560]  writing for us Google seeks to weaken search engine ranking of content
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.520]  farming websites that means alternative media period a way to censor that that's

[06:20.440 --> 06:24.520]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.520 --> 06:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.080 --> 06:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[08:14.120 --> 08:18.120]  liberty is no vice
[08:18.120 --> 08:40.120]  it is Monday the 24th day of January 2011 are to believe we're about to
[08:40.120 --> 08:49.120]  collapse and complete the first month of 2011 the English editor of a global
[08:49.120 --> 08:54.120]  newspaper print newspaper Stephen Gregory will be joining us dealing with
[08:54.120 --> 09:00.120]  the incredible article Chinese pianist plays propaganda tune at the
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.120]  White House US humiliated in eyes of Chinese by song use to inspire anti-
[09:05.120 --> 09:11.120]  Americanism celebrating the killing of US troops by regular Chinese forces during
[09:11.120 --> 09:16.120]  the Korean war what does this signify well Stephen Gregory is an amazing
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.120]  expert on China and he's going to be joining us of course the epoch Times is
[09:21.120 --> 09:27.120]  the global newspaper of the fall on gong which are a not even really religious
[09:27.120 --> 09:31.120]  Buddhist group but they follow it as an exercise tenant and they are warehouse
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.120]  admittedly in facilities and their organs harvested because they're so healthy
[09:35.120 --> 09:39.120]  and in the last 15 years or so they've been valiantly fighting with the epoch
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.120]  Times with deep research on China and their history of humiliation even
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.120]  going back to Nixon the Chinese dictator would only stick their hand out a
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.120]  little bit Nixon would reach for it they would say look we're humiliating
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.120]  him Obama bowed last year this year they also did the handshake thing again
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.120]  where they don't reach out far which in Chinese is a big insult so humiliating
[10:02.120 --> 10:12.120]  our face just incredible can you imagine if the US president brought a pianist
[10:12.120 --> 10:17.120]  along to be there at the communist Chinese headquarters and played an
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.120]  anti-Chinese song it would be a big deal but this is all part of the
[10:21.120 --> 10:28.120]  humiliation of the American people so we're going to be talking to the editor
[10:28.120 --> 10:35.120]  of the epoch Times coming up in about an hour and 25 minutes from now today
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.120]  also I want to talk a little bit more coming up in the third hour today about
[10:39.120 --> 10:42.120]  what quantitative easing is doing to our economy and the world economy and food
[10:42.120 --> 10:49.120]  riots popping up in every major continent of the world serious unrest
[10:49.120 --> 10:58.120]  global price fears mount and it says as food and raw materials prices soar
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.120]  Europe Central Bank had warrants of inflation really but our government
[11:02.120 --> 11:08.120]  says there's not an inflation problem and that back in June of 2009 a year
[11:08.120 --> 11:14.120]  and a half ago or or more that the the recession into of course don't tell
[11:14.120 --> 11:18.120]  that to anybody who actually works in the free market they'll tell you that's
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.120]  a lie every indicator of course shows that's a lie we're going to be discussing
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.120]  that quantitative easing causing food prices to skyrocket this from
[11:27.120 --> 11:33.120]  washington's blog also up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.120]  obviously there has been the horrid bombing in the biggest airport in
[11:39.120 --> 11:45.120]  russia the domo dead of all airport killing at least 31 people are prayers
[11:45.120 --> 11:50.120]  go out to them it's too early to tell right now if this is government sponsored
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.120]  terror corporate sponsored terror or chetched in terror where there actually
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.120]  are some muslim extremists and I'm sad to have to announce to you they are
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.120]  nato backed as usual just like they use nato backed muslim terrorists to
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.120]  attack Serbia not saying Serbia was perfect or angels I'm not serve I'm
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.120]  not muslim I'm not crow at I'm not Albanian I don't have a dog in the fight
[12:13.120 --> 12:19.120]  I just go with what the facts are and it could be the Russians they've been
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.120]  they've done it before but we'll see how the Russians play it and how they
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.120]  use it and what key juncture the Russians are at it doesn't fit in right now
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.120]  in my gut with it being the Russians it could be they've done it before most
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.120]  major governments do stage terror attacks it's just a fact we're going to get
[12:35.120 --> 12:38.120]  tar play on today or tomorrow to get his expert of you on this he really is an
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.120]  expert on all things Central Asia and Russia so we're going to be looking at
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.120]  that suicide bomber kills 31 at Russian airport at least 31 people were killed
[12:48.120 --> 12:51.120]  and more than 100 injured this morning and a suicide bombing at Russia's
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.120]  biggest airport Russian news agencies reported Russia's rubble dominated
[12:56.120 --> 13:02.120]  stock market the MIC ex fell by nearly 2% following the blast which ripped
[13:02.120 --> 13:10.120]  through the baggage claim area in Moscow's Domoderovo airport at 1332
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.120]  Greenwich meantime I guess that's actually in the afternoon Russia time
[13:14.120 --> 13:20.120]  smoke wafted out of the baggage claim area and people were seen running out of
[13:20.120 --> 13:24.120]  the emergency exits at the airport local media reported funny we've seen these
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.120]  new video games come out a few months ago that I talked about that Matt Ryan's
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.120]  in there he wrote a review of it from full wars dot com what's the name of that
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.120]  game where the Russian airport gets attacked in a false flag and you play
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.120]  the park yeah call of duty I mean just just incredible and we said are we going
[13:40.120 --> 13:46.120]  to see this happen I mean sometimes the coincidence is just a coincidence but
[13:46.120 --> 13:52.120]  when you had Fox News approached by the CIA not Fox News Fox TV six months
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.120]  before 9 11 that they actually approached him a year before but six months
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.120]  before the peace aired where the government hijacked a passenger jet
[14:00.120 --> 14:04.120]  to fly it in the World Trade Center as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and
[14:04.120 --> 14:10.120]  launch a police state and in the peace and we've interviewed members of the
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.120]  lone government ex files episode admitting that CIA routinely approached
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.120]  them about what they wanted to be in the pieces so we have the fact that it
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.120]  mirrored the attacks and that the government did approach them about
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.120]  placing this on television you ask why it's part of the collective unconscious
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.120]  it's almost a preparing of the public for what is about to come and the
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.120]  globalists believe it's really a form of mind control or to use the ancient
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.120]  term lesser magic to practice what they're going to do in symbols before
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.120]  they actually carry it out I don't believe in it it's total mumbo jumbo
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.120]  it's crazy but the globalists certainly do it and believe in and of course the
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.120]  lone government piece and you can just pull up lone government 9 11 on
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.120]  YouTube and watch all the different pieces you can buy the DVD at Best Buy
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.120]  actually bought the lone government series just so we'd have it in high quality
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.120]  the elements of the US anti-terror apparatus hijacked the jet by remote control
[15:06.120 --> 15:13.120]  they send out messages that it's been done by Afghanistan and then the
[15:13.120 --> 15:19.120]  rest of norad stands down because the insiders at the Pentagon tell norad and
[15:19.120 --> 15:25.120]  the FAA that it's a drill and so they stand down now in the show the
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.120]  hackers on the ground the good guys the lone gunman actually Dean Haglin the
[15:30.120 --> 15:35.120]  hacker you know that's the actor's name you a different name in the show he is
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.120]  able to hack in and remote control unlock the remote control that the globalist
[15:40.120 --> 15:44.120]  are using to fly it into the towers of course we know in the real world that
[15:44.120 --> 15:50.120]  didn't happen and they went on to their destination and there's literally countless
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.120]  other examples of where they put it out there in your face before they do it but
[15:55.120 --> 16:00.120]  we don't know exactly what's going on yet with the blast that's rocked Moscow's
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.120]  main airport but we will continue to break that down if we can't get
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.120]  terribly on short notice popping in Watson is writing a big article right
[16:10.120 --> 16:17.120]  now on prisonplanet.com dealing with all of this I'm just going to see if it's
[16:17.120 --> 16:24.120]  now gone live yet know his article is not out yet there at prisonplanet.com

[18:03.120 --> 18:08.120]  have to get the government mandated insurance just like the first company
[18:08.120 --> 18:14.120]  they did what three months ago was McDonald's with hundreds and hundreds of
[18:14.120 --> 18:20.120]  thousands of employees USA Today headline McDonald's and 29 other firms
[18:20.120 --> 18:27.120]  given waivers from government health care from Obamacare and since then it's
[18:27.120 --> 18:31.120]  it's over 500 last time I shot around and counted them up and that was months
[18:31.120 --> 18:35.120]  ago so I don't know how many waivers have been issued you can go online to the
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.120]  White House links and they have a just just hundreds of pages of this stuff
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.120]  but this is the heart of what tyranny is about it's about government controlling
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.120]  everything and then enriching their friends how are you going to compete
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.120]  against a hotel chain that's in your town if you own a family owned hotel or
[18:53.120 --> 18:57.120]  motel and their employees don't have to get insurance but all of your employees
[18:57.120 --> 19:04.120]  do how are you going to compete if you have a hamburger place or a restaurant
[19:04.120 --> 19:10.120]  or a sub shop next door to a McDonald's and their employees don't have to get insurance
[19:10.120 --> 19:13.120]  and so let's say you're already paying folks 11 bucks an hour better than
[19:13.120 --> 19:20.120]  McDonald's at average $8 an hour it doesn't matter now they don't have to
[19:20.120 --> 19:25.120]  have the insurance paid for so now you've got to pay $5 $6 an hour extra on
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.120]  average is what it factors out to be to get that insurance and so now you got to
[19:30.120 --> 19:35.120]  lay people off now you got to increase the price of your sub sandwiches see how
[19:35.120 --> 19:40.120]  that works I mean this is incredible tyranny and so we're going to continue
[19:40.120 --> 19:46.120]  to discuss that but I want to get into abortion first and some big developments
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.120]  in Texas and other states on the other side then we're going to get into the
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.120]  police state rollout to condition everybody at the Super Bowl we're going to

[24:24.120 --> 24:29.120]  openly announcing intensified censorship drugs reports got this link today
[24:29.120 --> 24:34.120]  very important information that is call all coming up more on our vie for
[24:34.120 --> 24:38.120]  victory campaign and the amazing feedback i'm getting on that i'll just tell
[24:38.120 --> 24:43.120]  you now travis one of our it guys i've just gone ahead and hired two more
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.120]  people on top of the two we have to accelerate our social network the
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.120]  design of info wars prison planet all the things we're doing
[24:52.120 --> 24:56.120]  when we you know put the ad out and hired them folks didn't know where they
[24:56.120 --> 24:59.120]  were getting hired and this guy had heard the show off on an austin over
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.120]  the years but you know it was somewhat of a listener but not a huge fan and
[25:04.120 --> 25:08.120]  then he's finally told some of his friends this weekend where he works and
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.120]  they're like oh my gosh we're hanging up vie for victory posters all over the
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.120]  place and a lot of their friends are doing it that's great but we need to
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.120]  get those out on the street polls out in the public places wherever it's
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.120]  legal and lawful of course you'll see a garage sale sign and nobody pulls it
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.120]  down and then sometimes when you put it up they say oh it's illegal to
[25:30.120 --> 25:33.120]  hang it in public places in our town but then we've gone and checked in many
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.120]  areas it's actually not especially they haven't been enforcing it against the
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.120]  dog grooming signs and garage sale signs and cookie sale signs that go up
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.120]  everywhere our liberty and our freedom is important and it's our free speech and
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.120]  all of america is a free speech zone all the public commons are a free speech
[25:50.120 --> 25:55.120]  zone a free speech zone is not in your living room or if you own a newspaper
[25:55.120 --> 26:00.120]  it's not that newspaper is yours that's not a free speech zone that's your free
[26:00.120 --> 26:05.120]  speech zone but when it's public places it certainly is so that is coming up as
[26:05.120 --> 26:11.120]  well I've got a little stack of abortion news here and I'm gonna start getting
[26:11.120 --> 26:17.120]  into this now and get more into it later but I rarely find myself agreeing with
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.120]  Governor Rick Perry he's the guy that tried to push through the naftab super
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.120]  highways and the toll roads on 8,000 miles of existing texas roads he's the
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.120]  guy that tried to force the Gardasil shots on texas schoolgirls that they admit
[26:30.120 --> 26:34.120]  doesn't protect you from the papillomavirus that can cause cancer in the
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.120]  cervix and that is very dangerous and has caused a lot of deaths and that's on
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.120]  record it caused deaths during the trials and since then so I'm not a big
[26:42.120 --> 26:47.120]  fan of Rick Perry but when someone does something right you've got to give them
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.120]  credit when Glenn Beck comes out admits the government wants to reduce world
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.120]  population and gives the documents got to give him credit when he talks about
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.120]  the private fellow reserve taking over America got to give him credit they're
[26:59.120 --> 27:02.120]  going in the right direction and that's because you their viewers their
[27:02.120 --> 27:06.120]  listeners their constituents are demanding it the system with the
[27:06.120 --> 27:11.120]  overton window what is seen as politically acceptable is trying to do
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.120]  radical things to pull the political debate to the extreme so that things that
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.120]  would have been extreme don't look as extreme because they're pushing for such
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.120]  extreme things on the other end well we're pulling the overton window of
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.120]  what's politically acceptable back the other way towards constitutional
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.120]  common sense and what this nation was founded on the system has tried to
[27:32.120 --> 27:36.120]  demonize it it's tried to make gun ownership look bad it's tried to make
[27:36.120 --> 27:39.120]  private property look bad it's tried to make the family look bad with all the
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.120]  dramas and sitcoms and you see the messages all over TV and all you know in
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.120]  the movies and culture but the point is we're beginning to win this info war
[27:48.120 --> 27:53.120]  every study shows it if you go back to the time of Roe v. Wade in 1973 the
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.120]  polls were roughly 50-50 some of the polls leaned towards 55-45 or a little
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.120]  bit more of the population being pro-abortion because it was sold like
[28:03.120 --> 28:09.120]  a human right like suffrage for women or voting for blacks now today and they
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.120]  run the gamut but all polls that are scientific show above 60% being against
[28:14.120 --> 28:21.120]  abortion some over 80% and every year the numbers flip towards common sense
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.120]  and pro-life and so they can yell they can scream they can have shows on MTV
[28:26.120 --> 28:32.120]  glorifying abortion all they want it didn't work in and Rick Perry is doing
[28:32.120 --> 28:38.120]  something I really agree with I do not like in Travis County with my office
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.120]  here having to pay Travis County franchise taxes which is really a hidden
[28:43.120 --> 28:52.120]  sales tax on businesses or really a hidden income tax on businesses and the
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.120]  hospital district tax and the rest of it to make me pay millions of dollars
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.120]  that is Austin I said to pay millions of dollars over three million a year
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.120]  total to pay for abortions and people are coming from all over the state in
[29:04.120 --> 29:08.120]  the last year to have them here including late term abortions those are
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.120]  babies that can be adopted up there's on average a two-year waiting list for
[29:12.120 --> 29:15.120]  them there are all these big groups that will pay women to have their babies
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.120]  and adopt them mainly Christian groups they don't ever tell the women that
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.120]  they don't tell them that Planned Parenthood was founded to carry out eugenics
[29:23.120 --> 29:26.120]  we're going to cover this big development with Rick Perry and some other
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.120]  abortion news on the other side but first the government and Cass Sunstein
[29:30.120 --> 29:34.120]  have announced the fairness doctrine and that we need to give equal time to
[29:34.120 --> 29:38.120]  their position and so I've decided when we come back that we're going to talk
[29:38.120 --> 29:45.120]  to David Rockefeller's spirit guide and give the soul of the New World Order
[29:45.120 --> 29:49.120]  a little bit of time here on air so we're going to hear from the other side
[29:49.120 --> 29:55.120]  equal time on the other side we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.120 --> 30:00.120]  and the GCN Radio Network
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.120]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[30:04.120 --> 30:09.120]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[30:09.120 --> 30:13.120]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.120]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[30:17.120 --> 30:21.120]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.120]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should

[33:56.120 --> 34:02.120]  order there is no way you can stop our globalist takeover resistance to us is
[34:02.120 --> 34:10.120]  futile turn away from God there is no God give yourself to world government
[34:10.120 --> 34:18.120]  only believe in materialism fight with your family turn in your firearms don't
[34:18.120 --> 34:24.120]  spend time with your children watch sports and nothing but sports take your
[34:24.120 --> 34:33.120]  project when the school tells you to put your five-year-old on riddle and don't
[34:33.120 --> 34:39.120]  read the insert that it causes their brain to shrink and causes brain damage
[34:39.120 --> 34:45.120]  submit to us it's like easing yourself into a hot bath tub and splitting your
[34:45.120 --> 34:54.120]  brain into the new world order do not resist do not resist do not resist the
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.120]  Federal Reserve is here to help you all words are dangerous don't be angry at
[35:00.120 --> 35:06.120]  your government the massing giant military force against you if you are
[35:06.120 --> 35:20.120]  this transmission you are not the resistance we now take you live to the
[35:20.120 --> 35:27.120]  central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots
[35:27.120 --> 35:37.120]  worldwide you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.120]  all right there's fair time to David Rockefeller he wanted the time J. Rockefeller
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.120]  is calling for a return to the fairness doctrine and so we may now at least a few
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.120]  times a week try to give them equal time and that's really what the new world
[35:52.120 --> 35:57.120]  order wants for all of us so keep drinking your fluoride water you heard it
[35:57.120 --> 36:03.120]  directly from the night circle of hell a report from David Rockefeller on what
[36:03.120 --> 36:14.120]  he thinks would be good for this country and the rest of the world here's an
[36:14.120 --> 36:19.120]  interesting report dealing with China General Motors China sales past US for
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.120]  the first time in history well yeah part of the stimulus package went to build
[36:24.120 --> 36:29.120]  factories in Brazil and China and Eastern Europe GM sold more cards in China in
[36:29.120 --> 36:34.120]  the US for the first time Toyota keeps titled for most global sales we'll be
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.120]  looking at China coming up in T minus one hour in the middle of the next hour
[36:37.120 --> 36:44.120]  deep look at China continuing here with the good news so the polls show it the
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.120]  numbers of abortions are overall down the vast majority of citizens now know it
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.120]  is a baby they know it's alive you're talking over 90% in major polls that are
[36:54.120 --> 36:59.120]  against late term or third trimester abortions upwards of 80% against all
[36:59.120 --> 37:04.120]  abortion period it is incredible it's used as a contraceptive Planned Parenthood
[37:04.120 --> 37:09.120]  of course was set up by the Rockefeller Foundation on record via Margaret
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.120]  Singer to quote get rid of the undesirables namely black people that was
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.120]  their quote the quote social weeds societal weeds is the precise quote and
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.120]  52% I kept saying 51% I was corrected 52% of blacks never make it out of the
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.120]  womb we're talking close to 20% of whites Hispanics never make it out of the
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.120]  womb it's terrible where are the civil rights activists trying to stop this
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.120]  Holocaust well they're the quote mainline liberals who were bankrolled by this
[37:39.120 --> 37:42.120]  system and to be a quote liberal you've got to be pro-abortion and then once
[37:42.120 --> 37:47.120]  people have had abortions they tend to psychologically defend the abortion and
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.120]  get very very mad if you speak out against the abortion now Rick Perry is
[37:51.120 --> 37:56.120]  trying to get the legislature to propose a law here in the second most populist
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.120]  state also the second largest geographically after Alaska but the second
[38:01.120 --> 38:06.120]  most populist state with what 28 million people to make it to where you have to
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.120]  get a ultrasound before you have an abortion the media spending it claiming
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.120]  why an abortion is only $300 that's because it's subsidized by the federal
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.120]  government state government and Planned Parenthood they actually cost about a
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.120]  thousand so it ends up the money the abortionists get it's just you put in
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.120]  your 300 into the kitty you know abortion when I was in high school was
[38:25.120 --> 38:31.120]  300 bucks and still 300 bucks 20 years later but they're trying to spin it the
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.120]  truth is there are free clinics all over the state of Texas and all over the
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.120]  country where you can get an ultrasound if you're pregnant there's also many
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.120]  organizations and governments move to ban the 3d ultrasounds that they have in
[38:46.120 --> 38:51.120]  shopping malls in places which are like a hundred bucks where you get 3d photos of
[38:51.120 --> 38:55.120]  your child because when you see their eyelashes when you see their little
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.120]  fingers when you see them sucking their thumb you don't want to kill them you've
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.120]  now humanized you know you people got so freaked out in Iraq with the Marines
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.120]  throwing that puppy off the cliff because we've lost our empathy for fellow
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.120]  humans but we haven't seen simulated murders and killings of dogs on
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.120]  television like we've seen humans being simulated killed so we become
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.120]  sensitized our intellects our psyches our hearts become hardened and so many
[39:22.120 --> 39:27.120]  quote liberal comedians and social commentators make sickening jokes about
[39:27.120 --> 39:33.120]  abortion oh but then if you make some mild racial statement you need to be
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.120]  arrested see they're there trying to tell you that you can only have the
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.120]  speech that they approve of so continuing here we've got to get behind
[39:43.120 --> 39:49.120]  this in the Texas legislature it's quote women's choice they say but
[39:49.120 --> 39:53.120]  statistically and they break this down in different reports you can just pull
[39:53.120 --> 39:57.120]  up ultrasound reducing number of abortions you'll see the studies
[39:57.120 --> 40:03.120]  they've got out worldwide that when a woman sees that baby instead of going
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.120]  to the abortion clinic where they claim that they're giving you counseling but
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.120]  push you towards the abortion remember the famous phone calls a few years ago
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.120]  all over the u.s. where pro-life groups would call up and say yeah I want to
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.120]  give ten thousand dollars want to make sure it goes to black babies can I
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.120]  make sure it only goes to abort black babies oh absolutely sir absolutely
[40:24.120 --> 40:29.120]  we're with you on that and then the left covers their hatred of blacks by
[40:29.120 --> 40:38.120]  saying nobody wants those black babies really my family adopted a so-called
[40:38.120 --> 40:47.120]  minority baby my parents did now the truth is that the liberals try to keep
[40:47.120 --> 40:55.120]  non blacks from adopting black children and that's a big liberal cause to
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.120]  live by the black activists don't let whites adopt blacks let us keep our
[40:59.120 --> 41:03.120]  culture yeah let's just go ahead and kill those black babies because we don't
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.120]  want to actually get along with whitey we don't want to get along with what
[41:07.120 --> 41:16.120]  Chris Matthews called crackers in trying to invoke racial division the truth is
[41:16.120 --> 41:22.120]  there is more than a six month waiting list out there for disabled black
[41:22.120 --> 41:27.120]  children statistically the most unwanted there is a six month waiting list of
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.120]  good predominantly Christian families who've got giant hearts and souls who
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.120]  want to love those children there's a close to a year waiting list for
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.120]  mentally retarded and disabled Asian and Hispanic children and there are
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.120]  blacks there are whites there are Hispanics there are Asians there are
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.120]  people who want to adopt all those children there is close to a three year
[41:51.120 --> 41:57.120]  waiting list for a Caucasian baby and if that baby is blonde-haired blue-eyed
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.120]  you're talking over a four year waiting list you can pull those numbers up if
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.120]  the child has black hair and blue eyes or black hair and green the most
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.120]  coveted you're talking about a five year waiting list it's easier to get a
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.120]  liver than it is to get a black-haired blue-eyed or green-eyed child they are
[42:15.120 --> 42:20.120]  an absolute premium and it has come out and we have the senator from Georgia on
[42:20.120 --> 42:25.120]  before she was killed she was about to break major news but this has come out
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.120]  in other places of quotas for children CPSS quotas and that's why in so many
[42:30.120 --> 42:36.120]  CPS cases I fought where you'll have you know black people put cigarettes out on
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.120]  their kids you'll have Hispanics doing it you'll have other people doing it and
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.120]  and the CPS doesn't respond you see these reports all the time of a you know
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.120]  eight-year-old black child who weighed 20 pounds and was found in a crib filled
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.120]  with feces dead or a six-year-old that weighed you know 25 pounds found dead you
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.120]  see those articles all the time the mothers that admitted crack head no one
[42:57.120 --> 43:00.120]  cares about the baby the CPS doesn't take them because that's a black that
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.120]  should have been aborted to begin with according to these people I'm sorry if
[43:04.120 --> 43:10.120]  these are hard truths to hear but when you see CPS taking a child who's three
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.120]  and and falls off the swing and breaks a finger in front of witnesses
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.120]  blonde-haired blue-eyed when you see a family who won't give the vaccines that
[43:18.120 --> 43:21.120]  are newborn and there's no law to do it but they take them blonde-haired blue-eyed
[43:21.120 --> 43:27.120]  I mean this is well known it is worth hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[43:27.120 --> 43:33.120]  dollars now I knew so many cheerleaders in high school who went and got abortions
[43:33.120 --> 43:37.120]  friends of mine who had girlfriends and they come up with the 300 bucks their
[43:37.120 --> 43:43.120]  parents wouldn't even be told that 14 15 16 17-year-old girls were having abortions
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.120]  multiple times a year no one told those cheerleaders hey have that baby
[43:50.120 --> 43:53.120]  I guarantee you the parents would have wanted it the grandparents would have
[43:53.120 --> 43:58.120]  wanted it but even if they didn't want that that that cheerleaders baby nobody
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.120]  told that cheerleader that there were Christian organizations that would pay
[44:01.120 --> 44:06.120]  her over and that was back then a hundred thousand dollars on top of putting
[44:06.120 --> 44:10.120]  them in an apartment if they wanted paying for everything and giving them
[44:10.120 --> 44:15.120]  money for two years after the child is born for a total of over one hundred
[44:15.120 --> 44:20.120]  and fifty thousand dollars that's why you see these national billboards show a
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.120]  woman who looks depressed and it says pregnant thinking of an abortion call
[44:24.120 --> 44:29.120]  us there's help there is an alternative you call whether you're black Hispanic
[44:29.120 --> 44:34.120]  it doesn't matter they will help you have that baby they will help get that baby
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.120]  into a good family don't chop them up and if you don't like hearing that because
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.120]  you're pro-abortion face it spiritually face it psychologically you bought into
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.120]  abortion you've paid for them or you got friends that have just admit you're
[44:47.120 --> 44:56.120]  wrong and that is the beginning that is the beginning of healing ladies and
[44:56.120 --> 45:01.120]  gentlemen okay so I can't tell you how many times I've heard on talk radio not
[45:01.120 --> 45:04.120]  even on my own show but also my own show I mean I hear it every few weeks when
[45:04.120 --> 45:09.120]  they're having an abortion discussion the arrogant moralizing fake liberal
[45:09.120 --> 45:16.120]  21st century Nazi calls in and says oh who's gonna adopt for these black babies
[45:16.120 --> 45:23.120]  who's gonna adopt these Hispanic babies are you moralizing they want them dead
[45:23.120 --> 45:31.120]  they want them chopped up they want them dead dead dead dead dead dead so I've also
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.120]  studied this you can study this for yourself in many countries that are even
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.120]  pro-abortion they still want a sonogram even though it's not shown to the mother
[45:38.120 --> 45:42.120]  so they know the position of the baby of the fetus and sometimes there's
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.120]  medical complications that could be involved and so they need to know when
[45:46.120 --> 45:50.120]  they're going in there if they need to you know normally they want to do one after
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.120]  as well to make sure everything was cleaned out not in the United States
[45:55.120 --> 46:00.120]  and not in Latin America or Africa they they don't care if something gets left
[46:00.120 --> 46:03.120]  in there they don't care they don't tell women that they have a doubling on
[46:03.120 --> 46:11.120]  average this is conservative just pull up studies or abortion cancer studies
[46:11.120 --> 46:18.120]  and you'll see at least a 50% in uterine I mean your body if the baby needs to
[46:18.120 --> 46:24.120]  die 99% of the time and I've talked to medical doctors who deliver babies on
[46:24.120 --> 46:29.120]  this 99% of the time if that baby's down syndrome or that baby's deformed or
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.120]  that baby's got problems your body will shut off and it's called a miscarriage
[46:33.120 --> 46:39.120]  your body 99% of the time it's actually almost 100 it's 99 point something
[46:39.120 --> 46:42.120]  if you pull it up if you want to see the actual numbers your body will get rid of
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.120]  it okay we'll get rid of that baby and then it's not your fault and then you
[46:47.120 --> 46:52.120]  don't get a massive increase in cancer you go in to the middle of an incredible
[46:52.120 --> 46:58.120]  biological event with your body building and creating through that placenta a
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.120]  new life form within you you go in and snuff that out well all the hormones are
[47:03.120 --> 47:08.120]  aligned and everything's operating correctly and there are many women they
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.120]  get abortion after abortion after abortion listen we tell you that if you've
[47:11.120 --> 47:16.120]  had three consecutive flu shots it again doubles your chances of Alzheimer's
[47:16.120 --> 47:23.120]  there are scores of mainline studies don't believe me just search Alzheimer's
[47:23.120 --> 47:29.120]  flu shot Alzheimer's studies don't believe me check out all these things I'm
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.120]  telling you and whether it's sodium fluoride giving a seven-fold increase in
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.120]  cancer in men three-fold between men and women average together and that's in
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.120]  the video we put out with mainline US government documents linked under it
[47:41.120 --> 47:47.120]  that's just a public service announcement if we come on the air and we break down
[47:47.120 --> 47:54.120]  the fact that abortion more than doubles your cancers of uterine cancer cancer of
[47:54.120 --> 47:59.120]  the uterus it massively increases cancer of the fallopian tubes cancer of the
[47:59.120 --> 48:05.120]  ovaries cancer of the cervix they don't know why but it increases cancer of the
[48:05.120 --> 48:12.120]  intestines of the colon it's linked to more breast cancer because it causes
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.120]  that's one of the big confirmed links is breast cancer because they're in a
[48:17.120 --> 48:22.120]  hormone flux connection dealing with metabolic rates with the uterus and the
[48:22.120 --> 48:29.120]  reproductive system so if they if you get an abortion and they don't do an
[48:29.120 --> 48:36.120]  ultrasound after it that's malpractice in Western Europe I mean I can't tell you
[48:36.120 --> 48:41.120]  how many women I hear about in the news and how many women I knew women who I had
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.120]  you know friends who were who were dating who would get toxic shock who would get
[48:45.120 --> 48:51.120]  blood poisoning who would get flesh eating bacteria inside of them because I
[48:51.120 --> 48:56.120]  don't want to get graphic here but the doctors get sloppy and well you know it
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.120]  it's it we're trying to save people here if they leave and I'm not going to get
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.120]  into it the doctors are supposed to put everything back together to make sure
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.120]  they got it a lot of times they don't okay or they I'm done talking about it
[49:09.120 --> 49:15.120]  the point is this stuff is going on and there needs to be an ultrasound after
[49:15.120 --> 49:24.120]  the event okay now Rick Perry and I've got a saluting and we'll find out if he
[49:24.120 --> 49:27.120]  thought he had the votes in the house and if this is a political stunt as he
[49:27.120 --> 49:33.120]  gets ready to run for president but Perry will push anti-abortion measure UPI
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.120]  Texas Governor Rick Perry said he will introduce emergency legislation requiring
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.120]  women seeking abortions to first get a sonogram of the fetus Perry speaking
[49:43.120 --> 49:46.120]  Saturday at the anti-abortion rally in Austin said the measure would also
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.120]  include the requirement that women listen to the sound of the heartbeat the
[49:50.120 --> 49:56.120]  Austin American states have reported it's medically needed to begin with I
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.120]  don't know if you can make them because it hadn't been outlawed yet make them
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.120]  listen to the heartbeat but there at least needs to be the sonogram and how
[50:03.120 --> 50:06.120]  about not even make them look at it they're going to want to look 99% or more
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.120]  I mean I bet a hundred percent are going to want to look at that baby and but
[50:11.120 --> 50:14.120]  just so you don't need to look if you don't want we have to do this for
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.120]  medical reasons and then they're going to want to look and then they're going to
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.120]  find out the truth now you know what Planned Parenthoods are going to do
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.120]  they're going to run ultrasounds and other abortuaries other abortion
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.120]  mills and not tune it in just right I've been there for three ultrasounds of my
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.120]  children and you before they tune it up you don't see those eyes those hands

[54:34.120 --> 54:41.120]  being judged right now it's still repent the hairs on your arm will stand
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.120]  alright so Rick Perry deserves credit he said when someone has all the information
[54:46.120 --> 54:50.120]  the right choice will be made the choice for life Perry said the crowd between
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.120]  4,000 and 5,000 that means it was probably 50,000 at the steps of the
[54:54.120 --> 55:01.120]  capital since 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision 50 million 51 plus 50
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.120]  million children have lost their chances that's a catastrophic number twice the
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.120]  population of the entire state said Perry and most of them black or Hispanic
[55:10.120 --> 55:16.120]  Perry also designated for quick approval in the state's legislative session
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.120]  starting January 11th a crackdown on sanctuary cities for legal immigrants
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.120]  stronger property owners rights tighter voter identification requirements at
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.120]  the polls I gotta say I like this whole agenda I can't believe I'm here agreeing
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.120]  with Rick Perry but he's really flip-flopped but he's definitely had a
[55:34.120 --> 55:40.120]  shawl of Tarsus conversion on the road to Damascus or he's getting
[55:40.120 --> 55:43.120]  he's getting prepared to run for president and getting his conservative
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.120]  bona fides in line but as long as he doesn't sabotage this vote at the last
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.120]  and try to stop it all I can say is good get behind this big time now this is
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.120]  the type of news that I see constantly and don't even cover here because I
[55:56.120 --> 55:59.120]  don't like getting into it it's painful to even think about but we've got to
[55:59.120 --> 56:05.120]  talk about these things doctor allegedly killed babies with scissors and even
[56:05.120 --> 56:12.120]  the New York Times is reporting on this and it goes on to say the grand jury
[56:12.120 --> 56:20.120]  found that they would reportedly keep babies alive on shelves and I've seen
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.120]  many other cases that are similar to this and there's many famous cases were
[56:24.120 --> 56:30.120]  pro-lifers we need to interview some of those survivors they're now full grown
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.120]  some of them dig them out of trash cans in the medical waste bins I mean they
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.120]  don't even dismember them in the partial birth abortion and see legally they
[56:40.120 --> 56:46.120]  say as long as the baby has been killed they take scissors and poke a hole in
[56:46.120 --> 56:49.120]  the back of their head to suck their brains out I'm sorry that's how they
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.120]  kill a eight-month-old baby who could be adopted right there that's how they do
[56:53.120 --> 56:57.120]  it but if the baby comes all the way out of the womb all the way out on to the
[56:57.120 --> 57:03.120]  on to the bed then they legally are supposed to adopt the baby and call
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.120]  the paramedics it's a total oxymoron of you can kill the baby inside but not on
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.120]  the outside in that third trimester and so what they do is they put them in
[57:11.120 --> 57:16.120]  cold buckets of water they put them on shelves and then when workers freak out
[57:16.120 --> 57:20.120]  by seeing the child dying they finally have a pang of humanity when there's
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.120]  people lined up around the block to adopt them they call the police and these
[57:23.120 --> 57:31.120]  aborture wary people go to jail well why are they going to jail for doing
[57:31.120 --> 57:40.120]  something that is legal two seconds before and so there's that report
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.120]  reportedly of the dead babies the living babies and the rest of it here's
[57:44.120 --> 57:49.120]  another one this is a New York Times squalid abortion clinic escaped state
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.120]  oversight well they let them do whatever they want and it is a squalid for years
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.120]  to help officials missed some unsettling patterns at the three-story brick
[57:56.120 --> 58:00.120]  abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue it was always openly way past the time the
[58:00.120 --> 58:04.120]  pizza place next door closed at midnight the women who emerge from it often poor
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.120]  blacks and Hispanics appeared dazed and in pain and sometimes left in ambulances
[58:08.120 --> 58:15.120]  the doctor who ran the clinic Kermit Goslin Gosneal had been sued 15 times
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.120]  for malpractice two women died under his care and it just goes on I'm not going
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.120]  to read what's in this article it's too gruesome but that's the type of stuff
[58:23.120 --> 58:28.120]  we've got here let's just stop the abortions okay let's stop them let's
[58:28.120 --> 58:32.120]  stop them let's educate people and show them what's going on it's not a right
[58:32.120 --> 58:37.120]  it's murder okay it's murder certainly in the third trimester who can disagree
[58:37.120 --> 58:47.120]  let's ban third trimester abortion this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[58:47.120 --> 58:53.120]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.120 --> 58:57.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:57.120 --> 59:01.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:01.120 --> 59:05.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:05.120 --> 59:10.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.120 --> 59:14.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.120 --> 59:18.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.120 --> 59:22.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.120 --> 59:26.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.120 --> 59:30.120]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.120 --> 59:34.120]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.120]  We have a guest from the Epoch Times joining us Stephen Gregory about the playing
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:53.120]  at the White House of the incredible anti-U.S. military anti-U.S. song
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.120]  The Motherland about killing U.S. troops in Korea joining us the editor
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.120]  Matthew Robertson was the writer of the article Stephen Gregory the editor will
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.120]  be joining us coming up in 30 minutes I appreciate Webster Tarpley coming on
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  on short notice because he's a real expert on things Central Asia and Russia
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.120]  well he's an expert on just about everything that goes on geopolitically
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:21.120]  around the globe really learn to respect his analysis and of course
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.120]  suicide bomber kills 31 at Russian airport and that's a Doma dead off
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right Doma dead over and that's the biggest
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.120]  airport in Russia it's in Moscow and they're saying a suicide bomber but
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.120]  we know how many of these have been faked in the past now is it NATO is it the U.S.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  is it the Russian government or is it a real Chechen terrorist joining us is
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.120]  Webster Griffin Tarpley doctorate of history he's also an economist and the
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.120]  author of several books exposing Barack Obama and we carry those books as well
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.120]  in full wars dot com Webster thank you for joining us hello Alex it's the
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.120]  airport is Doma get over and it happens to be the main gateway from Moscow
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  towards the North Caucasus and the Caucasus meaning precisely the area of
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:16.120]  Chechenia and Georgia and these other small ethnic nations there in the
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  Caucasus and trans Caucasus that have been the scene of so much
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  orchestrated terrorism so it obviously when anything like this happens the
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.120]  prime suspects immediately become Chechen based organizations or
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:37.120]  organizations operating in or around Chechnya but also maybe Georgia where
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  there was after all the war back in August of 2008 however behind these
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:51.120]  their patrons always looms the question of NATO intelligence and the desire to
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  destabilize Russia promote the further breakup of Russia and so forth I have
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:02.120]  here my my book that you mentioned Obama the postmodern coup one of the essays
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:07.120]  Obama campaign linked to Chechen terrorism and this is about the fact that
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.120]  the the principal Chechen terror organization I think there's no other
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:18.120]  way to say it is stationed here in Washington DC funded by US taxpayers
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.120]  with a with an office that I guess the National Endowment for Democracy and
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.120]  and the Russians have recreated repeated the ex that demanded the expedition of
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  this guy but that is that has never happened then of course we have the
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  pattern of things going on in Russia at last March there were I believe a
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  couple of female suicide bombers who put off put on a bomb in the Moscow subway
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.120]  or maybe they they never found out who did that but very dramatic was a
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.120]  little bit more than a year ago a bomb in the Moscow to St. Petersburg
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.120]  fast train and of course back behind that we have the the Moscow theater
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.120]  hostage taking which turned into a massacre we have the best line school
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.120]  massacre of September 2004 before that there was a hospital massacre all the
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.120]  while bombs in the Moscow subway and so forth so this is generally attributed
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:18.120]  to Chechens again I say Chechens you know it's notorious and various Russian
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.120]  media and other media have gone through this that these are supported by the
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.120]  West I'm meaning meaning NATO intelligence and then there's that that
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.120]  strange fascist dictator Sakashvili in Georgia right and installed by a
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.120]  color revolution say what we've got one more long segment with you I want you
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.120]  to come back to recap the history of this look at different geopolitical aims
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.120]  behind this and what this signifies if the West through the Chechen operatives
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:52.120]  is behind it and and and why you wouldn't even look at Moscow being behind
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  it I will get your view on that straight ahead Webster Griffin Tarpley

[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:09.120]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.120]  we are now eight minutes into our number two we're going to be talking to the editor
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:21.120]  of the epoch Times dealing with the Chinese press celebrating the White House
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  guest the Chinese pianist with Hu Jintao last Wednesday playing the song the motherland
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.120]  which celebrates Chinese victories over US groups in Korea talks about shooting down
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  the jackals why would they do something why would Hu Jintao announce that the
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.120]  dollar needs to be replaced why why are the elites selling us out to China
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.120]  but we're talking to Webster Griffin terribly for the rest of this segment
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.120]  doctor of history also an economist joining us to and of course he's written
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:58.120]  books on this subject how Obama and others but our CIA is funding a lot of
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:02.120]  Muslim extremists they funded them openly under Clinton out of Albania
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  and NATO funded them as well to attack the Serbs we're not seeing the Serbs
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.120]  or wonderful Boy Scouts the point is that was all staged we know that it
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.120]  at the time broke it down then it came out in Indian news and Pakistan news
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:20.120]  and then it came out the Chicago Tribune that the head of the Mumbai attack was
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.120]  CIA that whole attack on the shopping mall and hotel that came out years later
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.120]  to have been accurate we know the West did launch the 888 888 attack during
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  the Olympics when Putin and Bush and others were meeting in China and
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.120]  Beijing for the 2008 Olympics that it was a hoax the media said Russia had
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.120]  attacked Georgia when Georgia had attacked Russian controlled areas of
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.120]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia and I just went with the facts and a week later
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.120]  they had to admit okay the Russians didn't attack people said what are you
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.120]  doing standing up for the Russians I just go off the facts now the evidence
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.120]  points towards FSB and 99 being caught in a fourth apartment building
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  planning exigen bombs and that came out in the Moscow papers and some of those
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  reporters got killed and so I have no doubt that the czars before them the
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.120]  communists and now the current Russian government does stage provocations
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.120]  most big government stage false flags partly may differ with me about the
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:21.120]  1999 attacks but we're looking at who could be behind this and we're getting
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.120]  our first look this only happened five six hours ago Moscow airport blast
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:31.120]  FSB false flag part of anti-Putin campaign or real separatist attack
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  that's the headline by Steve Watson and Paul Watson at prisonplanet.com it's
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  also up at info wars.com and so let's go back here because we know four years
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  ago Bush put out the press release on whitehouse.gov saying four groups of
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  freedom fighters are attacking the Iranians inside Iran we're funding them
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.120]  what a provocation towards Iran three of the four groups were Al Qaeda based
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  number three in Al Qaeda commanding one one of them was Kurd based and then
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  our media says Iran is backing Al Qaeda when Iran's the opposite as you know
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:09.120]  Webster Shiite and the other branch of Islam Shiites being 20% the other
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.120]  branch being roughly 80 there's one percent that's a few other subgroups
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.120]  but but I mean what's really going on here clear it up for us give us your
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.120]  first look view on who you think has the motive who stands to gain is it
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:27.120]  Moscow is it NATO is it the West or is it Chechens operating on their own
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.120]  well we have to remember there's a presidential election now in Russia in
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.120]  2012 and the number one goal of the entire Anglo-American intelligence
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  establishment and this is a hysterical commitment that they have is to
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:46.120]  prevent Putin from switching back from Prime Minister to president and they
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:52.120]  there have been a very interesting WikiLeaks in part of their dumping has
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:59.120]  revealed the transcripts of meetings held in well the US Embassy to Moscow
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.120]  with the presence of Michael McFoul who is the the Russia director of the
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  National Security Council and he of course is a lightweight he was a cheerleader
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.120]  for Yeltsin he was a cheerleader for the color revolution in Ukraine
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:19.120]  anything that the US Stooges do in Russia is democratic if Russia if Yeltsin
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.120]  shoots up the parliament that's democratic if we have kleptocrats in Kiev
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.120]  that's democratic so what McFoul was doing was to try to marshal his forces
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.120]  which turned out to be various Russian has been politicians people like
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:39.120]  Kasirov and Ruchkov people you've never heard of as well as some human rights
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.120]  people but one you may have heard of Gary Kasparov the former chess champion
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.120]  but his friend of course is this guy Limonov who was a national Bolshevik
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  which basically means a fascist with skinhead rowdies in the streets so
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.120]  our government is backing Bolsheviks the national Bolsheviks again that's
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.120]  it's more like a Nazi than a than a than a real communist so if these
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.120]  distinctions mean anything so they get together these gaggle of people and
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.120]  there's there's they they're the candidate they'd like to put up against
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.120]  Putin is a guy called Nemtsov who was essentially the one of the masterminds
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.120]  of the destruction of the Russian economy IMF shock therapy deregulation
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.120]  privatization hyperinflation a bubble of banking crisis every every disaster
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.120]  in the book when it comes to economics this guy Nemtsov had visited on the
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  Russian people but they said he'll we'll call them a democratic force we'll put
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.120]  them up we'll give them a lot of money from the US taxpayer and see what we
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.120]  can do and I think they've decided now that it's hopeless and they've decided
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.120]  to recourse to these to these things that we see now I also would I would
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.120]  look look at things as being a little bit open-ended right the London
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.120]  Economist has announced essentially that 2011 is the year of the long-awaited
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.120]  Middle East war right for the past seven or eight years really since the
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:04.120]  immediate aftermath of 9-11 the other big the big question like the other shoe
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.120]  ready to drop after after Afghanistan after Iraq is what's going to happen
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  with Iran they've just been some some conferences over the weekend in
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.120]  Turkey about the Iranian nuclear program they have ended with basically no
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  result and maybe this is now the beginning of some kind of a buildup
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.120]  towards Iran but in the meantime it's a warning to Russia but certainly the
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.120]  idea that I think they have is that they their ability to influence affairs in
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  Russia has gone down to very very low levels they can't install their
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.120]  puppet Nemtsov and therefore they they may be doing this that would be a
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.120]  first yes I guess in the first hours after such an event are you talking
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:50.120]  about the economist article last week that had the headline not another war
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.120]  or no the first one of the new year was there's going to be a war in the
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.120]  Middle East because of the trip the very significant you know conventional
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  ballistic missile buildup by by Hezbollah in in Lebanon in particular
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.120]  course there's a government crisis going on there the other thing I would
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  put in is that there's a manic mood in the State Department in the CIA
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  remember Tunisia is just a week ago right so a week ago the US feels that
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.120]  they with with the help of WikiLeaks and Assange were able to overthrow the
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:25.120]  government in Tunisia and since then serious disturbances have broken out
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  in Albania and in Yemen and we have these Palestinian papers against the
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.120]  the PLO against the Palestinian authority which is likely to lead to
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.120]  kinds of political chaos there so somebody's lighting the match here but
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.120]  but Webster boiling this down again we have the headline Moscow Airport
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.120]  Blast FSB false flag part of an anti-Putin campaign or real separatist
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.120]  attack I mean how does this help the West to stage an event when even the
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.120]  White House advisors are telling Obama have a big terror attack that will
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:06.120]  help you that will get your approval rating up even the shooting God has
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  approval rating up Gallup reports by 15 points and when we go back to
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:16.120]  Putin somewhat unpopular going into that 99 election with the
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.120]  adult alcoholic Yeltsin who couldn't even get out of a wheelchair and then
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.120]  magically there's bombings in and around Moscow Putin gets to roll into
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.120]  Chesney of the strong leader his approval rating goes way up I mean are you
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:35.120]  saying that there is an evidence of the 99 apartment building bombings being
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  an FSB connected let's talk about that for a minute that stuff in 1999 you've
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  got to remember what kind of a Russian state that was that was the Russian
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:50.120]  state destroyed with tremendous inroads and incursions by NATO intelligence
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  remember Yeltsin was a complete IMF NATO puppet that's all he was and parts
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.120]  whole parts of the state apparatus starting with the economic so how was
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.120]  Putin able to maneuver in well it's basically saying you know that at that
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.120]  point the candidate the candidate of the U.S. and the British to become the
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.120]  head of Russia was the same them off the same IMF shock therapist but at the
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  same time they had this thing going a parallel operation which was the
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:23.120]  dismemberment of Russia they wanted to keep the weak for the Yeltsin in power
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.120]  at the same time have a dismemberment operation also you think the bombings
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.120]  were carried out by NATO affiliated groups to prop up Yeltsin using using
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.120]  cutouts that they had in the penetrated and completely subverted and
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:41.120]  corrupted Russian security establishment and at that point Putin looked
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.120]  at it and said all right you want to do this I'll ride the tiger I'll judo
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.120]  your terrorist attacks and I'll take over and you won't like it as we've seen
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.120]  and they're still cursing themselves that they ever let Putin get into power
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.120]  what's the evidence because what's the evidence because we know that a city
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:03.120]  police department did reportedly arrest FSB with the hexagon in a fourth building
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.120]  it doesn't prove anything it just proves that that you know NATO has deep pockets
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.120]  and there were a lot of very very poor people running around in Moscow in those
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.120]  days man you had the whole middle class selling their possessions in the in the
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.120]  subway so I don't necessarily buy that but I do buy the bombing of the last
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.120]  year being tied to the Chechens because they took credit for those and we know
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.120]  the Chechens are as you mentioned earlier run directly out of the state
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  department so there's no doubt that's going on right and I would I would
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.120]  I would take your FSB full flag if you're going to keep that at all and put
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:43.120]  that at the end the prime suspect are always NATO back Chechens NATO back
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.120]  Georgians and once you get down there right there's Pakistan there's
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.120]  English a tier right there there are disgruntled individuals from every one
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:57.120]  of these small ethnic groups again Georgia what's the goal then how does it hurt
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  Putin to bomb this airport in Moscow it simply it's done periodically that is
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.120]  it's a good question because this has been going on now on a large scale
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.120]  for a long time the second the second phase of these things is usually that
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.120]  the Russian government is blamed for example when you have that Moscow Theatre
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.120]  massacre the general tone of the Western media was not to say terrorists are bad
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.120]  and should be fought but that the Russian government did it all wrong or with
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.120]  the school right that the the school was not you know these are bloody monsters
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.120]  who killed all these children but rather oh the Russian government made made
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.120]  tactical mistakes I'm sure we're going to hear now that that Russian aviation is
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  not safe and maybe you better not go there and maybe you better reroute your
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.120]  airplane you've got Europe not wanting the naked body scanners and Russia not
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.120]  wanting it so this could also be used domestically here to crack down more is
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.120]  that what you're saying so much bigger than this do a few more minutes with us

[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.120]  okay going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley Webster look I'm just looking for
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:09.120]  the truth here and I know Russia does a lot of corrupt things and has its own
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:16.120]  interest I know our corrupt system does it as well I mean 888 was a giant hoax
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.120]  and it was admitted the difference is that the the US is generally an aggressive
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:28.120]  attack posture the Russian posture much more defensive and I think that's
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  that's the thing that has to be stressed and you know when these when these
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.120]  events occur if they were no background and no pattern going back you know 15
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  years you could let you know you can look in in every direction of the compass
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.120]  okay I'm just saying I'm looking for the truth so in the three and a half minutes
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.120]  we got left what's the motive here for you who's behind it from the the key
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:57.120]  bono well the the US you know with Obama was attempting to do this deception
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  operation the strategic deception around the so-called reset of relations with
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:08.120]  Russia and that is included now the the ratification by the US of the of the
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:13.120]  Star Treaty right the strategic arms treaty however all of this had a goal
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.120]  the goal was to get Putin and his faction out of public life get in Medvedev
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  who is a much weaker figure and then proceed with more destabilizations with
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.120]  the soft power methods hopefully from their point of view including a color
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.120]  revolution taking advantage of the relative weakness of Medvedev as a
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.120]  political leader isn't he stronger because that was a test of him in 888
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.120]  with the Georgia situation I know I that was that was Putin Putin all the way
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:49.120]  certainly the Medvedev by the way Medvedev made a response to this which I
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.120]  thought looked rather weak he looked very depressed rather passive quite weak
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  not you know not a strong rallying defiant figure so I think you realize this
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  is not good for him individually so the idea is if you if you have this
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.120]  gaggle of opposition forces that are worthless and you can't subvert from
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  within and your your ability to have a color revolution from the US point of
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.120]  view is very limited well then you've got to go back to treating Russia as a
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  unit and a great power and then you go back to your long-term Caucasus based
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:31.120]  subversion and geographic breakup story sure encirclement well you know it's
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.120]  encirclement of course but specifically the London Economist again the British
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  are always the main center of anti-Russian hatred and this goes back
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.120]  200 years to post-Napoleon the London Economist has always had this idea
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  that you can use the Caucasus trans-Caucasus this ethnic labyrinth of
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.120]  small countries to break up Russia geographically right not just break up
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:59.120]  the Soviet Union that they've done but now break up the Russian Federation so
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.120]  if you can't do the internal subversion using you know the young dupes and
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:07.120]  young nihilists with a color revolution then go back to your ethnic based
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  terror-assisted strategy and it seems to me that may be what and then try to
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.120]  invoke a Russian invasions into those satellites yes of course and then that's
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  that weakens Russia you see that's that's what that was what was done in the
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:26.120]  mid-1990s right the the Chechen war really started in what 94-95 so just like
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  the West is tied up in Afghanistan Iraq they're trying to suck them into a new
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:37.120]  Afghan type situation but in other areas of the Caucasus the oligarchs you know
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.120]  they're also not happy their darling Kondarkovsky is being kept in jail you
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.120]  can imagine if we had Warren Buffett or Bill Gates in jail in this country that
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.120]  would create a somewhat different political climate thank you so much
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.120]  we'll continue to talk to you as this unfolds thank you so much we're on the

[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:10.120]  June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.120]  perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the

[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:12.120]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.120]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.120]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:29.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:02.120]  the epoch times.com and they have a amazing report that we link to on infowars.com
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:07.120]  we link to part one but there's also a part two Chinese pianist plays propaganda
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:13.120]  tune at the winehouse us humiliated in eyes of Chinese by song used to inspire
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.120]  anti-Americanism now we know the Chinese people are greatly oppressed they're
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.120]  great people we know that Mao Zedong has the greatest mass murder record in
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.120]  history even greater than the monster Hitler and the monster Stalin but to
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:33.120]  have them play this song the motherland that's in a popular movie in China
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.120]  dealing with the Chinese regulars fighting Americans in Korea during the
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:44.120]  Korean War it's just incredible and this was aired Chinese TV covered it Chinese
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.120]  bloggers praised it Lang Lang the pianist talked about he chose it to
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:53.120]  basically glorify China I mean it's one thing to have who Gentile come out
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.120]  before he came last week and say the dollars going down the Chinese currency
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.120]  will be the World Reserve currency China being the biggest holder of our debt
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:06.120]  what an amazing move we see but to see all this these other slights that
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.120]  Americans don't recognize but in China are seen as rubbing our face in it
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.120]  imagine of an American president went over there and played some anti-Chinese
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:21.120]  song or had their P.S. do it so it's really kind of an inside joke for I
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.120]  guess a billion three hundred million Chinese but a lot of them aren't
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:32.120]  laughing and so joining us is the editor Stephen Gregory of the epoch times
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.120]  dot com again their online version their print version very powerful around
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.120]  the world very effective and pro-liberty and we really appreciate their
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:44.120]  report that they were the only East Coast newspaper report on Bilderberg
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.120]  2008 when I was there covering Obama the fact that they made the deal to
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.120]  have him get the nomination when he was quote out of pocket none of the other
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.120]  media could find him it was the epoch times that covered to give you an idea
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  of the work they do and they've got a lot of other important articles dealing
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:06.120]  with people that were paid to greet who Gentile last week and so he joins us
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.120]  now hopefully about five minutes in the next hour but Mr. Gregory good to have
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  you here with us it's great to be with you Alex tell us about I think it's
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.120]  talking to folks at the paper you really are one of the biggest experts on
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:25.120]  what's happening in China what this song means and give it ties into a larger
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  pattern yes certainly this song was the theme song for a movie battle battle on
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.120]  Shang-Gong and this is a battle triangle hill which is not well known to
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:47.120]  America but in the Chinese Communist Party narrative about the Korean War
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:54.120]  it's very important it's treated as a major victory over US forces and the
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:00.120]  song is a praise of how beautiful China is but at the end of the song there's
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:09.120]  a verse which which says that when friends are here there is fine wine but
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  if the jackal comes what beats it is the hunting life and in the song the jackal
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:19.120]  of the United States and since that movie played for decades now in China this
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.120]  song has been the leading song for promoting anti-Americanism in China
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:30.120]  and so for this song to be played in the White House at a state dinner with
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:35.120]  President Obama and Putin's child president was a tremendous insult to
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.120]  the United States going into the White House and playing a song
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.120]  for most hatred of an opposition to the United States
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.120]  well if I played the old country music song from the 50s in 1814 we took a
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.120]  little trip along with Colonel Jackson and the mighty Mississippi we took a
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:55.120]  little bacon and we took a little beans and we whipped the bloody British at
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.120]  the town of New Orleans and it goes on from there about running the British
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:06.120]  down to the Gulf of Mexico that was 220 something years ago this is this is
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  different because this is something that's currently popularized and you
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.120]  link in the article written by Matthew Robertson to the celebrations in China
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  and the fact that the message was clearly taken
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:23.120]  can you talk about this history of humiliations of America and why it's
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.120]  being done from your view and why they would do this right there at a White
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  House dinner with President Obama in attendance
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  sure Alex I think the fundamental thing is that the Chinese Communist Party
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.120]  has recognized from the very beginning that they are in a life and death struggle
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:50.120]  struggle with the Democratic class as long as the United States exists at the
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  pre-democratic and prosperous country the example of the United States is a
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:01.120]  repute to the authoritarianism of the CCP no matter how strong the propaganda
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  is inside China our example is still attractive to the Chinese
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.120]  but if they can lobby our government to crack down on internet speech and free
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.120]  speech zones now it can normalize their authoritarian system and to see our
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120]  media and I'm sorry to interrupt that's powerful what you just said though sir
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.120]  the editor of the epoch Times I've now seen our media actually praising
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.120]  China and saying they can get things done and almost no criticism of their
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:36.120]  unbelievable human rights degradations yes the media the media in the west and
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.120]  this is this is also to get back to your your point about there being a pattern
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  involved in the pattern of humiliation of the United States the media in the
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.120]  United States has badly misunderstood China the Chinese Communist Party and
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:58.120]  the Chinese Communist regime and since Nixon went to China in 1972 US
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:04.120]  president US administration has badly misunderstood and badly informed about
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:10.120]  the Chinese Communist Party and so what the United States administration
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  have not understood is the CCP views this as an enemy and an enemy that they
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  have a long-term plan to see to support and our policy towards China of
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.120]  engagement has been an attempt to treat them as friends and this has been
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.120]  simply very naive we can trade with the Chinese we can of course have all kinds
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.120]  of relations with the Chinese we should be very clearheaded about what the
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:44.120]  CCP is and what the CCP is doing when when Nixon visited China in 1972 there
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:50.120]  was a picture that was used throughout China after his visit Nixon is getting
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.120]  off the play and he has a big grin on his face and stretching his arm out to
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:01.120]  shake hands with Joe and why Joe at that time had a bad arm and his arm is how
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:07.120]  close to his body his face is very close and what the Chinese propaganda
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.120]  did with this picture which shows Nixon reaching out and Joe with his hand
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.120]  close to his body is saying look how badly the United States wants to reach
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.120]  out to it they're reaching out to us now this is this is a tiny subtle detail
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.120]  but it's how the Chinese people have an indoctrinated by the CCP to begin
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  thinking about the United States from the very beginning why does Obama
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.120]  continue to bow I noticed when he bowed last year and again this week to
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  Hu Jintao the Hu Jintao just didn't even tip his head in any way how is that
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:47.120]  being received in China I think that in general Chinese propaganda is going to
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  play up any opportunity to show the United States as weak or the United States
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:05.120]  as being inservient towards China you know as for President Obama's tipping
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  of the head towards Hu Jintao this is his understanding of democratic manner
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.120]  my understanding about how to relate to the foreign head of state and you know I
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.120]  would simply say that in the context of the relationship with the Chinese regime
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:29.120]  I don't think that's helped to bow to the Chinese state
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.120]  so where is all this going because I'm not a China expert but you know compared
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.120]  to the general public I read about it every day and try to study it and have
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  studied the history of China I mean I read the Chinese government approved
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.120]  publications and for those that don't know they shut down the only free
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  magazine that had been up a few years in China just a month ago so all publications
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  are approved and I read the big Chinese dailies and it's America's week we own
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  their debt they are our enemy we're preparing for war against them we are
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.120]  encircling them they've got 90 plus percent of rare earth mineral mines all
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  over the world they're giving out more money in the IMF and World Bank now to
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:11.120]  third world countries I mean China obviously is racing around they lobbied
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  to get our Panama Canal I see all sorts of warlike statements by them I don't
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  see it out of the Russians I saw it out of the Russians I'd be talking about it
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.120]  and it really is a threat I know it's come out in our news they've been caught
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.120]  selling AK-47s to street gangs 14 years ago they've got thousands of front
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:34.120]  companies and Chinese mafias unfolding controlled by the government I mean I do
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.120]  see China as a very serious threat especially because our own government
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.120]  at so many corporate levels have sold out to them I mean am I overstating that
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.120]  or I mean as somebody who's deeply researched this the editor of the Epoch Times
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:52.120]  give us your take on it the Chinese regime has been using every
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:59.120]  mean available to them to weaken the position of the United States I don't
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.120]  think you're overstating it but I do think that we need to be clear if the
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:10.120]  United States is simply clear on its own principle and stays firm on its own
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.120]  principles and don't understand if you've been right and let that guide
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:21.120]  policy the Chinese regime appears to be very strong in fact it's very weak in
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:27.120]  2009 radio radiation had an interview with a professor at Beijing University
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  and he was quoted as saying that in 2009 there were over 200,000 mass protest
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:39.120]  mass riot in China that is a huge huge number and what it points to is
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.120]  the Chinese that the Chinese regime is rapidly deteriorating
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  is great instability well that was my next point they've got these entire
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.120]  new cities they've built that are almost entirely empty this real estate bubble
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.120]  I see the YouTube videos that quickly get pulled down by the Google parent company
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:59.120]  who's in bed with the Chinese Communist and there's this illusion that the
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.120]  Chinese people are anti-America but I think what you're saying when I've
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.120]  researched is that they're trying to create a fake communist nationalism
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.120]  against the US to rally their people against the US and the West so their
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.120]  people won't rally against the authoritarian hardcore oppression I see
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:23.120]  the YouTube videos of farmers having their tiny pieces of land taken rushing
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.120]  Chinese troops with guns and even you know defeating them and so absolutely
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.120]  China is on the verge of revolution and China doesn't want us knowing that
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  meanwhile our Western governments are almost like trying to prop them up break that down
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.120]  yeah I think there are two things at least two things going on
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:48.120]  at the same time one is the Chinese people who were the greatest victims
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.120]  of the Chinese Communist Party oppression regime the Chinese people are deeply
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  poisoned by the propaganda of the Chinese regime that's on the one hand
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:02.120]  on the other hand the Chinese people increasingly are recognizing that
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:07.120]  the Chinese Communist Party's rule has to end one of the biggest unreported stories
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.120]  in the world something the f of times has devoted a lot of space to is
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.120]  what's called in Chinese the toidon movement the movement to withdraw from the Chinese Communist Party
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.120]  at this moment 88 million Chinese in China and around the world
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:27.120]  have withdrawn either from the Chinese Communist Party or its affiliated youth
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:33.120]  organization and this is this is something which the Chinese Communist Party
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.120]  is very afraid of Falun Gong practitioners for taking the lead
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.120]  in helping the Chinese people in China understand the nature of the CCP
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  and understand how catastrophic the CCP has been in China
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.120]  Why is China so threatened the Chinese Communist Party separate from the people
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.120]  by the Falun Gong A and then B here's an example
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:03.120]  Paul Watson the editor of prisonplanet.com one of my big news sites lives in England
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.120]  his wife is Eon Watson and she speaks your perfect English she's
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.120]  I guess you'd say anglified but but her but she has family you know that lives
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.120]  in China really nice folks and she just wrote an article or contributed to it
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.120]  about a ran corporation document about war with China and it wasn't even an
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.120]  anti-communist party article just a dry piece and they got word their family got threatened
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  they got word you shut up you don't write now she is British and there's the long
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.120]  arm of the Chinese Communist Party telling her you shut up you know trying to tell
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.120]  my website you shut up I mean what have you guys gone through with the fact that
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  you're reporting on them well from the very beginning the people of time
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:55.120]  has experienced a lot of interference in the CCP I mean one of their
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.120]  one of their top priorities is to shut us down in 2000 he had a
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:06.120]  reporters throw inside China of course it didn't operate openly and operated
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  find destiny but these this was a bureau in a couple of cities and in December of
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:19.120]  2000 he had several dozen people who worked for us scooped up and raised and
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:25.120]  many of them was in the prison they suffered severe torture we have columnists
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:29.120]  people of time columnists who I've been in for the last few years
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.120]  unfortunately sir your phone started breaking up there try to speak right into
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.120]  your microphone and repeat about your reporters getting scooped up okay is this
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:45.120]  better Alex yes go ahead okay and in 2000 we had several dozen reporters inside
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.120]  China scooped up and raised many of them was in the prison many of them suffered
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  severe torture in major cities around the west there have been our paper has
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:04.120]  started with many ways for the Chinese columnist party in in Hong Kong that
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  that were employed by the CCP broke into our offices there and smashed our
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:18.120]  printing press there and so you know that their opposition to us has been
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  very strong because we give our Chinese language edition communicate directly
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  to the web and print the Chinese inside China around the world and it's
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.120]  delivering a message of course about the CCP the CCP does not want the Chinese
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:39.120]  people to be there well incredible that these type of things could go on where
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.120]  do you see China going and I know it's hard to predict but where do you see
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.120]  China in its relationship to the west going in relationship to its own
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.120]  domestic operations going and I want to come back and get into some of the
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:59.120]  limited abuses that this government means out to people sure sure I see the
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:06.120]  Chinese regime at this time becoming it's becoming very arrogant and more
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:11.120]  aggressive around the world play claims of the entire South China Sea it is
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.120]  having navigation disputes the US Navy and Yellow Sea and so from one point of
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.120]  view I see this is a very dangerous time there's a miscalculation in Korea there
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:27.120]  could be a war could break out around Korea the Chinese regime feels that
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.120]  they're strong enough they might attempt to conquer Taiwan and so I see the
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:37.120]  Chinese regime becoming more aggressive on the one hand on the other hand I see
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.120]  it's becoming much weaker Mr. Gregory stay there sorry to interrupt you we got

[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:20.120]  I got a bridge and I'm ready to sell you
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.120]  I got some oceanfront property in Arizona as George Strait would say
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:28.120]  going back to Steven Gregory of epochtimes.com
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.120]  the editor of their English language version
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.120]  okay, you got interrupted by the break
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.120]  you were getting into their extreme arrogance
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:40.120]  evidenced by the White House playing an anti-America song about the victory against U.S. troops
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.120]  continuing, please
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.120]  right, well, on the one hand I see the arrogance increasing
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.120]  and the aggression increasing
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:52.120]  on the other hand, I see the regime growing more and more unstable
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:57.120]  and the members of the CCP know that high-ranking members of the CCP
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.120]  have numerous foreign passports and billions stashed abroad
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.120]  they're ready to run
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.120]  and what the West needs to do is to support those inside China
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.120]  who are seeking to have civil society
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.120]  and that goes back to the withdrawal loop without speaking up before
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.120]  the people inside China who are looking to end the Chinese Communist Party
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:24.120]  and those are the people the West should be speaking out for
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:29.120]  but there are a lot of Western megacorporations that promote the authoritarianism
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.120]  because they've got business deals that count on the slave labor
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.120]  what about that part of the equation?
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:42.120]  it's certainly true that their western corporations in China that are devoted to the regime
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:47.120]  it's also true that this year for the first time the American Chamber of Commerce
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  pulled back from its support for doing business in China
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:55.120]  American business and Western business have been badly burned inside China
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120]  they have not been willing to admit it
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.120]  and now people are finally starting to take a little bit more sober look
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.120]  at what it means to do business in China
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.120]  sure, I've been asking a lot of the questions here
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.120]  but you really are from doing my research
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.120]  a deep expert on what's happening with China
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.120]  and the rest of this segment, the next, you've got the floor on other points
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.120]  you think are really important and the persecution of Falun Gong
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:18.120]  who they are for folks that don't know
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:22.120]  great, thank you
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  okay, so we're still alive, I'm sorry, I thought we were going too fast
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.120]  no, no, no, you've got the floor, break it down for us as we got a break here
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120]  okay, right
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  the persecution of Falun Gong is the story that our paper has covered
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:43.120]  because it's the most important story we think in China today
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:45.120]  we think in the world today
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.120]  100 million people were practicing Falun Gong
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.120]  which is a peaceful spiritual practice in China in 1999
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  and this scared the Chinese Communist Party
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:59.120]  and because it scared the Chinese Communist Party
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:05.120]  to have 100 million people independently doing a meditation practice, spiritual practice
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.120]  they decided to eradicate Falun Gong in the words of John Smith
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.120]  and they have used the most extreme and violent means
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.120]  the most extreme forms of torture and brainwashing
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.120]  can be imagined to attempt to eliminate Falun Gong in China
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.120]  but what has happened is for the first time in the history of the Chinese Communist Party
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.120]  a group has successfully resisted the attempt to eliminate them
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:41.120]  and this is a huge story in terms of the dynamics inside China
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:49.120]  that you now have tens of millions of people who are conducting a campaign of civil disobedience
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:54.120]  to oppose the rule of the Chinese Communist Party
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:59.120]  and this is something which readers of our newspaper and our website know about
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:06.120]  and we think that media around the world should be thankful to the Chinese that made the development
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.120]  Well, I agree with you
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.120]  Briefly, do you think it would have gone better for the Communist Party China
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.120]  to let Falun Gong operate?
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.120]  Has it caused a bigger backlash by them trying to crush it?
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:32.120]  I think that the Chinese Communist Party has allowed Falun Gong to continue peacefully cultivating the future of Falun Gong
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:35.120]  China would be a different place today
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.120]  Alright, stay there, back in one minute, I want to continue down that line

[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:17.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:41.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  How do you see it ending in China for the Communist Party? I mean, I see a lot of Western leaders getting foreign passports and buying property
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:55.120]  And we see corruption as systemic all over the world, but nowhere more thoroughbred than what we see with the Communist Party, China
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.120]  So how do you see it ending over there and finishing up your point about
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:04.120]  You were saying they wouldn't have crushed the Falun Gong that we'd have a different China today
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:10.120]  Well, maybe that's their view, they don't want it to become free, they want it to be authoritarian
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:17.120]  That's certainly true, the CCP's prime motivation is to keep the bells in power
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:26.120]  And so, yes, they don't want a different China and that's the reason for the persecution of Falun Gong in the first place
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  That to see a large group of people that were independent, spiritually independent, independent in their thoughts from the CCP
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:41.120]  This is what the CCP could not tolerate and could not allow to go forward
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:51.120]  They are looking to assure their rule and that means they're looking for ways to control the false Chinese at every turn
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:02:05.120]  And in terms of what I see happening, I'm not a prophet, but I believe the CCP is heading to its end, it's going to be falling apart
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:17.120]  And I think that what the West needs to do is to take stock of what its own principles are, what its own values are
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:28.120]  And to return to those and insist on conducting business on the basis of the West's principles involving human rights
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:39.120]  And if they do this, the United States will be true to itself, it will recover its honor and feelings with China
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:45.120]  And it will have the greatest impact on, I believe, China in a positive way
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:54.120]  I want to go back in closing, boiling it down, why would they do something as brazen and naked and arrogant as play a song
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  known to be dealing with the celebration of defeating US troops on the Korean Peninsula and calling them jackals
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:07.120]  Why would they do something that incredibly arrogant, why would they celebrate something
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:18.120]  Even if the Communist Party, China, wants to defeat and basically make the US impotent, why would they run their flag up so arrogantly?
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:26.120]  I think that they are sending a signal to their own people that the tide has turned
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.120]  China has had a very difficult history in the modern world
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  It suffered occupation by foreign powers earlier in the 20th century and it suffered many humiliation
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  And the Chinese people have felt that intensely and the Chinese Communist Party has throughout its history played on that
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  And so by playing this song and allowing this song to be played in the White House
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:06.120]  And the Chinese Communist Party is sending a signal to the Chinese people that things have turned, things have changed
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  That the Chinese Communist regime is now getting the upper hand
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  Which they see is bolstering themselves domestically at a time when resistance to their tyranny is rising
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:29.120]  Exactly, the appeal to patriotism and the appeal to nationalism is one of the strongest cards that the Chinese Communist Party has had to play
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:37.120]  And by not rebuking it and by not having the government speak out against it here, is that not aiding and abetting this?
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:46.120]  I think the United States government would do well to acknowledge what happened and to register a complaint
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:52.120]  I think speaking silent, staying silent, I think, the wrong person
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:56.120]  Yeah, the wrong message. Stephen Gregory, editor of the Epoch Times dot com
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:01.120]  Folks need to go and subscribe there. In fact, stay there. I want to come back and briefly talk about how folks subscribe
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:16.120]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:21.120]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:35.120]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource

[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:34.120]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family. I'm worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow. I'm looking for America
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:40.120]  Where American and be proud, go to Gusset.com forward slash America
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:52.120]  Land on the free and the home of the brave. Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone, long gone
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:55.120]  But I know in my heart it's still the same
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:05.120]  Again, go to Gusset.com forward slash America today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:09.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:15.120]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:20.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:25.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:29.120]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:32.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:36.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:41.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:46.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:50.120]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:52.120]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:08:00.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:17.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:22.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  There was one final point I wanted to hit with Stephen Gregory, the epochtimes.com online and physical newspaper
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  And that is, how do folks subscribe and get hard copies? Because when I'm around the world or in the US, I see it everywhere
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:40.120]  For years, many years, at least a decade, pick it up and read it and go through it
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:45.120]  Very pro-liberty, they report on the Bilderberg group here domestically
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.120]  A lot of things that other mainstream newspapers won't do, I wanted to do that
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  But before we plug, how folks can get involved with you guys and read it online or get the hard copy
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.120]  You have another article up at the epochtimes. Photo show that chairman, whose welcomeers were paid
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:05.120]  Spend a minute or two on that, Mr. Gregory, and then let's tell folks how to subscribe to the epochtimes
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:12.120]  Sure. One of the things that people in the West don't understand about the CCP
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:21.120]  Is how hard they work to try and control civil society inside the United States
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:31.120]  Most Chinese community groups and the Chinese Student and Scholar Associations, which all Chinese students studying in the United States belong to
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:37.120]  Are heavily influenced or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. These are called front groups
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:47.120]  And so when Hu Chintow visited Washington, D.C., the embassy mobilized its front group, particularly the students
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:52.120]  And paid them to come and welcome the welcome group
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:10:02.120]  This welcome has at least two purposes. One is to push aside those who come to protest Hu Chintow
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:11.120]  The welcome groups know in advance that who is coming. And so they're able to apply for permits before those who might protest them
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:20.120]  And they can get the best spot. And so the spot directly opposite the Blair House, for instance, would be occupied by the Chinese students
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.120]  Who've been paid to come and welcome Hu Chintow
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:34.120]  Of course, the other purpose is to give American media and American public and American leaders perception that the people of China are very strongly pro-Chinese Communist Party
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:38.120]  And very strongly pro-Hu Chintow
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:47.120]  But the reality is that while these students may have strong patriotic feelings for China, they're paid to be there
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.120]  And we can't take its face value
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  Sure, this is perception management. How do folks get hard copies of your newspaper?
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:07.120]  If they go to our website, which is www.dfoptime.com, www.thdpochdimes.com
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.120]  In the top right hand corner of the website is the tab to get home delivery
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  And if they click on that, then they can enter their zip code and we'll get back to them about establishing home delivery
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:30.120]  We are in major cities around the world, but we don't have wide distribution, wide US wide distribution that we hope to
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:39.120]  But in any case, click on Get Home Delivery on the website and get in touch with them. Thank you
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.120]  All right, sir. Good talking to you. Thank you for joining us
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:44.120]  Thank you so much, Howard
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:50.120]  All right, take care. There goes the editor of the Epoch Times. And again, I've seen him cover Bilderberg Group, the New World Order
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:56.120]  I've seen him cover it all. They were the only paper on the East Coast three years ago when I was at Bilderberg
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:02.120]  Covering Obama being selected there when Hillary and Obama disappeared for a day and no one could find him in D.C.
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:08.120]  And they loaded up the Obama press corps and flew him to Chicago, closed the door. They said, where's Obama?
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:14.120]  We knew where he'd be at the Bilderberg Group meeting. We were there. And the Epoch Times was also there.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:22.120]  So certainly a lot of great stuff and trying to support alternative media. That's our job. And that's why I'm promoting what they're doing.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:26.120]  Doesn't mean I agree with 100% of it. But overall, it's very, very exciting.
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:36.120]  Okay, I got a bunch of news I want to cover right now, but then I want to open the phones up on the China situation on what's happening with the economy
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:42.120]  on any of the issues, the State of the Union. We'll be covering it more obviously tomorrow ahead of his speech tomorrow night.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:48.120]  Obama has said that he's going to call for more job creation. Oh, like he did in the last State of the Union,
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:57.120]  when everything he does is there to shut down jobs for a quote, post-industrial world that the environmentalist land gravers and eugenicists have been calling for.
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:03.120]  They want to bring us to heal, destroy our society and rebuild it in their collectivist corporate image.
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:15.120]  He's also going to call for stopping the rhetoric, coming together and basically shutting our mouths and unifying in and around big government.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:22.120]  And that criticizing government and being angry about the police state, why that caused the congresswoman to be shot.
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:33.120]  And he's reportedly may even call for gun control tomorrow, so we will of course be covering that in detail and in the aftermath of it here.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:45.120]  One other issue, we had congressman Ron Paul on for a very powerful half-hour interview on Friday where he talked about possibly running for president and then he's still gauging it.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:52.120]  And there's also polls showing that he would probably win a run for senate replacing Kay Bailey Hutchinson here in Texas.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.120]  Either way up, it's a step up with our representatives, people that really care about the republic in congress.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  But we've offered a lot of different t-shirts over the years that are about spreading the word and also when you purchase them, it supports our broadcast.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  We can support other alternative media really as a launch pad or a platform.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:19.120]  But we've launched several new t-shirts and they're up at infowars.com on the online video bookstore, t-shirt, I guess apparel shopping cart.
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.120]  And the new one is a draft Ron Paul 2012.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:31.120]  And obviously if he's going to run, he's going to announce in the next six months or so.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  This will be a limited edition t-shirt and we'll actually give you a blown up screenshot of it. It's a very, very handsome t-shirt.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.120]  We have them in black and I believe also in red.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:52.120]  And it says 2012, draft Ron Paul 2012, freedom, liberty, freedom.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:15:02.120]  And it looks extremely presidential and it is a great way to get that ball rolling and also start lobbying our representative to run for president.
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:09.120]  Of course, I lobbied him here on air. I lobbied him before he ran in 08. I lobbied his son, Rand Paul, now in the U.S. Senate, on and off air.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.120]  We just really appreciate him. We need to get behind him.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.120]  And I believe the sooner he announces, the better.
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:18.120]  So those t-shirts are available only for a limited time.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:32.120]  And that way you get the word out about Ron Paul running in 2012 and you also support this operation that overall, of course, is firmly behind Ron Paul in the upcoming educational campaigns through campaign for liberty and other systems to expose the globalist.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:36.120]  So if you want that t-shirt, it'll probably just be available a few months.
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.120]  But obviously once he announces or if he doesn't announce, then we'll withdraw the shirt.
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  So I'll just put a date on it right now.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.120]  We're going to only sell these into six months from this date.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:59.120]  And so six months from today, in the middle of the summer, we will no longer be offering draft Ron Paul 2012 t-shirts that Jeanette Meadows, our great graphics lady, put together.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:05.120]  Also, Phil is going to put together a V for victory t-shirt that's also going to be available for a limited time.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:09.120]  And again, your purchase of the t-shirts also supports this broadcast and what we do here.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:19.120]  But again, available at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  I've seen a lot of great grassroots Ron Paul t-shirts.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.120]  And I know Ron Paul has always supported that the grassroots is the most powerful tool out there.
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:36.120]  I think this is the most handsome, best looking, most graphically pleasing, most presidential shirt that I have seen so far.
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:51.120]  So draft Ron Paul 2012 and it is available right now at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.120]  Now, and perhaps you guys can go to our Facebook photos page.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.120]  We can show some people watching on TV, some of this.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:02.120]  I just noticed over the weekend a huge grassroots posting of first 20, 30, 40, 50.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:07.120]  Now it's got to be well over 100 amazing V for victory graphics.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:13.120]  And a listener made one that shows the V as a pyramid going into the ground, anti-New World Order.
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:19.120]  It's got the short message, we are all in danger of police state control grid is being established in the United States.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:26.120]  And now is the time for all lovers of liberty to stand together and speak out against the growing tyranny destroying our republic.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:28.120]  We will be victorious against the New World Order.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:36.120]  We will protect our rights and our as human beings post V for victory flyer to warn others and show your peaceful resistance.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  You are the resistance infowars.com.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  And there's a lot of other countless ones.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.120]  I mean, literally, I couldn't even look at them all.
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  There's so many.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  We've got a lot of different Facebooks, both fan Facebooks and the official Facebooks.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  But if you click on the Facebook icon that's on the article pages, you know, you'll see the print icon, the YouTube icon, the podcast icon,
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:01.120]  the prisonpana.tv icon, the Twitter icon, the Facebook icon, the shopping icon.
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.120]  You click on that F and it'll take you to the Facebook.
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.120]  And you click on photos, not profile photos, but regular photos.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:11.120]  And it's just, it's over 100 that are incredible.
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:16.120]  Phil and I put together the one, you know, Thursday evening in about an hour filled with a great job.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:19.120]  People taking that archetypal V for victory.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:23.120]  Some of the detractors, I mean, if we use an American Eagle, they'd say it was fascist.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:26.120]  If we used a circle, they'd say it was occultic, a V.
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:30.120]  I'm not too familiar with that being occultic, but whatever.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:34.120]  I mean, the point is there isn't any image out there that hasn't been used by people for something bad.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:36.120]  You know, the Native Americans love the swastika.
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:38.120]  So did the Indians in India.
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  Doesn't mean that obviously we're not going to use a swastika because that symbol's been fully taken over and used for nefarious purposes.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:51.120]  The V is the French resistance to the occupation of the Germans.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.120]  That's what it means.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.120]  But other folks have made it R for resistance.
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:58.120]  Those flyers are up there with the info wars.com on it.
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.120]  I think that's great.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.120]  Whatever stands out.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:09.120]  But we've got to pick some time of iconic symbol, something there so people can see what's happening.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:15.120]  I mean, it's kind of like the Obama poster that hundreds of newspapers, hundreds of TV stations, hundreds,
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  picked up and covered and had a huge, giant effect showing that Obama is in our God, is in our King.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:25.120]  Taking this image of him as our messianic savior and pulling that down.
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:28.120]  This is about people saying, what's this V hanging there on that lamp poster?
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:31.120]  What's this V left here in the coffee shop?
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.120]  What's this info wars.com?
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:34.120]  Let me learn more about this.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.120]  There's a police state.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:38.120]  It's a way to get discussions going.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.120]  And that's why we're doing it.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  Now separately there's the answer to 1984 1776 contest.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  Obviously the answer to the 1984 society is the liberty of 1776.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  And that's a separate video contest to counter the TSA homeland security contest they're having for citizens about getting a spy on each other.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:10.120]  That contest for $10,000 is to respond to that.
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:34.120]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening.
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:39.120]  We'll offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:21:01.120]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:09.120]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:12.120]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:17.120]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:20.120]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.120]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:29.120]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.120]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:40.120]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.120]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:44.120]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:48.120]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:22:07.120]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:15.120]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:23.120]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:28.120]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:33.120]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:39.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:43.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:48.120]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:51.120]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:59.120]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:04.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:08.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:14.120]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:20.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:24.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.120]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:40.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:45.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:51.120]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:24:08.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.120]  Alright, coming up, Drudge Report's got it as one of its top links.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.120]  Google seeks to weaken search engine ranking of the alternative media.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:17.120]  That's what this really is. Then I'll go to your phone calls.
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:26.120]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:30.120]  And listen, I love the Obama poster that was so successful.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:36.120]  Watson had the idea of the French resistance in V because it was so successful against the Nazis saying,
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:44.120]  we don't like being occupied and to show that there was solidarity against the police state and to get people talking.
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:51.120]  If you want to come up with better ideas, and I'm sure you can, send them to infowars.com.
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.120]  Send it to contestedinfowars.com. And we'll try to get it up on the site.
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:58.120]  The problem is so much is coming in.
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:04.120]  We posted a fan listener version of our V that just had infowars.com and a short message.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:09.120]  And it says, you're not alone. We're standing up. We're everywhere. We're the people.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:14.120]  We are legion. I got like 30 emails, Aaron said, saying, we are legion. That's what the devil says.
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:20.120]  Whatever. The devil said everything. The devil says pink elephants. I can't ever say pink elephants.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.120]  The point is, we are the majority. We outnumber the globalist a thousand to one.
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.120]  So I didn't make that. A fan made it. There's hundreds of them on there.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:34.120]  Anybody that's on my Facebook can go in there and post it. It's not my fault.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:40.120]  We've got a, in this article by Eric Blair, we've got a symbol of Google with a tail and a pitchfork.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.120]  We're saying Google is the devil. We're not saying we're with the devil.
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:52.120]  Again, it isn't about that. And I expect in the next few days to start seeing newscast, news articles about this.
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:57.120]  You can do letters to the editor about our V for victory campaign because I'm getting a huge buzz.
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.120]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails an hour. Comments everywhere.
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:05.120]  As I said, hundreds of different graphics being sent in. Over a hundred.
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.120]  I quit counting after a hundred on our Facebook image page. Just one of our Facebooks.
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:18.120]  It's just pouring in. I've talked to multiple people in the office whose friends they didn't even know were listeners of this show,
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.120]  telling them, have you heard about this V for victory campaign to say no to the globalist takeover,
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.120]  no to the police state, no to the banker bailouts. No, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:31.120]  So it's really already having a big effect, reaching people individually all over the country.
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:40.120]  I've gotten emails and reports about people who didn't do it themselves, seeing them in shopping malls, on telephone poles, on light poles,
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:46.120]  wherever you do it, where it's legal and lawful. But the point is, get it out there publicly because it's great to get the grassroots
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:49.120]  and people here and there seeing it. That will have a big effect.
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:54.120]  Then they'll find infowars.com, the audio streams, the free videos, the guests we're having on.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.120]  But I want more than that. I'm not even looking for folks overall to go to infowars.
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.120]  That's just ensuring somebody gets some good out of it, you know, to actually see the truth.
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:07.120]  I want to get the media reading the caption about the police state to have local debates about it.
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:14.120]  When you start getting a chain reaction of newspapers and TV covering it, that's where it can reach tens of millions.
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:19.120]  I mean, I talked to people in New York, in LA, in Florida. I saw it all over Texas.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:26.120]  A whole bunch of newspapers, just where I live. England, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, New Zealand.
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  I mean, all over the place, these videos came in.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:34.120]  And so we're separately having the answer to 1984, the 1776 contest.
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:37.120]  I announced that a week ago. We officially launched it Friday.
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:42.120]  And it was just Thursday night, we had the idea. Paul did for this V for victory. That's a separate operation.
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:52.120]  But you can mix that in with the videos of demonstrating of protesting or soap opera style like TSA is putting out in situational ethic type situations,
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:28:01.120]  making videos of any way you want using your creative spark to expose the police state, to expose the Stasi society,
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:06.120]  to expose the DHS and TSA now rolling out on the streets of America,
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.120]  not just putting us in radiation friars and sticking their hands down our pants.
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  That's the point is to get people to practice their liberty muscles, to exert themselves.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:22.120]  Resistance is victory because like lifting weights, when you lift weights, your muscles get bigger.
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:27.120]  The resistance. Well, when you go to city council and speak out, when you call in the talk radio,
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:33.120]  when you start a website or your own radio show, when you make a film, when you make a flyer, when you hang a flyer up,
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.120]  when you talk to your neighbors, it has an effect.
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:40.120]  And I meant to do a special video about this last night and got too busy after the show.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.120]  And I meant to then do an audio blog and never did it.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  It's a whole story I want to tell because it ties into so many layers of what's happening in our society.
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.120]  But I stop at red lights and tell folks to tune into local talk radio that carries my show and others.
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:59.120]  I at the gym talk to people who are lifting weights if they talk to me and talk to the lady at the front desk.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.120]  I talk to people at the gas station. I talk to people at Target.
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:10.120]  I talk to people at the grocery store. I mean, I talk to people and I talk to them about what's going on.
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:17.120]  Nothing is a substitute for that. Nothing is a substitute for actually talking to somebody.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:24.120]  And if you want to print up, you know, V for victory cards, business cards and hand them out, whatever, nothing can stop the grassroots.
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:27.120]  And so we have a TSA protest. Look what it's done.
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:34.120]  Biggest news story for over a month nationwide. Huge resistance mounting. Congress moving with legislation to block it.
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:38.120]  We have other demonstrations, other events. It shows the people their power.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:45.120]  Even if they shut the media and the internet down, you can still hang flyers up in your town saying, hey, we've been occupied. We've been taken over.
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:51.120]  We're gearing up for full occupation and the resistance of it. That's what all this is about. Stay with us.
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:58.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:09.120]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:17.120]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.120]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:34.120]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:42.120]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:53.120]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:31:19.120]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.

[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:36.120]  Let's talk to the owner of 5-star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:32:00.120]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain. Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsope.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:08.120]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:16.120]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:24.120]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:31.120]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:38.120]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:47.120]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.120 --> 02:33:00.120]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America, the number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America 3.com.
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:25.120]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:38.120]  See, the system didn't like Jesse Ventura and his band, Police State Special on TruTV, at the end saying, you thought we had 50 states, no, we have 10 regions governed by people we didn't elect.
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:45.120]  You think you've got local police? They've been federalized. It can't happen here. It already has.
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:59.120]  By learning about the FEMA regions, by learning about the president's governor council that they admit is for martial law, by pointing out this grid that's been set up, we can then expose it and discredit it.
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  And that's what we're doing here today. Let's do this. Let's go to calls right now. Then I'll get into this economic news and this Google censorship news that I really can't even do justice to in just a short segment.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:16.120]  But Michael in Ohio, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:30.120]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for all that you do. One of the right to the point. You know, it's really a pleasure to call a radio station and not have to be asked 20 questions by a screener qualifying me to get on your show.
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.120]  So thank you for the freedom of speech.
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:39.120]  Well, listen, Michael, that's true, but that's why there's a big lie on the Internet that all our calls are fake and that we screen calls.
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:45.120]  See, it's the opposite. So they attack the fact that we do that because it upsets them so much. But go ahead.
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:53.120]  Yeah, I will attest to the opposite. You do not screen by any way, shape or form. Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:35:04.120]  Well, sometimes I do. Sometimes I do when I say we got a guest on a doctor in here about MSG. I only want calls about your bad reactions to MSG or if you like it.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.120]  You know, so sometimes but I'll announce we're having calls for the guest. But go ahead.
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:22.120]  Absolutely, so that you can stay on topic. That's understood. But you know, upcoming Ron Paul candidacy, hopefully, we really need to get behind his effort to audit the Fed.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:34.120]  This Federal Reserve system is the true power behind the international banking cartel that is stealing our sovereignty and our freedom, as you know.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:41.120]  And we almost succeeded the last time around when he got, I believe, what, 320 congressmen to sponsor it with him?
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:42.120]  Yes.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:55.120]  We really need to emphasize this more than anything. This is the beast within that we need to cut the throat of. And what really happened to Jesse Ventura and his show?
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.120]  And then I also wanted to ask you one more question.
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:13.120]  Well, that's a lot of important questions. I mean, I've made videos. I mean, there are videos on the web of the TV radio show where I break down that they censored his police state episode and are now a racing partner, all of them off people's DVRs remotely.
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:24.120]  That's now confirmed. And now Congressman Steve Cohen has come out admitted that he put pressure on Time Warner, the parent of True TV. But that show is being censored. It just got too many viewers and was too effective.
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:26.120]  And then that's what happened.
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:31.120]  Okay. Are CDs or copies going to be made available or other?
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:43.120]  Well, I don't own the show, so I can't do that. I've brought that up too. Most TV series that are popular, they put out on DVD sets. You'd think they'd want to do that and probably make $5 million in stores everywhere, but they're not doing it.
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:52.120]  And so people need to call for True TV to offer it on DVD. Why aren't they doing that? I mean, it's a lot. Why when the show was the number one show out of the gates?
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:37:00.120]  Did they move it from Wednesdays to the death slot on Friday nights? It was still successful. It's because we now know there's behind the scenes pressure.
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:09.120]  And I've been asked not to get into all of it because, you know, you work with people as a journalist, as a researcher, when they say, I'll tell you this, but don't share it. They don't want it shared.
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:12.120]  There's a lot more to the story and I can't share it with you.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:24.120]  Well, just my final question or comment and I would like to hear your opinion. You know, our founders, Alex, gave us a remedy to keep tyranny under control.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:46.120]  Aaron Burr was falsely accused in his day of crimes that he did not commit. He went before two common law citizen grand juries and was vindicated in both states, I believe, Kentucky and Virginia through the method of the citizen grand jury.
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:38:06.120]  This was stolen from us in 1946. The final nail in the coffin of the citizen grand jury ended in 1946. Do you see and are you behind any effort to revive the citizen grand jury to act as a watchdog over tyranny in our country?
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:13.120]  Absolutely. It's always good to get citizens together. The problem is they send feds in a lot of times to then infiltrate and radicalize it to discredit it.
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:29.120]  But interesting points, Michael, they took our senators from us in 1913 before you elected the legislature and the senator, the U.S. Senator, the two senators for your state, were a checkmate on the feds because your state then elected them via the legislature.
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:41.120]  They were selected and they took that away. And so a lot of those checks and balances have been removed and they've turned the regular county or state or federal grand jury into a rubber stamp of the prosecutors.
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:47.120]  It's all a big problem. That's why we've had Red Beckman, the father of the fully informed jury movement on many, many times.
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:51.120]  Let's talk to Roy in Texas. We've got to move quick now here. Roy, you're on the air.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  Hey, Alex, about a week ago or so, I tried to get in and talk about this. As much as I can't stand hearing anything that comes out of Mr. Maddow, Richard Maddow, I mean, Rachel Maddow's mouth.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:07.120]  That's that guy on the MSNBC. Right. Yeah, I know him.
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:25.120]  Yeah, that vicious creature. When she attacked you and Ron Paul and others on the Second Amendment regarding the Tucson shooting, you know, I wish you would have played the rest of that clip because she actually went on to say something to the effect that people like you or Ron Paul or anyone who believes the Second
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:33.120]  Amendment was established to protect us from governmental tyranny and anyone who believes this actually wants to go to war with the U.S. military.
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:48.120]  Yeah, I mean, well, sir, we did post the whole 10 minute clip. The issue here is we can play short clips and stuff and analyze it. It's fair use, but I can't just sit here and play 10 minute clips of newscast on my syndicated, you know, commercial radio show.
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:57.120]  So there's rules, you know, along those lines. So I can play a minute or so. But I did say the full clip is up on the side of folks want to see the rest of it.
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:07.120]  We did write an article about Mr. Maddow and MSNBC and what they did. But that's what Glenn Beck said three years ago. He said these Ron Paul supporters want to go to war with the government.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:15.120]  They want to bomb things with the money bomb. We need to use the army against them. That's why I was so freaked out by Beck. But now he's backed off of that. So, you know, good for him.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:27.120]  But yeah, no, we did post the whole clip of Mr. Richard Maddow, excuse me, Rachel Maddow on that show. I like the fact that Mr. Maddow is really catching on on the Internet. I've seen it everywhere.
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:35.120]  Without even looking, I just see Mr. Maddow everywhere. That's pretty funny. But we should really focus on her with the facts, not with jokes. I mean, it's not her fault.
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:45.120]  She looks like a, you know, NFL football player. But yes, she did say that. And so they're claiming we're seditious and it's one step towards arrest us.
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:53.120]  And she played Congressman Brown, Paul, myself. That's why I brought up the Ron Paul on Friday. You know, I said she says we're dangerous. We're bad. We need to be dealt with.
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:41:03.120]  We are the people. We are the government. Read the Declaration of Independence. It says that when the government starts setting up a police state, in fact, we pull up the Declaration of Independence.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:18.120]  It is, it is our right. It is our duty because it's the line right above it. You know, in fine old English talks about, you know, the fact that they're setting up and designing this control grid to just by design to destroy our rights.
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:26.120]  It's our right, our duty to throw it off. I mean, this is our country. And we're trying to take things peacefully back to the states and through Congress. And I think we've got a good chance of doing it.
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  They're going to try to foment violence. And they're trying to say free speech is fomenting violence. And it's, it's causing it. And so now free speech is bad. As bad as those guns, they're saying.
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:44.120]  So you can really see the tyrants they are. But look at Cass Sunstein. The regulations are he openly says arrest people that don't believe in manmade global warming. These people are tyrants.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:52.120]  These are the little baby, little baby Stalin's. And we've got to stand up and use our speech against them. I'm the last person to want violence.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  And we're using every recourse we have, but we're pointing out our second amendment is there as a check and balance against government force.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:11.120]  And notice the government's massing all this paramilitary force as Ron Paul said Friday against us using Homeland Security against libertarians and conservatives and anti war people, the whole spectrum, the ACLU.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:21.120]  And, you know, the point is, well, you know, they, they are the ones openly preparing for violence with us and then claiming that, you know, that we deserve it. I appreciate your call.
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:37.120]  It goes on that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such a way.
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:48.120]  And there's another part in there where it says it's not just our right. It's our duty continuing that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the government.
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  See, it's we, the people, and going back up above it, we hold these trees to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.120]  That means no government can take them that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:07.120]  And I can't find the part where it talks about how there, there it is.
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:18.120]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpation pursuing invariably the same object in vences of design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right.
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:34.120]  It is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such as been the patient suffering of these colonies and such as now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former system of government.
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:49.120]  The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to provide this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.120]  So this is really our declaration of independence.
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:59.120]  Maybe we should launch another flyer campaign about a new declaration of independence and then say see the original.
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:06.120]  You know, some people understand a declaration of independence against occupation against the construction of this absolute tyranny.
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:14.120]  I mean, who can deny all the ancient forms of classic tyranny are being set up and pumped full of steroids and given fertilizer.
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.120]  I mean, there's no doubt in any historical yardstick. This is hardcore tyranny.
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:22.120]  They're openly attacking our speech now, not just our arms.
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.120]  They're trying to bar our right of passage to travel.
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  We're going into an internal checkpoint system.
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.120]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Peter in Washington.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:35.120]  Peter, you're on the air.
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:37.120]  Hello, Alex.
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:42.120]  I liked much of what you had, but I do not like your V campaign.
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.120]  And I'd like to say a few words about it.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:47.120]  I will try to go fast.
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:52.120]  And yes, thank you for the for hearing me.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.120]  First of all, I'll address your main issue, which is the French resistance.
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:03.120]  That resistance was not unambiguously good.
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:08.120]  Increasingly, as it proceeded, it was under communist control.
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:16.120]  And after the end of the war, there was a terrorist campaign.
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:22.120]  It issued, well, we're a lot of people, I think 100,000 were killed.
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:29.120]  Many of them, not even fans of V.C. France or are they reading German?
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.120]  Let me just get this from you.
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.120]  Do you think that Hitler was the good guy in World War II?
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:36.120]  No.
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:39.120]  I have a book that I want you to look at.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:45.120]  It's still available on me.
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:49.120]  Hold on, your Skype or whatever is breaking up. Say that again.
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:51.120]  I don't have that.
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:57.120]  It's called France the Tragic Years, 1939 to 1947.
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:01.120]  And I will quote from it just briefly.
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:05.120]  If one did not admit a special brand of patriotism,
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:10.120]  consisting of allegiance to de Gaulle and at least tolerance of communism,
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:17.120]  then one was dubbed an anti-patriot and handed over as it were to the hangman.
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:22.120]  Now, I'll briefly go to also the occult thing.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:29.120]  Of course, France was where much of that was concentrated, as you know, from the 18th century.
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  The British came up with the V. It just meant victory, V for victory.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:35.120]  Listen, I'm going to put you on hold for just a minute and then comment.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.120]  Which color was this I was talking to, John?
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  This is Peter in Washington.
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:43.120]  The show is almost out of time and I do want to go to people's calls.
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.120]  Look, I could use any symbol in the world and people rather than take action
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:50.120]  and get the word out are going to say they have a problem with it.
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:53.120]  If I use an eagle, you'd say the Germans used it.
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:57.120]  If I use an Easter Bunny, I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to use here.
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:00.120]  Obviously, we're saying the V is for victory against tyranny.
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:02.120]  It's an easy to remember symbol.
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:04.120]  I'm sure nothing in this world is perfect.
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.120]  In fact, I want to challenge people.
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:11.120]  Send it to contestedinfowars.com.
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.120]  That's a good one for us to be checking your idea for a thing.
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  And I guarantee anything you make, people aren't going to like.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:20.120]  But up on my Facebook, you can post whatever you want.
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:22.120]  People come up with all sorts of other ideas.
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:24.120]  Look, don't, Kate, let me put you this way.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  You come up with some kind of flyer to wake people up about the occupation
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:31.120]  of foreign banks and the world government that's coming in and the police state
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  and the attack on free speech and post the thing.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.120]  Start an organization, get the media talking.
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.120]  But we got to pick one symbol predominantly like the Obama Joker.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  I was told the Joker is a cult.
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.120]  He's a devil.
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:47.120]  You're promoting a devil.
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:49.120]  People didn't like that Joker thing.
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:50.120]  I don't care.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:53.120]  Most people do and they get it and they understand it, okay?
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:59.120]  So I can sit here all day and get into the intricacies of the French and de Gaulle.
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:02.120]  And de Gaulle, by the way, kicked NATO out.
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:06.120]  I'm not some de Gaulle in Frankfile, okay?
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:07.120]  My last name is Jones.
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  This is about the succession with the French and the British fighting with each other.
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.120]  It's about the V campaign.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.120]  And of course, that's what we'll do because we want bondage.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:20.120]  We'll debate the V all day instead of some way to get out there and reach out to people.
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  Some way to get people talking.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.120]  Okay, put Obama posters up everywhere again saying he's a Joker
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:31.120]  and then a link to something explaining that he's a puppet.
[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:34.120]  But see, we've already defeated that puppet to a great extent.
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.120]  Now we're moving forward against the overall DHS occupation.
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  If you don't like the V, great.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:42.120]  We have the answer to 1984, a 1776 campaign.
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  And of course, going to El Pro are all over the internet saying the founding fathers were bad.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:48.120]  Don't have 1776.
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:50.120]  They were slave owners.
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:51.120]  It never ends.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:52.120]  It's not that they were perfect.
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.120]  It's that it was a standing up against a oppressive empire.
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  You're never going to find anything perfect in man.
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:01.120]  Then others spend it to say, oh, he put 1776 meaning French Illuminati.
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:03.120]  No, that's not what it is.
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:09.120]  The answer to the 1984 oppressive society coming in is the spirit of 1776.
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  And you can take and twist whatever meaning you want out of that till the big fat cows come home.
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.120]  I'm going to continue to make films.
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.120]  I'm going to continue to reach.
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:21.120]  I've done films with pyramids.
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:23.120]  Tom at the New World Order and the pyramid symbol.
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:25.120]  And they go, look, Illuminati symbols.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.120]  Of course, I'm pointing out who they are.
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:30.120]  This is an upside down pyramid.
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:31.120]  It's a V.
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:32.120]  Man, we are.
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:37.120]  It's just, it's just, we are totally obsessed with infighting and nitpicking.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:39.120]  Look, give me symbols better.
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:42.120]  But I guarantee you we're promoting a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:43.120]  People are sending us.
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:47.120]  In fact, we were sent one that's a V with the devil down there with the St.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:48.120]  Michael stabbing it.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.120]  I'm sure that's bad now because I get attacked for being a Christian.
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:54.120]  Whatever, knock yourselves out.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:58.120]  Now you got about a minute left because I got to get into this Google thing and I promise to go to John in London.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.120]  I may have to go into overdrive.
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:01.120]  Oh boy.
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.120]  I got a lot of work to do after the show.
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:06.120]  But I got into abortion in the first hour.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  It was really important.
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:09.120]  And now I'm bad for being against that.
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:11.120]  That's secret Satanism and I'm against it.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:13.120]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.120]  And you know you're good.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.120]  So you get out there and do something.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  Peter, come up with a better symbol for us.
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  A symbol that hasn't been used by somebody in history that's got a problem.
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:24.120]  Okay.
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  What do you say to that, Peter?
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:27.120]  Victory is resistance.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:28.120]  V.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:29.120]  R.
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  That's what you said.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:36.120]  And that that takes away all of that other stuff.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.120]  That's what you said.
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  And that was brilliant.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:40.120]  And that's what you should use.
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:43.120]  Not this other stuff that's locked in with that.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:44.120]  What do you mean?
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:45.120]  Say it again.
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  I should do V for resistance.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:54.120]  No, V. R. Not V for resistance, V. R.
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:56.120]  Victory is resistance.
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:57.120]  That's what you said.
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:58.120]  That's brilliant.
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:50:59.120]  Okay.
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.120]  Well, people make the posters.

[02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:24.120]  And after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.120]  Efoodsdirect.com.
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:55.120]  Okay, I didn't mean to get an argument with that guy.
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:57.120]  It just frustrates me.
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:02.120]  But this whole V for victory, V for resistance.
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:05.120]  I mean, I've seen some posters made, V for resistance.
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:07.120]  Or you are the resistance.
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:08.120]  That's the whole message of it.
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:10.120]  The poster we made is V for victory.
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:12.120]  You are the resistance.
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:14.120]  And I'm talking about victory against the globalists.
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.120]  It's just get people talking.
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:19.120]  Believe me, the general public doesn't see a V and think the devil.
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:23.120]  I don't really know where that comes from, but I thought it's the number five in Roman numerals.
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:27.120]  But I guess everything's been used somewhere by a cultist.
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.120]  I mean, if they use the color green, can I not wear that?
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:33.120]  I've worn green shirts before and said, are you a Muslim?
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:35.120]  You're wearing green.
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:37.120]  My favorite color is green.
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  I mean, it's like an insane, I'm not saying the color is insane,
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:45.120]  but it goes to the insane sometimes of like grand inquisitors and witch hunts or something.
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:47.120]  I'm here fighting the New World Order.
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:49.120]  I'm speaking out against abortion.
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:55.120]  I've always found somebody who's really fighting abortion is on the side of good.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:56.120]  I mean, really fighting it.
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:57.120]  But it isn't about me.
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:59.120]  What are you going to do about the New World Order?
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.120]  What are you going to do about Alex Jones?
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:02.120]  What are you going to do?
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:03.120]  What are we going to do?
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:05.120]  Just sit here and argue with each other.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:06.120]  He's an agent.
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:07.120]  They're an agent.
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:08.120]  Everybody's an agent.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:09.120]  No, there's a lot of good people here.
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  You know, you're good.
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:11.120]  Take action.
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.120]  Man, John in London.
[02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:15.120]  You're on the air, John.
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:16.120]  Go ahead.
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:18.120]  So good to speak to you.
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:19.120]  Good talk to you.
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:20.120]  What's on your mind?
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:21.120]  Yeah.
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:27.120]  I just wanted to say first of all that I absolutely agree with you with what you have to say about abortion.
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:31.120]  I personally started making a stand knowing that abortion is an evil.
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:37.120]  It's a known evil rather than the things that we sort of discover.
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:42.120]  And it's only after that that I started actually waking up to a lot of other things like seeing
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:46.120]  your wonderful DVDs like the Obama Deception.
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:49.120]  I had to watch that repeatedly.
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.120]  And really that opened my mind to a lot of things.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  Another thing that I wanted to mention is in today's Daily Mail, there's an article written
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:08.120]  by a man called Peter Sissons who was a BBC reporter for about 20 years.
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:15.120]  And in this article, he mentions that the BBC did a trial run for announcing Diana's death
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.120]  prior to her death.
[02:58:16.120 --> 02:58:22.120]  Well, she made a video saying Prince Charles said he was going to kill her in a fake auto accident.
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  Yeah, that's amazing how these things come out.
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:33.120]  And they're putting it all out in the newspapers for us to read just like that.
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:37.120]  And yeah, we've got an evil government going on here.
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:39.120]  Awesome to hear from you, John.
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:49.120]  We'll come right back in one minute.
[02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:12.120]  We've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:16.120]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:18.120]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:21.120]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:26.120]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:31.120]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:37.120]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:42.120]  To freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it, visit eFoodsDirect.com on the Internet

[02:59:45.120 --> 03:00:13.120]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:17.120]  But if you go to my Facebook account that's linked on infowars.com,
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:20.120]  you can see all the other flyers people are making.
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:25.120]  If you don't like the V and that letter really scares you, then there's resistance.
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:28.120]  Join the resistance with a big R.
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:30.120]  Oh, but it says we are legion, the fan man.
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:31.120]  They'll think that's the devil.
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:33.120]  Actually, you can't use that.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:34.120]  You can't use anything.
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:38.120]  But I didn't make it, so I'm not ukabugging you.
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:42.120]  Maybe we can use the one with St. Michael killing or stabbing the devil with V for resistance.
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:44.120]  Now they'll say that's satanic, too.
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:45.120]  I guess it's got a devil on it.
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:46.120]  Don't use any of it.
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:47.120]  Just don't do the contest.
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:48.120]  It's all over.
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.120]  Don't even do the answer, 1974, 1776.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:55.120]  Don't stand up against Homeland Security brainwashing people with their own contest
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:58.120]  to get videos produced by citizens about spying on each other.
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:01.120]  Just everything's the devil, so just give up and that's the end of it.
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:02.120]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:05.120]  Let's talk to Sovereign Space in California.
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  You're on the air, Sovereign Space.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:12.120]  The thing that's happening is about jobs and money and that's all it's ever been.
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:16.120]  So if you want to save the dollar, then you're into government.
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.120]  There's no good, bad government.
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:19.120]  That's what it stands for.
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:20.120]  Okay, Matt.
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:21.120]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:24.120]  You call every day on a different name, and it's not that we're ignoring you, but we
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:27.120]  got about 100 calls a day from here at the office, and I just can't handle it.
[03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:28.120]  Thank you, though.
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:30.120]  Let's talk to Tony in Seattle.
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:31.120]  Tony, you're on the air.
[03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:32.120]  Go ahead.
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  Alex, thanks for all you're doing.
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:36.120]  You're leaving a positive legacy.
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:39.120]  So I have been kind of an announcement, I guess.
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:47.120]  I'm a soldier, incident commander for HAZMAT, Mass Casualty in Washington State, EMT 15
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:48.120]  years.
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:52.120]  About four months ago, I watched one of these DVDs on police state, and I had a great
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  realization that three years ago I was in one of those trainings.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:02.120]  And it was hard to assimilate that.
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:08.880]  But in Washington State, what they were doing was a mission to Evergreen, and all the civilians
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:13.960]  were doing their jobs, the EMTs, the airport fire, all that kind of thing.
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:21.520]  We were doing something different, and we were to escort the top politicians from small
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:26.040]  industrial airports to shelters that we didn't know of.
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:27.760]  That wasn't the scary part.
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:34.560]  The scary part was I'm the hand-to-hand instructor, and when they're asking us to do role playing
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:39.560]  on taking citizens off the street, they're saying, I'm your uncle, I go to your church,
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:43.640]  I go to your wife's school, what are you doing to me?
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:47.640]  And we said, hell no, what is this about?
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:50.680]  And the other thing was we had several forces that were there.
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:53.040]  We didn't even know what the hell country they were from.
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:58.680]  I've been to many urban warfare drills where they're practicing putting citizens in camps
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:02.880]  and where the troops train with foreign troops with role players saying, I'm your father,
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:05.960]  I'm your uncle, we have rights, don't take my guns.
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:08.920]  And you're saying you were in one of those training drills.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:14.040]  And what I'm saying today is if you're an officer, if you're a fireman, if you're a
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:17.560]  security guard, be wary.
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:20.720]  There's going to be a point in time when you're going to have a pivotal moment, when you're
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:26.040]  standing there in your uniform, and you're going to have a deep realization, please listen
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:32.000]  to me people, tell anyone you know that are in these categories of jobs.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:37.240]  They're going to have a stark realization that they are part of the big deal.
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:43.160]  They're going to have a choice to make, either lay down and go home or fight back or whatever
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:46.000]  they do, but don't give into it.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.520]  But you're saying you weren't aware of what was going on at the time.
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.960]  It was later when you saw the big picture that you understood, but were others questioning?
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:54.960]  Why are we training?
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:04:02.080]  I questioned it, and what happened was there was six of us that were very specialized.
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:05.520]  I was a bodyguard for top ranking military.
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:06.520]  That was my job.
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:09.880]  There's only 1,600 of us in all the services.
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:14.440]  My military card says indefinite, I cannot separate.
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:16.520]  I'm one of those.
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:20.280]  And when we came back, and I have a great relationship with the 06 Colonel, I worked
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.000]  with him every day, and I said, sir, what the hell's going on?
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  And I also said, we brought guys all the way from the eastern side of our state to do this
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:29.360]  exercise.
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:32.640]  And when any of them were questioning what was happening, they were put in their barracks
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:35.360]  and said, well, we don't need you anymore, this drill.
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.440]  And they sat there for three and four days on their phone.
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.440]  You know what they were doing?
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:41.400]  They were finding out who will go along with the martial law and who won't.
[03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:42.400]  You know what?
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  This is so powerful.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:45.520]  This information is so important.
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:49.800]  We're going to come back and continue overdrive briefly with you and finish up with you.
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:51.960]  Because I was going to get your number and have you back on.
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:52.960]  But I've been there.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:53.960]  I've seen the training.
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:56.800]  I want to give you the floor for about five minutes when we come back, then we'll join
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:59.040]  the retransmission as it was going.
[03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:00.040]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:02.560]  We'll be right back.

[03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:06.680]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:09.400]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:06:09.400 --> 03:06:11.960]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:15.680]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[03:06:15.680 --> 03:06:17.400]  of your health and your own family.
[03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:20.320]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:22.680]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:06:22.680 --> 03:06:26.920]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:28.920]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:32.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:36.400]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:39.600]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:41.120]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:43.560]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:48.040]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:08.760]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:13.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:32.640]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:38.760]  Live, ladies and gentlemen, it's 208 Central Standard Time in 35 seconds, the 24th day
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:44.440]  of January, 2011, and if you weren't tuned in earlier, I've gone into overdrive because
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:50.040]  Tony in Seattle was in the military as a bodyguard.
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:52.880]  They were doing drills, and we actually haven't.
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:55.880]  They're not secret, but they've never really been aired on television.
[03:08:55.880 --> 03:09:00.160]  Government training videos back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, we've even used a few clips
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:05.240]  of them in our films, well, in an upcoming film, where they were training under nuclear
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:12.720]  attack to move the mayor, the county commissioners, others, local congresspeople who are in town,
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:16.760]  who aren't in Washington, end of secret bunkers.
[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:18.920]  And that's how the feds federalized them.
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:20.720]  Oh, the feds are here to help.
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:24.600]  But then I've been to countless, I mean, many, many urban warfare drills, where they have
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:28.680]  foreign troops with Marines, Army, National Guard, they're doing gun confiscation.
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:32.600]  They've got hired role-players screaming, I'm your uncle, I'm your dad, I'm your mom.
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:33.600]  Don't take me to the camp.
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:35.720]  I've got a right to own this gun.
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:40.920]  We've got that in police day 2000 video I shot.
[03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:46.080]  And I remember playing that in 99 in police day 2000, on local access TV and it going
[03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:52.000]  out on VHS to people and getting letters and calls saying, you hired that Coronado trip
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.320]  ship to land.
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:57.320]  You hired those, those warrior fighting vehicles, you hired those foreign troops.
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:00.160]  That's not real.
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:02.800]  And I remember Rick Linklet of the director saw it and I told him that people didn't
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:03.800]  believe it was real.
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:05.480]  And he goes, well, I know people in California that saw it happen.
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:09.720]  He goes, this would take 20, 30 million dollars to shoot one of these scenes.
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:12.000]  You would win a Academy Award for this.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:13.160]  Of course it's real.
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:19.600]  And it was on the news, CNN said, oh, they're training for Macedonian.
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:21.720]  It was in the newspaper that it happened.
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:26.120]  My film had the news articles on still not real.
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:31.520]  That was 12 years ago, back when people were not acclimated by the media to accept trips
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:35.440]  on the streets and checkpoints and TSA.
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:40.520]  And so yes, going back for over 15 years, they've been training the military to take
[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:43.920]  your guns to go door to door to take you to FEMA camps.
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:46.240]  And you notice they didn't bring food or water in for five days.
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:50.240]  They wouldn't let folks walk out on the high and dry highways in New Orleans.
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:52.800]  They went to the richest areas, high and dry.
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:56.760]  The poor areas are down low, generally in New Orleans, multi-million dollar homes and
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.760]  went in and busted open gun safes and took people's guns while they were home and put
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:03.360]  them in handcuffs.
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:06.160]  I mean, this was to see if the military and police would do this.
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:12.320]  Now you heard Tony, I know his story is true because I'm even aware of Operation Evergreen.
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:16.360]  I'm aware of the drills they've run in LA09, all of them.
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:18.000]  And I've already been to drills like this.
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  This stuff's all public.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:23.400]  Now, years ago it was very secretive and they'd lied to local media for what it was for.
[03:11:23.400 --> 03:11:27.440]  But the number one thing it's there for is to find troops that'll do it.
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:30.200]  Those that don't, they can find them to barracks.
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:32.880]  Just as he said, they get sent off to Iraq.
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:37.920]  They get the big, you know, list of injections to be given as guinea pigs.
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:43.360]  They get DU duty to take care, you know, to clean the DU weapons, you know, the firearms
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:48.600]  and cannons and guns that have been used, the howitzers that have been firing DU.
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:49.880]  Literally.
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:54.680]  You get sent overseas to die and to get an early death from cancer.
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:59.360]  Those that say yes, get promoted up the chain, then get brought into infraguard over local
[03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:01.640]  civilian spy forces.
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:05.720]  Just in the last two months, my father, who's a dentist, was approached by Homeland Security,
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:09.120]  not even knowing that he was my dad, one of his patients approached him.
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:10.680]  And so we want you to spy on people.
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:12.080]  He said, he didn't say anything.
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:13.720]  He said, thank God I've get involved.
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:14.720]  I said, no, don't do that.
[03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:16.360]  Don't get involved to find out what's going on.
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:17.360]  We already know.
[03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:19.120]  Don't get involved.
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:22.080]  Then he was telling Dr. King about it in the break room.
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:25.600]  And Dr. King went, yeah, they came to my house separate people a week ago.
[03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:30.720]  So just in my life, they're getting all the professionals to spy.
[03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:36.080]  You see the TSA ads going out, the TV news pieces, spy on your neighbors, nothing safe,
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:38.280]  you can only trust Homeland Security.
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:42.880]  It's about more mistrust in each other and then only trusting our loving government who's
[03:12:42.880 --> 03:12:44.400]  busy robbing us blind.
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:48.000]  We know this is a classical takeover program happening.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:49.480]  And now it's coming to a head.
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:52.080]  So, Tony, I want you to start over from the beginning.
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:56.480]  You've got the floor here for a few minutes where the drill was, what was happening, all
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:01.440]  the details you just covered, and then more break down your concern, how they can find
[03:13:01.440 --> 03:13:03.200]  folks that knew it was wrong.
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:04.680]  Break it down for us.
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:05.680]  Okay.
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:12.120]  Well, first, the thing that we have to understand is there's a national guard, okay, and many
[03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:15.280]  states have what's called a state guard.
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:21.200]  And Washington State through Gary Locke, some, I don't know, 10 years ago or whenever, reinstigated
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:22.520]  the state guard.
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:26.760]  The guys used to be old retirees just watching the museum.
[03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:28.280]  So they outfitted us.
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:33.600]  I was one of the people that was supposed to bring it up to strength, do the hand-to-hand,
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:38.040]  you know, all the rifle, all the stuff that we have to do to get, we're hiring civilians
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:44.120]  because this is a volunteer, you're still liable for UCMJ military law.
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:48.480]  You still get rank, and if you were prior service or currently serving, you can gain
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:49.480]  rank within the...
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:51.640]  So they're now federalizing the state guards, which we've confirmed.
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:56.080]  They have state guards from Alabama to Texas at local high school football games, searching
[03:13:56.080 --> 03:13:58.760]  three-year-olds with their Hello Kitty purses.
[03:13:58.760 --> 03:14:05.280]  We actually have photos of that in my police state film that we made in 2005, 9-1-1 Rise
[03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:06.280]  the Police State.
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:10.880]  So yes, I can confirm that as well, so they have regular army, like my cousin, who they
[03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:15.720]  bring in to train the national guard, the state guard for martial law.
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:17.640]  Please continue.
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:22.560]  And one of the things about them that we have to understand is some of the guys you're looking
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:28.920]  at in uniform are an accountant, never did basic, or a gas station worker or something,
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:30.720]  and I don't have anything against that.
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:34.320]  I like people serving for the good.
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:38.240]  But we're getting right back into that thing of, do you want some guy who's always wanted
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:42.240]  to pull a trigger or beat someone over the head who doesn't really have any military
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:43.240]  training or military...
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:44.960]  He's not fighting real enemies.
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:47.160]  He's been trained to fight his new enemy, the American people.
[03:14:47.160 --> 03:14:50.540]  Let's get back to this drill, shepherding the politicians out.
[03:14:50.540 --> 03:14:51.840]  That's very important.
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:57.680]  So what they were doing was, all the civilian workers, whether it be EMT, a doctor, hospital
[03:14:57.680 --> 03:15:03.000]  facility or whatever, were doing moulage scenarios, like there's a plane down, there's
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:06.520]  a fire over here, there's an outbreak of something there.
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:14.040]  Meanwhile, us and our little group were going back and forth, hand carrying special people
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:22.000]  of status to bunkers that we didn't even know about.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:27.360]  And when we had gotten back, I asked the colonel about that, and he kind of had a slight eye
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:30.360]  toward me, like, why are you really, you know, asking?
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:35.280]  Being one of the senior NCOs and in charge of half of the platoon, you know, I need to
[03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:37.200]  know what's going on.
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:44.320]  And then when we went back out the next day, the second day, they started doing these moulage
[03:15:44.320 --> 03:15:50.160]  scenarios of taking over school kids, colleges, people out of their truck driving down the
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:55.760]  street, you know, searching and doing all this, but I wasn't training those people.
[03:15:55.760 --> 03:16:00.640]  And what I noticed was the civilians, the role players, they're not real civilians,
[03:16:00.640 --> 03:16:05.360]  were saying things like, why, you know, I know you from church, why are you doing this?
[03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:10.000]  Or, you know, I'm a good guy, I don't have anything here, why are you, you know, arresting
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  me?
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  I work with your wife.
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  Why are you doing it?
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:14.480]  I'm an American.
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:19.480]  They're giving these people up to just dissolve that, uh...
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:20.480]  That bond.
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:22.160]  From now on, knowing that that's wrong.
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:26.520]  And that's what the 9,000 locations with telescreens saying, don't trust your neighbor are.
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:28.360]  They're really gearing up.
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:29.960]  They actually could drop the hammer now.
[03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:32.720]  We're entering years ago, I said, look, it could take decades.
[03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:33.720]  Now we're here.
[03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:34.720]  No, no, no, no.
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:35.720]  Absolutely so.
[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:39.400]  So they're training them to take people out of cars, load them on army trucks.
[03:16:39.400 --> 03:16:40.680]  Yep.
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:45.560]  And the other thing is they're, they're, they're, they're, they're structures this.
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:50.120]  Locate them, obtain them, uh, bring them to the quarantine area, and then they go to
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:53.120]  the docks where the trains are.
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:54.120]  Mm-hmm.
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:55.120]  I know.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:58.120]  And, and, and, and on top of this, this came out in Model States Health Emergency Powers
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:16:59.120]  Act.
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:03.000]  They'll use any excuse to drill, trying to get local police and firemen to round up people
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:04.200]  for forced inoculation.
[03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:08.080]  The problem was they wanted to shoot them up with smallpox in 2002.
[03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:10.360]  So they said no, so they couldn't even do it.
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:13.680]  Now they've told them, okay, you don't have to take it, but you're going to make everybody
[03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:14.680]  else take it.
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:16.280]  And now they have the clergy response teams.
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:19.320]  We got the internal documents three years before it was mainstream niche.
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:20.320]  People couldn't believe it.
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:25.120]  Training the clergy to tell their flocks to go to the FEMA camps to turn over, uh, uh,
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:26.120]  their firearms.
[03:17:26.120 --> 03:17:27.120]  It's of the Lord.
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:28.120]  Romans 13.
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:30.240]  We've only got about two minutes left in this segment.
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:34.480]  Finish up with the, uh, military that said no, what happened to them?
[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:37.880]  And so, and we're talking about very gifted soldiers here.
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:42.720]  The backbone of this unit, probably eight of us, four from the other side of the state
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:43.920]  and four of us from here.
[03:17:43.920 --> 03:17:46.080]  You're training the Uncle Samilian Goon Squad.
[03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:47.080]  Right.
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:50.840]  And so we went to the, the logistics area, you know, with all the big screens, the big
[03:17:50.840 --> 03:17:52.160]  thing you see on TV.
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:57.000]  We went in to talk to the bird colonel who's exercising this mission and said, you know,
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:58.000]  what is going on?
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  What are we doing?
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:02.360]  And we were literally told to stand by and go to the barracks and they'll have a mission
[03:18:02.360 --> 03:18:05.600]  force shortly, which they never had anything.
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:10.160]  And, uh, after that, we went to the colonel after that and who I work personally for and
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:12.080]  watch him bodyguard him.
[03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:13.080]  I understand what happened.
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:14.080]  Tell us.
[03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:19.360]  They took my idea away and said, you're not in the Washington State Guard anymore.
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:21.160]  Thank you for your service.
[03:18:21.160 --> 03:18:22.160]  Yep.
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:27.480]  And again, they're looking, it's a drill, just like what TSA, they go, is the radiation
[03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:28.480]  dangerous?
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:29.480]  Is this violating rights?
[03:18:29.480 --> 03:18:30.480]  Boom.
[03:18:30.480 --> 03:18:31.480]  You're out.
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:32.960]  They're finding the dumbest.
[03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:38.320]  That's why they won't hire cops under, uh, over a hundred IQ now and, and, and we got
[03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:39.320]  a minute left.
[03:18:39.320 --> 03:18:40.320]  Any other tidbits?
[03:18:40.320 --> 03:18:44.960]  I gotta tell you this real important, okay, no, let me tell you this, they, they retired
[03:18:44.960 --> 03:18:45.960]  me early.
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:46.960]  Okay.
[03:18:46.960 --> 03:18:50.920]  And so then I went in the voc rehab program where you get trained for a new position.
[03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:52.160]  Okay.
[03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:55.840]  And one of my colleagues that I went through the three years of the school with that was
[03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:00.560]  an airman who was physically at NORAD who was told to stand down and I tried to get
[03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:07.240]  that to your producers, but I, here's a great kid and I've known him for four years and
[03:19:07.240 --> 03:19:13.960]  he's a hell of a good airman, four point student and what they do is the guys that they told
[03:19:13.960 --> 03:19:20.360]  to stand down during 9 11 were obviously, you know, amiss or like, hell no, you know,
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:21.360]  forget it.
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:23.120]  You know, why don't we do anything?
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:25.480]  And you got top brass in there from all forces.
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:28.760]  So, you know, they're having to stay, you know, in line.
[03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:35.560]  And as soon as that event was over within days, they basically gave anybody that, that gave
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.320]  up a little inkling of decisiveness about that.
[03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:44.840]  And they exited these airmen and soldiers out on mental anxieties to be retrained.
[03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:47.600]  Oh, yeah, they always did that, that happened in World War Two.
[03:19:47.600 --> 03:19:52.920]  If you complained about faulty parts in your plane, you were given a, you know, a section
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:54.920]  eight mental illness situation.
[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:55.920]  We're going to get your name and number.
[03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:56.920]  I'd like to talk to you again.
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:07.720]  You want to write an article for us under a pen name and we publish it at infowars.com.
