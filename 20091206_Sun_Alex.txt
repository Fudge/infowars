[00:48.440 --> 00:57.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:04.440 --> 01:12.440]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:12.440 --> 01:20.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.440]  Jones.
[01:28.440 --> 01:36.440]  It is the day before the Copenhagen-Triesen meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.960]  It will be taking place on the 7th, 8th, and 9th. We're gonna have live reports
[01:41.960 --> 01:48.040]  from Copenhagen from multiple reporters, including Lord Christopher Monkton of
[01:48.040 --> 01:55.880]  Monkton and Brinchley. Tuesday, Jesse Ventura will also be pumping in, talking
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.480]  about his new television broadcast Tuesday, just a plug so people are aware of the
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.520]  fact that's coming up during the weekday broadcast, Monday through Friday, from
[02:06.520 --> 02:11.480]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Congressman Ron Paul is also scheduled to be on with us next
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.640]  week as well. Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to open the phones up for the full
[02:17.640 --> 02:22.360]  two hours. I really want to hear from you on two major
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.280]  subjects. Government takeover of health care and the fact that Obama wants to cut
[02:28.280 --> 02:35.240]  $42.1 billion a year out of Medicare alone. We're going to go back through and
[02:35.240 --> 02:41.640]  look at the government health care bill today because they are probably going to
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.000]  pass it this year or next year and this is just the private central bank
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.560]  seizing 17% of the economy that they didn't control. Obviously, huge new
[02:53.560 --> 02:58.360]  developments on the climate gate front. The media is now saying they think they
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.080]  know who hacked it, who leaked it. They're claiming Russian-affiliated
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.840]  students who were going to the East Anglia Center. I don't know if that's
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.960]  true. Some of the evidence shows that it's not.
[03:11.960 --> 03:15.320]  It was leaked out on many different servers and computer systems.
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.400]  Why are they picking one associated with Russia? Well, that way they can talk
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.360]  about it being some type of dirty espionage. Regardless of that fact, we
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.280]  know that the United Nations and the colleges involved have admitted that
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.960]  these emails and internal documents are real. They are authentic and so there's
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.920]  been some big new developments in the last few days on that front as well
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.520]  that we're going to be going over today. But I want to hear from listeners
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.880]  your view on the Copenhagen Treaty, how we can defeat it. A lot of people are
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.720]  asking, will it be implemented? Will it be passed? The answer is yes. I
[03:57.720 --> 04:00.920]  believe that it will be ratified and will be signed
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.760]  by this international body and by the United Nations and the IPCC
[04:06.760 --> 04:09.720]  and the 191 nations that are going to be attending.
[04:09.720 --> 04:15.400]  But still, it has to be ratified in the Senate
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.440]  here in the United States. And so we're going to be going over the different
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.600]  political angles of that and how we kill this. We have a good chance of killing
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.040]  it in the United States, not much of a chance of killing it at
[04:28.040 --> 04:32.680]  Copenhagen, the international agreement itself. And so the devil is in the
[04:32.680 --> 04:35.800]  details. Of course, this treaty establishes open
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.880]  world government, world taxation, world regulation.
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.080]  And so the debate is over about whether there's a world government forming
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.440]  right now and we know the aims of that world government.
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.960]  And there's been some new developments on that front. One of the
[04:49.960 --> 04:54.920]  climate change heads at the IPCC is a Bilderberg group member.
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.160]  He's given speeches in Germany calling for world population reduction
[04:59.160 --> 05:02.760]  and admitting that there is an international consensus in the elite
[05:02.760 --> 05:06.040]  to bring in world government to carry out population reduction.
[05:06.040 --> 05:09.720]  For the new world order, world government is only the beginning.
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.440]  Population reduction, one-child policies, forced poverty on the world
[05:14.440 --> 05:19.400]  population is their goal. And that's just beginning.
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.080]  So that's all coming up today. I want to give you the toll-free number to join us.
[05:23.080 --> 05:26.520]  We're opening the phones up right now on government-run health care,
[05:26.520 --> 05:29.080]  on the new world order agenda, on the Copenhagen treaty,
[05:29.080 --> 05:40.120]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776. I'm here live six days a week,
[05:40.120 --> 05:43.320]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central,
[05:43.320 --> 05:49.000]  back 4 to 6 p.m. central as well. Very important broadcast. Thank you so much
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.880]  for joining us and not being distracted and diverted by all the
[05:51.880 --> 05:55.800]  gladiatorial entertainment. Like Sunday Night Football,
[05:55.800 --> 05:59.800]  we're here trying to save the Republic and the planet from tyranny.
[05:59.800 --> 06:05.400]  Hello, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to invite you to go to tpr20info.com.

[06:53.800 --> 06:55.960]  That's tpr20info.com.
[07:01.240 --> 07:05.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[07:05.320 --> 07:17.160]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[07:21.080 --> 07:30.600]  It is Sunday, the 6th day of December 2009. We're going to be live here this evening for the next
[07:30.600 --> 07:37.480]  two hours. And of course, we're going to have wide open phones on the birth of world government
[07:37.480 --> 07:46.200]  to begin during the Copenhagen Greenhouse Gas Emissions International Summit going on
[07:46.200 --> 07:54.280]  from December 7th to December 18th, 2009. Barack Obama, who promised that he would not
[07:54.280 --> 08:00.440]  attend the summit, has now broken that promise following his continued streak of being nothing
[08:00.440 --> 08:08.200]  but the liar-in-chief, even outlying Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. We're going to be breaking
[08:08.200 --> 08:14.840]  that down today. And also, government hijacking of healthcare, the nanny state wanting to run your
[08:14.840 --> 08:22.600]  life. When we've read the 2,070-plus-page bill and gone over the subsections here together
[08:22.600 --> 08:28.840]  in the last few months, it has rationing of care, unelected government bodies decide what care you
[08:28.840 --> 08:37.400]  get, not doctors. 2.5 to 5% depending on your tax bracket of your check will be taken. On top of
[08:37.400 --> 08:45.000]  that, you'll be forced to get insurance or be fined yearly. The refusal will be a quarter
[08:45.000 --> 08:54.120]  million dollar fine and five years in prison. And this is from CNN today. Obama to meet with
[08:54.120 --> 09:00.520]  Senate Democrats to push healthcare. There's a revolt even by the Democrats and Republicans.
[09:00.520 --> 09:10.200]  Senate Republicans failed Saturday to eliminate $42.1 billion in cuts to Medicare home healthcare
[09:10.200 --> 09:17.320]  service in the healthcare bill. And that's only one of scores of cuts. So you have the Republicans
[09:17.320 --> 09:27.800]  fighting to stop 42-plus billion a year being cut from Medicare. We've seen this with Obama.
[09:27.800 --> 09:34.600]  For every $30 he gives to offshore banks of taxpayer money, one dollar goes to social
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.920]  welfare net. Now, I don't believe in socialism. I don't believe in big government because I know
[09:40.920 --> 09:48.440]  that socialism always turns into a way for elite organizations to steal the taxpayer money.
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.320]  And then crumbs are given to the public and that makes the public dependent.
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.320]  But here is such a great example of how big corporations and big money, it was the insurance
[09:59.320 --> 10:06.440]  companies that actually wrote the healthcare bill and they bragged about that. The head lobbyist
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.000]  for the healthcare insurance companies of the United States has been all over television bragging
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.440]  that, hey, we're not against government healthcare, why we wrote it. And you bet they wrote it. It's a
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.600]  giant tax paid to them as Dennis Kucinich, a real socialist. I don't agree with his policies,
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.760]  but I agree with his honesty. You know, wrote articles saying why I voted against the healthcare
[10:26.760 --> 10:32.520]  bill. And then another article he wrote saying healthcare bill is a giant bailout to the insurance
[10:32.520 --> 10:40.360]  companies. But every time you're against government run healthcare, the talking point is, oh,
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.720]  you work for the insurance companies. Isn't that just special?
[10:48.200 --> 10:55.560]  So imagine this upside down world where the Republicans are trying to block all these cuts,
[10:55.560 --> 11:07.800]  one of them 42.1 billion a year or roughly 25% of the Medicare expenditures. So Obama is having
[11:07.800 --> 11:15.400]  a 25% cut in the money you get. Now you've already paid into this in taxes your whole life.
[11:16.120 --> 11:22.200]  They take your money just like Social Security. The average worker invested in Social Security
[11:22.200 --> 11:31.080]  for 35 years, they'd get over $2 million. But instead you get negative return and you get on
[11:31.080 --> 11:49.480]  average about $450,000. You get fully 75% less, 75% less back on your money. You pay Social Security
[11:49.480 --> 12:00.040]  your whole working life and you get 75% less than you would have it would have been invested
[12:00.040 --> 12:06.760]  in guaranteed government bonds at 4%. Does it matter though? The general public can't figure
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.880]  that out. The general working person has money taken out of their check. They don't understand it.
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.400]  A lot of working people actually think that when you pay a bunch of taxes that somehow you're
[12:17.400 --> 12:24.920]  getting it over on the rich guys, when the big moneyed elites, the 1 tenth of 1% as a unified
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.360]  group lobby for bigger government because it's bigger government that gives them the monopolies
[12:30.360 --> 12:40.680]  they need and gives them the corporate welfare they rely on. Now I got more emails this week,
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.400]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds that I didn't even have time to read but scanning over them saying
[12:45.400 --> 12:54.280]  how dare you, Mr. Jones, be against government health care. You are a minion of the insurance
[12:54.280 --> 13:00.360]  companies and I just explained to you that the insurance companies are for this. And similarly,
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.600]  people have now gone through the thousands of emails, hundreds of documents from the Head UN
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.920]  Climate Research Center that supplied the data to all the other governments and universities.
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.240]  That's on record the head climate facility, not some backwater, engaged in lies and climate
[13:17.240 --> 13:23.560]  aid, engaged in fraud, consciously knowingly lying, persecuting other scientists that were
[13:23.560 --> 13:29.160]  telling the truth, getting people fired, blocking government for your request, colluding with the
[13:29.160 --> 13:37.480]  government to keep the documents secret. Now going through the emails, it has been discovered
[13:37.480 --> 13:43.480]  by the Times of London, whatsupwiththat.com, Climate Depot and others, and we have these linked
[13:43.480 --> 13:51.640]  up on prismplanet.com, climategatecru, looks to big oil for support. And these emails,
[13:53.880 --> 14:04.360]  these emails go back six years ago about how they're meeting with Dutch Royal Shell, BP
[14:04.360 --> 14:11.880]  and others who are actually funding them for this research. British Petroleum, Energy,
[14:12.440 --> 14:20.200]  Eastern Electricity, Greenpeace International, Leather Hume Trust, National Power, Nuclear
[14:20.200 --> 14:27.480]  Installations, Inspectorate, Shell, Sultan of Oman, World Wildlife Fund, which is a eugenics front.
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.680]  This is the groups. In fact, I'll show prismplanet.tv viewers the emails. Here are the emails.
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.840]  Here's one from 2000. Had a great meeting, very good meeting with Shell yesterday,
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.080]  only a minor part of our agenda. And they talk about how they're taking over the economy.
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.160]  These guys are a joke. Here's another one. Had a great meeting with the CEO of Siemens.
[14:51.560 --> 15:00.280]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on. Now, last week, I showed you the New York Times.
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.560]  I mean, just Google it for yourself. Shell, cap and trade is a good thing.
[15:07.080 --> 15:12.600]  Another one. ExxonMobil supports global carbon tax, Wall Street Journal. I mean,
[15:15.320 --> 15:21.720]  the head lobbyist for the healthcare industries in the US and the head lobbyist for the insurance
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.600]  companies bragged that they wrote the takeover of healthcare. Big corporations like that.
[15:26.600 --> 15:31.800]  They like consolidation. The biggest fortunes out there are made off government. As John D
[15:31.800 --> 15:38.040]  Rockefeller, the first said, competition is a sin. And here are the emails with the head
[15:38.040 --> 15:45.080]  climatology unit for the UN having meetings with Dutch Royal Shell, BP, all of them rigging.
[15:45.080 --> 15:52.440]  I mean, folks, don't believe me. Open a magazine up. Half the ads that you see literally are for
[15:52.440 --> 16:01.080]  global taxes and global greening. Nothing to do with greening. Nothing. Absolutely nothing to do
[16:01.080 --> 16:07.240]  with it. I mean, I walked through the airport when I fly around the country. I was in LAX.
[16:07.240 --> 16:12.360]  Half the billboards inside the concourse were oil companies and computer companies and defense
[16:12.360 --> 16:17.960]  companies pushing the global system. And they candy coated and talk of electric cars and wind
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.520]  power. Also, it has nothing to do with that. It's about a select group at a global government level
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.480]  being able to control our lives and being able to decide what businesses you can have,
[16:29.480 --> 16:35.080]  what energy you can have, what technology can be developed. It's all in the Copenhagen climate
[16:35.080 --> 16:41.960]  change treaty. We're going to break down what this treaty does. They're meeting starting tomorrow,
[16:41.960 --> 16:48.040]  the head of the UN, the head of the EU, the head of the IPCC, the head of the UN, Ban Ki-moon,
[16:48.040 --> 16:55.560]  are all in the news calling for planetary government to reduce population. That's more
[16:55.560 --> 17:01.640]  important than a Dallas cowboy. I will assure you, stay with us. The illusion created by the power
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.680]  elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.120]  profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.240]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution. Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife

[17:57.960 --> 18:04.520]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[18:04.520 --> 18:08.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.880]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[18:13.880 --> 18:19.480]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.600]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.880]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[18:29.880 --> 18:34.360]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.240]  from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[18:39.240 --> 18:43.240]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[18:43.240 --> 18:49.960]  Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[19:04.040 --> 19:08.840]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[19:08.840 --> 19:14.120]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[19:14.120 --> 19:19.080]  food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the
[19:19.080 --> 19:23.880]  battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[19:23.880 --> 19:28.680]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.480]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you
[19:33.480 --> 19:39.160]  have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[19:39.160 --> 19:44.760]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[19:44.760 --> 19:53.000]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at

[20:02.440 --> 20:06.840]  that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center,
[20:06.840 --> 20:11.880]  buying their processed food that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't
[20:11.880 --> 20:17.080]  have to cooperate. There is a solution. InnerHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just

[21:01.000 --> 21:08.120]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[21:08.120 --> 21:20.120]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, December 6, 2009
[21:20.120 --> 21:29.000]  edition. We see the entire corporate structure, the entire government structure worldwide
[21:29.560 --> 21:36.360]  pushing for taxes on all human activity to be paid to a world government. We see the states
[21:36.360 --> 21:43.320]  across the United States implementing their own cap and trade systems, their own systems
[21:43.320 --> 21:51.080]  to track and trace everything you do. This is slavery and in the IPCC United Nations Treaty
[21:51.080 --> 21:58.520]  that we've covered so many times on air, it states global government with control over all
[21:58.520 --> 22:06.680]  nations will be implemented through this plan. That's why it's so wonderful that two weeks ago,
[22:07.320 --> 22:13.960]  thousands of emails and documents including the climate programs that the UN was using got leaked.
[22:13.960 --> 22:28.120]  Now, Reuters and others are reporting that they believe Russians may have hacked this,
[22:30.040 --> 22:35.560]  but it doesn't matter who hacked it. They're saying they think Russian students there
[22:35.560 --> 22:41.640]  hacked it because it was released on a server out of Russia, but that doesn't make sense
[22:41.640 --> 22:47.640]  because six weeks before that happened, it was leaked and given to the BBC and other
[22:47.640 --> 22:54.360]  British and US media and reporters it's now come out, this has been in multiple newspapers,
[22:54.360 --> 22:59.240]  had the material and asked to be able to go with it with their editors, especially at the BBC and
[22:59.240 --> 23:08.040]  were told no. And those reporters are saying that they got it from researchers inside of the East
[23:08.040 --> 23:14.600]  Anglia Climatology Center, the head UN center. Because if you're going to gauge in fraud,
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.760]  you've got to have one place the fraud comes from to keep your story straight.
[23:21.320 --> 23:28.440]  But continuing along those lines, then I'm going to your phone calls and then into the
[23:28.440 --> 23:33.880]  fact that Obama is cutting Medicare and Medicaid. That's the supposed liberalness of this guy
[23:33.880 --> 23:38.840]  in his government run healthcare. You see, because the big banks that have bankrupted this country
[23:38.840 --> 23:46.040]  by design, they need all the money for themselves. And later, arming Goldman with pistols against
[23:46.040 --> 23:51.160]  the public. This is out of Bloomberg. I mentioned this a few days ago. I want to get into it today
[23:51.160 --> 23:57.560]  how Goldman Sachs fears rioters attacking them so they're arming themselves with weapons.
[23:57.560 --> 24:04.920]  This is out of Bloomberg financial. First off, emails that rocked climate change campaign leaked
[24:04.920 --> 24:14.040]  from Siberian closed city university built by KGB UK daily mail suspicions were growing last night
[24:14.040 --> 24:18.600]  that Russian security services were behind the leaking of the notorious British climate gate
[24:18.600 --> 24:25.640]  emails, which threatened to undermine tomorrow's Copenhagen global warming summit. And the UN
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.400]  is finally admitting that this does hurt them because this is their main climate center.
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.120]  And again, the emails admit they're engaged in fraud and they know the earth's cooling,
[24:34.120 --> 24:40.040]  the ice cores, the tree rings, all the measurements. They have been caught
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.520]  lying about the thermometer data worldwide. The earth has been cooling for nine years.
[24:47.240 --> 24:54.120]  It was heating part of a natural process. Even the UN's own reports say two to six percent,
[24:54.120 --> 25:01.160]  depending on which report of warming, which itself is a fraud, is manmade. The UN says the
[25:01.160 --> 25:08.520]  seas will go up one foot. The UN is being forced to admit that's a fraud now, but Schwarzenegger
[25:08.520 --> 25:15.400]  is giving speeches saying it may raise 10, 20, 30, 40, even 50 feet, just totally made up. No one
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.080]  is saying that's true, except for John P. Holdren White House scientists are who got grilled in
[25:21.080 --> 25:27.080]  Congress about saying it would rise 13 feet this week. An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.800]  discovered that explosive hacked emails from the University of East Anglia were leaked via a small
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.520]  web server in the formerly closed city of Thompson in Siberia. Russian news reported this a week ago,
[25:38.520 --> 25:43.160]  but they're not saying Russia is the ones that got it out because they're pointing out that it was
[25:43.160 --> 25:49.960]  on other university servers. It was leaked onto servers all over the world. The leak scandal
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.880]  has left the scientific community and disarray after claims that the key climate change data
[25:53.880 --> 25:59.720]  was manipulated in the run-up to the Climate Change Summit of world leaders. The row or fight
[25:59.720 --> 26:03.480]  erupted when hundreds of messages between scientists and University of Climatic Research
[26:03.480 --> 26:08.120]  Unit and their colleagues around the world were placed on the internet along with other documents,
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.440]  like the computer program, which we have posted up on infowars.com, where there are computer
[26:14.440 --> 26:22.040]  programmer notes how to engage in fraud and how to hide the decline in temperature. So that is
[26:22.040 --> 26:29.320]  just some of what's coming up today. But again, not Alex Jones, not Lord Monkton, not Senator
[26:29.320 --> 26:36.600]  Inhofe, not Ron Paul. We're not the ones saying this. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the
[26:36.600 --> 26:44.360]  United Nations, Herman von Rompuy, the new head of the EU, Al Gore, Gordon Brown. I played
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.160]  all these clips last week. I'm not going to play them again because of time. If you go to YouTube
[26:49.160 --> 26:55.480]  and type in Von Rompuy or Von Rompuy, however you pronounce it, world government, his clips come up
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.560]  where he's saying it. If you go to the New York Times and type in Ban Ki-moon, his editorial,
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.920]  We Can Do It, comes up where he says the heart of global government is the taxation system of
[27:06.920 --> 27:14.600]  climate change. You can, they're all saying it. Now, 14 years ago, I would read official UN
[27:14.600 --> 27:22.280]  documents on air and people would just say I was lying and making it up. You cannot live in denial
[27:22.280 --> 27:28.440]  about this anymore. World government is real. The new world order is real. The banks,
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.760]  bankrupting our society to take control in their own documents is real. The fact that
[27:34.760 --> 27:43.240]  carbon dioxide is what plants breathe is true. Carbon dioxide is not toxic. One volcano puts
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.080]  off more carbon dioxide than 100 years of human activity. This is a fact.
[27:51.400 --> 27:58.120]  I could continue ranting about this, but the world government treaty, in the treaty, it states that
[27:58.120 --> 28:04.040]  if your nation signs on to it, you are bound by international law to never be able to get out
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.560]  unless there is a unanimous vote by every signatory. That'll be over 190 that are in attendance.
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.240]  If there's a unanimous vote, it doesn't take a unanimous vote to pass it. Only a majority vote.
[28:16.920 --> 28:26.440]  It doesn't take a unanimous vote to pass it. It only takes a 51%. But once you sign on to it,
[28:26.440 --> 28:36.120]  it takes 100% for you to get out of it. That is impossible. That is right out of dictatorship
[28:36.120 --> 28:47.720]  101, ladies and gentlemen. That is the bottom line. And it states that the United Nations
[28:48.760 --> 28:53.720]  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate will decide what industries can be developed,
[28:53.720 --> 28:56.920]  what new technologies can be brought out. It's a scientific dictatorship.
[28:57.960 --> 29:03.880]  It decides what taxes can be put on all carbon, all carbon dioxide, and all greenhouse gases,
[29:03.880 --> 29:11.160]  and they state one child policy worldwide. Taxes on all meat, taxes on all petrochemicals,
[29:11.160 --> 29:18.840]  taxes on all natural gas, taxes of at least 50% on all coal, and half the energy in the country
[29:18.840 --> 29:26.680]  or more. 51% comes from coal. This is a total world government takeover. Yes, I predict the
[29:26.680 --> 29:33.000]  United States will sign on to the Copenhagen Treaty. Obama's also going over to Europe to get his
[29:34.840 --> 29:41.720]  Nobel Peace Prize. What a joke. Of course, they gave it to Kissinger and to Al Gore. So why not?
[29:41.720 --> 29:44.360]  Why not give it to Hitler? You know, he was nominated for a peace prize,
[29:44.360 --> 29:50.760]  and he's going to sign on to it. But that doesn't mean it will be ratified in the U.S.
[29:51.320 --> 29:56.680]  We'll be right back with your calls on the government takeover of health care and Climate
[29:56.680 --> 30:02.040]  Gate and the Copenhagen Treaty. Stay with us. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about
[30:02.040 --> 30:06.600]  the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity

[31:01.960 --> 31:07.160]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[31:07.160 --> 31:12.120]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[31:12.120 --> 31:17.400]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[31:17.400 --> 31:22.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[31:22.360 --> 31:27.880]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding
[31:27.880 --> 31:33.080]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[31:33.080 --> 31:37.800]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[31:37.800 --> 31:42.280]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[31:42.280 --> 31:47.000]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information

[33:02.840 --> 33:08.920]  tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing
[33:08.920 --> 33:14.120]  off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We've turned
[33:14.120 --> 33:19.800]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[33:19.800 --> 33:26.440]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[33:26.440 --> 33:32.280]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty,
[33:32.280 --> 33:37.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists,
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.160]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[33:41.160 --> 33:47.480]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the
[33:47.480 --> 33:54.440]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online
[33:54.440 --> 34:21.640]  right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv. The globalist taught the public that world
[34:21.640 --> 34:26.680]  government didn't exist, that international intrigue didn't exist, so that we couldn't
[34:26.680 --> 34:32.840]  build a movement to resist it when they finally announced it and launched it. It is authoritarian,
[34:32.840 --> 34:38.280]  it is bloodthirsty, it is corrupt, it is eugenical. If you don't know what eugenics is folks,
[34:38.280 --> 34:44.360]  you need to find out quickly because I've got more mainstream articles today and there's an
[34:44.360 --> 34:50.600]  infowars.com article that links directly to the UN where they are stating that they are going to
[34:50.600 --> 34:57.640]  establish a world religion that is compulsory of Earth worship that will be controlled by the
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.960]  United Nations and notice Al Gore's new book, calls for a global religion, his new film,
[35:03.960 --> 35:10.200]  he's making calls for a new global religion. This has always been their plan, the total
[35:10.200 --> 35:16.280]  takeover of society. Like the rock and roll song says, everybody wants to rule the world,
[35:16.280 --> 35:22.040]  these guys need a religion to do it and a taxation system, they're telling you the Earth is dying
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.320]  and you've got to pay taxes to them or the Earth is going to basically sink into the ocean.
[35:27.320 --> 35:33.720]  It is a fraud. I want to go to Jeff Scott, Steve George, Steve Chris, Billy Bob, Jim and others.
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.800]  I'm going to try to give each caller one minute, then later I'm going to get into some financial
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.720]  news and what's happening with healthcare as Obama slashes funding to the elderly and the sick.
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.680]  It's in the bill. For those that are in denial, we're going to be going over it today. Again,
[35:48.680 --> 35:56.760]  here's CNN, Senate Republicans failed Saturday to eliminate $42.1 billion in cuts in cuts,
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.680]  eliminate the cuts to Medicare home health care service in the health care bill. That's
[36:02.680 --> 36:09.720]  your touchy feely liberals, okay? Again, they get you domesticated, they get you under a socialist
[36:09.720 --> 36:15.400]  system so they can give the money to the elites, then they take the money away from you. Do you
[36:15.400 --> 36:22.840]  understand that? Big governments for big money. Dutch Royal Shell and Exxon Mobile are publicly
[36:22.840 --> 36:28.440]  behind the climate tax. The insurance companies are behind government health care. Don't you get it?
[36:29.800 --> 36:36.600]  I was driving home Friday from the radio show and I saw a woman driving on 360 who had a carbon
[36:36.600 --> 36:44.760]  credit pass sticker saying she buys carbon credit so she can drive her car, buys it from some private
[36:44.760 --> 36:51.320]  company. That's like buying indulgences from the Catholic Church 500 years ago to get your family
[36:51.320 --> 36:58.440]  out of hell. It's made up. It's a scam. It's ridiculous. Jeff in Texas, thanks for holding.
[36:58.440 --> 37:02.520]  You're on the air on the eve of the global government meeting. Copenhagen, go ahead.
[37:02.520 --> 37:08.920]  Well, Alex, I'm really upset. I lost all my tomatoes to the freeze last night or two nights
[37:08.920 --> 37:15.320]  ago whenever that was. But other than that, the reason why I'm calling is because if you search
[37:15.320 --> 37:23.320]  BBC News, Copenhagen, what's your solution? They're asking people to upload videos for their ideas
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.840]  about Copenhagen. I uploaded one of your videos to there and I'd like to encourage other people
[37:28.840 --> 37:35.000]  to search. Here's the question. Did it make it on their site? Well, that's the thing. I'd like to
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.880]  have people flood them with videos. The good part is you upload to YouTube. They can't censor you.
[37:41.880 --> 37:47.880]  The BBC is a joke. They still won't report on Climate Gate two weeks in. Well, and I want to
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.280]  support what you're saying. Here's what it says on the page. We're asking you to upload your comments.
[37:52.280 --> 37:56.600]  It says, how much are you personally willing to adapt to live more sustainably?
[37:56.600 --> 38:02.520]  And here you go. Are you prepared to change the way you travel the food you eat or to have fewer
[38:02.520 --> 38:08.520]  children? There you go with the eugenics population. In fact, in fact, I sent you guys Friday and I
[38:08.520 --> 38:16.280]  forgot to show it on television that UN picture map for kids where it shows you can't fly. You
[38:16.280 --> 38:22.920]  can't have kids. This is what they're already teaching the children. It was a big graphic
[38:22.920 --> 38:28.120]  that the UN is giving people. I'll see if my guys can find it to put it up on prisonplanet.tv
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.720]  for radio listeners. We're also streaming live television at prisonplanet.tv. But absolutely.
[38:33.720 --> 38:40.920]  Look, they officially, Maury Strong, Al Gore, officially say you will not be allowed to have
[38:40.920 --> 38:47.400]  more than one child. This is total tyranny worse than Nazi Germany, worse than the Soviet Union.
[38:47.400 --> 38:52.680]  Anything else, Jeff? Well, yeah. And one more thing on the page, the example of a video message,
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.880]  it's a picture. It's a video from a kid. They are absolutely targeting the children to start this
[38:57.880 --> 39:05.160]  brainwashing at an early age. Good to hear from you. Monday, Monday, we got the secret UN documents,
[39:05.160 --> 39:10.920]  AP, Fox and others reported on it, where the UN admitted they have a giant covert program
[39:11.720 --> 39:15.800]  targeting children worldwide. Well, I didn't need to know there was a covert program.
[39:16.600 --> 39:22.200]  They have the same laws in Australia, same laws here. They teach kids in school that
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.840]  that they're killing the earth and that their parents are bad. And Al Gore goes out giving
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.720]  speeches to middle school and elementary students saying their parents are bad. I mean, people
[39:31.720 --> 39:37.240]  shouldn't be putting putting up with this. You guys found the graphic, pop it up on screen for people.
[39:37.240 --> 39:44.280]  And you look at this graphic and it says travel, bad travel, don't fly. CO2 is bad.
[39:46.120 --> 39:51.480]  Good travel, bicycles, walking. See, all sounds reasonable, but the government's going to decide.
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.080]  It says have only two children and then other documents say zero children. It says eat less
[39:57.080 --> 40:03.000]  meat and it shows a cow passing gas. This is what the UN gives to people's children.
[40:03.880 --> 40:09.560]  And it says do something. Ladies and gentlemen, they are teaching the children that penguins and
[40:10.600 --> 40:17.160]  polar bears are drowning. It's a total lie. It's all a fraud. Let's go to Scott in Minnesota. Scott,
[40:17.160 --> 40:23.240]  you're on the air. I just want to thank you, brother, for the free t-shirt. I ordered the
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.760]  two pack for Christmas. One for my brother, who's a sheriff deputy and one for my brother-in-law,
[40:28.760 --> 40:34.440]  whose brothers and cousins are all Marines. I've met out three oaf keepers just smoking outside
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.200]  at the bar, but they haven't. And thank you. I realized that the Vikings lease on the metrodome
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.520]  isn't real news, but I'm going to do with that t-shirt, my best friends in a wheelchair. I'm
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.400]  going to get tickets to the first playoff game right on the field. And I'm going to rip my jersey
[40:49.400 --> 40:55.960]  off like Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura show the world. Well, that's awesome. Yes, we do have
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.240]  some deals where you order one copy of follow the Republic, get a free t-shirt. You can get a
[41:01.240 --> 41:06.840]  don't tread on me, Patriot shirt or the Obama Joker shirt. And absolutely. Thank you so much for
[41:06.840 --> 41:11.800]  your support, sir. Yes, I've been one of your soldiers for a year now and I'm turning into one
[41:11.800 --> 41:17.800]  of your generals. And it's exciting. The more society crumbles, the more my thing, it goes up.
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.000]  And I love you, man. God bless you. God bless you, Scott. Yeah. So you went outside the bar and ran
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.680]  into two oath keepers for people that don't know. That's military and police that swear to upkeep
[41:28.680 --> 41:34.760]  their oaths and to fight the new world order. These chicks were out there smoking, talking about the
[41:34.760 --> 41:41.160]  uh, the swine flu. And this guy goes, your government gave that to you. And they said,
[41:41.720 --> 41:49.160]  you're crazy. It goes, I'm a Marine. I'm an oath keeper. And I said, thank you. And I shook his
[41:49.160 --> 41:55.400]  hand and he goes, do all the work. What does that mean? He goes, when the government tells me to
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.800]  turn on the people, he's like, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to protect them. Awesome, Scott.
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.400]  Good to hear from you. Yeah. Look, the globalist did us a favor for decades. They said there's no
[42:05.400 --> 42:10.440]  world government, no carbon tax. I mean, I had globalist on two years ago on the radio saying,
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.720]  there's no tax planned, Alex. Don't be a conspiracy theorist. Didn't matter if I had all their own
[42:15.720 --> 42:20.840]  documents. Then people heard me tell them this. They thought I was lying. Now they see we're
[42:20.840 --> 42:26.520]  telling the truth and the government's the one lying. Stephen, New Mexico, take us out to break.
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.800]  Steve, you're on the air. Yeah, your question at the top of the show was how to go about defeating
[42:31.800 --> 42:38.760]  the bogus climate bill. And my opinion is one key is to make sure we don't distort or twist the truth
[42:38.760 --> 42:45.000]  the way they have. Now, maybe this strikes you, strikes you nitpicking, but we damage our credibility
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.360]  if we claim that the only thing coming out of smokestacks of the coal power plants is water
[42:50.360 --> 42:57.480]  vapor. H2O, nothing else. I mean, the composition of emissions from coal burning power generating
[42:57.480 --> 43:03.560]  facilities include mercury, among other toxins related to cancers, respiratory and cardiovascular
[43:03.560 --> 43:09.720]  diseases. Sir, sir, sir, listen to me. The only jobs in East Texas where I got a lot of family
[43:10.600 --> 43:16.280]  are prisons and coal powered power plants run in Houston and Dallas and Fort Worth. And I've had,
[43:16.280 --> 43:23.640]  it's got to be most of my family out there from plant managers down working those. And the government
[43:23.640 --> 43:30.040]  has airplanes, Cessnas flying over, testing, flying over the smokestacks. If anything, but water
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.360]  vapor and CO2 comes out, they get fines that completely annihilate them. Is it true that
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.960]  China and Mexico have dirty coal burning? Yes. But maybe 20 years ago, something was coming out of
[43:41.960 --> 43:49.000]  these coal plants. But no, I mean, those scrubbers are cutting everything out. Nothing has allowed
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.560]  toxic out of those. And I mean, that's what my family is telling me. I don't know if they're
[43:53.560 --> 43:58.920]  liars, but I appreciate your call, sir. We'll be right back and talk more about that.
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.640]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and

[44:26.200 --> 44:30.840]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[44:30.840 --> 44:36.200]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[44:36.200 --> 44:41.400]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[48:01.080 --> 48:09.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[48:09.160 --> 48:18.680]  All right. Commenting on what that caller from New Mexico was saying.
[48:20.760 --> 48:27.880]  I was mainly ranting Thursday and Friday about how they show images of polar bears hunting on
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.960]  ice floes for seals and say, oh, look, the polar bear is stuck out there. He's going to float away
[48:33.960 --> 48:39.800]  and drown. He can't swim. Penguins can't swim. This is taught. This is on the news. You've all seen
[48:39.800 --> 48:46.360]  it. Al Gore put it in his movie and he's been exposed as a fraud. And then I was talking about
[48:46.360 --> 48:53.240]  how there is a government building next door to us and how there's a bunch of other big buildings
[48:53.240 --> 48:59.240]  that have heating and cooling systems. And when there's cold weather, it looks like smoke is pouring
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.440]  out of the big air conditioning heating systems. But notice when it's the summer, you see nothing
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.720]  coming out. And I was pointing out that's hot air, hot water vapor, just like when you breathe,
[49:10.440 --> 49:18.360]  when you exhale out, when it's cold weather, it looks like smoke, but that's not. That's water
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.800]  vapor that's warm. And then when it gets about a foot away from your face, it cools off and becomes
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.720]  the temperature of the ambient temperature outside. And so I was pointing out that most
[49:29.720 --> 49:34.840]  these photos, they show in the news of cities, you know, it looks like in the wintertime,
[49:34.840 --> 49:40.600]  all the smoke's coming up. Most of that is not smoke. In fact, almost all of it is in the smoke.
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.400]  It's air conditioning and heating systems. And that was the point I was making. There's no
[49:45.400 --> 49:52.680]  coal plant around my office. And yes, the coal plants are so clean, it's incredible, even though
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.520]  they're burning dirty coal. Now something Bill Clinton did in 1998 is he laid off limits in
[49:58.520 --> 50:04.680]  Utah and two other Western states, all of the public lands that are the only place in North
[50:04.680 --> 50:11.720]  America that have totally clean coal. They have a type of coal that has no mercury in it, no sulfur
[50:11.720 --> 50:20.840]  in it. And they laid limits to that being mined. Okay. I mean, there are coal mines all over the
[50:20.840 --> 50:26.840]  country. And most of them are very, very clean. It's lignite. They strip it off. They replant
[50:26.840 --> 50:32.600]  grass and trees. It looks better than what it did before. I mean, humans can make the environment
[50:32.600 --> 50:39.080]  better. The rainforest has grown back. The real environmental problems, the globalists are doing
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.720]  nothing about and they can care less. They want to tax and control all industry. They want to tax
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.080]  this five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide. Humans exhale. That's in the UN treaties to
[50:49.080 --> 50:55.080]  literally tax what you exhale, saying carbon dioxide is a toxic waste. Obama has now listed it
[50:55.080 --> 51:01.320]  in the US as a toxic waste. That's what I'm discussing. You know, I talk a lot about what
[51:01.320 --> 51:05.640]  are real environmental problems. I'm not anti-science. I love science. I'm not a troglodyte.
[51:06.520 --> 51:13.160]  But thousands of different creations a year, many of them open air planted of cross species,
[51:13.720 --> 51:18.280]  goats that are part spider to create body armor in their milk. Don't believe me. Just
[51:18.280 --> 51:25.160]  in fact, Google it right now or smartpages.com. Another good search engine. The term spider
[51:25.160 --> 51:31.400]  goats, usually CBS news is the top one, part spider, part goat. That creates in the DNA all
[51:31.400 --> 51:38.520]  sorts of weird mutations. They've got most the produce you eat has insect genes, animal genes
[51:38.520 --> 51:45.160]  in it. Most the salmon that's farm raised, catfish that are farm raised, tilapia that are farm raised
[51:45.160 --> 51:51.320]  have been genetically engineered with insect and other mammal and other fish genes. And I've had
[51:51.320 --> 51:59.000]  top genetic engineers on who talk about how deadly dangerous. I mean, Prodigene 10 years ago in Texas,
[51:59.000 --> 52:07.400]  open air planted a pharmacological corn crop, a pharmacological corn crop that had HIV virus
[52:07.400 --> 52:12.920]  in it, associated press, open air planted that. And then people found out about it and they had
[52:12.920 --> 52:19.800]  to destroy the crops. Did you find spider goats? Just just spider goats. I want to show people
[52:19.800 --> 52:29.480]  this. There it is. BBC GM goat spins web based future BBC. I've told the story many times, but
[52:29.480 --> 52:33.160]  it was probably eight, nine years ago. I was in a Conan's pizza, picking up a pizza.
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.520]  No, my wife was pregnant. That was eight years ago. She wanted a pizza. So I go get her the
[52:38.520 --> 52:43.880]  pizza, the deep dish Chicago pizza. And this guy pokes me in the shoulder and I turn around and he
[52:43.880 --> 52:49.240]  goes, I used to like you, but I don't like you now. You're a liar. And I said, what am I lying
[52:49.240 --> 52:54.280]  about? I said, I do make mistakes occasionally, but please tell me. And he said, there's no such
[52:54.280 --> 52:58.920]  thing as spider goats. And I just interviewed one of the heads of one of the companies that
[52:59.560 --> 53:04.520]  has them out in a military base in upstate New York. I just interviewed the CEO about it.
[53:04.520 --> 53:11.000]  And I said, sir, he goes, you can't cross different animals. You're a liar. And I just said, fine,
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.480]  I'm a liar. No, I'm not a liar. I'm telling the truth. Okay. And he started saying, well,
[53:17.480 --> 53:23.160]  I went to UT and have a degree in biology. And I said, are you in biology now? And he said, no,
[53:23.160 --> 53:30.120]  I have another career field. I said, when did you go to UT? And he said 1976. And I said, buddy,
[53:30.120 --> 53:33.880]  we're not in Kansas anymore. A lot has changed. He's kept getting in my face,
[53:33.880 --> 53:35.800]  kept getting in my face. Look,
[53:39.160 --> 53:46.360]  that's the real environmental threat are these cross species chimeras, not carbon dioxide.
[53:46.360 --> 53:51.400]  And the globalists don't want real environmentalists worried about serious issues like overfishing.
[53:51.960 --> 53:55.880]  The Gulf of Mexico, when my dad would go down there, they'd go three miles out
[53:55.880 --> 54:04.520]  and catch mahi mahi and tuna. Now you can't catch that stuff at 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 miles out.
[54:05.400 --> 54:09.160]  So there are a lot of things going on that are problems, but world government
[54:09.160 --> 54:13.960]  isn't going to fix that, especially when it's run by a bunch of crooks in global government that
[54:13.960 --> 54:18.600]  have been deceptive about what they've been setting up. And their whole system is authoritarian,
[54:18.600 --> 54:24.520]  dictatorial, and tyrannical, and despotic, and oppressive. Don't you understand? I mean,
[54:24.520 --> 54:29.720]  I have the White House science are, I show this book, every show we literally have ordered over
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.120]  a hundred books written by this guy and other people, the White House science are saying,
[54:34.120 --> 54:38.360]  they're poisoning your water supply to sterilize you. That's a big issue,
[54:38.360 --> 54:42.520]  a lot bigger than climate gate. And I'm going to keep hammering on this.
[54:44.440 --> 54:50.280]  I mean, these people mean business folks. They are the progeny of the Nazis. They just pose as
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.640]  liberals. All right, let's go to Joe in Texas than Chris, George, Steve, Chris, Billy Bob, Jim,
[54:55.640 --> 55:01.320]  and others. Let's try to move or am I getting new callers on top? Cause I want to go to them in
[55:01.320 --> 55:07.560]  order. Who do I go to next here? Okay. Yeah. Okay. It is flipping the calls. These computerized
[55:07.560 --> 55:15.400]  systems confuse me. George in Texas, you're up next. Go ahead. How you doing, Alex? Good. Go ahead.
[55:15.400 --> 55:20.840]  You know, the thing is about this healthcare bill and this Copenhagen, this is just a frontal
[55:20.840 --> 55:27.720]  assault, eugenics, frontal assault. Tom Daschel wrote a book. He wrote the original bill saying,
[55:27.720 --> 55:32.840]  if you're above 16, no eye surgery, they say you need to die. The earth is, they are eugenicists.
[55:33.400 --> 55:40.440]  They're cutting Medicare and Medicaid and calling it liberal. Only a fake leftist could get away
[55:40.440 --> 55:45.400]  with this. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm against socialism, but if you're going to have it, give the money to
[55:45.400 --> 55:51.480]  the people. No, no money for us. All of it goes to the banks. I'm sorry. Go ahead, George. Well,
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.120]  the only way I'm trying to fight back against this is, uh, I'm trying to get ahold of DB kits.
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.560]  So I get the archived documents of the frauds on the 17th amendment and bring it to my legislatures
[56:01.560 --> 56:06.360]  saying you got a hundred frauds sitting up in, in Capitol Hill. I own, I own the wall that never
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.320]  was by Bill Benson and Red Beckman. They went to all original 44 states that were around in 1913
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.640]  with the 17th amendment to fully federalize the states and take the senators from the states
[56:17.640 --> 56:22.120]  before senators were elected by the legislature controlled by the state. The same year they
[56:22.120 --> 56:26.600]  gave us the private federal reserve and gave us the IRS and the income tax. They gave us that.
[56:26.600 --> 56:31.080]  This is even bigger. In fact, the head of the UN is saying this is the biggest moment for world
[56:31.080 --> 56:37.080]  government in history, this Copenhagen treaty. And yes, they went to the 44 states. They have a list
[56:37.080 --> 56:42.280]  of them. They talked to all the attorney generals. Most of the states didn't even ratify it. It never
[56:42.280 --> 56:48.280]  passed. Uh, the income tax never passed. Uh, none of it passed. George, I appreciate your call.
[56:48.280 --> 56:53.800]  Let's talk to Steve in Michigan. Steve, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Um, two quick
[56:53.800 --> 57:01.640]  comments. 70 miles north of me two nights ago had the highest, um, amount of snowfall this early
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.920]  in the season, 14 inches. Thank God for global warming. That's right. This is the third coldest
[57:06.920 --> 57:14.040]  week on record in US history. And the, uh, the second comment is, I think these politicians
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.600]  all about what, about representatives and senators, they need to know that their political jobs are
[57:20.600 --> 57:27.800]  on the line if they ratify this global warming treaty. They need to know it's political suicide
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.240]  because here's the problem. Obama's approval rating has gone from 86% down to the low 40s,
[57:33.240 --> 57:38.600]  the lowest of any president, um, 11 months into their first term, but it doesn't matter. He controls
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.640]  the house and the Senate and the presidency, the legislative and the executive. They're gonna
[57:43.640 --> 57:48.440]  probably pass the Copenhagen treaty this week. Then this year or next year, they're gonna pass it
[57:48.440 --> 57:52.680]  in the Senate. They got to ratify it. Uh, they're probably going to pass the government grab of
[57:52.680 --> 57:57.320]  health care. Uh, they're probably going to pass the gun control bills. They got introduced
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.560]  everything. I mean, this, we are in trouble. And then we've got all these Republicans like
[58:01.560 --> 58:06.760]  Schwarzenegger and Newt Yenrich running around supporting global government. This is high treason.
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.800]  Anything else? Stephen, Michigan. All right, we're going to come back and go to Chris,
[58:11.800 --> 58:17.560]  Billy Bob, Jim, Leon in Australia, Chris in Kentucky, Joe in Texas, and a lot more. I'm
[58:17.560 --> 58:23.160]  going to get into the government hijacking of health care more on the massive Copenhagen
[58:23.160 --> 58:27.560]  global government establishment. They've already built the world government. Now they're getting
[58:27.560 --> 58:34.040]  nations to sign over their sovereignty irrevocably to this criminal organization. This is the most
[58:34.040 --> 58:39.480]  important issue we've faced in decades. This could be the end of America. Ladies and gentlemen,
[58:39.480 --> 58:43.880]  you better get the word out to everybody, you know, instead of watching stupid Sunday night
[58:43.880 --> 58:52.440]  football, this is what matters to your family. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[58:52.440 --> 58:57.480]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.480 --> 59:02.440]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[59:02.440 --> 59:07.720]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[59:07.720 --> 59:12.680]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[59:12.680 --> 59:18.200]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[59:18.200 --> 59:23.400]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[59:23.400 --> 59:28.120]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[59:28.120 --> 59:32.600]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.600 --> 59:36.760]  generators offered by solutions from science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[59:50.600 --> 59:55.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[59:55.320 --> 59:59.960]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[59:59.960 --> 1:00:05.320]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:10.600]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:15.160]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:19.560]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:25.240]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:30.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:36.040]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:45.080]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:56.840]  that number 1-800-409-5633. Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:10.680]  Broadcasting Network. Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:19.560]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:28.120]  Alex Jones. Stay there, Leon in Australia. You're coming up after the next break right now. Let's
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:33.160]  go straight to Florida and talk to Chris and Billy Bob, Jim, and others. Chris, go ahead. You're on
[1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:39.560]  the air. I'm getting the word out there. I see so many different. I see so many developments this
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:46.520]  week on Al Gore backing out of Copenhagen and Obama not delaying his trip by a week. But I'm
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:52.040]  having my suspicions about Alan Grayson. I know that he's the representative here in Florida,
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:58.120]  and he is very much against the Fed. I know that his grilling of Bernanke's been great, and he's
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:03.320]  had a reputation as fighting the war profiteers and prosecuting them, I guess. I don't know much
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:09.160]  about that. But I got to talk to him today, and he was saying that CO2 levels are dangerous
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:15.000]  greenhouse gas. He was not aware of climate gate, and he has his own cap-and-trade bill,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:21.960]  purple ideas. Grayson's good on the war. He's good on the banks. He's bad on
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:27.160]  government-run healthcare. He's the one saying Republicans want to kill seniors. Hey, Alan,
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:35.560]  here's CNN buried in the article. He wants Obama and the Democrats want to strip $42.1
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:41.720]  billion a year out of Medicare alone, massively rationing healthcare, pal. That's what's going
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:48.200]  to kill old people. And he also didn't like the idea of, uh, we are change members demonstrating
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:52.600]  at a Christmas parade. He wasn't specific. I assume he met the local one here. There's a video
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.080]  of it. Oh, it's not his business. It's the First Amendment. Oh, absolutely. And he's not even,
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:01.720]  he's very general in his allegations. But now there's a, maybe he's trying to detract from the
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:05.720]  attention that's gotten over a hundred views now from what happened yesterday in St. Petersburg
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:11.240]  with a Tampa weir change. They confront the youth police if you want to look at that. But also
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:16.520]  about a Holdren is that since he's reversed his position on bioengineering, what about changing
[1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:21.960]  the actual department of energy as atmospheric science program says at the top of the page,
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:27.160]  the current focus of the program is aerosol, radiative forcing of climate. That's in bold
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:30.760]  at the atmospheric science program department of energy. And of course they're contracting with
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:37.560]  various give me a favor, email, email, Kurt and info wars.com that headline. Yes. Holdren's first
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:44.520]  speech was about climate manipulation, climate control. And that's a whole other issue. Don't
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:51.080]  think that the global government won't engineer climate calamities as a pretext to scare the
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:57.160]  public into this global climate based dictatorship where they play God. Great points. Good to hear
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:05.160]  from you, Chris. Let's talk to Billy Bob in Texas. Billy Bob, you're on the air. Alex. Hey, buddy.
[1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:13.800]  Was the aforementioned cow passing gas, in fact, Nancy Pelosi?
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:19.560]  Well, you know, that's the problem is they've done studies. There are about the same amount of
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:26.280]  agrarian bovine creatures before we had buffalo and water buffalo and other things flatulating.
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:33.000]  And so to say that an animal's flatulence that methane is bad, methane has been produced by
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  all animals that have digestive processes. And so again, they're saying life is bad.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.120]  As the club of Rome's own documents that we've quoted say, this is about making human life
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:51.640]  the enemy. So the globalist have an excuse to tax breathing itself. So, so really,
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:55.960]  there's not a lot of difference between a cow and Nancy Pelosi. You're saying
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:05:03.800]  me. Hey, listen, Alex, look, you know, the globalist, you mentioned that one of their
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:10.440]  members wanted to come have a sit down with you. And that's because they realize how much
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:20.360]  millions and millions and even more millions of people love you, care for you, because
[1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:27.400]  you're a straight up guy. You tell it like it is, you read their documents. And lastly,
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:35.480]  I just wonder what tip the powers that be the goal was for finding out about what the BBC
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:44.280]  knew for that six weeks. That's a good question. I appreciate your call. We're going to come back
[1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:49.960]  and go to Leon in Australia and others on the other side of this quick break. I'm going to run
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:55.560]  through the latest climate gate developments. I haven't even gotten into that yet. And a lot more
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:06:02.200]  on this Sunday edition, 55 minutes left. The illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:06.600]  that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center,
[1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:11.240]  buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:16.360]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution. Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife

[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:08.120]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:16.200]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. I feel like I should have a drum roll in the
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:24.520]  background or air raid sirens should be going off. I mean, we're on the radio talking about
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:32.200]  the head of the UN, the head of the EU, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Barack Obama, all giving speeches,
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:37.800]  all making statements about global government is here. We will control the planet with carbon
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:43.160]  taxes. We're only going to let you have one child. We're going to bankrupt the coal plants.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:52.680]  They're hijacking the medical system. Their own bill singing in reports will strip 42.1
[1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:59.480]  billion a year out of Medicare and Medicaid alone. I mean, this is upside down.
[1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:06.840]  They're openly announcing world government, but for decades, all the yuppies were taught that
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:10.920]  doesn't exist. Only crazy people talk about it. So when they see it being announced on the news,
[1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:14.760]  they say, well, I better not talk about it or resist it because it's not supposed to exist,
[1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:23.000]  and it's not polite in a polite conversation to bring it up. I better just lay here and take
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.280]  the banks bankrupting the planet by design and bringing in world government. And then I have
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:34.680]  Bloomberg reporting here arming Goldman with pistols against the public. I'm going to cover
[1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:39.560]  this in the next segment. But right now, that's right, the banks are arming against you. But
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:44.040]  right now, let's go to Leon in Australia. Leon, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:51.320]  Yeah, yeah, good day. I just have two quick points to make. First of all, the leader of the
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:58.200]  opposition, the leader of the opposition challenging the prime minister to a global warming debate.
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:01.240]  This has just come out in the last maybe 24 hours or so.
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:06.440]  You know what? Let me stop you. Since you're calling from Australia, let me bring this up to
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:10.760]  you because for those that don't know, a whole bunch of members of your parliament have resigned.
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:16.840]  There's talk of the government collapsing. They tried to pass their Copenhagen national version
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:20.440]  because all the countries have to get their laws in line. That's what our government's trying to
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:27.000]  pass this 2000 page climate change behemoth that lets the feds take over every facet of our lives
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.720]  to mirror the international treaty. Last week, it was set to pass. It failed. The government's
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:38.360]  in deep trouble. Al Gore is canceling his speaking engagements because everybody's booing him.
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:42.280]  He doesn't want to be associated with climate gain. And the fact that top UN scientists were
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:47.480]  caught engaging in fraud, their internal documents admit the earth is getting colder, not hotter.
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:53.400]  But give us a report from the land down under exactly what's happening. Leon, go ahead.
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:10:04.280]  Okay, sure thing. Well, the permission trading scheme was about to be looked through and
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:11.880]  that it failed for the second time. And there was a challenge for the leader of the opposition
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:18.520]  because most of the party was against the whole global warming fraud. And the leader, though,
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:24.360]  he was actually for it because he got ousted. And the end of parliament has just begun.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:30.360]  Oh, it was a two-month break. And Tony added the leader of the opposition,
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.880]  he used it as a challenge to the prime minister. And the prime minister has avoided it.
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:43.240]  And they want to have the debate before the parliament gets back to it.
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:48.920]  But it looks like the prime minister is losing support for the global warming,
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:55.880]  pretty much the carbon tax and all that. And the leader of the opposition has put
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:11:01.080]  an anti-global warming, global warming skeptics in the front bench,
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:07.960]  so in the more powerful position. So it looks like at least we're not going to see any carbon
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:16.440]  tax debt. I mean, everybody knows. But here's the problem. In Australia, in the UK, in the U.S.,
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:21.480]  everywhere, where the big central banks are in control. And I saw a speech with Gordon Brown
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.320]  on the Financial Times of London. He gave a speech just yesterday bragging that, oh,
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:32.200]  all the Commonwealth nations will get in line. Even if the parliaments don't pass it,
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:38.040]  we'll use the bureaucracy to implement it. Washington states passed a law that your employer
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:44.760]  has to collect a tax from you, give you drive a car to work. Swartz and Eggers banned TVs
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:49.320]  above 40 inches and put taxes on the rest of them. It didn't matter if he couldn't get the
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:57.000]  legislature to pass it. He just used a bureaucracy to criminally order it. And Texas wants to put
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:04.200]  a tracker box in all cars to tax you by the mile to reduce the carbon footprint. I know Australia's
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:10.600]  trying to pass that. So yes, we've gone from 70 plus percent of people worldwide in different
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:16.760]  polls I've seen above 60, sometimes above 70, but the majority believing manmade climate change,
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:21.320]  believing all the penguins are dying, believing all the polar bears can't swim, total lies.
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:28.280]  Now in every major poll, over 60 percent don't believe it. So the numbers are flipping,
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:32.520]  and so the worm is turning. Is that what you're reporting to us from Australia?
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:41.800]  That's exactly it. And on YouTube, you can see it, the United Nations and Google have combined
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.840]  to run a poll about global warming. It looks like it's aimed at the youth. But if you just
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:53.240]  write maybe United Nations, a global warming poll or something like that, you'll be able to find it,
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:59.640]  but I'm not sure if they're doing it around. Well, yeah, the news article, it made it look
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:05.000]  like it was aimed for around the world, and you can check what parts of the world think about,
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  you know, what other parts of the world think about global warming is in Australia.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.560]  Well, good to hear from you in Australia, my friend. Thank you so much for the call, Leon.
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:19.160]  Let me just talk about some of the strategy, and there's a lot of different strategies that have
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:25.720]  been used to brainwash people. Three years ago, this is in my film, in-game blueprint for global
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:33.160]  enslavement, judicial watch sued. Bush wouldn't release the minutes of his meeting in Baylor
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:41.480]  with the heads of Mexico and Canada. Then they had the Banff Canada meeting a year later,
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:46.360]  and they wouldn't release those. Judicial watch sued, therefore your Freedom of Information Act
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.920]  was successful with the suit, and they got the internal documents. And we have copies of these
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:56.840]  in the film. We wrote articles about it at PrismPlanet.com and Infowars.com. And the first thing they
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:04.920]  said at the meeting was, A, we've got to keep this secret. B, we are creating global regions
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:10.360]  for the global government. C, we're going to use the threat of man-made climate change
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.920]  to set up the taxing system for the regional and global government components.
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:22.200]  So we know that this is their funding mechanism, but now it's not secret. As I said,
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:26.840]  Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, everybody's writing articles, giving speeches, admitting it.
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:32.680]  They've gone from lying about it to just throwing it in your face. They also talked in those SPP,
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:39.800]  Security Prosperity Partnership, NAU, North American Union meetings, about having it be a fad,
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:45.640]  working with the media, working with CEOs of media. And they were there. Hundreds of private CEOs
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:49.960]  are at these meetings, part of the discussion, part of the voting. It's a corporate government.
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:54.840]  They just, it's a corporate takeover. They understand organization control, they're taking
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:15:00.200]  over. They understand paying campaign contributions. I mean, special interests have taken over.
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:05.240]  That's all this is, and they're raping us. And they said, we got to get rock stars behind it.
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:10.920]  We got to get Miss America behind it. We've got to educate the kids, brainwash them in the schools.
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:17.800]  And what they did is they used Bush, who was unpopular, saying he was against manmade global
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:24.600]  warming because he's uncool. He's corny. He's dumb. He stutters. Oh, it must be trendy. It must be
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:29.320]  cool because Bush was wrong on the Patriot Act and wrong on the war and wrong on all these other
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:34.760]  issues. Oh, he must be wrong about manmade global warming. Then we had people at Bilderberg,
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:41.240]  2007, and they reported here that Bush was going to do a U turn and say global warming was real.
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:47.480]  He did that. So most Europeans in polls, though it's changing, believe in global warming because
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:53.080]  it's the trendy thing. Dumb Americans don't believe it. Dumb Bush doesn't believe it. It's
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:58.760]  trendy. It's cool. It's hippie. It's radical. It means you care about the penguins. In fact,
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:03.640]  give me a close shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers. Here's the Copenhagen 15 Copenhagen.
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:11.240]  This is the website and it shows penguins up here and it implies that the penguins are all
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:18.520]  going to die and drown if the Antarctic melts. Well, most of the Antarctic is rock. Even if it
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:24.280]  melted, the different archaeologists have studied penguins. Penguins were once in tropical areas.
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:30.440]  They're actually in areas of Chile. Okay. The point is they're highly adaptable,
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:35.480]  but the ice isn't melting. Penguins are great swimmers. The ice actually gets smaller in the
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:40.040]  summer, bigger in the winter, but they point satellite cameras at it in the summer and show
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:45.640]  it melting and don't tell you that in the winter it gets bigger again. Same thing with polar bears.
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:50.040]  Polar bears almost die during the winter and they put on most their weight in the summer
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:55.880]  and they go out and swim. But the media says they can't swim. Go to Encyclopedia Britannica.
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:01.400]  Polar bears are the best land swimmers. I know I keep saying that. I just can't get over it.
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:04.760]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric

[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:08.440]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:13.480]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:18.760]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:23.720]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:29.160]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.960]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:38.600]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.320]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:47.800]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:08.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:14.040]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:20.040]  at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling
[1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:25.960]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:31.720]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:36.840]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:41.160]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying,
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:45.800]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington,
[1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:52.840]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on dvd
[1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:59.560]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:25.160]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:31.240]  Fall of the Republic is my latest film, my latest and greatest, two hours, 24 minutes long.
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:35.640]  Covers how the banks are setting up world government, their own documents, their own
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:39.800]  statements, how they engineered the climate tax to fully take control of society.
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:46.120]  Bureaucrats will be in your house every week, your children being brainwashed right now turned

[1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:58.360]  I went to an amazing interview with Dave Mustaine, a megadeth who named his new hit album,
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:04.200]  In Game, off of my film, In Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement. That's going to be a huge
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:10.280]  interview for prisonplanet.tv members up next Wednesday. So many great reasons behind the
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:16.760]  scenes interviews with Jesse Ventura, so many others at prisonplanet.tv. Before I go back to
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:22.360]  your calls, a few of the other tricks that the climate dictators use. Look, if they can teach
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:27.480]  you your bad and train you that all human activity is evil and a global government's going to run
[1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:34.200]  your life, regulate your life and tax what you do, they have complete control. And they make it look
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:38.120]  trendy and they sell it like it's a great thing and they tell you every scientist believes it's
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:43.000]  real when the majority are on record saying it's a fraud and they tell you that you've got to do it
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:48.360]  or the earth's going to die. And they've got so many different tricks they use to sell this
[1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:54.760]  and their whole world government is built around this system and it's now imploding,
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:24:01.000]  it's now falling apart. Let's go to Jim in California, then Joe, Chris, Rob, Noelle, Larry,
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.440]  Kathy, Alex and others. Jim, you're on the air. Welcome. Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:11.000]  Thanks for calling. I'd like to talk about the healthcare system takeover. Yes.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:19.960]  This really bothers me. I've been in California. I got hurt 13 years ago and I've been in the
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:27.400]  many health care system of California, the workers comp system. And I saw in the newspaper
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:36.280]  that Obama wanted to fashion the healthcare system akin to the California workers comp system.
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:44.360]  And I can tell you right now that they will do their best to kill you if you're seriously hurt
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:54.840]  or sick. That's his bottom line. And this whole thing is like a perfect storm brewing. And if
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:25:01.000]  they are... Our entire economy is being seized. I have scanned over and had guest after guest with
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:08.600]  the 2000 70 plus page bill. It cuts everybody's healthcare. It raises everybody's taxes. The
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:16.120]  insurance companies wrote it as Dennis Kucinich, the ultra liberal said, to rob everyone. This is
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:22.520]  a scam. I mean, again, for those that just joined us, CNN today, Senate Republicans failed Saturday
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:30.440]  to eliminate 42.1 billion in cuts, in cuts, in cuts to Medicare home healthcare services
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:36.760]  and the healthcare bill. And that's a CNN whitewash. That's 42.1 billion a year. They want
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:42.360]  something like half a trillion in savings over the next 15 years. Just out of that, I mean,
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:49.000]  it is mind blowing. Only a fake liberal could get away with this. Can you imagine if Republicans
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:56.760]  were trying to cut 42 billion a year just out of Medicare, sir? Can you imagine? And that's...
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:04.440]  Look, Tom Daschle wrote the book, Bloomberg's reported on this, that the bills based on saying
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:10.840]  above 60, you don't get eye surgeries. In Europe, they make you wait 18 months for brain surgery,
[1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:16.840]  for brain tumors. There is rationing. It's eugenics. The same people that are running social
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:22.520]  as healthcare write textbooks like eco science, how you need to have your healthcare taken.
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.920]  Once they socialize healthcare, they teach all the yuppies and young people that, oh,
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:32.040]  your taxes are getting raised because old people, we never had to ration care before. It's because
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:36.200]  government got involved that this is happening. I don't mean to be ranting here. It's just the
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:40.760]  oil companies write the cap and trade legislation, and the media says the oil companies don't want
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:46.520]  it. The insurance companies write the stinking bill to Robbis, just like the banker bailout,
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:52.280]  the 700 billion, which turned into 23.7 trillion, again, according to Bloomberg and AP, and Congress,
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:55.160]  and I have all those clips in my film from Congress admitting those numbers,
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:00.840]  they said, this is to unfreeze mortgages. And then the next day, October 4th, they said,
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:03.960]  we're not going to tell you where the money is going and it didn't go in for mortgages.
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:10.200]  It went all to the banks. It's robbery. We have a criminal illegitimate global government
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:16.600]  raping us. Wake up, you stupid idiots out there. I'm sorry. It's just too much. It's too much for
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:22.520]  me to sit there and watch these eugenicists literally planning to kill sick people and old
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:28.200]  people and then saying that the insurance companies are against the bill when they wrote the stinking
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:35.080]  thing. Anything that comes out of Washington of the UN is a robbery because crooks run it.
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.920]  Period. What is it? You can't get about it. It's like if you had a next door neighbor
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:45.000]  who you'd known for 10 years, who'd robbed you, who'd stolen from you, who'd lied to you,
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.560]  and now he's going to become the chief of police, you know, it's going to get worse. I mean,
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:54.200]  what is wrong with these people? Look at Schwarzenegger saying San Francisco,
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:28:01.080]  that's 938 feet above sea level, is going to be completely underwater. It's complete bull.
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:07.160]  Then we pulled up the official NOAA levels and other levels. The water level has dropped in
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:15.080]  San Francisco. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Well, I just, I agree with everything you just said. I can give
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:21.720]  some examples of how they've treated people in the workers comp system here in California.
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:27.640]  Like, you'll get approved to go have surgery. And then if you have a complication from that
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.760]  surgery, they may not treat it. Also, if you- By the way, I'm going to stop you right there.
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:37.560]  I want them to pull this up. Google the case for killing granny. The cover of Newsweek a
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:42.360]  month and a half ago is the image of an old woman with her power plug pulled out of her
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:46.440]  respirator. And it says, we got to kill the old people. And then every, and then I showed,
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:51.000]  the week before that, they had an article with a grim reaper leading somebody away talking about
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:56.200]  how great it is people are committing suicide to get rid of their numbers. And then they teach kids
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:02.680]  ABC news with video games in Australia how to commit suicide because it's because their carbon
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:08.040]  footprint went up. The case for killing granny. Yeah, that's the online article. Google the case
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:13.800]  for killing granny Newsweek cover. Add Newsweek cover to the search. And then people won't believe
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:19.720]  me they're teaching kids to commit suicide. ABC news, Australia. Google after that, Google,
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:24.120]  or start page.com, whatever searches you want to use, yahoo, whatever. Google this.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.880]  Because people, you got to see this for yourself. They have TV shows and video games where it
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:33.720]  teaches them that little animals are dying because of your carbon footprint and that you
[1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:38.280]  should die at age 11, that your carbon credit runs out at age 11. I appreciate your call, Jim.
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:43.880]  I'm sorry I'm ranting. The case for killing granny, teaching kids to commit suicide,
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:50.040]  openly saying they want to kill old people, cutting Medicare and Medicaid. Oh, it's so liberal. You
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:56.120]  people are sickening morons. I told all you stupid communist liberals that in every case in history,
[1:29:56.120 --> 1:30:03.320]  big money takes all the cash and rapes you. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important
[1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:07.720]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:13.080]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:18.200]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:23.160]  want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:28.120]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:32.920]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:38.600]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:43.800]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm

[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:29.560]  tpr20info.com.
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:46.040]  You're in the ring, the guys found both of the cover stories. One of them, the case for killing
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:55.720]  granny, curbing excessive end of life care is good for America. I was a teenage death panelist
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:05.640]  and then pull up the ABC News Australia. Kids told when they should die age 11
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:11.640]  that you should kill yourself for your carbon footprint. Now you found news.com.au,
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.920]  one of the big Australian newspapers, but that's not exactly what I was looking for.
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:22.280]  I wanted to show TV viewers because we simulcast on the web at prisonplanet.tv. I wanted to show
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.560]  you actual screenshots from the video game and cartoon shown to all Australian schoolchildren
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:34.200]  where they show bloody cows and pigs being murdered with blood spewing out, literally little baby
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.480]  pigs having their heads cut off to traumatize the children. They say, see humans are bad,
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:46.600]  you must kill yourself. You cannot make this up. How am I supposed to sit here and calmly
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:52.120]  take this? How am I sitting here and have government textbooks by the White House
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:58.280]  scientists are where they brag that they're already drugging our water supply? Now you guys
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:03.400]  did a great job in that four minute break finding all that, but Cole Watson back in England, he's
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:07.400]  one of our chief webmasters, great at finding stuff because I can't remember the exact search term,
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:13.560]  it's our article. We wrote about it. In fact, kids told when to die info wars.com. Add that at
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:17.880]  the end because we got screenshots before the Australian government pulled it of teaching
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:23.560]  the kids how to commit suicide. I want you to see the bloody animals five year olds are shown.
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:31.000]  They're teaching five, six, seven and eight year olds. Oh, it makes me sick. All you in curriculum,
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:38.920]  you cannot make this up. Do you understand Hitler? God is all all of his ideas from the U S in
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:46.440]  England. Do you understand this is serious? Okay, I'm getting angry. In the final segment,
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:51.320]  I'll cover this Bloomberg arming Goldman with pistols against public. I'm going to cover that,
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:58.520]  but right now let's blast through your calls as quickly as possible. Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:07.800]  Joe in Texas. I'm highly trained in science and you actually hosted one of my articles called
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:14.520]  the hoax of the century back in April. I have 15 other articles. My action plan for the info
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:20.920]  warriors is to find the three or four best climate articles that you can find and put them together
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:26.200]  in a package so that you've got bullet points and send them to all your friends, print them out,
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:31.400]  take them, discuss them with your neighbors. Do everything we can to raise conscience on this
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:37.160]  level. This is the weakest flank of the socialist front. Well, it's more than that. According to
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:42.600]  the head of the UN, head of the EU, Al Gore, they say the heart of world government control
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:48.680]  is the carbon tax grid. And for those that don't know, I just found the info wars.com article.
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:55.000]  ABC website tells Kim when they should die. And then we have the screenshots of the bloody
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:02.840]  dead animals saying that a human creates 24.6 tons of CO2 in their life. By age 11, you must kill
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:11.880]  yourself. I'm sorry, go ahead. Anyhow, I've got my other 15 articles are hosted at climate realists,
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:18.360]  climate depot and Canada free press. If you Google Weegee board of science, you'll pull up one of
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:23.800]  the articles. If you know, I'm not endorsing strictly my articles. There's great articles. It's
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:28.040]  just, I think I've done a good job of tying together. You certainly have. But let me be clear.
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:33.160]  Let me be clear. This is not a bunch of tree hugging, patchouli wearing, sandal wearing idiots.
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:40.440]  Low level, they aren't high level. These are hardcore control freaks that literally want
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:44.920]  a tyrannical world government in their own words. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yes, it stems
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:50.920]  from Savente Arranius back in Sweden, who was the hero of Hitler and the U.S. Progressives.
[1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:59.160]  And from Sir Thomas Malthus and from Galton. Exactly. It's good to talk to somebody that's
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:05.960]  done their research. The Royals 300 years ago decided they wanted to wipe most of the population out
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:11.320]  to control people. And that's why they ship them to Australia and to America and everything
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:16.040]  else to get rid of us, because they couldn't kill everybody. And that's all this is. I mean,
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:21.400]  people, you cannot make this up. It's real. It's so much worse than the public even knows.
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:27.240]  If you read the rise and fall of the Third Reich, we're reliving 1939 all over again.
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.080]  William Shearer. Absolutely. And Hitler was an environmentalist.
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:37.480]  Hitler, Hitler. I read it every decade. Just listen, that Pulitzer prize winning book quotes
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:42.120]  another Pulitzer prize winner. I forget the name of the book where they Hitler was putting fluoride
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:49.080]  in the water. You cannot make this stuff up. Just oh my gosh, funded by the by the Rothschilds in the
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:55.400]  and the Rockefellers, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Great job, Joe. Appreciate it. Send us all your
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:59.240]  articles. I remember the one you sent was excellent. Well, research will post them. Send them to
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:04.040]  writersandinfowars.com. Everybody's got to call them to talk radio. Everybody's got to go to their
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:08.280]  city councils because the UN is in your local city. Those internal documents came out a week ago.
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:12.680]  They're brainwashing everybody. You've got to go counter these liars. You've got to get involved.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:17.000]  You've got to call Congress and say, do not cut Medicare and Medicaid in this health care bill
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:22.280]  which the Democrats are doing. I mean, can you believe that we that conservatives are having
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:27.480]  to say don't kill old people? That's it says the case for killing granny. They're the ones saying
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:39.960]  kill granny. They're the ones. I mean, let's go to Chris in Kentucky. Chris, you're on the air.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:45.160]  I'm just fired up about exactly about this carbon footprint thing. All this propaganda,
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:48.840]  they backwards it, it says, oh, they're not going to die for it. It's actually going to make you
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:53.880]  live longer. No, it isn't. This is such propaganda. They're all tied in with this green movement as
[1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:59.320]  well. And this is all about control. Land grabs has nothing to do with the environment. Take
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:05.720]  Austin and SOS, save our Springs, the mayors. They just stole tens of thousands of people's acres,
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:10.840]  didn't even pay him market value, then turned around and built condos all over them. It's all
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:16.440]  a scam. I've been to the smart growth conferences. It's all bankers and elitists laughing at you.
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:23.320]  They all, it's all a sick joke. They're, these are, these are sickos. Yeah, they are sickos. And it's
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:28.120]  absolutely right. This is why they even can tell you it's that includes Walmart, these old farms
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.440]  that are being grabbed, but from families, they just leave them with nothing. And these corporate
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:38.280]  takeover to the building. When you have the entire fortune 500 behind something like they are behind
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:42.920]  the carbon tax, you know, it's bad. Thanks, Chris. Robin, you talk, Rob, thank you, Rob, you're on
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:50.920]  the air. Go ahead. Thank you. Yes. My question was, is I once watched the Fox news channel,
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:57.320]  and on the news channel, one of the business guys was saying that the health care issue,
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:01.800]  you've seen how they're going to, just like to do the housing market with the subprime loans,
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:05.000]  you'll do the same thing with the insurance companies. Okay, they're going to take you to
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.720]  subprime insurance company, chop them up in a little bit and then sell them to the insurance
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:14.200]  companies. And they're going to make money off the. It's worse than that. The carbon tax was
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:20.280]  written by Ken Lay, all admittedly a new Ponzi scheme. Same thing with government health care.
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:25.240]  You're absolutely right. This gives immunity to the insurance companies and hospitals to start
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:30.280]  refusing care, literally like Soviet Russia, giving you an aspirin for a heart attack.
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:36.520]  And it allows them to absolutely. Yeah, I agree. And there's been, like I said,
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.600]  they're just going to chop them up and sell them and go into carbon tax footprint thing.
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:46.200]  It's all a bunch of, it's all a bunch of sham because if you think about it,
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:51.800]  go green initiative that everyone keeps pushing all, if you ever gone to a website and pay your
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:56.680]  bills, oh, go bring the eco built thing, go green with paperless statements and it's all
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:01.960]  a bunch of fraud. Exactly on one front. I appreciate your call, Rob. They want you on the cashless
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:07.560]  society whereby law, you can't even use paper so they can track everything. But more importantly,
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:12.200]  allows the fortune 100 through the UN, the UN admits they will direct things just like the
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:17.240]  SPP, the North American union meetings were run by private corporations telling the government
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:22.520]  what to do. They get to decide what business you can have, where you're allowed to have a factory,
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:29.160]  how you're able to operate. All the insiders get waivers from their own regulations. Big money
[1:43:29.160 --> 1:43:36.840]  uses government to shut down their competition. Man, good point. Noel, Larry, Kathy, Alex, I'm
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:40.600]  going to take at least those four calls on the other side, then I'm going to get into some
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:46.680]  financial news. What's North com all about? What's the US military doing policing America?
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:52.440]  How's it tie in with Goldman Sachs arming themselves against the public? The globalists
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.200]  know they've committed crime. They know they've taken over the country. Now they've got to do
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:44:02.600]  a rear guard action to protect their looting. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:07.640]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:12.600]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:17.880]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:22.840]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:28.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:33.560]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:38.280]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:42.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:46.920]  generators offered by solutions from science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:07.320]  some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:12.680]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:17.880]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:22.840]  want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[1:45:22.840 --> 1:45:27.720]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.600]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:38.280]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:43.480]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm

[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:09.720]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:14.840]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:17.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. I'm Alex Jones
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:23.640]  and this is the InfoWars. It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:30.680]  Both parties are controlled by ultra-rich offshore elites and I didn't even get to it.
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:36.600]  There's an infowars.com article that links directly to the UN where one of the heads of the UN
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:42.200]  is saying in speeches, we want a world government to reduce world population. We have hundreds of
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:47.800]  these. This is just a new one we found that was just put out last week by the UN. I was
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:53.080]  talking to my dad when he went to college, he was top of his class and they tried to get him
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:57.560]  into a program for world government and future leaders and they said it was all about eugenics
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:02.440]  and he said, no, thank you. Then I was over at their house this weekend and my dad was telling
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:06.920]  a story about somebody that he knew. He got invited to a party with a bunch of rich elitists
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.800]  and some of these names you'd recognize here in Austin. And one of them was like, look at this
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:16.200]  book I wrote about how we should have a one-child policy in America. And he said that was all they
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.920]  talked about at dinner. I mean, this is just everywhere. This is the real world. The rich
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:27.560]  people are a bunch of spoiled rotten control freaks that don't like the general public.
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:33.080]  And they want to make you poor so they can control you. And if they have their way, they want to
[1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:39.160]  kill you. You can't trust any of the vaccines, any of the stuff they're pushing. Now, on the
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:46.600]  banking end, two weeks ago, the house committee passed the bill to the full house. They have 311
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:51.720]  votes, a super majority. It's sure to pass. We don't know about the Senate to audit the
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:56.200]  private fellow reserve. And McClatchy newspapers is now in a five-part series. They got internal
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:00.920]  Goldman Sachs documents. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank and brokerage firm,
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:06.680]  is the most powerful group out of the private shareholders of the private fellow reserve.
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:12.360]  They've been chosen in the last 20 years as the management team before that was mainly JPMorgan.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.920]  Chase, to be the Treasury Secretary, to be the Fed chairman, to be the head regulators.
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:27.480]  The insiders running the government, Clinton, Bush, Obama, a unified program, created the
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:31.560]  derivatives, robbed the public, knew it would destroy the economy. We have their internal
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:35.800]  documents. They know they've committed these crimes. They know they've stolen trillions.
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:39.320]  That's why Bloomberg, give me a close shot of this, please, with a document cam,
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:45.880]  Bloomberg arming Goldman with pistols against the public. Alice Schroeder wrote this article.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:54.600]  And it talks about how in New York City, and now again, Goldman also is a big democratic party
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:58.360]  and one of the biggest supporters of gun control groups that want to disarm the public. So there
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:01.960]  they are in New York having to get a permit to protect themselves. I just wrote my first
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:07.320]  reference for a gun permit, said a friend who told me of swearing to a good character of a
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:12.600]  Goldman Sachs group, Inc., banker, who applied to the local police for a permit to buy a pistol.
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:16.920]  The banker had told his friends of mine that senior Goldman people have loaded up on firearms
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.400]  that are now equipped to defend themselves if there is a populist uprising against the bank.
[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:24.520]  And it talks about the bank having security guards and machine guns.
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:31.480]  Again, they want your guns, but they want guns to protect themselves from the public
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:36.280]  because they're guilty. They know it's coming out that they've engineered a depression.
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:40.680]  They know the Federal Reserve is on the verge of being audited. They know they run the Federal
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:49.240]  Reserve. It's just the front, the holding company. And it just goes on here with how they're buying
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:56.920]  all these weapons against the public and how they reached a 27 billion first nine months of last
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:03.880]  year that they gotten bonuses alone. I mean, this is just incredible. So again, they're acting like
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:10.760]  criminals who are scared because they are crooks. This is the head group. Let's jam in some final
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:16.520]  phone calls here. Noel in Illinois, you're on the air. Welcome. Alex Jones, how are you today?
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:24.760]  Pretty fired up. All right. You were talking earlier about weather modification. I was watching
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:32.440]  conspiracy theories with Jesse Ventera talking about HAARP. And then I went to StarPage.com
[1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:38.440]  and found a report from the Air Force August 1996, weather as a force manipulator owning the
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:47.320]  weather in 2025. Talking about working with NATO, the United Nations, one part in here on page 28,
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:54.040]  talks about our major advantage of using simulated weather is to achieve the desired effect
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:59.960]  that is unlike other approaches. It makes what are otherwise the results of deliberated actions
[1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:05.000]  to appear the consequences of natural weather phenomenon. Let me break this down for those
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:10.600]  that don't know. China manipulates their weather. Russia manipulates. Venezuela manipulates. They
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:17.800]  admitted on their news. There was a Nobel Prize given in 92 for the chemtrail, barium, salt,
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:24.680]  aluminum dioxide, patent. Obama's White House science are admits in speeches that going back
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:31.320]  since 1995, they have been spraying the atmosphere to stop global warming. But then scientists,
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:36.120]  before they ever admitted they were doing this, the meteorologist and others we interviewed said
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:41.560]  what they're doing will actually heat the earth. So what they're doing is they're trying to raise
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:50.760]  sea levels to play God so they can terrorize the public. 1997 Army Times, April 28th issue,
[1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:55.560]  interview with Secretary of Defense William Cohen. He admits they have weather weapons.
[1:53:55.560 --> 1:54:00.840]  Yes, this is this is absolutely real, but the general public is not aware of it.
[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:06.680]  And chemtrails are real. They are manipulating the atmosphere. So they may engage in more weather
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:12.120]  terror to try to scare people into going along with all this. But because the sun cooled off the
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:17.800]  last nine years, it gets hot and cold, hot and cold in its own cycle, our cars have nothing
[1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:21.880]  to do with that. As you know, Noelle, they're even having trouble heating things even though
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:26.760]  they're trying. Go ahead. They talk about according to John Hall, John Stores Hall,
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:31.640]  scientist at Rutgers University down in Piscataway, New Jersey. According to research on
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:39.640]  neurological technology, production costs of these Neon particles could cost at the same price
[1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:44.760]  per pound as potatoes. They also talk about a global weather network. Think about it. Maybe
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:50.280]  the weather channel, NBC going to be with GE now going to Comcast. It talks about
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:55.240]  war fighting commander in chief. Our current president is one. He's also the Nobel Peace
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:55:01.960]  Prize oxymoron. Again, folks, start page dot com August 1996 weather as a force manipulator.
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:05.960]  Good to hear from you. No, I know, I know, it's just, I know, and the public
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:12.040]  just cannot understand. We have a latest scientist playing God, manipulating everything.
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:17.800]  The White House science are who wrote this textbook, Eco science about a planetary regime
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:22.840]  to carry out our extermination and drugging of the water to sterilize us and give us cancer.
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:28.280]  And his first speech when he became White House science are was to admit they are controlling
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:33.400]  our weather to a group of scientists. And they think we're so dumb, they admit it,
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:37.800]  but then deny it publicly. Let's go to Larry in Oklahoma. Larry, you're on the air.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:47.960]  Alex, I've got four quick points. In 2000, 2001, Obama, along with Maurice Strongest,
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:53.320]  mother investors started the Chicago climate exchange. Yes, they, your money will be paid
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:56:00.360]  directly to Al Gore and Obama and Maurice Strong. Sorry. Yeah. And Fox News has a headline on
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:10.600]  that. From the Wall Street Journal, the EPA is set to declare carbon dioxide a public danger.
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:17.320]  Yes. Okay, that's supposed to make it illegal and then make you pay them in Ron came up with
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:22.280]  a plan with Al Gore 95. If you cannot make up a fraud this big, sorry, go ahead.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:29.400]  All right. Have you ever had a show with a man named John Coleman? Do you know who he is? You
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:35.960]  ought to get him on. He's a weather man. The Weather Channel. He's a broadcaster. Yes. He was
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:41.000]  the founder of the Weather Channel. He's suing Al Gore. I've been trying to get him on. Yeah. Well,
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.120]  get him on. He's got a hell of a story to tell. We're trying Larry. He's on a website.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:52.760]  He's a weather man now at KUSI News in San Diego, and he's got a long page article talking about
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:57:03.800]  Al Gore and his early days. It's great. And the last point, call James Enhoff 202-224-4721. He's
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:09.960]  my Oklahoma senator. Keep hammering on him to do something about this damn weather thing.
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:13.160]  I hear you appreciate your call. Look, Enhoff is trying to get a
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:18.280]  good investigation, and Barbara Boxer won't let him have one. You need to call that piece of filth.
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:22.280]  We've got time for Kathy in New Orleans. Kathy, you're on the air.
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:29.160]  How are you? I really am excited about what happened a couple of weeks ago. I feel like
[1:57:29.160 --> 1:57:35.880]  God reached down and touched us because before that I really had no hope. My comment was exactly
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:41.000]  two callers ago. I was concerned about the chemtrails. I was wondering, I'm sorry,
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.680]  they're very hot right now. They admit they're mixing with jet fuel. The pilots don't even know.
[1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:49.720]  It's a perfect, just like they put fluoride in the water, and the public doesn't know,
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:53.800]  and it's deadly poison and gives you cancer and sterile. It's the same thing. They add the
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:59.880]  barium salts, limit the oxide to the fuel. It's dispersed. It's perfect cloud nuclei to form clouds.
[1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:04.360]  The earth is 20% darker according to NASA. They are literally blacking out the sun.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:08.920]  I mean, I walked outside this weekend and you couldn't see the sun from the chemtrails.
[1:58:08.920 --> 1:58:13.880]  Right. Do you think that this is going to cause more attention to the chemtrails or the truth?
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:18.120]  What's incredible is they told us we were kooks a year ago for talking about it,
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.320]  and 10 years ago talking about it. Even though we had the government documents,
[1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:25.160]  now the White House admits, since the mid-90s, they've been spraying us,
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:29.080]  and the aluminum dioxide also causes brain damage in all animals.
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.400]  I'm out of time, ma'am. Great points. Thank you.
[1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:38.440]  We're in a science fiction movie. It's the 21st century. There's a scientific dictatorship
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:43.000]  called the New World Order over us. They're manipulating the weather. They call it Google
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:49.720]  John P. Holdren, Geoengineering. You'll see video of him admitting they're spraying you with deadly
[1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:54.440]  chemicals. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[1:58:54.440 --> 1:58:59.480]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:58:59.480 --> 1:59:04.120]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:09.400]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:14.520]  technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.960]  overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:24.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:28.840]  their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:32.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:37.080]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more
