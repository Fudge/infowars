[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.280]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[00:26.280 --> 00:33.320]  be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible
[00:33.320 --> 00:39.400]  for launching nuclear weapons to do so. As president, I will make it clear that the United
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.680]  States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious
[00:45.680 --> 00:51.480]  political, economic and military responses. They are voting for peace on planet Earth
[00:51.480 --> 01:01.000]  if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war. We came, we saw, we died.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  With her, you'll end up in World War II. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.560]  president, we will attack Iran. Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace
[01:10.560 --> 01:18.320]  in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. The U.S. military has just
[01:18.320 --> 01:24.080]  raised the threat level to DEF CON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia
[01:24.080 --> 01:29.640]  with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking. It's like she's
[01:29.640 --> 01:33.200]  not even concerned about the repercussions. Of course not, because she's...
[01:33.200 --> 01:35.200]  There's a really loud noise.
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.600]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to
[01:40.600 --> 01:48.960]  get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[01:48.960 --> 02:14.960]  We must be followed.
[02:14.960 --> 02:25.000]  Well, I hate to say it again, but we called what was happening. NATO back forces have
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.360]  launched accelerated attacks into eastern Ukraine, into Russian-held areas. The Russians,
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.960]  who make about 98% of the population, they're evacuating, and they're just going to ethnically
[02:35.960 --> 02:42.720]  cleanse them out. And this is an attempt to get the Russians to come into their aid and
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.360]  start a major war. Unbelievable.
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.080]  To watch the globalists launch these attacks and launch, obviously, their own false flags
[02:51.080 --> 02:57.160]  on that kindergarten so that they can have the pretext for this, and now here we are.
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.480]  And Hillary Clinton, the people that represent her, are basically president now. It's a round
[03:01.480 --> 03:07.200]  table of the Clinton crime syndicate and Obama's crime syndicate and Soros' crime syndicate
[03:07.200 --> 03:15.200]  that are all interlocked that are putting the world under biomedical martial law and
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.800]  now preparing to launch a full-scale war with Russia.
[03:18.800 --> 03:21.600]  Putin's come out and said the situation is deteriorating quickly and that there's ethnic
[03:21.600 --> 03:25.960]  cleansing and, quote, genocide going on. There is. And he said they are attempting to push
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.080]  Russia into a conflict.
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.000]  Russia is showing all the facts and evidence of this. And instead of claiming that it's
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.960]  false flags that Russia stays against itself, the Western media is simply not talking about
[03:38.960 --> 03:40.440]  any of it.
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.960]  So it's a bad situation, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, it's so horrible. I don't even have
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.160]  words to describe it. They are now arresting and holding without bail peaceful protesters
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.720]  across Canada. You knew it wouldn't just be in the bridge situation or in the capital
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.120]  of Ottawa. They are now arresting people and saying, no bail. And under the emergency,
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.960]  we don't tell you why they're arrested. And we have the son of Arthur Poplowski, the
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.040]  preacher, who is now facing prison as a terrorist. They're calling him a terrorist for praying
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.280]  with truck drivers. And so you want to see what secret police, the end of America and
[04:18.280 --> 04:22.160]  the end of Canada, the end of freedom looks like.
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.120]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen. And they're getting us ready for the worldwide financial
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.680]  collapse and war that comes. And COVID martial law was the training wheels, as I told you,
[04:32.680 --> 04:38.600]  for all of it. So we are in the worst possible scenario now. The globalists aren't giving
[04:38.600 --> 04:43.560]  up. They're launching collapse, fake cyber attacks to be blamed on Russia and giant crack
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.720]  nouns on all of us. Remember, globalism is the UN Incorporations waging war against everybody.
[04:48.720 --> 04:52.320]  The Chinese people, the Russian people, the Mexican people, the Canadian people, the American
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.160]  people, the German people, the South African people, all people, we're to be dehumanized
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.640]  and then killed. Stay with us.
[05:00.640 --> 05:06.400]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock. Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information

[06:01.160 --> 06:25.160]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones, the capital of the
[06:25.160 --> 06:31.200]  great nation of Canada to our north here in the United States. What appears to be several
[06:31.200 --> 06:42.160]  thousand, if you look at all the videos, masked men with black ski mask in police uniforms
[06:42.160 --> 06:47.680]  are massing and they have already started the arrest of the leaders of the trucker freedom
[06:47.680 --> 06:55.240]  convoy and they are not charging them and saying they're being held without bail. So
[06:55.240 --> 07:03.120]  this is true martial law. They're also saying they're not going to just take the bank accounts
[07:03.120 --> 07:09.280]  but also the children and pets will be euthanized. These are true terrorists. This is the complete
[07:09.280 --> 07:15.600]  fall of our world of the West. It can rise again, but we have to find our souls and
[07:15.600 --> 07:21.640]  say no to it. And I have all the documents where Klaus Schwab is in full command bragging,
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.400]  congratulating Trudeau for his loyalty and carrying out the great reset. He actually
[07:25.400 --> 07:31.640]  says I run Canada. I run the cabinet. He congratulates Trudeau and he says that we are seizing their
[07:31.640 --> 07:36.720]  bank accounts. So the head of the Bilderberg group is on TV. There's also the head of the
[07:36.720 --> 07:43.280]  Davos group saying we are seizing their accounts. We are going to hold them without trial. I
[07:43.280 --> 07:57.120]  mean this is just unspeakable. And they have also announced that all leftist organizations
[07:57.120 --> 08:03.280]  including the Communist Party should be marching and should be demonstrating. Only anti-lockdown
[08:03.280 --> 08:15.480]  protesters are banned nationwide. Arthur Poplowski, the Polish immigrant preacher, popular preacher
[08:15.480 --> 08:20.280]  who went and prayed with the convoy has been arrested and they are not even charging him
[08:20.280 --> 08:26.520]  and they're saying that he's being held without bail. And that is also in the news for the
[08:26.520 --> 08:31.680]  other individuals who have been arrested in Ottawa. They're saying we will not say where
[08:31.680 --> 08:38.000]  they are, what happened to them, this is martial law. They're clearly trying to start a shooting
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.920]  war, ladies and gentlemen, and they're trying to put people in a corner where folks have
[08:43.920 --> 08:50.560]  no other choice. We do not need to go out and start a shooting war at this point. The
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.480]  people that went to Ottawa and other areas knew what they were getting into and the left
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.400]  is coming for our children one way or another. That's what this whole power grab is about.
[09:03.400 --> 09:09.360]  And I use the allegory of a very good film that actually Matt Damon's in, which I'm
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.680]  not a big fan of, but it's actually a true story. Actually many years ago I read an
[09:12.680 --> 09:17.680]  essay about it, there's several books out on it, but the movies Last Duel and there's
[09:17.680 --> 09:22.800]  a scene in the film from a historic battle where they're executing townspeople across
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.880]  the river in front of the French forces, the British are, so they will make them come
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.680]  across and lose the bridge so they could win the war, which they did win that battle and
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.640]  subsequently that war because of that. So I mean they could put women and children on
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.000]  TV and slit their throats. Seriously, I'm not saying they're going to do that, but we should
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.160]  let them and not respond and that will defeat them like Jesus did and Mahatma Gandhi did
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.920]  and Martin Luther King Jr. There is a time to let the enemy hurt us. If I was here with
[09:56.920 --> 10:00.760]  police with billy clubs, I'd just be just like, go ahead, knock my teeth out, just break
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.520]  my nose completely in right now. That takes real strength and I'm ready to have that
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.680]  happen. I'm ready for them to take me in a field, shoot me in the back of the head because
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.640]  they're losing the people and they're losing their control right now. They're losing
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.200]  right now. So I understand as men, like Ben Marble was on a few days ago, he's a good
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.400]  doctor and he says, you know, it's not my job to kill people, but he said, it's the
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.760]  military's job to protect us and we really should see the globalist taken out. Well,
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.960]  I understand his sentiment, but I don't agree with that at this point. That's how they want
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.320]  to be the victim and misrepresent us and then they're going to hit us with a cyber attack
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.400]  claiming the Russians turned the power off. You've got to not just look at what they're
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.920]  currently doing to us. You got to look around the world and understand they're starting
[10:46.920 --> 10:54.440]  a major war with Russia right now. Now, they had to bring in special trained police that
[10:54.440 --> 11:00.960]  have volunteered for this wearing Vala clava black mask in Canada. The vast majority of
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.360]  police are resigning or saying no and the truck drivers and tow truck drivers, they
[11:05.360 --> 11:11.560]  ordered to go tow the trucks. They have now joined the protesters. So this is quickly
[11:11.560 --> 11:17.560]  going to turn into a disaster and that's what Klaus Schwab wanted, but he wanted to act
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.400]  like Canada was just destabilized, America was destabilized, Europe was destabilized,
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.480]  Brazil was destabilized. They didn't want it to be known that he's involved. Now that
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.920]  it's out there, now he's acting powerful and like he's in charge and saying, I commend
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.640]  Trudeau for his loyalty. We're going to use, read the quotes here, Klaus Schwab explaining
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.360]  the digital response network illegally used to freeze bank accounts, crypto wallets and
[11:44.360 --> 11:50.120]  insurance of freedom convoy protesters as its donors. And then we've got his minister
[11:50.120 --> 11:58.040]  that's on the board of directors of the Bilderberg group and the Davos group, Christia Freeland
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.400]  laughing and giggling how they're going to take everything from everybody and it's so
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.800]  funny. We have all these video clips, folks. So you are witnessing the boa constrictor
[12:07.800 --> 12:15.240]  of the new world order, try to gobble Europe, try to absorb Canada, try to gobble up 800
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.920]  plus cities controlled by the left in America, try to swallow South America, Central America,
[12:20.920 --> 12:29.240]  try to swallow Africa, try to swallow Asia, try to swallow Russia, biting off more than
[12:29.240 --> 12:36.200]  they can chew. So work like your lives depend on it to expose the great reset, to expose
[12:36.200 --> 12:40.480]  Bill Beck better, to expose the globalist plan because their stock in Moderna and Pfizer
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.640]  is plunging. The scientists are all coming out exposing it was a soft kill weapon. The
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.160]  wheels are coming off everywhere in their church of political correctness, their attacks
[12:51.160 --> 12:57.240]  on children. Private citizens and corporate groups and the military and good people in
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.560]  the Justice Department, FBI are busting government pedophile rings and corporate pedophile rings
[13:02.560 --> 13:10.000]  everywhere in mass right now. We are winning the hearts and minds. That's in a clip last
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.560]  night when I got home from dinner with friends. But I'm very well known a podcaster who's
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.560]  one of my best tipsters. And I went and I watched it. I researched it. The head community
[13:20.560 --> 13:27.240]  organizer, like number three, I guess, overall in that at Facebook, that he's launching the
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.280]  metaverse everything. He's in a hotel room where he thought he was meeting a 13 year
[13:31.280 --> 13:38.400]  old boy. And that's one of the top Facebook executives right there, ladies and gentlemen
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.280]  who flew to Indiana to meet with a 13 year old boy in a hotel room. It's up on infowars.com
[13:45.280 --> 13:55.000]  right now. So they can run, but they can't hide. Their religion is vampirically sucking
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.480]  the innocence and energy out of our children. The children are the power. And when we don't
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.800]  take care of them, God turns his back on us and might just allow nuclear war to teach
[14:05.800 --> 14:10.840]  us a lesson. I wouldn't blame God if he blew the whole planet up tomorrow, but I hope we
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.440]  get a reprieve for our children's futures. Now we come back, ladies and gentlemen, we
[14:16.440 --> 14:21.400]  got so much to hit all the trucker information video, the arrest video, the announcements
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.440]  are going to kidnap their children and animals, their dogs. A lot of these people are homeless
[14:26.440 --> 14:35.240]  now under the two years of martial law in Canada. So they live in their trucks, but Russia
[14:35.240 --> 14:44.400]  has tried to not escalate tanks and Putin has tried to play things down so that hardliners
[14:44.400 --> 14:49.240]  don't engage in a coup against him. But he's gone ahead and just come out and said what
[14:49.240 --> 14:54.400]  we already knew. There's a massive Western offensive attacking Russian held areas of
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.680]  eastern Ukraine and they're engaged in genocide. They're going house to house, taking people
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.040]  out in front of their houses and killing them. And this is all being done again as a provocation,
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.960]  just like in the last duel, where they're slitting the women and children's throats
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.120]  across the river to make them come across to lose the bridge. And that's the historic
[15:14.120 --> 15:16.480]  thing that's actually in the record books that happened when they lost the battle. They
[15:16.480 --> 15:25.360]  lost the war. We have to let them attack these people and these people have chosen this route
[15:25.360 --> 15:28.960]  and I'm going to pray for them and support them. They're not going to slit the children's
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.960]  throats because that will be too much, but that's the kind of stuff they're engaged in.
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.800]  So this is a very, very painful time, but I'm not asking these people to do anything
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.480]  I haven't done. I have stood here peacefully and taken their attacks and not let them manipulate
[15:45.480 --> 15:51.720]  me into violence. He who shoots first loses the upper hand. Don't worry folks, those of
[15:51.720 --> 15:54.280]  you who want shooting and war and stuff, you're probably going to get a lot more of it you
[15:54.280 --> 16:00.480]  ever wanted. So don't worry. We'll be right back.
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.200]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[16:05.200 --> 16:11.800]  empowering, and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes to information,
[16:11.800 --> 16:18.800]  boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation,
[16:18.800 --> 16:25.160]  great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[16:25.160 --> 16:31.680]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors
[16:31.680 --> 16:37.840]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their
[16:37.840 --> 16:43.000]  world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.520]  it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.600]  gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[16:53.600 --> 16:57.840]  And that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up with your links. That's
[16:57.840 --> 16:59.840]  why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[16:59.840 --> 17:02.960]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right there, to prevent them
[17:02.960 --> 17:06.200]  right now, take advantage of this moment. And I've always had an idea that something
[17:06.200 --> 17:10.000]  everybody can do, but every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective for
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.480]  us to hang banners over highways, imagine a giant man on a piece that I laid up, it
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.040]  says Alex Jones is right in the war stock farm where we stand with the truckers, a rescout
[17:20.040 --> 17:21.040]  or whatever.
[17:21.040 --> 17:24.920]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in your small
[17:24.920 --> 17:29.040]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[17:29.040 --> 17:35.000]  your car or banner hangs over highways. And it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend
[17:35.000 --> 17:43.160]  people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, the vaccine is poison.
[17:43.160 --> 17:47.680]  There's tons of things I say to keep it short, keep it concise. I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.360]  Bill Gates, the COVID backs is poison. Beautiful. Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[17:52.360 --> 17:55.920]  if we could all be effective. So that's what I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.200]  Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so much. UN run contact
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.240]  tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.480]  from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you
[18:10.480 --> 18:15.520]  go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away
[18:15.520 --> 18:20.960]  into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand their
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.800]  shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.520]  for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.400]  to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America
[18:34.400 --> 18:40.120]  and are very compliant, meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.560]  the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[18:44.560 --> 18:50.240]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones.

[19:00.360 --> 19:14.360]  William in California, people are asleep and program controlled. I agree. How do you make
[19:14.360 --> 19:18.760]  the sleeper awaken, William? Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug
[19:18.760 --> 19:25.560]  the dialets real quick? Yeah, go ahead. Hey, I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25, 30
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.320]  year olds and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to know why. And I've tested
[19:28.320 --> 19:33.520]  this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[19:33.520 --> 19:39.760]  I really do. I take that B12 and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.320]  heavy work with the highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[19:45.320 --> 19:52.320]  for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12
[19:52.320 --> 20:01.320]  saves my life.
[20:01.320 --> 20:27.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.320 --> 20:37.320]  The grid. A digital frontier. I tried to paint your clusters of information as they moved
[20:37.320 --> 20:45.320]  through the computer. What did they look like? Chips. Motorcycles. Were the circuits like
[20:45.320 --> 20:59.320]  that?
[20:59.320 --> 21:06.320]  paramilitary police masking their identity are preparing mass arrest and assault. They said
[21:06.320 --> 21:11.320]  they'll launch against the thousands of peaceful demonstrators who just didn't want to live
[21:11.320 --> 21:20.320]  under the UN, Bilderberg group, corporate world government forced inoculation, tyranny. Incredible.
[21:20.320 --> 21:25.320]  We've got all that information coming up with one of the political prisoners, sons, a pastor
[21:25.320 --> 21:31.320]  arrested for keeping his church open. Everything else is allowed to be open to churches.
[21:31.320 --> 21:34.320]  Arthur Pulaski's son will be joining us starting the next hour. We'll go over all of that,
[21:34.320 --> 21:43.320]  but let's hit the biggest threat currently going on right now. Hillary, Biden, the puppet,
[21:43.320 --> 21:49.320]  Vice President Harris have all said Russia is going to shut down our pipelines, though
[21:49.320 --> 21:54.320]  it's the globalist shutting our pipelines down publicly, and that there's going to be power
[21:54.320 --> 22:00.320]  outages launched by Russia. And then when there is power outages, we have to have a nuclear
[22:00.320 --> 22:05.320]  war that Hillary and others have said with nuclear war response. US senators have said
[22:05.320 --> 22:11.320]  sounds psychotic because it is. People know their world systems going down. They know
[22:11.320 --> 22:15.320]  their big banking cartels going down and they need wars as the distraction when they let
[22:15.320 --> 22:22.320]  you know that you basically are completely bankrupt. And they're desperate getting all
[22:22.320 --> 22:27.320]  the trillions they can before it all goes down, building their armored fortresses everywhere.
[22:27.320 --> 22:40.320]  But you notice, Pfizer and Moderna are plunging, plunging, plunging as much as 70%. It's unbelievable.
[22:40.320 --> 22:43.320]  And then what's happening? Same thing, an escalation of violence in Canada, putting you
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.320]  in a corner, telling you you can't travel, telling you you're non-essential, telling
[22:47.320 --> 22:53.320]  you you've got to take a deadly shot. And then it's the same thing in Russia. I just look
[22:53.320 --> 23:01.320]  at the history. I look at the facts. And I'm not a Russophile when the Russians were
[23:01.320 --> 23:05.320]  controlled by the globalists and we're going around doing bad things. My family confronted
[23:05.320 --> 23:12.320]  the Russians around the world because I'm a loyal American and loyal to freedom. But
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.320]  this isn't the same Russia. And the globalists that did control Russia now don't control
[23:17.320 --> 23:23.320]  Russia and they're pissed. And so it's barely even hitting the western news that massive
[23:23.320 --> 23:29.320]  artillery barrages, rocket attacks, mortars, machine gun attacks into the eastern area of
[23:29.320 --> 23:39.320]  the Tiley Dents, looks like Austin, Texas, highly dense eastern region of Ukraine. And
[23:39.320 --> 23:46.320]  so you send in heavy weapons, you send in arms, you expand your offensive to push the
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.320]  Russians out of that buffer zone that they created in 2014 because of ongoing ethnic
[23:50.320 --> 23:55.320]  cleansing. And then the Russians have now announced evacuations of the Russian population.
[23:55.320 --> 24:00.320]  And then now their homes will be taken. Their businesses will be taken. And the Russians
[24:00.320 --> 24:07.320]  are pulling back. But the globalist plan on staging false flags, obviously, what they
[24:07.320 --> 24:12.320]  accuse Russia of as a pretext to escalate it. And they claim with no evidence the Russians
[24:12.320 --> 24:20.320]  are firing artillery barrages back into the West. Eastern Ukraine's situation is
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.320]  deteriorating, warrants Putin. So he doesn't want to call it a war. He's called it a
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.320]  genocide. But the war is already there. The war is hot since 2014. And now there's a
[24:30.320 --> 24:36.320]  globalist offensive into the country with heavy weapons and class A weapons. Russian
[24:36.320 --> 24:40.320]  President Vladimir Putin said Friday that the situation in eastern Ukraine was
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.320]  deteriorating and called on the Ukrainian president to launch negotiations with Russia
[24:44.320 --> 24:51.320]  back separatist. The comments came as separatist leaders in the Donbass announced
[24:51.320 --> 24:56.320]  mass evacuations of civilians into Russia on claims that Kiev was planning an imminent
[24:56.320 --> 25:01.320]  attack. We had an American reporter on a couple days ago. We should get him back on
[25:01.320 --> 25:05.320]  to talk about this now. Unfortunately, right now we see deterioration of the situation
[25:05.320 --> 25:11.320]  in that area, Putin said. He repeatedly telegraphed that Moscow wants Kiev to
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.320]  implement the 2015 Minsk agreement, a ceasefire deal that has only existed
[25:15.320 --> 25:20.320]  framework for ending the war in eastern Ukraine. So he wants a ceasefire and the
[25:20.320 --> 25:27.320]  West is pushing in now with armored vehicles, tanks, anti-aircraft and anti-tank
[25:27.320 --> 25:31.320]  weapons and just leveling the area. And they're not denying that. They're leveling
[25:31.320 --> 25:36.320]  it right now. And if you fight back, it's like what's the biggest crime? Antifa's
[25:36.320 --> 25:39.320]  mugging you, antifa's stabbing you, shooting you, you fight back and go to
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.320]  prison, they don't. Come on, Harris, bail's the amount of jail. You go to jail.
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.320]  Your call right now is being chased by pedophiles and criminals trying to murder
[25:48.320 --> 25:52.320]  you, shooting at you. You fight back, you're the devil. It's the same thing.
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.320]  It's anybody fighting back against a globalist that have hijacked our country,
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.320]  destroying our country while they destroy everybody else. Putin sees deterioration
[26:00.320 --> 26:07.320]  of situation in eastern Ukraine. Donbass separatists announced mass evacuation
[26:07.320 --> 26:13.320]  to Russia. Putin sees situation deteriorating. As VP Harris warns, Putin,
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.320]  U.S. now says up to 190,000 Russian troops are near Ukraine. And again,
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.320]  they're not in their own country. How dare them? Bleak new intelligence assessment
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.320]  driving new urgency for by-demonstration on Russia. So they believe that Putin,
[26:28.320 --> 26:34.320]  here's the bottom line. The globalists believe Putin, when they launched
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.320]  offensives into eastern Ukraine to drive the Russians out and then now into
[26:40.320 --> 26:50.320]  other areas the Russians control, they're in the south, that when they finally
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.320]  attack Crimea, the Russians will have a red line and that Putin will be deposed
[26:55.320 --> 27:01.320]  by hardliners if he doesn't attack back. And so Putin's being driven into a corner
[27:01.320 --> 27:11.320]  to be induced to fight back, which will then be called a war and will be called
[27:11.320 --> 27:15.320]  an attack. And if the Russians show anybody that's been killed, that's all the
[27:15.320 --> 27:19.320]  false flag, that's all fake. And so you see where the world is right now,
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.320]  just like the truckers. They'll attack the truckers, attack the men, women,
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.320]  and children, had police thugs come in under martial law and all the lefts
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.320]  allowed to protest, but the right wing isn't. That's in the decree. They brought
[27:32.320 --> 27:35.320]  in special police just like in Tiananmen Square. The first day or so the police
[27:35.320 --> 27:38.320]  didn't, the military didn't attack the demonstrators. They wanted democracy too.
[27:38.320 --> 27:45.320]  They wanted to free up China. So they bust from a thousand miles away a group
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.320]  of Chinese that even speak a different language to attack them. And they now
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.320]  bust in paramilitary and special uniforms, probably most of them aren't even
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.320]  Canadians, and they're there with their machine guns and their shotguns and
[27:57.320 --> 28:01.320]  their weapons and they're already arresting the leaders and saying in the news
[28:01.320 --> 28:07.320]  they're being held, they're being held and we won't tell you why, what's
[28:07.320 --> 28:17.320]  happening and we don't have to charge anybody. So this is an ongoing situation.
[28:17.320 --> 28:20.320]  So you want to see how the secret police system works. They already set up the
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.320]  emergency camps for the quote, unvaccinated. Remember we told you a year before it
[28:25.320 --> 28:27.320]  was announced it was happening. It's all over the world. It's you
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.320]  indirectly. And now it's here. And people need to understand that this is a
[28:33.320 --> 28:37.320]  worldwide move by the globalist attacking in different ways, but overall
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.320]  destabilizing things so that when you see the currency collapse, the new world
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.320]  digital currency rolled out, you'll accept it believing they're the saviors
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.320]  and that you'll blame Russia or you'll blame the truck drivers or you'll blame
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.320]  whoever for the detonator of the great reset collapsing civilization in their
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.320]  own words. This is such a dangerous time. Please pray for a global
[28:56.320 --> 29:15.320]  awakening right now. Harness the power of the sun. Harness the life giving energy of this incredible engine that God gave us.
[29:15.320 --> 29:22.320]  Wherever you are, wherever you go, 365 days out of the year, whether it's in the dead
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.320]  or dark cold winter or the blazing hot summer, everyone does better and is healthier
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.320]  with an extra dose of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are essential for your
[29:31.320 --> 29:35.320]  immunity. And now that people understand that, it's important to act on that
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.320]  information. We have the highest quality vitamin D3 called Winner's Son with
[29:39.320 --> 29:45.320]  vitamin K at m4works store.com. And right now it's 50% off. So harness the power of
[29:45.320 --> 29:48.320]  the sun for yourself, your friends, your family today. The globalist are fighting
[29:48.320 --> 29:53.320]  to suppress this information. So it's key to let others know about the power of the sun
[29:53.320 --> 30:19.320]  Harnessed in vitamin D3 inside Winner's Son at m4works store.com.
[30:23.320 --> 30:51.320]  We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars. But we won't. And we're just learning this fact. So don't f*** with us.
[30:53.320 --> 31:00.320]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[31:00.320 --> 31:07.320]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training, probably not as much as they should be, but thank
[31:07.320 --> 31:14.320]  goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some
[31:14.320 --> 31:21.320]  TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins
[31:21.320 --> 31:28.320]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best
[31:28.320 --> 31:37.320]  chance at getting through the training. And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore less. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for
[31:37.320 --> 31:45.320]  giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me
[31:45.320 --> 31:53.320]  recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news. TurboForce, that can still
[31:53.320 --> 31:59.320]  give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore less can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[31:59.320 --> 32:08.320]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large. If you're
[32:08.320 --> 32:16.320]  having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[32:16.320 --> 32:23.320]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut eye you deserve.
[32:23.320 --> 32:31.320]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted
[32:31.320 --> 32:39.320]  directly into the glycerin solution. So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[32:39.320 --> 32:47.320]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[32:47.320 --> 32:56.320]  who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be Down and Out.
[32:56.320 --> 33:01.320]  Now at InfoWarsStore.com
[33:27.320 --> 33:41.320]  I remember 30 plus years ago, before I was even on air, reading patriot publications like the New American from the John Burt's
[33:41.320 --> 33:55.320]  Society and actually going to the library and getting the books that they were quoting by Zabigniew Brzezinski by people like
[33:55.320 --> 34:05.320]  Carol Quigley, like people like Cecil Rhodes, and reading it and seeing that they indeed said they would do these things.
[34:05.320 --> 34:12.320]  And then later going and looking at the microfilm, when I read quotes about New York Times, editorials written by
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.320]  David Rockefeller about how communism is good and how Mao Zedong is good and how we need to bring that here.
[34:18.320 --> 34:25.320]  And we'll have to have a big collapse first, though, of capitalism to do it.
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.320]  The most selfish, greedy, monopolistic people you could ever imagine running communism, because it's not what you think.
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.320]  That's why Vi Lenin bust his in-claw swabs office.
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.320]  Because Lenin wasn't trying to do something for the people.
[34:38.320 --> 34:48.320]  He was setting up a system where humans are like farm animals and a new elite control, everybody.
[34:48.320 --> 34:49.320]  Read 1984.
[34:49.320 --> 34:57.320]  That's a communist that got to the highest levels of it, George Arwell, Eric Blair, and found out how real it was and how they
[34:57.320 --> 34:59.320]  planned to only hurt people.
[34:59.320 --> 35:05.320]  And he worked with the communists in the Spanish Civil War before that, but it took him 20 years of working with the communists
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.320]  to get to the highest levels.
[35:08.320 --> 35:14.320]  And to learn British intelligence was funding Stalin.
[35:14.320 --> 35:22.320]  And the U.S. Army was funding Stalin even before World War II, just like McCarthy found out about it.
[35:22.320 --> 35:25.320]  It's a long-term authoritarian plan.
[35:25.320 --> 35:28.320]  And Klaus Schwab was just the latest frontman of this.
[35:28.320 --> 35:34.320]  Head of the Bilderberg Group, now head of the Davos Group, carrying this out.
[35:34.320 --> 35:42.320]  Yeah, there's Klaus Schwab with his boss, Henry Kissinger, and others.
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.320]  So that's who these people are.
[35:46.320 --> 35:53.320]  And they think they can hide while they start wars and hide while they release the virus and shut everything down to consolidate control
[35:53.320 --> 35:59.320]  and bring out their world IDs and put out policy papers bragging how they did it to us.
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.320]  And how Trudeau's loyal for what he's doing now to the great reset.
[36:02.320 --> 36:10.320]  And Trudeau gets up on TV and reads that I'm doing this for the great reset and build back better.
[36:10.320 --> 36:17.320]  Yeah, there's Klaus Schwab with Prince Charles.
[36:17.320 --> 36:27.320]  I mean, these are real supervillains that engage in what they call elite capture.
[36:27.320 --> 36:35.320]  But Cecil Rhodes wrote books on the head of the British Empire 120 plus years ago.
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.320]  You can go read his books, I have.
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.320]  Now, British intelligence went in and bought up all the elites.
[36:42.320 --> 36:48.320]  It's not British intelligence that runs it now, but it's that skeletal system they set up that is the New World Order.
[36:48.320 --> 36:49.320]  And it's bad news.
[36:49.320 --> 36:57.320]  And Prince Charles and Prince Philip both say they want to depopulate 80 to 90 percent of the world population.
[36:57.320 --> 36:59.320]  And they're cutting the resources off.
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.320]  They're making you stay home.
[37:00.320 --> 37:01.320]  They're making you go bankrupt.
[37:01.320 --> 37:03.320]  They're promising you all this free stuff.
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.320]  And once production collapses, who do they blame?
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.320]  They blame the Russians.
[37:12.320 --> 37:20.320]  Wall Street Journal, a repeat of what we saw a month ago, two weeks ago, a week ago, three days ago.
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.320]  U.S. officials warn of imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine with tanks, fighter jets and cyber.
[37:26.320 --> 37:35.320]  And Biden says, and Hillary says, well, we'll go to full war with them if somebody claims there's a cyber attack.
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.320]  So you wonder how the left of the global is staying in power?
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.320]  This is it.
[37:41.320 --> 37:48.320]  And now Russia to stage massive nuclear drills amid Ukraine's standoff because they pulled their troops back.
[37:48.320 --> 37:49.320]  They said, stop.
[37:49.320 --> 37:58.320]  And NATO is taking the country right now and pushing ethnic Russians out of the country that have been there since before Ukraine existed.
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.320]  And that's how you start a fight.
[38:01.320 --> 38:10.320]  And so the criminals that have run our governments have got martial law in Europe, martial law in Canada, martial law in all the blue cities.
[38:10.320 --> 38:16.320]  They're maneuvering us towards financial collapse, total devaluation of the currency, borders are wide open.
[38:16.320 --> 38:30.320]  They have left us to the U.S. and Canada marching demanding masks never come off and that masks always stay on children while the teachers go out to parties at night and don't wear the mask because it's about a cult of their power over our children.
[38:30.320 --> 38:47.320]  And now we have a top level Facebook executive who runs a whole division of Facebook caught in a hotel room reportedly thinking he was there to meet a 13-year-old boy.
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.320]  And you look at those zombie eyes.
[38:49.320 --> 38:58.320]  They've all got that weird, just vacant look like they're staring off 50 trillion miles and all they want.
[38:58.320 --> 39:05.320]  They don't even think it's bad is your children.
[39:05.320 --> 39:07.320]  They just want love.
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.320]  They just want to steal your children's innocence and just let them give us your children.
[39:12.320 --> 39:18.320]  The transmission goes, give us them, give us the children, give us the children.
[39:18.320 --> 39:25.320]  And the Wren feels like this guy is like, oh, but the thing behind him is give me children, give me, yes, master and children.
[39:25.320 --> 39:28.320]  And that's it. They always act the same. They always look the same.
[39:28.320 --> 39:35.320]  I've studied these creatures, these blobs and that's who they are.
[39:35.320 --> 39:40.320]  But then you've got the controllers like the Klaus Schwab's and the Prince Charles's up there.
[39:40.320 --> 39:50.320]  Prince Charles pledged himself four months ago to a worldwide war against humanity for depopulation and a worldwide collapse in the Great Reset.
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.320]  And he will be the king of England soon. And I love how he fell down when he went up to the podium.
[39:56.320 --> 40:03.320]  He fell on his face when he walked up to declare war against everybody.
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.320]  That's a real good omen there, Jack.
[40:08.320 --> 40:19.320]  And you and your little Transylvanian crew aren't going to be doing so hot down the road because like all devils, you get your day.
[40:19.320 --> 40:23.320]  We hate you. We know who you are. We reject you.
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.320]  But we don't fight you because we hate you. We fight you because we love our children and love innocence.
[40:28.320 --> 40:39.320]  And we, with God's power, will break you. You will not break us. We will break you.
[40:39.320 --> 40:48.320]  The situation is deteriorating incredibly fast with Russia.
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.320]  Biden reiterates the commitment to attack Russia.
[40:52.320 --> 41:02.320]  If Russia fights back in any way while NATO takes the country over and ethnically kills Russians, ethnically cleanses.
[41:02.320 --> 41:08.320]  So there you go. They kept telling you the war is coming and of course it is. The West has launched it.
[41:08.320 --> 41:15.320]  Everything the left do is a lie. They say Russia is attacking them. They are attacking.
[41:15.320 --> 41:22.320]  And just like that, it happens. Just like that, it happens.
[41:22.320 --> 41:28.320]  Because if Russia pushes back, they get their water war on their distraction. If Russia gives in, they take the whole country.
[41:28.320 --> 41:34.320]  And then they start the infiltration of the Russian borders itself, just like they've done to us.
[41:34.320 --> 41:39.320]  The globalists have lost Russia. They want to retake it.
[41:39.320 --> 41:45.320]  For 85 years, they got to rape the children and put people in gulags and rape your wives and torture.
[41:45.320 --> 41:49.320]  Now they, oh, that's Canada's there now. They brought in their special police.
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.320]  You know, they're UN. The UN everywhere they go, rape and murder.
[41:53.320 --> 41:59.320]  The C-130s land in any country, including Europe, they load those women and children on who've never seen again.
[41:59.320 --> 42:06.320]  They go into the hungry arms of Klaus Schwab.
[42:06.320 --> 42:13.320]  They are. They see us as lower than worms.
[42:13.320 --> 42:21.320]  We are. Meet on the table with them. They devour us because we will not see them for the monsters they are.
[42:21.320 --> 42:27.320]  We will not find God again and pray for guidance and say, I will not be your slave. I will not submit to you.
[42:27.320 --> 42:34.320]  And because we will not wake up to the fact that they are evil, because we won't take the black pill and realize that things are bad,
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.320]  and we got to stop it. They could win. But God won't let that happen.
[42:39.320 --> 42:45.320]  You'll wake up one time or another. And so many of you that serve evil think you're on the winning team.
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.320]  You're pretending you're part of the New World Order.
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.320]  No one is. Not one human that serves Satan is actually part of it. You're all fools. You're all losers.
[42:53.320 --> 42:59.320]  We'll be right back.
[42:59.320 --> 43:10.320]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[43:10.320 --> 43:19.320]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[43:19.320 --> 43:25.320]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[43:25.320 --> 43:34.320]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[43:34.320 --> 43:37.320]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[43:37.320 --> 43:42.320]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[43:42.320 --> 43:51.320]  Like Canada, where they now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[43:51.320 --> 43:59.320]  So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation. Stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[43:59.320 --> 44:08.320]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.320]  and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[44:13.320 --> 44:21.320]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[44:21.320 --> 44:23.320]  That's why they launched their great reset.
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.320]  And their program after collapsing us have built back better.
[44:28.320 --> 44:34.320]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.320]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[44:37.320 --> 44:45.320]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win. They released a biological weapon on us.
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.320]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[44:49.320 --> 44:53.320]  It's that simple. They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.320]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.320]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[45:00.320 --> 45:07.320]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[45:07.320 --> 45:15.320]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[45:15.320 --> 45:21.320]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[45:21.320 --> 45:24.320]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[45:24.320 --> 45:31.320]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[45:31.320 --> 45:33.320]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[45:33.320 --> 45:42.320]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[45:42.320 --> 45:45.320]  They have weather control trees from 1979.
[45:45.320 --> 45:49.320]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[45:49.320 --> 45:56.320]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists wanted Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[45:56.320 --> 46:20.320]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[46:20.320 --> 46:22.320]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[46:22.320 --> 46:31.320]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways.
[46:31.320 --> 46:33.320]  And it will be a chain reaction.
[46:33.320 --> 46:35.320]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[46:35.320 --> 46:36.320]  I have a few ideas.
[46:36.320 --> 46:39.320]  First of all, I'll suggest this one is not farm.
[46:39.320 --> 46:40.320]  Arrest out.
[46:40.320 --> 46:41.320]  Arrest while swab.
[46:41.320 --> 46:42.320]  The vaccine is poison.
[46:42.320 --> 46:43.320]  There's tons of things.
[46:43.320 --> 46:44.320]  I say just keep it short.
[46:44.320 --> 46:45.320]  Keep it concise.
[46:45.320 --> 46:46.320]  No, I agree.
[46:46.320 --> 46:47.320]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.320]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[46:49.320 --> 46:50.320]  Beautiful.
[46:50.320 --> 46:53.320]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected.
[46:53.320 --> 46:54.320]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[46:54.320 --> 46:55.320]  God bless you, Chris.
[46:55.320 --> 46:58.320]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[46:58.320 --> 47:00.320]  Thank you so much.
[47:00.320 --> 47:28.320]  Thank you.
[47:28.320 --> 47:38.320]  And that's true in my experience.
[47:38.320 --> 47:43.320]  But survival is the mother of awakening.
[47:43.320 --> 47:45.320]  We know who the globalist are.
[47:45.320 --> 47:46.320]  We know about their programs.
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.320]  They've been very arrogant about what they've launched.
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.320]  And if we're going to have any future, they're going to have to be stopped.
[47:55.320 --> 48:01.320]  They believe in a cataclysm, they're playing God, where they trigger famine, economic collapse,
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.320]  wars, ethnic cleansing, to be the alpha predator.
[48:07.320 --> 48:14.320]  You can argue in areas where they killed all the wolves in the western part of the United
[48:14.320 --> 48:21.320]  States that there was nothing to keep the deer populations and the elk populations down.
[48:21.320 --> 48:23.320]  So they brought wolves back.
[48:23.320 --> 48:26.320]  But really, hunting could just do that.
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.320]  But when you read what Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote about and the rest of these people,
[48:30.320 --> 48:34.320]  they talk about they are the apex predator.
[48:34.320 --> 48:37.320]  And they come in and announce the world lockdown.
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.320]  And then when millions starve to death, they come and call for more money to the UN,
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.320]  which they then keep for themselves and don't actually feed the children.
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.320]  So they get us coming and going.
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.320]  Now, I'm not a Slava file.
[48:53.320 --> 48:55.320]  I'm not a Serba file, I'm not a Russa file.
[48:55.320 --> 49:01.320]  I'm not an Anglo file, even though I'm part English.
[49:01.320 --> 49:04.320]  Or a German file, a Deutsche file.
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.320]  I'm a guy that follows Christ and tries to be a good person and loves humanity.
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.320]  But I do study how the New World Order operates and how they do the same propaganda over and over again.
[49:13.320 --> 49:20.320]  And if you go back to the 1990s, those two wars in the Balkans,
[49:20.320 --> 49:24.320]  you've got the Croats, you've got the Muslims, you've got the Serbs.
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.320]  And it's on the historical record, it's not debated that both times,
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.320]  Islamic backed and UN backed forces started wars with the Serbs
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.320]  and ended up taking over a third of the Serb lands in the south.
[49:37.320 --> 49:39.320]  And both sides committed atrocities.
[49:39.320 --> 49:49.320]  No one admits that twice as many Serbs were killed as Croats and as Muslims.
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.320]  Now, I'm sure both sides have reasons to hate each other or all the sides.
[49:54.320 --> 49:59.320]  I'm not even picking sides here, but it was the same thing that when the Serbs fought back,
[49:59.320 --> 50:02.320]  well, they were bad.
[50:02.320 --> 50:13.320]  The Serbs holding the Muslims back for a thousand years, right there at Pristina is the line,
[50:13.320 --> 50:19.320]  where for a thousand years they held them until Bill Clinton rained down thousands
[50:19.320 --> 50:25.320]  of depleted uranium bombs on their cities.
[50:25.320 --> 50:32.320]  And so the Serbs didn't have nuclear weapons and they were outnumbered and surrounded
[50:32.320 --> 50:36.320]  and now the ethnic cleansing continued up more into Serbia.
[50:36.320 --> 50:39.320]  And it's the left side, it's wonderful, we're killing Serbs,
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.320]  raping their women, murdering them, oh, it's so liberal.
[50:42.320 --> 50:48.320]  It's that alliance of Klaus Schwab and Christia Freeland saying on Bill Maher,
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.320]  she wants to re-law, she wants our women to be under Muslim control.
[50:51.320 --> 50:55.320]  It's a sick authoritarian fetish.
[50:55.320 --> 51:01.320]  And it goes back to a plan that a member of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire royalty had
[51:01.320 --> 51:05.320]  over a hundred years ago to merge Europe with Islam.
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.320]  And they're following this satanic plan and now she runs Canada as the real Prime Minister.
[51:10.320 --> 51:13.320]  She's a dictator and she works for Klaus Schwab, he's on his board,
[51:13.320 --> 51:19.320]  and she is taking your bank accounts and now has masked unidentified men
[51:19.320 --> 51:24.320]  arresting and attacking and disappearing the peaceful people as we speak.
[51:24.320 --> 51:28.320]  And that will be our fate in every town, every city in America and the world
[51:28.320 --> 51:32.320]  if we don't start saying no and withdrawing our consent
[51:32.320 --> 51:35.320]  and exposing that these are outside powers.
[51:35.320 --> 51:39.320]  Notice they always tell you, oh, you're a Russian if you don't want build back better.
[51:39.320 --> 51:42.320]  You're a foreign agent if you don't want to turn your guns in.
[51:42.320 --> 51:44.320]  You're a foreign agent if you don't want open borders.
[51:44.320 --> 51:50.320]  If you're a part of the Freedom Convoy and don't want Klaus Schwab putting in your body what he wants,
[51:50.320 --> 51:53.320]  then you work for Russia because they're the outside power.
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.320]  The globalists are a multinational corporate attack and if we ever organize
[51:57.320 --> 52:01.320]  that it's an outside attack, whether we're in Serbia or whether we're in Bosnia
[52:01.320 --> 52:04.320]  or whether we're in Mexico, I mean, Mexico's got its problems,
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.320]  but it likes to be its own country and sovereign.
[52:07.320 --> 52:09.320]  Mexico runs its own show pretty much.
[52:09.320 --> 52:14.320]  It's got big problems, but their elites that run it, it's like, this is our thing.
[52:14.320 --> 52:19.320]  The Mexican Socialist President said the vaccines a scam, a power grab, you know,
[52:19.320 --> 52:22.320]  don't go along with it. We don't want the great reset here.
[52:22.320 --> 52:25.320]  We don't want to make our people poor. We don't want to build back better.
[52:25.320 --> 52:29.320]  He says that. You ever see that on the news?
[52:29.320 --> 52:33.320]  All we need is leaders that say, burn in hell to this
[52:33.320 --> 52:37.320]  and the people will get behind saying no to war and no to famine
[52:37.320 --> 52:40.320]  and no to devalued currencies and no to rolling blackouts
[52:40.320 --> 52:42.320]  and no to all this garbage.
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.320]  You think Mexico likes all of Latin America being collapsed
[52:45.320 --> 52:48.320]  when it's the richest country arguably in Latin America?
[52:48.320 --> 52:51.320]  And now everybody's flooding in there.
[52:51.320 --> 52:53.320]  No, Mexico's like, no, we want to work with Trump.
[52:53.320 --> 52:55.320]  Control the borders. This is bad.
[52:55.320 --> 52:57.320]  But Trump's gone.
[52:57.320 --> 53:01.320]  And so now Mexico is collapsing in many areas worse than it was.
[53:01.320 --> 53:06.320]  So that's our fate, ladies and gentlemen, is a failed state.
[53:06.320 --> 53:09.320]  Like Mexico.
[53:09.320 --> 53:12.320]  And that's what's happening in Europe is becoming a failed system.
[53:12.320 --> 53:14.320]  And what does Klaus Schwab say?
[53:14.320 --> 53:17.320]  We're creating a post-industrial world.
[53:17.320 --> 53:19.320]  We're getting rid of the social contract.
[53:19.320 --> 53:21.320]  We're getting rid of civilization.
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.320]  We are going to build back better after we collapse it under Claude Biven.
[53:25.320 --> 53:29.320]  These are fricking statements out of you.
[53:29.320 --> 53:33.320]  And his grandfather was the fourth largest
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.320]  manager of arms for the Nazis.
[53:37.320 --> 53:44.320]  Christia Freeland's father was the direct captain
[53:44.320 --> 53:47.320]  of Joseph Goebbels and ran propaganda
[53:47.320 --> 53:51.320]  in multiple occupied nations under Nazi Germany.
[53:51.320 --> 53:54.320]  Of course she works for Klaus Schwab.
[53:54.320 --> 53:57.320]  What do you think Bilderberg was with Henry Kissinger
[53:57.320 --> 53:59.320]  and the Rothschild and Rockefeller money in World War II?
[53:59.320 --> 54:02.320]  They went and got the whole Nazi intelligence network in Europe
[54:02.320 --> 54:05.320]  and all the stolen loot and let them all stay in charge
[54:05.320 --> 54:09.320]  and then recruited all their kids and put them in charge
[54:09.320 --> 54:13.320]  of every major industry because they were controlled
[54:13.320 --> 54:16.320]  and they would follow orders.
[54:16.320 --> 54:18.320]  It's not a Nazi conspiracy.
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.320]  They use Nazi personnel, 36,000 of them,
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.320]  in one round of the rat line to create NASA,
[54:26.320 --> 54:31.320]  to create the CIA, to create every bit of it.
[54:31.320 --> 54:36.320]  You know, even by the 1970s there were still Nazis
[54:36.320 --> 54:39.320]  in charge of CIA operations.
[54:39.320 --> 54:42.320]  And CIA people I've talked to would walk into a room
[54:42.320 --> 54:45.320]  in Central America or even in East Texas or West Texas
[54:45.320 --> 54:48.320]  and they would walk into a room with a bunch of military people
[54:48.320 --> 54:50.320]  and folks and there would be a fricking famous Nazi
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.320]  given the orders.
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.320]  Because how would an American ever believe that?
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.320]  How would anyone even get that through their head?
[54:59.320 --> 55:01.320]  Because it's so crazy.
[55:01.320 --> 55:04.320]  The king of England was a Nazi in World War II.
[55:04.320 --> 55:08.320]  He advocated.
[55:08.320 --> 55:10.320]  Because they were a professional control group
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.320]  that would follow orders and believed in elites.
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.320]  Yeah, there's the former head of the Nazis'
[55:17.320 --> 55:19.320]  rocket program with President Kennedy.
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.320]  And the other point is, is that people need to stop
[55:21.320 --> 55:23.320]  being so naive about all this
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.320]  and realize who Klaus Schwab is
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.320]  and realize what their goals are
[55:29.320 --> 55:33.320]  and realize these people want to kill you and your family.
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.320]  They want to cut your power off, make you starve,
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.320]  make you come hat in hand to them
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.320]  so you've got to have a medical ID to take into your body
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.320]  whatever they want, whenever they want
[55:41.320 --> 55:43.320]  so you have the privilege of leaving your house
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.320]  or having a job and that's just getting started.
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.320]  And so now we know it's a Western offensive into Ukraine
[55:50.320 --> 55:52.320]  pushing ethnic Russians out
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.320]  trying to elicit a response by Putin.
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.320]  Like we saw in Georgia in 2008.
[55:58.320 --> 56:00.320]  And that's what's happening.
[56:00.320 --> 56:01.320]  We'll come back next hour and get to it.
[56:01.320 --> 56:03.320]  We have the latest on the convoy, the arrest,
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.320]  the disappearances, the paramilitary police.
[56:05.320 --> 56:07.320]  This is just so horrible
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.320]  and we need to pray for all the truck drivers and their families.
[56:09.320 --> 56:11.320]  But we need to know this is being done to elicit.
[56:11.320 --> 56:15.320]  The last thing Schwab wants is a violent confrontation.
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.320]  Separately, we need funding.
[56:17.320 --> 56:19.320]  I don't know how long we'll be on the air,
[56:19.320 --> 56:21.320]  but it could be the last time you can get books or films
[56:21.320 --> 56:23.320]  or t-shirts or storeable food or you name it.
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.320]  And then FullWarStore.com.
[56:25.320 --> 56:27.320]  We could be a nuclear war by tomorrow.
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.320]  Probably not, but I mean, we're in that point.
[56:30.320 --> 56:32.320]  And I would just suggest to all of you to support the broadcast
[56:32.320 --> 56:34.320]  and get great products you need.
[56:34.320 --> 56:37.320]  At the same time, Winter Sun is the highest quality organic
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.320]  vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system.
[56:40.320 --> 56:42.320]  The two go together in synergy.
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.320]  Take it out of the tongue, you get higher absorption
[56:44.320 --> 56:46.320]  and it funds the operation.
[56:46.320 --> 56:49.320]  It's 50% off right now.
[56:49.320 --> 56:51.320]  That's something you can do for health and stamina
[56:51.320 --> 56:53.320]  and for your immune system.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.320]  It's back in stock.
[56:55.320 --> 56:57.320]  Even though I'm going to sell out soon,
[56:57.320 --> 56:59.320]  I'm going to have to stop doing 50% off deals
[56:59.320 --> 57:01.320]  because we can't get supplies.
[57:01.320 --> 57:03.320]  We're still doing a 50% off because you should buy some
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.320]  for yourself and buy some as a gift to give,
[57:05.320 --> 57:07.320]  especially older folks or folks with darker skin
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.320]  to not absorb as much sunlight and make vitamin D.
[57:09.320 --> 57:11.320]  So it's essential.
[57:11.320 --> 57:13.320]  Black folks are twice as likely to die of COVID.
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.320]  They admit major studies is because they don't get any sun
[57:15.320 --> 57:17.320]  or vitamin D.
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.320]  They admit that it funds their operation
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.320]  at infowarstore.com.
[57:21.320 --> 57:23.320]  Winter Sun, infowarstore.com,
[57:23.320 --> 57:25.320]  or AAA 2533139.
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.320]  And it's been sold out for months and months.
[57:27.320 --> 57:29.320]  It's back in stock 40% off.
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.320]  Brainforce Ultra, the incredible
[57:31.320 --> 57:33.320]  Neutropic that hits in 15, 20 minutes
[57:33.320 --> 57:35.320]  and goes away in a few hours.
[57:35.320 --> 57:37.320]  That's why I like it.
[57:37.320 --> 57:39.320]  It's something I use in the afternoon or at night when I'm tired
[57:39.320 --> 57:41.320]  because I can still go to sleep on it.
[57:41.320 --> 57:43.320]  Unlike the Turbophores, it's 10 hours of incredible energy.
[57:43.320 --> 57:45.320]  They're all different formulas.
[57:45.320 --> 57:47.320]  And they fund the resistance.
[58:15.320 --> 58:17.320]  They're in lifetime revision.
[58:17.320 --> 58:19.320]  Suppressing voices
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.320]  of good people all around the world
[58:21.320 --> 58:23.320]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[58:23.320 --> 58:25.320]  that are exposing
[58:25.320 --> 58:27.320]  all their lies, their COVID
[58:27.320 --> 58:29.320]  and strain, and their world's going to end in 2030,
[58:29.320 --> 58:31.320]  carbon tax, global warming
[58:31.320 --> 58:33.320]  and bull all of it.
[58:33.320 --> 58:35.320]  And none of it can succeed.
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.320]  None of it can actually be carried out
[58:37.320 --> 58:39.320]  unless everybody is silenced
[58:39.320 --> 58:41.320]  and gas lit.
[58:41.320 --> 58:43.320]  And that's why truth comes
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.800]  diligence. And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[58:47.800 --> 58:50.520]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[58:50.520 --> 58:56.040]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[58:56.040 --> 59:01.440]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[59:01.440 --> 59:06.560]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[59:06.560 --> 59:12.600]  you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting
[59:12.600 --> 59:16.520]  your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[59:16.520 --> 59:21.120]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody
[59:21.120 --> 59:26.880]  should visit InfowarsStore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in
[59:26.880 --> 59:33.400]  America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible. It's a 360 win. Protect
[59:33.400 --> 59:38.880]  your privacy and shop at Infowars to support the overall Infowar against the globalist,
[59:38.880 --> 59:44.960]  a true 360 win. Get your Faraday Cages at InfowarsStore.com. Check out the new line.
[59:44.960 --> 59:48.960]  It's amazing.
[59:48.960 --> 1:00:08.920]  To be clear, a state of war has been taking place since ethnic cleansing began eight years
[1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:13.760]  ago in Ukraine, but now Western forces are accelerating the Russian border with artillery
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:21.120]  attacks. War has already begun. I used to give out my phone number. Can't do that anymore.
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:28.800]  They don't even allow me to have a phone anymore. Not only you worry your child may die, but
[1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:34.920]  you're stripped of your dignity. You're stripped of your sense of who you are, not being able
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:43.920]  to afford that child's needs. I was a cancer moonshot, which I worked very hard on in the
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:51.640]  administration. The administration I served in last. And meanwhile, Biden then addressed
[1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:57.680]  the country with flagrant, desperate propaganda attempting to keep the doomed New World Order
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:05.840]  narrative going. And invasion remains distinctly possible. That's why I've asked several times
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:12.800]  that all Americans in Ukraine leave now before it's too late to leave safely. If Russia decides
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:18.280]  to invade, that would also have consequences here at home. But the American people understand
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:22.920]  that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost. And if Russia attacks the United
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:28.520]  States or our allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:34.400]  or critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond. We're moving in lockstep with
[1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:40.760]  our NATO allies and partners to deepen our collective defense against threats in cyberspace.
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:45.880]  I will not pretend this will be painless. There could be impact on our energy prices.
[1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:52.880]  So as the economy tanks and gas prices shoot past historic records, Putin opened to deploy
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:57.840]  diplomacy, ordered the withdrawal of troops while the Russian Federation's side of the
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:03.360]  story was spun out of control. Unfortunately, seven years down the road, we are increasingly
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:09.320]  thinking that the implementation of the Minsk agreements is not something that's in the
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:14.120]  plans of our Ukrainian neighbors. Biden's handlers at the United Nations have been given
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:19.880]  their marching orders. Their masters require a world war to feed the dwindling spending
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:25.560]  of defense departments and the reaping of war profits. Russia plans to manufacture a
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:32.560]  pretext for its attack. This could be a violent event that Russia will blame on Ukraine or
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:37.280]  an outrageous accusation that Russia will level against the Ukrainian government. We
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:41.640]  don't know exactly the form it will take. It could be a fabricated so-called terrorist
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:48.200]  bombing inside Russia. The invented discovery of a mass grave. A staged drone strike against
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:55.600]  civilians. Or a fake, even a real attack using chemical weapons.
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:01.840]  So we are concerned that Russia is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:09.400]  Ukraine. And we also know that there are many Russian intelligence officers operating in
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:19.280]  Ukraine. They are present in Donbas. And we have seen attempts to stage a pretext, false
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:27.040]  flag operations to provide an excuse for invading Ukraine.
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:31.080]  So Biden and company will unleash the beast no matter what.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:36.040]  The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving toward an imminent invasion. This
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:40.480]  week, the Russian government said that it would withdraw troops from the border, from
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:45.840]  the Ukraine border. And they received a lot of attention for that claim, but here and
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:53.080]  around the world. But we know that is absolutely false, which you've heard us say from coming
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:57.680]  from our administration. In fact, we have now confirmed that in the last several days,
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:03.760]  Russia has increased its troops presence along the Ukraine border by as many as 7,000 troops
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:08.320]  with some arriving in the past 24 hours. This is cause of serious concerns.
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:11.680]  How high is the threat of a Russian invasion right now?
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:19.160]  It's very high. It's very high because they have not moved any of their troops out. They've
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:25.880]  moved more troops in. Number one, number two, we have reason to believe that they are engaged
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:29.320]  in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in.
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:35.920]  We are now experiencing Gulf of Tonk in 2022, using reports of an exchange of live fire
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:41.320]  between Ukrainian and Russian forces and a supposed shelling of a kindergarten in the
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:46.880]  Luhansk region of Ukraine to fuel the false flag projections.
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:53.400]  It is United Nations New World Order tool and compromised criminal President Joe Biden.
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:05:00.400]  That is the aggressor, and he must be stopped before millions die needlessly to...
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:13.040]  Harness the power of the sun. Harness the life giving energy of this incredible engine
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:20.440]  that God gave us. Wherever you are, wherever you go, 365 days out of the year, whether it's
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:25.800]  in the dead of the deep, dark, cold winter or the blazing hot summer, everyone does better
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:31.200]  and is healthier with an extra dose of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are essential for your
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:35.480]  immunity. And now that people understand that, it's important to act on that information.
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:41.200]  We have the highest quality vitamin D3 cold winter sun with vitamin K at m4works store.com.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:46.280]  And right now, it's 50% off. So harness the power of the sun for yourself, your friends,
[1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.880]  your family today. The globalist are fighting us to press this information. So it's key
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:55.560]  to let others know about the power of the sun. Harnessed in vitamin D3 inside winter sun
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.880]  at m4works store.com.
[1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:17.880]  But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Don't bother there here.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:22.120]  Well, this morning, I wrote a headline just about an hour and a half ago that isn't strong
[1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:30.240]  enough now. It was that Putin was warning the situation as it charioted very, very quickly.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:34.040]  Globalist forces launched major offensive in eastern Ukraine as Putin warned situation
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:42.160]  to charioting quickly. Watch live. Well, now massive shelling and attacks as NATO pushes
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:49.240]  an offensive into eastern Ukraine up to the Russian border. The Russians have announced
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:54.480]  an evacuation of Russian speaking citizens of the 90 plus percent of the people there.
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:59.440]  And it's all a provocation to get Putin to fight back. But if Putin fights back, they
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:03.560]  get a wider war and a good political distraction. But if they don't fight back, they get to
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:07.880]  go ahead and clear out the Russians. And then next will be, of course, the main Russian
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:15.720]  military base there on the Black Sea in the south of Ukraine.
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:22.560]  So this is how World War Start. Biden to speak to nation as crisis of Russia over Ukraine
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:28.280]  escalates. It's now being reported bleak. New intelligence assessment driving new urgency
[1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:33.640]  from Biden administration on Russia. So the West has launched its offensive if Russia
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.040]  doesn't fight back. They say that Russia has launched an attack. If Russia doesn't fight
[1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:47.520]  back, the globalists win and take control of those Russian held areas and enable turn
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:57.400]  towards the last Russian enclave that is not under globalist control in the south of Ukraine.
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:03.560]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen. I'll continue to watch this very, very closely.
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:09.080]  As the globalists attempt their next leg of the Great Reset, at bare minimum, a major
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.640]  European theater full on war with the second largest military in the world.
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:24.600]  Arthur Poplowski, son, is joining us here. We can't talk to the well-known pastor and
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:29.040]  preacher because he's been arrested for keeping his church open. You've seen that footage
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:37.680]  last year. And now Nathaniel is here to speak for his father, who has been arrested for
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:49.520]  praying with the truckers. And they are announcing in the news that he's been denied bail. He'll
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:58.360]  be held until his hearing on March 11. Other folks being arrested in Ottawa by the paramilitary
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:02.840]  police are also not being charged. They're not saying what they're charged with, they're
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:07.360]  just disappearing. Another hallmark of tyranny.
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:11.560]  Also Trudeau put out another order, got it right here, that any leftist group is allowed
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:16.960]  to protest anywhere at any time. He lists Black Lives Matter, Islamic groups, any Communist
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.880]  Party, there's a whole list. Only the communists are allowed, only the Soros people are allowed
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:29.520]  on the streets. We're showing footage to TV viewers of the police arresting the peaceful
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:34.240]  leaders of the demonstration for walking down the street because they would not follow orders
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:41.040]  to tell people to leave. True thought crime come to our northern partner, the beautiful
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:43.520]  country of Canada that has fallen.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:49.040]  So Nathaniel Pulaski, your dad warned of this over a year ago on my show, and now he's
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:52.840]  a political prisoner. How are you handling it? How is your father doing? And what do
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:56.160]  you make of the situation there in your once great nation?
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:03.200]  Well, thanks for having me on. And yeah, it's crazy what's happening in Canada. It seems
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:10.920]  like Trudeau is ramping up, silencing all political opposition. As you saw in that video,
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:16.040]  the trucker organizers, the trucker convoy to Ottawa, the organizers have been arrested.
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:22.520]  My dad, Pastor Arthur, one of the leading voices opposing this tyranny has been arrested.
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:28.760]  He was arrested on February the 8th for giving a speech for doing his job as a pastor, giving
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:36.520]  hope and motivating the truckers on February the 3rd. And he was arrested under three criminal
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:46.080]  charges, and he has been denied bail, quite, as claims that he is a danger to society.
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:52.520]  So what's going on in our once beautiful, free Canada is absolutely disgusting. It's
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:57.920]  deplorable. The state of our justice system, the state of our politics, it's really goes
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:04.480]  to show what this is all about. It's not about safety or health or public health. It's all
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:12.840]  about tyranny. It's about bringing in a dictatorship, a totalitarian regime. It's been tough on
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:18.840]  the family, seeing that someone who's innocent is being held behind bars in such horrible
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:23.840]  conditions treated worse than a gangster, than a murder. I mean, I've heard of murderers
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:29.560]  and rapists being granted bail. And this pastor, he's the danger to society and he's
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:34.560]  the danger to society.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:50.000]  Yeah, exactly. So criminals are allowed out, but pastors know they have to stay behind
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.120]  bars. Our mainstream media and the crown prosecutor alleged that he incited violence,
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:01.440]  and twice in that speech that he gave to the truckers, he said he's talking about a peaceful,
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:06.880]  nonviolent resolution. Twice he mentioned that in his speech, and they still published the
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:13.520]  lie that he incited violence. So they're making stuff up. He's become a political prisoner
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:19.160]  in Canada because of his strong voice, his opposition to this tyranny, and they don't
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:22.920]  want to let him out. They know that these are trumped up charges. Anyone see that these
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:27.880]  are made up charges that won't stick. So the only way that they can get revenge on him,
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.200]  because this is a vendetta, I mean, he embarrassed them on a global scale. He has been exposing
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.280]  them on a global scale. So they want to get revenge. They want to hurt him. They want
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:41.360]  to silence this pastor. So the only way they can do that is to deny him bail and keep him
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:42.360]  behind bars.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:49.440]  Is he even able to speak to folks? Because I know that the peaceful leaders of the Ottawa
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.000]  event have been disappeared. Now he showed that footage earlier. Have you been able to
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.560]  talk to your father and how are his spirits?
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:02.600]  He's standing strong. So we do get a phone call for him roughly once a day. If the guards
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:07.760]  are nice, then they'll allow him to call twice a day. He's standing strong. He won't let
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:18.640]  this break him. He thanks everyone for their support, for continuing the fight, for holding
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:24.240]  the line. So he's standing strong. They're treating him horribly. He says the first few
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:29.720]  days they were essentially torturing him. They denied him water for an extended period
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:35.960]  of time. They placed them in an iron cage, like a tiny, what he described as a dog kennel.
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:39.880]  They were flipping the lights on and off, so they're not letting him sleep. They placed
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:44.840]  them on a hard bench for hours without a mattress. So they were really trying to hurt him.
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:49.320]  Now, they're the ones that are putting themselves in a prison with the devil. They're the ones
[1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:54.960]  that we should be sorry for because the dishonour of these people is legendary and is so sad
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:59.320]  what they're doing to their own families in future. This is really so sad.
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:05.840]  Yeah, absolutely. It's sad that we're allowing this to happen also because my dad represents
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:12.040]  millions of people worldwide who care about freedom, who care about religious liberties.
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:16.200]  He represents millions of people who just want to live their lives in peace. So if we
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:25.160]  allow this to happen to a pastor of all people, as he says, often, for me, they'll come for
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:30.880]  you. Be sure of it. If you allow this to happen in a free and democratic society, then a precedent
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:33.560]  will be set and they will do this to everyone.
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:37.160]  Well, that's it. The cover was the virus and Klaus Schwab wanted martial law in all the
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:40.680]  countries and the freeze bank accounts. He said it and Trudeau's done it and they knew
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.400]  they kept you locked down enough. They kept you locked down for two years, wouldn't let
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.120]  you drive, tried to put a poison in you. So finally, folks peacefully stood up and now
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:51.200]  they declared martial law and now they're purging the good police and creating their
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:55.160]  army of bad police and they're hoping for a shooting war, which they believe they're
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:15:00.200]  going to win. How do you think we make it out of this just with Jesus and with nonviolent
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:03.560]  civil disobedience like your father has shown us?
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:10.600]  Yes, with God, we win. And as my dad, this is why they're so scared of him. My dad
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:16.120]  message is very simple. Civil disobedience, peaceful noncompliance, peaceful resistance
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:23.200]  like civil rights movement, like Mahatma Gandhi, like solidarity in Poland behind Iron Curtain.
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:29.040]  That's how you win this with peaceful noncompliance with God on our side and on the right side
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:34.120]  of history. We are on the right side of history. And if we keep pushing, if we keep fighting,
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:38.160]  if we do not bend the knee, eventually we will win this. We just have to stand our ground.
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:41.920]  I agree in all the polls show that Trudeau is totally hated now and destroyed in his
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:45.600]  own party. For people that don't know, he only won by 30 percent. That's how Parliamentary
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:50.200]  Systems got Hitler and you had 30 some percent as well. And this is the guy that says he
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:54.360]  wants to be a dictator. So he's going to escalate to get himself out of this. And this is going
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:59.200]  to be Klaus Schwab's Waterloo when we take his man down.
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:06.640]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:12.800]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:19.000]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.400]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:32.080]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:37.520]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:42.120]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada,
[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:48.320]  where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:52.920]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:17:00.280]  serious situation. And stay tuned into infowars.com because Trudeau is absolutely bare-mount.
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.400]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.200]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com. Before
[1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:16.040]  I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to get
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:21.080]  going. You know, besides the energy Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:25.920]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:30.480]  for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:36.880]  day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:41.800]  for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and
[1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:46.520]  extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:51.920]  the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news Turbo Force
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:56.320]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:23.280]  you moving and feeling great at any age. From the words of Chuck Paulinik's fight club,

[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:08.320]  stones to leading a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:13.360]  enough in your system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:18.480]  vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:23.300]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:29.040]  contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:34.040]  variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:39.400]  after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:44.120]  know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:49.240]  everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:53.720]  affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it
[1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:59.600]  out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:13.120]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:17.680]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. David Ike is joining us to talk about all the insanity
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:23.320]  in the world, war with Russia and more. And then, you know, I told the crew that I wasn't
[1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:27.440]  going to come in tomorrow and do an emergency Saturday show but now this war is so imminent
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:32.640]  it's already expanding. I'm going to come in, it may go live, I may tape, I'll let you
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:37.120]  know by the end of the show today. I've just got a lot to do personally and a lot of business
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:40.720]  to take care of to keep this operation going. I'm not complaining but we spent a lot of
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:44.720]  our time just getting the funding and keeping the wheels rolling around here. So I really
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:50.720]  appreciate your support at infowarsore.com but when you talk about a hero, when you
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:57.240]  talk about somebody that needs to be a model for everybody, if more people were like Arthur
[1:20:57.240 --> 1:21:03.960]  Pulaski we would not be in this bad situation. In fact more people were just 10% like him.
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:13.240]  And nothing good we have came free folks. And they have created this horrible nanny state
[1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:17.520]  that literally said churches have to stay closed in Canada but the topless bars can
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:25.720]  be open and now they've arrested him for giving a sermon. For his thoughts, for his speech
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.720]  that is thought crime. This is North Korea and they are establishing a North Korean state
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:38.280]  in Canada. His son Nathaniel Pulaski joins us and it's just amazing under the civil
[1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:47.720]  emergency to hold your father until March 11th without bail, without bond for thought
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:52.520]  crime and we aired his speech here on the show back when he gave it to the drugers about
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:56.200]  following their conscience and standing up for what's right and when we saw black people
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:00.080]  with white people and others say no to being told they had to sit at the back of a bus
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:04.400]  or no they couldn't go to a restaurant and order food, they had to go to the back window
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:08.000]  and get it out. Now we're told unvaccinated you've got to go to the back window. It's
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.480]  the same crap again and oh you can't come in the restaurant or oh you can't be on the
[1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:17.320]  bus, period. It's wrong. And it's particularly black folks around the U.S. that see that
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:21.120]  they're the main group getting arrested in places like L.A. and New York. Like over 90%
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:25.600]  of those getting arrested are black. Refusing to take the damn shot. They're not stupid.
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:30.800]  So this is pure evil. 101 by people claiming they're the left. Trudeau's calling everybody
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:35.160]  racist that don't agree with them but even the liberal party I've seen the videos are
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:40.560]  countering him and saying you're full of crap. He charged the conservative Jewish caucus
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:47.080]  small group in parliament of being Nazis. I mean this is preposterous and where do you
[1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:53.960]  see this going Nathaniel? Freepastorart.com, streetchurch.ca. I know this is going to be
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:58.160]  used to magnify Christ. I know that he now doesn't just reach thousands a week as he
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:02.760]  did at his several churches but now he reaches millions a week. So we salute your father.
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:06.400]  We all should pray for your father right now. But in the six minutes we have left what else
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:10.400]  would you like to add to the listeners about the situation happening in your country that
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:12.760]  is such a great concern?
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:18.080]  Well, we can't allow this to happen. We can't let them get away with this because if we
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:24.000]  do then they'll do this to everyone. So my dad is like the tip of the spear but this
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.680]  will apply to everyone if we allow this to happen. So what we're doing is we're going
[1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:33.760]  to apply political pressure on the Canadian government to stop doing this because he has
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:38.640]  not stood trial. What happened to the notion innocent until proven guilty? What happened
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.800]  to due process? He's being punished for something he has not been convicted of.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:46.680]  Well, this is martial law. This is they disappear political prisoners and don't let them out
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:49.160]  on bail. That's martial law.
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:57.600]  Yeah, exactly. So what we're going to do is if you go to freepastorart.com you can sign
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:04.840]  up and look for in your area there's going to be protests at Canadian embassies and consulates
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:09.720]  to show your discontent with what's going on in your neighbors to the north because
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:14.000]  they cannot get away with this. They cannot just subdue the people. The politicians are
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.400]  panicking right now. So they're cracking down on their citizens and declaring martial law
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.320]  and silencing political opposition. So we cannot let them get away with this. If you
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:31.920]  go to freepastorart.com you can join a peaceful protest vigil at Canadian embassies and consulates
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:36.800]  all around the country to stop this tyranny. That's right. The police are going around
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:40.640]  handing out notices even to businesses and coming to people's homes outside the city
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:45.560]  saying we saw you're on Facebook or Twitter that you support the protest. Well, this is
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:51.520]  now a banned protest, but leftist groups are allowed to protest. Let me show that live footage
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:25:00.040]  of one of the streets where hundreds of police are massing in groups and preparing to start
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:04.640]  going after these people. This is just absolutely outrageous. And I'm going to say this because
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:07.840]  I'm not in Canada and I'm not somebody that asks people to do things that I'm not going
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:12.600]  to do. But I know if I was in Canada and I'd been on the fence about this, I think everybody
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:18.440]  in Canada should peacefully go to Ottawa now and should start just outside this, peacefully
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:23.480]  surround the paramilitary police that are attacking and going after peaceful people inside so
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:28.480]  that everything basically gets shut down. This is the front lines of human liberty. This
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:33.480]  is so important. This is so historic. This is Berlin wall level stuff that we're facing
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:40.560]  here and I hope everybody will just go there peacefully and just as media as observers
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:45.280]  document what's happening. You're not going to be part of the demonstration, but go there.
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:51.040]  I mean, look at this. Tell us who are these gentlemen in all of Drabb?
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:26:00.400]  Well, they look like the Ontario police service, but they're basically soldiers. This is martial
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:06.880]  law that they've declared on us and this is basically the terrorist squad. They've sent
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:15.680]  in the best trained soldiers to subdue the people to make sure that they go home. They're
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:20.640]  trying to scare us. And Trudeau has called any Canadians that want to peacefully demonstrate
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:29.360]  he said are terrorists. They've used terrorism provisions called us misogynist, racist terrorists
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:34.640]  because the truth is they have nothing on us. We're just peaceful freedom loving Canadians
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:39.040]  who want our rights and freedoms back. That's it. So he has to call us names. The famous
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:43.520]  lie about us because that's their tactics. That's the taxes tactics of the communists
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:47.840]  of the fascist. And that's what that's what my dad grew up under. That's why he is one
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:52.320]  of the loudest voices about this because he saw this growing up behind the iron curtain
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:55.760]  and he sees it unfolding today. History is repeating itself.
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:27:02.440]  Well, I knew the jig was up last year whenever Biden stuck a self in 11, 12 months ago and
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:06.640]  they immediately said any protesting lockdowns is terror. We're going to seize your funds
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.400]  and take you. Of course, they hadn't implemented it yet, but they announced it clearly. They
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:13.720]  were going to do more lockdowns. Clearly that was their plan, but they knew the US wouldn't
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:19.160]  go along. So they're using Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Austria as the beta test.
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:26.200]  It's just wild. Yes, that's exactly right. And now we've shown them that they can get
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:31.680]  away with this. That's why the people now more than ever have to resist, have to peacefully
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:36.600]  not apply and show them that they cannot do this to their own people because if we let
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:43.560]  them do this, this will spread globally. Tyranny is spreading globally and we got to stop this.
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:50.280]  We have to rise up, stand up and keep fighting. Nathaniel Poloski, freepastorart.com, streetchurch.c.
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:55.760]  Everybody should share that link. I bet you're proud though of your father. Yes, yes, of
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:28:01.560]  course. He's a beacon of hope and he is one of the front runners of freedom and he is
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:06.040]  showing the world right now that despite there being consequences, we cannot give up. We
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:10.720]  have to keep fighting because in the end we will win. Well, we're very, very proud of
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:14.080]  your father and obviously they put him in the cage and did all that to him trying to
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:17.360]  make him get mad so they could beat him up and he was smart and didn't let him do that.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:22.240]  And I would imagine he's stronger than ever in Christ inside that political prison, isn't
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:27.840]  he? Yes, yes, he is. He's standing strong. He's actually fasting. He's on this 11th day
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:34.840]  of fasting in prison and he is stronger than ever. Well, I think next there should be a
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:40.840]  demonstration. Where is he? A peaceful demonstration. Where is he being held? So actually, we're
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:44.840]  there every day. We're at the Calgary Reman Center, which is the prison that he's being
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.120]  held in and we are there every single day at 7 p.m. protesting and letting them know
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.480]  that they cannot do this to a pastor in Canada. Absolutely. This is North Korea. Come to North

[1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:09.480]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:17.120]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe, but the injection is not ready
[1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:27.120]  yet. And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can. I
[1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:35.280]  also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:42.160]  way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:50.880]  only I own. Profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special

[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:07.760]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:17.760]  Coming out alive, out alive, out alive.
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:24.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:42.440]  It's a live source of information, 50,000 unstoppable watts, interests, and radio, and
[1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:43.440]  the car.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:49.080]  The only reason we're still alive on air and the only reason we are millions and millions
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:58.280]  of unstoppable watts just in AM and FM stations around the world is because of you. What have
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:06.000]  I told you? World governments making its move, not out of strength, but out of weakness.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:13.480]  And now that the thermonuclear war clock is two minutes to midnight, David Ipe, the most
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:19.920]  prolific individual, the trailblazer, the most accurate person. You know, you see the bumper
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:26.840]  stickers everywhere. Alex Jones was right. Well, David Ipe was right first. Truly prophetic.
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:31.560]  We're honored to have him here with us for the next, I don't know, 70, 80 minutes as
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:36.720]  long as he can stay with us to talk about the Russia crisis, the ongoing escalation
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:41.720]  there. Are the globalists backing off the COVID tyranny? China and what it's doing,
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:48.320]  so many things. And then tons of executives busted in pedophile stings, including the
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:54.280]  number four person at Facebook, flying to Indiana to have sex with a 13-year-old boy,
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:59.800]  he believed. This is the head of the metaverse. I mean, it's just all coming out. The Queen
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.960]  of England preparing to advocate, and I guess hand things over to Charles, they're saying,
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:11.080]  just an insane time in the world, a major point of inflection. David Ipe, of course,
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:15.120]  is something author and researcher, David Ipe.com. He has a great channel on band.video as well
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:21.760]  and iconic.com. What would you call this moment in history and time and why are so many changes
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:26.040]  happening so quickly? I would guess you'd say, as you predicted 20 years ago, that by
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:30.720]  this time we would see the emergence of the new world order no longer hiding itself. Are
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:38.600]  we seeing the emergence, David Ipe? Yes, we are, but we're also seeing the pushback
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:48.160]  against it and the gathering awareness that it exists. You can only manipulate under the
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:55.680]  radar for so long, and you can do it for a long time if they have, where the events in
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:01.880]  the world don't seem to have a common theme, they don't seem to have a common thread, but
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:08.400]  there comes a point where what you have been manipulating in the shadows to create in terms
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:15.680]  of a transformation of human society has to break the surface where you can see it, or
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:22.640]  human society is not going to change. This is the position we're in now, where since
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:32.800]  the COVID card was played, they've walked into the room and ever more so, and the more
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:37.600]  they move along towards this end game, the more cards that are going to be played, the
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:44.520]  more things they're going to try to give us to have to respond to and react to and understand.
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:51.080]  It's going to get rat-a-tat machine gun numbers of things that are going to be happening.
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:37:01.080]  I said back in the late 90s that one of the big parts of this plan, they can pull it off,
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:09.600]  was to have a war between the West and a alliance of Russia and China with countries like Iran
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:24.640]  thrown in, because the idea is that China wins that war, and the blueprint for the global
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:34.080]  dystopian or Wellean state is China. If you look at what happened after the COVID story
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:43.400]  broke in China, the West has become more and more like China, not least the technological
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:51.920]  surveillance and the technological tracking, etc. That's the blueprint. I've said before
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:57.640]  that this global cult that I talk about is behind all this, that's orchestrating events
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:04.640]  in all these different countries that's running Canada currently, they were behind the Mao
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:15.440]  Revolution. The idea was to create a closed society within which a position of total control,
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:25.000]  but a method of mass human control, not least with technology, could be incubated and could
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:32.360]  be perfected. The idea was that once that had happened, you play it out across the world,
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:36.320]  because that's your blueprint for the world. I've said for years and years and years, if
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:41.880]  you want to see what they want for the West tomorrow, then look at China today. What we're
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:51.040]  seeing, Alex, quite demonstrably, it couldn't be more obvious, is the systematic dismantling
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:39:02.360]  of American society through the southern border just being wide open, through the extraordinary
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:08.120]  financial implications of what's been happening in the COVID years, and the extraordinary
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:15.080]  levels of inflation that are coming through. All these different things are being brought
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:25.120]  together to dismantle American society. The idea is that the Chinese part of the world
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:32.560]  becomes the dominant global force. Because you've got this global cult, which is like
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:39.320]  this global web of secret societies, semi-secret groups, et cetera, working in all these different
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:46.720]  countries. This is why you've got Schwab, the world economic forum, school graduates
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:53.280]  in Canada, in Freeland, the deputy prime minister, and Trudeau, the prime minister. Freeland,
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:58.800]  the deputy prime minister, is on the board of trustees of the world economic forum. Schwab
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:05.000]  and the WAF are running this whole deal in Canada, but they're running the whole deal
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  in America. People have said over the years, why are these American corporations making
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:22.520]  decisions that are obviously damaging to American jobs, American economy by outsourcing all this
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:30.840]  stuff to China and the Far East? People say, why is the American government doing this when
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:37.560]  it's obviously going to benefit China? Why is the American government importing vast
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:43.920]  numbers of COVID tests from bloody China? Why are they doing that?
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:50.360]  Why are they cutting off Russian pipelines and US pipelines, but letting China open pipelines?
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:53.800]  Making this grease towards China being preeminent.
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:41:01.640]  Yeah. So it starts to make sense when you realize that this cult, which is operating
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:06.640]  out of China, it's one of its major global centers. Obviously, it's a global cult. It's
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:11.680]  not just China, but that's a real major center now because they've developed the blueprint
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:16.800]  there for the world. But they also are controlling the Biden administration. They're controlling
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:23.160]  the administrations in Europe, and therefore decisions are being made by these Western
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:29.520]  governments that benefit China because you've got to see the cult level of this and not
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:34.160]  just in terms of national governments because they're just bloody pawns. I mean, we're seeing
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:40.280]  now in Canada, Trudeau is not running that. He's just a little boy in short trousers doing
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:42.280]  what he's told.
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:48.040]  Well, that's right. And we've got Klaus Schwab and Christia Freeland, who's on the board
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:54.240]  of the Davos Group in Bilderberg bragging that they own Trudeau. We're going to break
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:00.760]  in one minute, but David, why do they love to brag? They've gone from hiding it to bragging.
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:10.080]  Well, you know, they do have an incredible level of arrogance, but you know, a lot of
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:16.880]  it's whistling in the dark because they know that they're dealing with 8 billion people
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.640]  getting on for. And the number of people in full knowledge of what they're doing, and
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:29.880]  you add to that, you know, a great deal of the gophers and the others that are working
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:35.440]  with them, often not even knowing what they're working for, but you're still talking tiny,
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:44.360]  tiny numbers. And therefore, anytime enough people want to wake up and stand up, then
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:50.400]  there's nothing they can do. So if you look at what's happening in Canada now, let's
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:53.880]  talk about Canada. You read my mind. That's where I want to go next, where they're starting
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:59.520]  the roundups and arrests right now with David. I stay with us. Mike in California. Thanks
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:00.520]  for calling.
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.720]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research. Now, if you
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.840]  read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function deliberative
[1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:15.640]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:20.440]  of MERS and SARS viruses. There's nothing about SARS like viruses. And it's a research
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:24.560]  funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a four
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:28.240]  way intersection, there's the stops sign, you stop, you look both ways and then you
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:32.840]  proceed. And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:37.360]  of function. But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:41.320]  research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:44.320]  know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know, that's why he
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:48.000]  didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.360]  new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But in the main definition, it's
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:56.960]  still a gain of function for making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:58.800]  Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:05.720]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:12.120]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:17.920]  study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:23.840]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say,
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:28.080]  the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral Commission,
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.800]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.840]  10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:42.760]  exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public. It's former head, still on the steering committee,
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:48.880]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the race reset in global government. And if, as a liberty
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:53.520]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:57.320]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat
[1:44:57.320 --> 1:45:02.960]  them easily. I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:08.120]  concerts. I like going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:13.880]  life. I like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:19.840]  is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:24.120]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:27.400]  out to the woods, just trying to go get a piece of property in the woods and just get
[1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.520]  off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival
[1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:35.080]  instinct. But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:39.840]  me says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says, get the hell out
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:44.240]  of anywhere that ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:49.640]  struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:54.480]  at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the
[1:45:54.480 --> 1:46:01.480]  best ones at m4warstore.com experience the next level and high powered energy new tropics

[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:16.800]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:25.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with the iconic David
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:33.400]  Dink riding shotgun with us during this incredibly historic time. The bedrock of people being
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:39.160]  able to peacefully demonstrate his sank or sank to the West. It's the hallmark of tyranny
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:44.280]  that's curtailed. And now in Canada, we're watching Twitter, we're watching Instagram,
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:48.960]  but they are jamming the cell phones. They did start arresting last night. The leaders
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:52.800]  of the peaceful demonstrations and their reports are pouring in right now. We're posting them
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:58.040]  at m4store.com as they come in to the live show feed that they are now. Yeah, here's
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:04.360]  footage breaking out the windows of people's vehicles dragging away, taking their children.
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:13.520]  They are paramilitary with loaded firearms, pointing guns at people, dragging people away.
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:17.080]  It's just amazing. While saying the left can demonstrate and do whatever they want. Here's
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:21.400]  like any authoritarian movement, same thing in Australia and New Zealand. They are randomly
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:29.080]  picking people and dragging them away and disappearing them. This is not the dress rehearsal
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:35.160]  for tyranny. This is the takeover ahead of the organized world financial collapse and
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:39.920]  the new digital global currency based on G.G. Ping's social credit score that they admit
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:43.840]  they are rolling out. I've got the Davos groups documents right here while David's talking.
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:49.800]  I'll be showing those. But this is the footage coming out, ladies and gentlemen. And I just
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:56.360]  think Canadians should peacefully go there as observers, as independent press and show
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:01.480]  what is now happening. David, you were getting into this during the break. This is now coming
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:08.000]  out as we speak footage coming out. The live feeds are cut, but folks are going back to
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.680]  other areas and uploading what's happening. This is not North Korea. This is not Nazi
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:21.120]  Germany. This is not Soviet Russia. This is Canada. David, what is this all really about?
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:29.120]  Well it's Nazi Canada. And you know what we're seeing, Alex, is what's always been there.
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:34.720]  You see, they don't want to put themselves on public display through all these years
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.680]  of manipulating under the radar. They want to tell you that it's a democracy and that
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:47.400]  you're electing your government and that the government is serving you. But in the background,
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:57.800]  the whole time and gathering more and more has been this global cold web which has grasped
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:04.920]  and sees control of everything. It sees control of governments via puppet politicians like
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:13.640]  Trudeau. It sees control long ago indeed in terms of the modern version. It created the
[1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:23.560]  world economic system. It's got to the point now through these fantastic asset management
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:30.960]  operations like BlackRock and Vanguard and Fidelity Investments and State Street where
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:41.440]  they are holding assets and investment possibilities of so many trillions of dollars that they are
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:49.640]  dictating to the corporations, even major ones, how they run and what they do and how
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:58.160]  they act. And so something like GoFundMe, when they get told you're not giving that
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:03.520]  money to the truckers, they don't give that money to the truckers. And because they also
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:11.560]  control the courts, when they go to the courts to ask for permission to freeze trucker accounts,
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:19.520]  you know they're going to get it. They own the drug regulatory agencies. So you know
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:27.160]  when Pfizer and Moderna go and ask permission to fake vaccinate and damage and kill more
[1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:32.400]  people of younger age groups, you know that eventually, if not immediately, going to get
[1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:33.400]  it.
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.640]  Man, this is so surreal, David, just to interrupt you. For TV viewers, you can see it, radio
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:42.480]  listeners. This is paramilitary police, people in black uniforms, green uniforms, peacefully
[1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:48.280]  attacking peaceful protesters, beating them up. While the left, Trudeau said, and communists
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:52.680]  are allowed to demonstrate, people that don't want to be injected with this garbage, people
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:57.920]  that don't want to be tracked and traced by Klaus Schwab's garbage, they are being attacked.
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:02.600]  I mean, is this a test to see what the globalists can get away with? Because that's what I see
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:03.600]  it as, David.
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:14.760]  Well, I think that's part of it. But also, you see, what the truckers have done is to
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:23.040]  choose the biggest threat of all to this cold. And that's the threat of a good example.
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:37.120]  If you can do what they've done, and the Canadian government has to admit that they can't impose
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:44.720]  these vaccine mandates because of public pressure and all this stuff. And so they say, okay,
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:54.040]  well, we'll do what you want. Then that is a massive, massive statement to the rest
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:55.040]  of the world.
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.560]  That the people have the power.
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:06.320]  But the people have the power. So when this trucker protest began, my immediate response
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:17.320]  was, I can't see how they can let this go. Because if they do, the example set to the
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:24.920]  rest of the world would be monumental. You're already seeing other trucker protests happening
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:32.320]  around the world, inspired by the Canadian one. And that's why what's happening in Canada
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:40.400]  is pivotal. And, you know, like I say, they don't want to do what they're doing in the
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:47.440]  sense that they don't want to put absolutely in your face, you are actually living in a
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:55.200]  fascist tyranny. But because of what the truckers have done, they are instigating this because
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:57.920]  they simply can't let them prevail.
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:01.760]  Well, that's right. What if the Chinese get leaked videos of people standing up somewhere
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:05.480]  else, or one of the Australians, or one of the, exactly, they've got to make example
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:10.000]  of this now. But I got to tell you, David, I sense and see this backfiring really big
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  time.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:18.320]  Well, you know, we're at a point now, I mean, you know, I mean, we've been in this arena
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:29.800]  a long time, how difficult it has been over the decades to concentrate the minds of people
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:39.440]  that this tyranny existed, that events in the world were not random, they were coordinated
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:45.760]  to a particular end, and that actually the world is controlled by very few people to
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:56.160]  a very sinister end game. But every time they do things like this now, every time that
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:04.400]  what's happened in Australia, what's happened in Italy, people in greater and greater numbers
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:10.800]  have lost the getaway car. They've lost that always just a conspiracy theory. Of course,
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:16.800]  you know, the morons of morons still can't see it because they're too frightened or clueless
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:19.480]  to see it. But more and more people are seeing it.
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:24.800]  I agree. What happens, what happens if millions of Canadians seeing these horrible images
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:29.680]  march peacefully now? Would that finally break the will of this tyranny? Is that the answer?
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:37.520]  Alex, that's what has to happen. You know, people in Canada who are looking from the
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:47.880]  sidelines who could get there, what are you doing? What you're seeing is not just your
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:56.440]  future disappearing into a fascist tyranny, but your kids and your grandkids into an even
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:03.760]  deeper one. What are you doing? Watching the telly? Oh, Ethel, come and look what they're
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:12.000]  doing to the truckers now. Get your arses in gear and get down there and grow a pair
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:19.840]  and grow a backbone. Because what we're looking at here is a pivotal moment when we make the
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:27.760]  choice between freedom and fascism, between a global version of Nazi Germany and the
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:32.760]  kind of world that most of us would like to live in and see our kids and grandkids live
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:41.000]  in. This is not standing on the sidelines looking on time, people, anymore. Everybody
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:48.080]  in Canada that could get there should get there. The more that go, the more that get
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:55.840]  involved, the more people will see that they have the power and not this cabal.
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:56:58.680]  Well, that's right. And David, you've always said this, we're going to break in a moment,
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:02.400]  but you talked about being in Europe and Bilderberg was having a meeting and there were the police
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:05.920]  down there guarding the very group destroying their future, which is Klaus Schwab and it's
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:10.400]  Davos group is Bilderberg group. And that's it. These police are having their own future
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:14.760]  destroyed. But there they are incrementally closing in and attacking the truckers, men,
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:19.360]  women and children. These are despicable, horrible people. They're such a shame on humanity.
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.600]  It doesn't matter. They're good people will be right back with our number two with David
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:29.600]  Eich. Here's a little book, perceptions of a renegade mind, find it at David Eich.com and

[1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:02.960]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:09.200]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:15.560]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:22.200]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:27.680]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem
[1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:32.240]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada,
[1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:38.480]  but they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:43.080]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[1:58:43.080 --> 1:58:49.000]  serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:52.840]  Mike in California, thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling
[1:58:52.840 --> 1:58:58.920]  this gain of function research. Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government
[1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:04.400]  gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:09.160]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS virus does nothing about SARS like
[1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:13.720]  viruses. And it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:17.680]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stops sign, you stop, you look
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:22.160]  both ways and then you proceed. And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function
[1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:26.760]  just selected gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:31.120]  and qualification research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:34.200]  right. They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:37.600]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:41.840]  they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But
[1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:45.760]  in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. You're making something deadly
[1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:52.840]  that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you. If you are receiving
[1:59:52.840 --> 2:00:10.120]  this transmission, you are the resistance we cannot make up the evil we're witnessing
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:18.480]  the forced inoculations of stock prices, plunging of Moderna and Pfizer or how left this grips
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:26.000]  a whole list is allowed to demonstrate in Canada, but anybody else is arrested. It's
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:32.960]  just like the Ottawa police and the state police and the rest of them, they all exempt
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:37.040]  from the injections. And then these truck drivers don't want to be made to take it.
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:42.000]  So they go to jail and get beat up. Imagine being one of these police officers being part
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.440]  of this when they don't have to do it, but you do. That's the next level. David, I continue
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:53.520]  with this historic moment. We're witnessing right now.
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:01:03.680]  Well we are now seeing what's been in the background all along, and it hasn't been necessary.
[2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:09.320]  And like I say, they don't want to show you what they really are if they don't have to.
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:17.040]  But now because of what the truckers have done, they've had to. And what we are looking
[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:28.240]  at now is decision time. You know, are we going to capitulate and look at an ongoing
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:37.080]  future in which what you're seeing on the screen from Ottawa is the norm? Or are we
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:44.320]  going to draw a line in the sand? Because I've said so many times, what is coming,
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:55.800]  what is planned is far, far, far worse and more extreme than anything you can imagine
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:02.120]  in terms of the consequences of standing up now. When people say, oh yeah, but what are
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:08.240]  the consequences for me of doing this? Well, I can tell you the consequences of not doing
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:16.240]  it are enormously greater than standing up and doing it now. And we have to look at children
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:22.040]  in the eye and our grandchildren in the eye. And then we have to look in the mirror every
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:30.640]  morning and not have to avert our gaze. If we walk away from this or stand on the sidelines
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:39.800]  and don't get involved, because the more we wait, the more power and control will be accrued
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:47.080]  to make it harder and harder to do. We've left it too long already. We should have been
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:54.240]  dealing with this a long time ago. But unfortunately, it has to be in your face two inches away
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:57.480]  before so many people can actually see the bloody obvious.
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.160]  Well, David, I don't want to interrupt you because I've known you at least 25 years and
[2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:06.960]  I've never seen you this upset and I'm crying on air. I mean, I feel the same way. Why are
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:10.840]  you crying on air right now? Well, I'm not actually crying. I've got
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:15.520]  a frog in the throat. That's what's made me eyes go. But I could be crying. I could easily
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:24.320]  be crying at, you know, the frustration in many ways of all these years of saying, look,
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:33.840]  this is coming. This is coming. Wake up. And here we are. So we're in a situation now where
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:41.160]  we have to deal with the way things are. And we are looking fascism in the eye. And in
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:53.880]  Canada, you know, what more evidence do you need? Now the point is this, because the cult
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:04:01.600]  through things like the World Economic Forum, etc., etc. are running a global agenda. What
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:09.240]  you're seeing in Canada now is what is planned for everywhere. It's just that because of
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:18.520]  what the truckers have done, there has to have been a response from from the fascists
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:25.640]  in the Canadian government to to what they face and the danger of actually the threat
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:33.820]  of a good example. So for that reason, we're where we are in Canada. But what you're seeing
[2:04:33.820 --> 2:04:41.920]  is planned for everywhere. Look at what's happening in Italy, for instance, to the non
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:46.600]  fake vaccinated. Wow, powerful footage of a little bit child was like a six year old
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:51.640]  giving the police a flower. This is unbelievable. Back in 62nd, some stations join us. David
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:05:06.600]  Ike is on fire as usual, but he is really on fire today. Stay with us. Harness the power
[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:13.000]  of the sun harness the life giving energy of this incredible engine that God gave us
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:20.080]  wherever you are, wherever you go, 365 days out of the year, whether it's in the dead
[2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:25.560]  of the deep dark cold winter or the blazing hot summer, everyone does better and is healthier
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.920]  with an extra dose of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are essential for your immunity. And
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:35.040]  now that people understand that, it's important to act on that information. We have the highest
[2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:41.880]  quality vitamin D3 cold winter sun with vitamin K at M4warstore.com. And right now, it's 50%
[2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:46.760]  off. So harness the power of the sun for yourself, your friends, your family today, the global
[2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:50.760]  surfeiting suppressors information. So it's key to let others know about the power of
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:06:06.920]  the sun. Harnessed in vitamin D3 inside winter sun at M4warstore.com.
[2:06:06.920 --> 2:06:14.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas,
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:19.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:26.600]  Let's turn to other breaking news tonight from our neighbors to the north. In just a
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:31.040]  matter of weeks, Canada's so-called prime minister wannabe little cowardly authoritarian
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:37.840]  dictator Jack asked Justin Trudeau has single-handedly now upended civil liberties in order to squash
[2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:42.880]  what has been a peaceful protest, a real one that he doesn't agree with. Trudeau once
[2:06:42.880 --> 2:06:48.040]  praised the violent BLM group, that group that said, what do we want, dead cops? What
[2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:53.640]  do we want them now? And even, by the way, took a knee with them in 2020 in solidarity,
[2:06:53.640 --> 2:06:58.460]  but now he's treating peace-loving truckers in the freedom convoy like their terrorists
[2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:05.040]  literally by freezing their bank accounts, threatening to seize their rigs, their livelihood,
[2:07:05.040 --> 2:07:11.240]  suspending, revoking their licenses, throwing them in jail and threatening $100,000 fines
[2:07:11.240 --> 2:07:18.120]  that I doubt they're going to be able to pay. Now listen to Justin Trudeau's Justice Minister
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:23.600]  who is now threatening people on both sides of the border for merely donating to what
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:29.480]  he is calling a pro-Trump movement. Blaming Trump for this? Take a look.
[2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:33.600]  You've just compared people who may have donated to this to the same people who are
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:36.920]  funding maybe a terrorist. I just want to be clear here, sir, this is really important.
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:40.600]  A lot of folks say, look, I just don't like your vaccine mandates, and I donated to this.
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:44.360]  Now it's illegal. Should I be worried that the bank can freeze my account? What's your
[2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:50.800]  answer to that? Well, I think if you are a member of a pro-Trump
[2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:54.440]  movement who's donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars to this
[2:07:54.440 --> 2:08:00.320]  kind of thing, then you ought to be worried. Wow. Now, of course, that maniac is only following
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:04.800]  orders from Canada's little dictator, and the little dictator, meanwhile, claims he's
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:09.800]  treating protesters like terrorists for their own good to protect them from COVID-19. In
[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:15.040]  reality, Trudeau just can't handle any dissent. Today, he actually accused a Jewish member
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:20.640]  of parliament of supporting Nazis because of her support for the freedom convoy. You can't
[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:24.920]  make this up. Take a look. Mr. Speaker, when did the Prime Minister
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:34.160]  lose his way? When did it happen? You're right. Honorable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker.
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:38.400]  Conservative party members can stand with people who wave swastikas. They can stand
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:44.320]  with people who wave the Confederate flag. I wanted to play that for David Igue, who
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:50.400]  joins us here on the Ellen Schoen show on this Friday, February 18 transmission, because
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:53.680]  when I tell you this, I don't tell it to drop names. The system already knows it's why I'm
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:59.680]  under attack. I know David knows a lot more famous people than I probably do. But I helped
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.040]  wake up Joe Rogan. I told you a few years ago he was about to get hardcore. He did. Took
[2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:09.720]  Carlson, helped wake him up. But the world helped wake him up. But I can't even begin
[2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:15.560]  to tell you the other people, like Bolsonaro and others, that we helped wake up. And so
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:19.640]  to even see Sean Hannity, who's had his own problems, not going to give Sean trouble,
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:24.080]  but, you know, we've helped wake him up. And it's what David said earlier. This stuff's
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:28.640]  going to get so bad, not in the open. You're going to have to choose a side. And we're
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:34.000]  now at this moment where what is it like for you, David Igue? Because I don't even know
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:38.120]  how about the world and what's happening currently, but just you as such an iconic person. I'm
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:42.920]  not trying to say I'm like super iconic, but I mean, who is out there? There's like, you
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:46.320]  know, David Igue and Ellen Schoen are like in the fight against the globalist, the most
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:51.680]  preeminent, which is a dangerous position. I can't believe it. It's surreal. But what
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:57.880]  is it like to know this is all coming for 30 years or so, even though 30 something years,
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:01.560]  32 years or so, you've been fighting these people. So I was following you three or four
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:07.600]  years into your awakening. What is it like now to actually be in the middle of the actual
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:14.560]  globalist emergence? Because to me, it's just so it's very mixed feelings like it's happening
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:18.000]  and it's vindicating and people are waking up that you can't believe other humans are
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.280]  going along with it. What is it like for David Igue to have lived through this and now been
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.840]  vindicated? But then it's to me, bittersweet because we're vindicated because we couldn't
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:31.720]  stop it.
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:41.800]  Well, we were never going to stop it before it reached this stage. Because I used the
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:49.120]  term a few minutes ago, a getaway car. And while people have a getaway car for the mind,
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:55.880]  getaway car for actually doing anything, they will take it overwhelmingly. And so when it
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  was over the rainbow, sometime never, oh, it's just a conspiracy theory. Oh, a lot of rubbish
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:11.160]  eyes talking nonsense, never going to happen. Then people weren't being directly impacted
[2:11:11.160 --> 2:11:17.120]  by it. As more and more have been in the last two years and more and more now as we're seeing
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:27.160]  in Canada, then they'll make an excuse to leave the room and do nothing. So it was always
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:35.520]  going to get to this point. It was always going to when you reach the point where you
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.800]  can't if you've got off a brain cell on active duty, you can't ignore it anymore. And that's
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:50.240]  where we are. And everything is a danger and an opportunity in these situations. So obviously
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:12:00.280]  what we're looking at now is the danger of fascism in Canada, topically. But it's also
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:06.600]  an opportunity because fewer and fewer people are going to be able to deny the truth of
[2:12:06.600 --> 2:12:13.040]  what's actually going on and the forces that are actually running the world and more importantly
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:22.640]  to what end. And I can't emphasize to people enough that what is planned would make George
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:30.240]  Orwell shake his head, put his head in his hands and say, how could I possibly have understated
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:36.960]  it as I did? Because we're looking, see, one of the hardest things, you'll know this too,
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:45.400]  to get across over the years as being the scale of pure undiluted evil that we are dealing
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:52.680]  with. You know, you're faced with, well, up to this point anyway, they would never do
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:13:00.400]  that. No, no, no, you would never do that. They would do it and get off on it. They would
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:06.840]  do it. And it would give them great pleasure to see people suffer as a result of their
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:15.840]  actions, to see people submit because of their actions. So there are no limits. These people
[2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:24.920]  are extreme. Almost we need another word, psychopaths. And the top trait of a psychopath
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:32.280]  is no empathy and no compassion. So when you're seeing these pictures, Alex, and you're seeing
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:40.760]  all these kids and you're seeing these morons, these brain donors in uniform, you're looking
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:51.400]  at psychopaths, only people that have no empathy, no ability to put themselves in the emotional
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:58.040]  state that they're forcing other people to experience. Empathy is the failsafe mechanism
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:05.000]  of human behavior. It's because we have empathy that our behavior is limited because we can
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:12.120]  have the empathy, the compassion of feeling what others would feel in the situation with
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:18.080]  putting them in. And that entails what you do. These people have no limits because they
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:25.680]  have no empathy. And thus, what they've been doing systematically, I go into this in my
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:37.200]  books, is recruiting more and more psychopaths into the military, into the police, into government,
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:44.760]  into government administration, whereby they do not have this failsafe mechanism, and thus
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  they will do anything and have no emotional consequence for it. And because we are dealing
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:15:00.280]  with that mentality, we have to get streetwise to it. They wouldn't do that. They love it.
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.800]  And they're the people that are running your world. And when you get to the level of the
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:13.360]  gates and the swabs and the fouches, what a bloody mass-murdering psychopath he is,
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:19.440]  then you're looking pure, undiluted evil in the eye.
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:24.720]  I was about to say, stay there, next segment coming up. Can't wait to hear from you, David.
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:28.160]  But absolutely, there are those that just don't care. That's the minions. Then there
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:32.800]  are the people above it who enjoy it, the Prince Charles, the Prince Phillips, the Bill Gates,
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:38.120]  and then those above them, as you pointed out, that are not of this world. DavidIke.com,
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:43.960]  iconic.com, find a great channel on Band-Aught Video as well in his new book, Perceptions
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:48.400]  of a Renegade Mind. I get one while you still can. We'll be right back with David Ike. Please
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:55.400]  stay with us, InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:16:03.760]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:08.120]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:14.280]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:19.680]  get going. You know, besides the energy TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:24.840]  vitamin C, to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:29.480]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now,
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:35.400]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis. I have bad joints. Thanks, mom. So this is great for
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:40.480]  giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:46.000]  flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:50.720]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news. TurboForce, that can
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:54.800]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:17:00.240]  moving and feeling great at any age. The purpose of fear is to call us into action,
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:05.680]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:10.860]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[2:17:10.860 --> 2:17:15.800]  asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:20.920]  having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:25.680]  in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:30.520]  all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:36.120]  to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:41.480]  from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:46.560]  of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to years worth
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:53.520]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:18:01.120]  knowledge at infostore.com. Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:06.520]  everything that's going on both at home and the world at large. If you are having trouble
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:11.640]  getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, down
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:17.840]  and out, is just the thing. It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically
[2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:23.040]  designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve. Formulated to improve upon our best
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:28.360]  selling product knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:33.760]  extracted directly into the glycerin solution. So the ingredients are already dissolved into
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:38.920]  the formula before you even take it. One of the other sleep support herbs included is
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:44.440]  the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:49.560]  who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:57.400]  ready for sleep because you will be down and out. Selling out now at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:02.800]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:07.360]  a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:12.840]  system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.960]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:24.400]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:29.240]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:33.920]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.680]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:43.800]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:19:43.800 --> 2:19:48.880]  But it has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:53.920]  like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:59.120]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:17.160]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:47.080]  We are witnessing peaceful demonstrators being arrested.
[2:20:47.080 --> 2:21:05.040]  In
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:10.300]  We'll hit some of that next segment, continuing with what you want to lay on the viewers and
[2:21:10.300 --> 2:21:11.800]  listeners about this critical time.
[2:21:11.800 --> 2:21:17.040]  Meanwhile, while we're watching Canada, we see the whole situation in Ukraine, David.
[2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:26.880]  Well, you know, one of the encouraging things that I've heard it quite a number of times
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:38.520]  in the last few months are people that have awoken to the world as it is, perhaps relatively
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:40.520]  recently.
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:47.000]  And then I hear them say things like, it's a spiritual war, isn't it?
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:56.600]  And you know, when you break it down, that is what it is, because human behavior comes
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:21:59.920]  from human perception.
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:05.400]  And human perception is human consciousness.
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:14.400]  And what we're looking at is two extraordinarily different states of consciousness.
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:21.760]  And what I found fascinating over the years is you look at the religions and you look
[2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:32.400]  at the non religions and the ancient cultures, that this tussle, this ongoing tussle between
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:40.440]  a consciousness that wants love, that wants peace, that wants joy, opportunity, fairness,
[2:22:40.440 --> 2:22:49.480]  justice, and another consciousness, state of consciousness that wants control and suffering
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:52.040]  and what we call evil.
[2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:58.320]  And evil is the word live written backwards appropriately.
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:06.160]  And what this evil does under its different names is invert everything.
[2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:14.320]  This is why the Satanists that are an expression of this evil, they invert their symbols like
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:18.240]  the pentagram and the cross, they invert everything.
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:22.880]  And what this consciousness has been doing as it's grasped more and more control of
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:29.240]  human society is to invert human society.
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.520]  Everywhere you look, you see this satanic inversion.
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:42.920]  You're seeing it now in Canada, where people that want freedom are being attacked on the
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:49.680]  grounds that they are threatening freedom and democracy.
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:50.880]  Everything is inverted.
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:24:03.240]  We had two years of a transformation of human society on the basis of protecting their health
[2:24:03.240 --> 2:24:11.000]  of the population, when that entire time has been destroying the health of the population.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:12.880]  Everything's an inversion.
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:19.520]  And you know, I think what we need to do, those that follow this religion or that religion
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:29.120]  or no religion, we need to see what we agree on and not just see what divides us.
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:39.840]  So Christianity talks about Satan and the devil and demons.
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:47.400]  The Gnostic belief system talks about Yelda Beov, that's the Christian devil.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:52.160]  It talks about Archons, they're the Christian demons.
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:57.880]  You've got the Jinn in Islam and in the different cultures around the world, in the Native American
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:03.280]  culture, you've got Wateko, which is a name for the same thing.
[2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:11.480]  This consciousness has sought to impose its will upon the human mind.
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:16.160]  That's why Wateko is known in the Native American culture as a mind virus.
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:17.560]  It's exactly what it is.
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:22.600]  That's what this Satan is, this Yelda Beov, it's a mind virus.
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:29.640]  And its expression in human society is this global cult.
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:31.560]  It has no empathy.
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.440]  It has no compassion.
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:36.720]  It has no ability to feel.
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:44.880]  And therefore its expressions, personifications, are exactly the same.
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:51.960]  So what you're seeing in these pictures in Canada is this pure evil under its different
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:59.640]  names in different situations, seeking to impose its will on the consciousness, the
[2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:03.080]  love that it wishes to suppress.
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:11.920]  You know, I've been on anti-war marches and stuff like that over the years, going way
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:13.040]  back.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:19.120]  These marches in London, these gatherings in London are nothing like that.
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:22.040]  The energy is totally different.
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:27.520]  It's one of love, a joy, a unity, a togetherness of mutual support.
[2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:35.400]  And every time I've heard people at the protest in Ottawa describe the atmosphere, they've
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.240]  described it in exactly the same terms.
[2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:42.360]  Euphoric love, it's that wavelength the enemy's scared of.
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:45.880]  Yeah, that's what they're trying to suppress.
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:50.240]  And the way they seek to suppress it is through fear.
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:58.280]  Now you know, I tell you something, which I've kind of noted over the years, is that
[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:14.800]  this cult, and this I'll call it what's he called, its modus operandi is inversion.
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:25.000]  And it's the use of fear, which is an inversion of all these emotions that we wish to bring
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:26.720]  into the world.
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:36.160]  I would say this, this consciousness, this whatico, this Satan is fear.
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:38.240]  That's what it is.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:41.560]  Because it's fear, it feeds off fear.
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:48.400]  And so it has to pull other, its targets into states of fear, because they're not only
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:52.880]  going to control them because they want to start wars and threats of wars, it's always
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:55.400]  getting the fear, getting that energy.
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:58.000]  That's what you're looking at now with this thing with Russia.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:01.440]  It's what you're looking at with the thing with China's what you're looking at with
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:02.440]  Canada.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:13.160]  And what we need to do is to rise above that and not allow fear and intimidation to impose
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:14.160]  itself upon us.
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:15.160]  That's right.
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:16.160]  Stay there David.
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:17.160]  I will come back.
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:18.160]  Long segment coming up.
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:20.800]  But I've seen brown people, black people, white people, all these events, they say I've
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:21.800]  never been so high.
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  It's so great.
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:23.800]  We love you.
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  We love each other.
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:25.800]  This is so good.
[2:28:25.800 --> 2:28:28.840]  And that totally scares the system as people coming together and doing that with bouncy
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:33.200]  castles and with hot tubs and with hot dogs and with everything.
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:36.320]  And the system's like, no, this is terrorist ban this.
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:37.720]  It's so incredible.
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:41.360]  And now they're physically attacking them as we speak in broad daylight folks will have
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:44.160]  live coverage of this continuing the war rooms coming up later.
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:49.360]  And then tomorrow I'm coming in live two p.m. central to cover all this and info wars dot
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:50.360]  com.
[2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:51.680]  We got to work seven days a week right now.
[2:28:51.680 --> 2:29:01.240]  David, I stay with us anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:06.440]  really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:10.880]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:18.000]  We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:24.600]  collapse our society to build on tashes, their, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:31.080]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:37.160]  that are exposing all their lives, their covetous area, their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon
[2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:41.400]  tax, global warming bowl, all of it and none of it can succeed.
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:47.080]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:50.800]  That's why truth comes with hard work and research and diligence.
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:55.000]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:59.840]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever, whether they were present that
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:06.040]  day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will
[2:30:06.040 --> 2:30:17.960]  follow the facts wherever they lead, domestic terrorist, the days of independent media are
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:18.960]  numbered.
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:19.960]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:20.960]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:26.480]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly, with practically half the population
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:29.520]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:34.520]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening
[2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:39.960]  exponentially, so be it, make them silence us by force.
[2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:47.160]  This is the final battle of the information war, give now, buy products, donate before
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:48.160]  everything changes.
[2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:55.160]  We need you to carry us through to the end, victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:30:55.160 --> 2:31:22.160]  Brother I'm so glad you called elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small town
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:26.040]  or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your
[2:31:26.040 --> 2:31:31.840]  car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend
[2:31:31.840 --> 2:31:33.240]  people say on these banner hangs?
[2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.240]  I have a few ideas.
[2:31:34.240 --> 2:31:38.960]  First of all, help get the poison from the farm, arrest out, arrest while swabbed, the
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:42.520]  vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[2:31:42.520 --> 2:31:47.320]  No, I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-19 vaccine is poison, beautiful.
[2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:50.920]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be affected, so that's what
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:51.920]  I'm calling about.
[2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:52.920]  Thank you very much.
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:54.880]  So much you Chris in Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:55.880]  Thank you so much.
[2:31:55.880 --> 2:32:02.880]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:03.880]  humanity.
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:17.240]  Then our God say will reward us with eternal life.
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:20.840]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:27.400]  They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their
[2:32:27.400 --> 2:32:32.360]  social Darwinistic system. And in a way they're right. If we let them lie to us
[2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:37.400]  and dumb us down and poison us, destroy our children's futures, the evidence is
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:42.400]  overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to us. So I
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:48.960]  ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know
[2:32:48.960 --> 2:32:53.640]  I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is
[2:32:53.640 --> 2:32:57.480]  infowars.com
[2:32:58.240 --> 2:33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:06.720 --> 2:33:22.720]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:33.720]  And the great David Icke is riding shotgun with us. David, I know you've got other key points to make. We appreciate your time, but I wanted to ask you to bless him. I see the Moderna stock down 70%. I see Pfizer stock down 15%.
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:42.280]  I see scientists and top doctors everywhere saying the shot is deadly. I see their
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:46.320]  whole program in trouble. People think of the globalists as being invincible
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:49.520]  because they're in charge. They're not. Obviously they've stolen power. We have
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:54.240]  the power. But how would you gauge how things are going for them? Because it
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.200]  doesn't look like their operations are going too well. They had it backed off six
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:03.360]  months ago, a year ago. They could have kept some of those games and some of those
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:08.000]  games in place. But now it seems like they've pushed too far and all over the
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:12.200]  place. People are talking about the great reset. They're talking about the New World
[2:34:12.200 --> 2:34:15.640]  Order. They're talking about population control. It seems like they've pushed too
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:24.480]  far. What do you think is happening? Well, I think when you look at the way most
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:33.760]  places are pulled back, I see today Austria is rolling back some of its extremes.
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:41.240]  I keep going back to the fact that it is globally coordinated. When you see
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:46.640]  these things happening, it's because it's meant to happen. It really started in
[2:34:46.640 --> 2:34:53.520]  England. The rollback here started really the first and others have followed
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:56.880]  on. In fact, I meant to ask you that when I was trying to get you on a month ago.
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:01.800]  Why did it start in the UK? You're right. As soon as the Prime Minister said we're
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:06.200]  not doing it because they were about to remove him, both the Democrats or
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:10.200]  your labor and your Tory conservatives came together and were about to
[2:35:10.200 --> 2:35:15.840]  remove him, that was a big moment, wasn't it? Well, the thing was that they
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:22.800]  played this Omicron card, you know, yawn, and everything was moving towards a
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:26.880]  kind of lockdown over Christmas in England. They pretty much did that in
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:32.200]  Scotland and Wales. Then right at the death, Johnson said, oh no, we're not
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:35.960]  going to do any more measures over Christmas. We'll see in the new year and
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:42.960]  the new year came and they didn't do it. Then this party gate thing started to
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:48.400]  appear. All the parties at Downing Street, when everyone else was locked down in
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:55.840]  2020 Christmas. His credibility, his ability obviously to say, well, you know,
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:36:00.000]  we're going to have more restrictions. Well, hold on a minute. You didn't keep
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:04.800]  the ones before, you know, so his credibility in that way went. But I
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:08.040]  think it's more than that. Of course, in England, there has been a tremendous
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:15.680]  amount of pushback and there's a lot of people in England who are aware of the
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:18.800]  game now. I agree. So what are they going to do now as they act like they're
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:26.440]  pulling back? What comes next? Well, you know, I have this phrase, know the
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:31.520]  outcome and you'll see the journey. So we know what the outcomes plan to be. Total
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:38.960]  global control and at the end of countries and the connection of the
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:45.880]  human brain body to AI and all of that. So that is not gone away. That's the
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:53.400]  goal. How they get there is they'll have a plan, but they're going to have to
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:37:01.080]  change it here and there. So this pandemic, fake vaccine response to the
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:06.520]  pandemic, restriction response to the pandemic, that's not gone away. They're
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:10.240]  still going to play cards like that, but they're going to throw other ones in as
[2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:15.640]  well, like the like, you know, frightening people over global war and
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:23.920]  stuff. And I think the other thing, Alex, is that by this time, they pretty much in
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:30.760]  this cycle, fake vaccinated everyone who's going to have it. Of course, there
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:41.360]  will be some more still who succumb, but they're pretty much there. So they'll
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.760]  play other cards because they are going to want to get this fake vaccine into
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:51.160]  everybody. That's the whole idea. And I want to ask you what's in it from your
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:55.160]  deep research and understanding, but exactly Austria, as listeners probably
[2:37:55.160 --> 2:37:59.160]  know, announced a few months ago, forced inoculations, giant finds you leave your
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:03.560]  house. It made nobody, they reported nobody else took it. In fact, it caused
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:07.160]  people that had taken it, I started asking questions, so they backed off. They
[2:38:07.160 --> 2:38:11.480]  want this in us like their lives depend on it. And then we know it's turning off
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:15.920]  immune systems. It's changing DNA. It's causing cancer. They're literally just
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:19.920]  seeing how many people they can get to slowly die. What do you from your
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.160]  research know is in the vaccine, the so-called vaccine, and where does this
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:34.360]  go? Well, they're doing it in a way that seeks to keep the levels of people
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:43.160]  dying, certainly in this earlier period, to a level catastrophic as it is,
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:49.360]  where they can kind of keep some kind of lid on it as best they can. And to do
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:56.920]  that, enormous numbers of these vials are actually just saline solution. And what
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:39:02.360]  it means is, you know, as people get them and they say, oh, I had it, wouldn't
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.560]  it do me any harm and all that stuff? And, you know, all those people are not
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:10.160]  going to die. By the way, David, I got to interrupt you and give you credit. I
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:14.800]  remember you six, eight months ago or so saying, most of this is saline. They're
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:18.160]  only targeting old people and military and certain groups with it. And then
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:23.080]  now they had major top scientists go off the government's own data and show
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:26.120]  that they're actually targeting conservative and nationalist and awake
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:31.240]  sectors with the poison shots. They actually were able to map it out. Gregory
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:35.280]  said a report on it showing it. So what you said eight, nine, ten months ago, I
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:42.360]  forget it was a long time ago, actually came true. Exactly. Well, this process of
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:52.440]  more and more fake vaccines for more and more manufactured reasons means that in
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:57.840]  the cycle of more and more, everyone in the end who has it is going to cop a
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:06.040]  batter. But they're kind of, they, if they put the bad stuff in every vial, I
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:10.760]  mean, enormous numbers of people. Sure. So again, they're doing a test. This is a
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:21.080]  test run. And, and so in this stuff is things like a graphene and nanotechnology
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:27.680]  and that there's basically two levels to it. One is mass depopulation and the
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:30.880]  other one and to test and see if they can cover it up. And the next is
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:37.600]  transhumanism. Yeah. And the other one is for those that can survive the
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:44.760]  transition through this synthetic genetic material, this mRNA, et cetera. That
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:50.760]  is a transformation of the human body from human 1.0 to human 2.0. And this
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.720]  is a point too, I think it's worth mentioning if we're talking about
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:41:06.720]  censorship. If you go back to 2020 and the spring of 2020 when they started the
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:11.880]  lockdowns and they really played these cards, you imagine if there was no
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:17.360]  alternative media, you know, we've had all this incredibly sterical censorship.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:20.400]  They would have totally taken over. We'd all be in vaccine camps.
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:27.320]  It started due platforms and the information has got out. Now imagine if
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:32.680]  that hadn't happened and there was no alternative media. Exactly. Where would
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:38.920]  we be now? We would be long, long down the road to tyranny. I mean, what you're
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:44.840]  seeing in Canada would be the world. And these fake vaccines, enormous numbers
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:49.600]  of people more probably would have had them because they wouldn't be exposed.
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:54.240]  So what we're seeing now in this next stage, Alex, you mentioned it in terms
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:42:02.280]  of yourself, is a onslaught beyond anything we've seen of censorship
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:07.800]  because the idea is to destroy the alternative media so that in this next
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:16.040]  cycle, which will include the pandemic card, there will not be the ability to
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:19.640]  expose what's going on. That's right. This is key final segment. Stay there, David.
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:23.200]  It's the most important thing you've said. This is the beta test and now
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:25.880]  they're about to try to take everybody off the air ahead of the next attack.
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:32.040]  I want to hear your expert gravitas cutting into the ether, jacking
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:35.840]  into, you know, the consciousness and tell us what you think we can do to stop
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:39.960]  this, what lizards can do to stop this. Davidike.com. Davidike.com.
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:43.720]  Perceptions of Renegade Mind. Find this book at Davidike.com and you can find
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.400]  his great channel at Vandau Video and Iconic.com. We'll be right back, folks.
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:43:02.840]  Every show will be our last, is what David's saying. This is such a critical time right now.
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:23.480]  Trying to collapse our society, to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:29.400]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:34.760]  scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:39.480]  their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:45.480]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:50.680]  silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:55.160]  with diligence and that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and Vandau Video links.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:22.760]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:28.360]  Potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:35.320]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:41.160]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia originally from Malaysia,
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:47.320]  makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:35.160]  We can't see what's being done to them. David, I guess with us here in the final segment of this
[2:47:35.160 --> 2:47:41.000]  hour, I really appreciate him joining us. David, I think what you're getting at to the listeners
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.080]  here is I don't put words in your mouth, but I've meant to say this to the listeners. I think this
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:50.600]  is the time right now. I think now is as good a time as any on the eve of massive escalated war
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:55.160]  with Russia and cyber attacks. They claim Russia is going to launch. Obviously, it'll be a false
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:03.000]  flag and the tyranny in Canada and Australia and everywhere and the stocks plunging of the big death
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:08.040]  shots just to say that you've been on air fighting this 30 plus years. You were on air long before
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:12.840]  that with the BBC and being a championship goalie and the rest of it. But I think it is important
[2:48:12.840 --> 2:48:17.320]  for listeners to understand that in case farewells can't be made later, and I hope we're here a year
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:21.480]  later, 10 years from now. I hope we turn this around quickly. I hope things can be crash-landed
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:28.200]  in a safe way, but I think it is fair to say parting is such sweet sorrow. This could be the last
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:32.120]  time you and I ever talk, but our spirits are eternal. This could be the last time we're ever
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:38.840]  on air. Today, next week, next month, we're in that area or in that house of total censorship,
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:42.280]  and I don't let my enemies have the enjoyment to hear about what they're doing on the scenes,
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:46.760]  but I'm sure you've gone through some similar things. It's been very intense. The attacks have
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:52.680]  been much more intense. We're barely on air right now, and I've had family members that have cancer,
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:57.720]  and you're like, oh, your uncle, he's all right. He's got cancer. Oh, he's dead. It's kind of like
[2:48:57.720 --> 2:49:02.440]  they don't make a big deal about it. It's just suddenly they're gone, and we are literally
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:08.440]  barely hanging on like everybody else, and the old systems of protection are falling. The old
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:13.880]  human constructs of a free speech in the West and the Renaissance is going down right now
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:17.000]  because the enemies launching their main offensive. That doesn't mean they're going
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:21.400]  to win in the end, but people need to know what they hear today or a book they've got on their
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:26.200]  shelf or a film they've got or a recording they save could be in the future the only way we have
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:32.360]  to communicate. But what we say today, if the lights go off, if we get shut down, we'll be more
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:36.760]  powerful than ever when you can share it with others. So David Eich, we got about eight minutes
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:40.680]  in closing. I really appreciate you joining us. Can you elaborate on what you were saying about
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:46.360]  the next phase and what we're about to deal with? Well, I'll give you an example of the next phase
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:53.560]  in Britain. The government has a bill going through parliament called the online safety bill,
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:50:05.640]  and it has widespread support, it seems, by MPs, morons, and what it does is give the government
[2:50:06.440 --> 2:50:15.080]  broadcast regulator called OFCOM an organization so utterly appalling it was created by Tony Blair
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:28.280]  in 2001. And what it says to OFCOM is you can demand that anything is taken down, including on the
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:42.360]  internet, that you feel could be harmful. It doesn't have to be illegal. It doesn't have to be unlawful.
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:49.960]  What you can say in the street, if OFCOM decide you can't say it on the internet.
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:56.920]  And David, just as you said, this is coordinated worldwide from Germany to the UK,
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:01.800]  from Scotland to Canada to the US, they have bills introduced like this here. They have the
[2:51:01.800 --> 2:51:06.840]  censorship bills introduced and racing through, including Canada. So this is an organized worldwide
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:17.480]  program. Because it's the global cult that's behind it. And so the idea is that they destroy,
[2:51:17.480 --> 2:51:29.000]  through this means, the alternative media. And OFCOM is being given the power to make
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:37.320]  crippling fines and even jail sentences for those that refuse to comply and take down what they
[2:51:37.320 --> 2:51:47.960]  demand. And it's the same scam that was used again by Tony Blair to part enormous numbers of
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:55.320]  children from their loving parents, because he introduced a new criteria for taking children
[2:51:55.320 --> 2:52:05.800]  from their parents, which was emotional harm. And that is completely in the interpretation
[2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:12.920]  of social services and the family courts, which are secret and cannot be reported.
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:18.760]  So this thing about emotional harm, you're going to hear more and more about that,
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:26.200]  is the ruse to justify mass censorship. And let me just back to you up. The head of YouTube just
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:31.960]  said, we're going to have AI watching for stuff that we think might be harmful, even if it's not
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:35.640]  against our rules. So they're the ones being harmful. But now they're just saying we're going
[2:52:35.640 --> 2:52:44.360]  to shut everything down and AI is in control of it. Inversion. We're being lied to by the second
[2:52:44.360 --> 2:52:51.480]  person, by people who say we must take this down because of your misinformation. Everything's an
[2:52:51.480 --> 2:53:04.200]  inversion. But the numbers are still on our side. If only people would focus themselves on where we
[2:53:04.200 --> 2:53:17.000]  are. Like I said earlier, don't kid yourself, but standing up now is going to be worse than just
[2:53:17.800 --> 2:53:22.520]  doing nothing. It's going to be a thousand times harder not to. I agree. I think everybody
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:27.800]  peacefully should go to Ottawa right now, where they have a few thousand police brutalizing tens
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:32.440]  of thousands of people who sit there and take it, don't attack them, go surround them peacefully,
[2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:38.200]  and more and more show up. This could break the back of this Chalcescu 2.0 right now,
[2:53:38.200 --> 2:53:44.760]  couldn't it in Ottawa, David? Exactly. Because, you know, what are they? 30 million people or so in
[2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:53.160]  Canada? 33 million. Yeah. Yeah. Look at the number of people that are doing this. I mean,
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:54:00.120]  talk about the tail wagging the bloody dog. And why aren't people that were still on the sidelines
[2:54:00.120 --> 2:54:08.360]  looking on? Why aren't they in Ottawa, in downtown Ottawa, in the face of what's going on? Because
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:13.640]  they're frightened of the consequences. And you're saying you better be frightened of the
[2:54:13.640 --> 2:54:19.000]  globalist takeover consequences, which is a trillion times worse. Well, I tell you something,
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:30.440]  Nathan, that when you're coming from an open heart and an open mind, you don't go through
[2:54:30.440 --> 2:54:35.880]  consequences. I'm sure the truckers didn't go through. No, you're right. You just get more
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:41.720]  empowered by it is what you're saying. It's the path you're supposed to be on. You do what you
[2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:52.520]  know to be right. And to consider the consequences of doing what you know to be right is to consider
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:55:00.760]  not doing what you know to be right. So consequences are irrelevant. We have to do what we know to
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:07.160]  be right. And what's right now for anyone that can get to downtown Ottawa is to get down there
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:15.240]  and and show your support in great numbers for the people being abused by these fascists.
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:19.640]  And by the way, David, you're not leading from the rear. You have had it's got to be dozens. I've
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:24.280]  seen the half a million people or more when they tried to arrest you and did attack people. So
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:28.680]  you've actually gone and done what broke their back in the UK, what you're asking Canadians to
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:34.040]  do right now. You're not asking people to do things you haven't done. Well, the point is,
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:40.440]  if this was happening in London, I wouldn't be talking to you now. I'd bloody be there if this
[2:55:40.440 --> 2:55:49.720]  sort of stuff was going on. And so would enormous numbers of other people. So it's no good standing
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:56.920]  on the sidelines and just complaining and then doing nothing about it. These people couldn't
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:02.680]  care less what you think of them. They couldn't care less if you complain. They're not even bothered
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:10.760]  about your votes anymore, given the way they've stitched up the system. And this is such a pivotal
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:18.680]  point. Where people do you think we're going from here? Where Canada? Do you think you're going
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:24.280]  from here? When this is going on, right? We're at the edge of the slide. David, you're hard to get
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:29.240]  on your prolific. We see your videos every day at Band Out Video and David.com. Join me again,
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:32.920]  even if it's 30 minutes next week, to give us an update, because things are moving very,
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:38.680]  very quickly. We promise you'll join us next week. Okay, mate. Thank you so much. Davidike.com,
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:43.160]  the book, Perceptions of a Renegade Mind. We're about to have Jay Dyer take over. I have a few
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:56:47.400]  closing comments, but you're right, David. It's good to know you during this time. It's amazing.
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:51.400]  And as you said, everybody's got a peacefully stand right now. It's such a critical period.
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:57:01.400]  30-second closing comment. Well, it's always, it was always going to come to this. And now we
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:10.440]  have to deal with it. And if we don't, then we are looking at a tyranny, an ongoing tyranny,
[2:57:11.160 --> 2:57:18.200]  in which even the human mind, as we've known it, will no longer exist. So we really are looking
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:27.320]  the dragon in the eye. And are we going to blink? Because if we do, then have a word with your
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:32.120]  kids and your grandkids and tell them the kind of world they're going to have to live in. And
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:38.520]  tell them what you were doing when we had a chance of standing up to it.
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:42.520]  Beautifully said, Davidike. Join us as soon as you can next week. It can be our last show.
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:50.360]  Who knows? God bless you and thanks so much, Davidike. Sold out for months. X3 is now back in
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:54.680]  stock. Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:58:01.080]  game changing. And so many people are deficient in iodine. It's not the soil anymore. Most of the
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:07.000]  ocean is contaminated. But when you get high quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:12.200]  types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido. But most importantly,

[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:29.960]  and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:34.200]  experience X3. Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:38.520]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what
[2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:43.560]  does for your body. It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the M4WAR, a true 360
[2:58:43.560 --> 2:58:49.080]  win. So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off at limited time. With the world awakening, I think what's
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:52.280]  important that we were right there to prevent them right now, take advantage of this moment,
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:55.960]  and I have all of them an idea that something everybody can do, that every listener can do.
[2:58:55.960 --> 2:59:01.240]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners over highways, imagine a champion
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:06.200]  on a piece of land up there that says, Alex Jones is right, infowars.com. We stand with the
[2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:11.640]  truckers, arrest out or whatever. Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes, now is the
[2:59:11.640 --> 2:59:16.600]  time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:22.600]  on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:26.920]  people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, help just as well as you call
[2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:31.720]  yourself armed, arrest out, arrest while swab. The vaccine is poison. There's tons of things. I say
[2:59:31.720 --> 2:59:37.160]  keep it short, keep it concise. Don't agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates. The COVID backs is
[2:59:37.160 --> 2:59:40.520]  poison. Beautiful. Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved, that we could all be
[2:59:40.520 --> 2:59:44.520]  effective though. That's what I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really,
[2:59:44.520 --> 3:00:05.360]  really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so much. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:22.080]  All right, we're going to have Tate Iyer take over here in about 15 minutes. I have a lot of news to
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:27.840]  hit before he takes over. A lot of clips I didn't get to, but here's the big announcement. We will go
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:33.440]  live tomorrow at 2 p.m. central for at least two hours and take your calls from Canada and other
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:38.880]  areas, but from the trucker specifically. I'm not going to tell Owen Troyer what to do. He's a smart cookie.
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:47.760]  He's the veterans call-in show on Fridays. Veterans, I'm sure, can call in. How about veterans of the
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:54.880]  demonstration in Ottawa? How about people on the ground there and the live feeds of people getting
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:59.440]  beat up and attacked? I'm not going to tell Owen what to do, but I would imagine he's going to have
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:04.000]  live coverage and I hope you'll share the links and I hope you'll get it out to everybody because
[3:01:04.720 --> 3:01:10.560]  the police are descending on it street by street and viciously beating and attacking people who
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:15.920]  already played a bunch of the footage. They now say the word freedom is evil and bad in Canada.
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:20.000]  I'm not joking, folks. That sounds like it's not a joke. I have a whole stack of news saying that
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:24.640]  with a straight face. This is an authoritarian corporate takeover.
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:29.600]  Shing what they can get us to go along with and if we'll give our birthrights of liberty up.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:33.840]  So, Jay Dyer is going to take over. I got some other news I'm going to hit, but Owen Troyer,
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:43.200]  3 p.m. Central today, I would guess. I wouldn't guess. I mean, I give such a free leeway to all
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:46.240]  our great hosts that I never even tell them what I want them to cover. I just hire them because I
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:51.120]  respect them and they care about them, but I can guarantee Owen Troyer is going to be covering
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:58.640]  what is happening today at 3 p.m. Central. But whatever happens on Twitter and on Gab and on
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:04.800]  Getter and on all the establishment platforms, non-establishment, rumble, you name it,
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:13.200]  people need to get on there and they need to share the live feeds and the clips getting out of what's
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:20.400]  really happening because the system doesn't want that scene. We're also going to create a whole
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:26.000]  live update section on infowars.com right when the show ends. There's a bunch of articles up
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:31.120]  there and there's a bunch of links. We're going to create a live update page for the Tiananmen
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:37.600]  Square of Canada. That's what's happening. So, we can add all the links and show it all and also
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:42.080]  grab the footage because when footage goes on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube, if somebody
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:47.120]  gets beat up by cops for no reason, including little young people, children, I saw some of it
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:53.040]  earlier, they pull it down. So, we, that's why independent news organizations are special,
[3:02:53.040 --> 3:02:58.080]  why we're important, why you keep us in the fight is important because we can grab those clips and
[3:02:58.080 --> 3:03:05.840]  post them to the attack on Canada, the martial law in Canada. We'll create a new section titled
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:12.160]  Martial Law Canada, something like that right now. And then I'll just have my crew just upload
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:19.200]  the interview with Arthur Polinsky's son, the political president, all of it will be uploaded
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:24.960]  there. So, there's a place where that's at because that's why they want to shut down. They don't want
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:35.680]  us, when they're carrying out just incredibly corrupt out of control operations, they don't want
[3:03:35.680 --> 3:03:44.720]  us on air, on 300 plus radio stations and on over 100 TV and cable stations and on all these
[3:03:44.720 --> 3:03:49.040]  other systems and reaching you via info wars.com. I mean, I've been around the left, I've been
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:54.000]  around the globalists, they are enraged that they can't shove a sock in your mouth and tie
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:01.120]  your ass up, that we're still here, we're still fighting because they're the trash that sold
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:07.840]  out to evil and they're the trash that was promised they'd be made a real man or a real woman once
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:12.400]  they serve Satan. And then Satan goes, sorry, you didn't get what you wanted, you got to serve me
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:18.160]  more, you got to be even more evil, you got to silence our enemies and then you'll be a real boy.
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:24.720]  Think about how disgusting that is and thank God every millisecond you're not one of these people.
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:30.080]  But it is an act of total defiance against evil and it is the defense of the innocent
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:36.240]  when you share a video or an article from man.video or from FutureNews.News
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:38.320]  or info.com when you tell others.
[3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:43.680]  It's a revolutionary act to share this link and tell those you tell to share it and tell them to
[3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:47.600]  share it and tell them to share it and tell them to share it and tell them to share it
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:50.480]  and tell them to share it and tell them to share it and tell them to share it, and tell them to share
[3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:51.520]  it, them, them, them, them.
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:57.360]  them.
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:05:00.200]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:04.600]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[3:05:04.600 --> 3:05:10.480]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:14.160]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:19.080]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:23.320]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[3:05:23.320 --> 3:05:26.920]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:30.240]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com.
[3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:37.560]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products that have 100% reviews

[3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:47.760]  globalist, a true 360 win.

[3:06:07.560 --> 3:06:12.520]  round with live calls from the Tiananmen Square of Canada.
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:16.920]  The footage is just horrible, them beating and attacking people and smashing their windows
[3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:19.160]  out, stealing their dogs and children.
[3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:23.240]  I mean, I just feel like a coward not going up there and fighting, but we've got to be
[3:06:23.240 --> 3:06:24.240]  Christ-like.
[3:06:24.240 --> 3:06:28.760]  Christ was so powerful, just annihilated all those people.
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:32.480]  We're going to have to sit here and take it like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Muhammad
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:34.920]  Gandhi, so everybody knows who the bad guys are.
[3:06:34.920 --> 3:06:36.440]  This is really sick.
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:41.600]  Owen Troyer, coming up in 54 minutes, you're going to be hosting the war room, tell us what's
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:42.600]  coming up.
[3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:46.400]  Well, Alex, we're with the Canadian people up there.
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:48.000]  What's happening today is just stunning.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:53.600]  What's happening to Pastor Arthur Paulowski is stunning, and so, hey, we're still licking
[3:06:53.600 --> 3:06:58.040]  our wounds and cleaning up from our battles on January 6th and learning from that.
[3:06:58.040 --> 3:07:01.640]  So this is the Canadian people's battle here, just like it's the Australian people's battle,
[3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:04.880]  the New Zealand people's battle, but we're definitely going to be covering the developments
[3:07:04.880 --> 3:07:06.800]  for all three hours on the war room, Alex.
[3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:10.480]  The footage that's coming out by the minute is stunning.
[3:07:10.480 --> 3:07:15.480]  The police just beating people senseless, disappearing people, arresting them, no bail,
[3:07:15.480 --> 3:07:19.560]  no court date, nothing, martial law, fences going up around the capital.
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:21.040]  I mean, it's crazy.
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:22.040]  We're witnessing it.
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:27.080]  By the way, let's just change the war room's name today to Live Coverage of Canada Martial
[3:07:27.080 --> 3:07:31.400]  Law, and let's just, everything will be uploaded there on your channel today.
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:35.120]  You start uploading everything so it's on record because they're taking it all down.
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:38.080]  This footage here is nothing compared to what we've been showing of them attacking men,
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:39.080]  women, and children.
[3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:40.480]  You name it, Owen.
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:42.720]  Well, I can't believe we're witnessing this.
[3:07:42.720 --> 3:07:44.600]  This is our neighbors to the north.
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:46.400]  This is our Canadian neighbors.
[3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:49.560]  We shouldn't be concerned about what's going on in Ukraine.
[3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:56.280]  We should be concerned about what's going on in Canada because that's the real issue,
[3:07:56.280 --> 3:07:57.280]  not Ukraine right now.
[3:07:57.280 --> 3:08:01.800]  It's the tyranny in Canada that'll come here next.
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:07.480]  And put you guys at the very top of Band-Aut video, and we'll change it to what, like,
[3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:09.520]  Canada declares martial law assault citizens.
[3:08:09.520 --> 3:08:11.000]  What are we going to call the page?
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:15.360]  Everybody can share that page and share that link.
[3:08:15.360 --> 3:08:19.000]  War Room Martial Law, World Martial Law, Canada Under Martial Law.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:22.760]  Yeah, Canada Martial Law Live Coverage.
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:29.360]  Canada Martial Law Live Coverage, and we'll show it all because the stuff we're showing
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:33.400]  now is just some stuff from earlier, then breaking in cars, attacking people, kicking
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:38.680]  people when they're down, grabbing men, women, and children, and just all of it is truly
[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:39.680]  disgusting.
[3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:41.080]  Thank you so much.
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.040]  All right Alex, we'll talk to you at three.
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:46.520]  And then, tomorrow, 2 p.m. central, if we're even on air anymore.
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:47.520]  Who knows?
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:48.680]  We'll be at war in Russia, God knows.
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:56.200]  I mean, because, you know, and you know, here's my biggest frustration.
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:59.840]  Here's my biggest frustration.
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:05.560]  They have busted a bunch of top executives, Facebook, you name it, and Pito rings just
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:09.280]  the last 24 hours.
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:11.440]  And we haven't even covered that.
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:12.440]  The articles are on infowars.com.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:15.400]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:24.160]  So let me go to a little video we put out six years ago, five and a half years ago,
[3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:29.120]  on the eve of the election about Hillary wanting nuclear war, and then we're going to come
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:31.160]  back and hit the other nose.
[3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:37.400]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:38.400]  be followed.
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:44.680]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:47.000]  launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:53.400]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:55.320]  like any other attack.
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:10:00.320]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:05.440]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:07.120]  Hillary, it's war.
[3:10:07.120 --> 3:10:12.200]  We came, we saw, we died.
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:14.360]  With her, you'll end up in World War II.
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:18.240]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:23.240]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:27.960]  to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:32.360]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:38.200]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:40.440]  reports of further hacking.
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:43.080]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:44.560]  Of course not, because she's-
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:46.600]  Look, that's a really loud noise.
[3:10:46.600 --> 3:10:51.560]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[3:10:51.560 --> 3:10:57.720]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[3:10:57.720 --> 3:11:24.120]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:31.840]  In World War II, 22 million Germans or more than a third of the population died, 20 million
[3:11:31.840 --> 3:11:33.240]  Russians died in that war.
[3:11:33.240 --> 3:11:38.640]  And I want to say that U.S. and England weren't in World War II, or the Japanese we were,
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:40.640]  but we were back ventures.
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:46.400]  It doesn't take away from the valor of our soldiers or what they did or the half million
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:57.640]  dead bread to the 800,000 dead Americans, but 22 million dead Germans, 20 million dead Russians.
[3:11:57.640 --> 3:12:03.280]  And that was without nuclear weapons.
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:06.880]  Hathamese like, let's just get it on, just okay, you go, I just want to blow the planet
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:07.880]  up, let's just do it.
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:11.560]  At least you won't be able to rape kids all day.
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:14.840]  Speaking of that, ladies and gentlemen, here's this footage.
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:23.280]  It's on infowars.com, Facebook LGBT activist, caught in alleged child sex sting operation.
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:25.280]  And this is the number four guy at Facebook.
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:29.840]  He heads up the metaverse, virtual reality, of course.
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:35.080]  And he thought he was flying to Indiana to have sex with a 13-year-old reportedly, 13-year-old
[3:12:35.080 --> 3:12:36.080]  boy.
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:40.000]  And you can read the whole article at infowars.com, but here it is.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:44.400]  So you're telling this 13-year-old boy that he makes you horny, correct?
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:46.720]  It could be perceived as such, yes.
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:49.520]  Oh, quit the bulls***, bro.
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:52.360]  I'm sick of your bulls***.
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:57.320]  I won't have any restraint around you if I'm horny.
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:12:58.320]  What does that mean?
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:02.720]  It means I was flirting, I was talking to him.
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:08.040]  Throughout all of this, I'll let you know there was never any intention of ever meeting
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:09.040]  up with him.
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:10.040]  Okay.
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:11.040]  Bro!
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:13.920]  But you did set two meets with him.
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:20.080]  You said I never intended to go to what you set it up, correct?
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:24.680]  And I gave information, location, and all that stuff, yes.
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:26.680]  And how did that find you?
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:30.680]  I thought like I just pulled this out of my ass.
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:31.680]  That's true.
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:34.400]  You gave the hotel and the hotel room.
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:35.400]  Right.
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:38.120]  So you set the meets.
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:43.240]  So you're okay with talking sexual online as long as you don't meet the children?
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:45.160]  Is that Brian Stelter's brother?
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:47.200]  This is the one time I've done this.
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:48.200]  The only time.
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.680]  Okay, so you are okay to talk sexual to 13-year-old Corey because you knew in your head that
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:56.160]  you would not meet up with him.
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:13:58.160]  That was my rationale.
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:13:59.160]  He asked you what you do.
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:04.080]  I'm the head of a global community development for Metta.
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:06.720]  That's a pretty f***ing good job, right?
[3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:07.720]  That's right.
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:08.720]  It's huge, right?
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:10.720]  You make good money, right?
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:13.520]  I mean, what was the title again?
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:16.520]  I mean, what is your official title?
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:18.120]  Energy of Community Development.
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.520]  And you said, make out with you, touch you, suck you.
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:25.200]  Is that what you said?
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:26.200]  I did.
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:27.200]  So that's a 13-year-old boy?
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:28.200]  I did.
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:32.840]  I said my cousin or Uber, he said Uber would be expensive, he said my cousin's rich, he
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:37.000]  doesn't care, he owes me, he said, ha ha, that would be crazy.
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:39.560]  And you're talking to this other boy, can I see a pic of him?
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:41.120]  Why'd you want to see a pic of him?
[3:14:41.120 --> 3:14:43.280]  Just want to see what it looks like, part of the conversation.
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:44.280]  All of this stuff.
[3:14:44.280 --> 3:14:50.200]  You were hoping that this 13-year-old somehow got a ride here and somehow got up here.
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:52.000]  And you weren't going to push it.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:55.960]  You weren't going to be like, yeah, I'll come get you, you're doing that, maybe because
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:56.960]  you're a skater.
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  All right, that's enough.
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:01.560]  We'll have the rest in post when I post it to m4wars.com, but in Band-Aid video, here's
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:02.560]  the deal.
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:05.920]  If he'd just dressed up like a clown, he'd been at the public school with your five-year-old,
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:06.920]  you never know.
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:12.080]  And he's a teacher, five-year-old, to have their balls chopped off, it's transgenderism.
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:15.320]  It's a damn cult that want your children's energy.
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:19.360]  If you don't stand up for them, God is going to let us get nuked.
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:21.320]  Really gets that simple.
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:22.820]  Hollywood is cancer.
[3:15:22.820 --> 3:15:24.320]  CNN is cancer.
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:25.320]  They're all cancer.
[3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:30.800]  We've got to reject them spiritually and recognize what they are, a bunch of lying trash.
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:31.800]  Please spread the word.
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:35.360]  J. Dyer is about to take over 45 minutes, and then Owen Shroyer with live coverage from
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:41.880]  the police state attacked in Canada, and Winner's Son, the highest quality vitamin D3, if you're
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:50.920]  being such as back in stock, 50% off with Rainforest Ultra, incredible, new tropic, 40%
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:56.160]  off m4wars.com.
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:00.960]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:03.360]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.680]  I was barely holding onto a jaw, and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:08.680]  it.
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:12.480]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:15.840]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you had, you know, with a deep-burdened
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:18.520]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:24.840]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened,
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:25.840]  you know.
[3:16:25.840 --> 3:16:26.840]  I could think again.
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:27.840]  I could connect with people again.
[3:16:27.840 --> 3:16:32.560]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:34.640]  take basically all of your supplements.
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:36.640]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:38.680]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:40.960]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:16:40.960 --> 3:16:41.960]  It's amazing.
[3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:42.960]  It works.
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:44.720]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:49.160]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:51.240]  own health into our own hands.
[3:16:51.240 --> 3:16:52.240]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:54.840]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:16:57.960]  So I did it.
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:00.120]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:04.800]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:07.800]  and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:13.000]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  get going, you know.
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:19.160]  Besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:24.480]  keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:27.160]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:30.800]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[3:17:30.800 --> 3:17:33.120]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:37.760]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:40.160]  support and extra flexibility.
[3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.720]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[3:17:44.720 --> 3:17:49.440]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:53.520]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:56.560]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:01.760]  This is the next level in high-powered energy-neutropics with our latest brain force offering, Brain

[3:19:57.960 --> 3:20:12.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:12.600 --> 3:20:15.760]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show and your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:20:15.760 --> 3:20:20.440]  And today we're going to be talking about another one of the global elite texts and the
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:24.800]  Bilderberg Group and how this ties into Claus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, showing
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:29.640]  a continuity of plans and agenda over the last century.
[3:20:29.640 --> 3:20:34.080]  If we think back to the famous book by David Rockefeller, his memoirs, you've heard me
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:37.440]  mention in the past the famous chapter Proud Internationalists.
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:44.840]  This is a chapter where David Rockefeller says that his plan is known to the world
[3:20:44.840 --> 3:20:47.680]  as a conspiracy, and he kind of laughs at this.
[3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:53.440]  He chuckles and he says that many have considered me as the head of an international conspiracy
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:58.360]  to create a world government, and he says, I stand guilty as charged.
[3:20:58.360 --> 3:21:03.360]  So within a couple pages, he admits this and he says that if you think about it, what we
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:09.040]  actually did as the head of the Rockefeller Foundation and this family essentially donating
[3:21:09.040 --> 3:21:14.560]  a lot of money, a lot of land to international institutions, he says we were able to create
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:19.840]  or help create the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the IMF, NAFTA, and he
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:24.280]  says that because we've done this for you, you should trust us to be the beneficiaries
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:29.440]  of the future, and thus we must create a united world government.
[3:21:29.440 --> 3:21:34.160]  And then he goes back a little bit and says, let's look at my family's history as a Proud
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:36.840]  Internationalist in setting up these institutions.
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:39.960]  So he begins by talking about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:41.960]  He moves to the Trilateral Commission.
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:48.320]  He moves to talking about people in the CIA that were really close buddies of his, particularly
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:53.640]  the Dulles family, and how they did have Nazi ties and how this was really no problem,
[3:21:53.640 --> 3:21:58.320]  because really everybody, whether you're a Marxist or a Nazi or whatever, they're all
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:00.720]  looking towards a global government.
[3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:05.640]  And he says, so me as an international monopoly capitalist, I really have a problem with these
[3:22:05.640 --> 3:22:06.640]  systems.
[3:22:06.640 --> 3:22:10.440]  These are just systems working towards the same end goal, and really what matters is
[3:22:10.440 --> 3:22:11.440]  what works.
[3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:18.480]  So I would move around these different circles with the influencers of various ideologies.
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:22.480]  So the ideology is not really the issue here.
[3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:29.040]  And then he gets into talking about Bilderberg, and he says that this was an excellent project
[3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:34.960]  that he said was spearheaded by former SS Prince Bernhard, and then later by Etienne
[3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:41.840]  d'Avignon, and he says that this group also had ties to Catholic organizations like Opus
[3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:42.840]  Day.
[3:22:42.840 --> 3:22:47.120]  He mentions this as kind of tied into this with its connections to the CIA.
[3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:52.240]  So you can look at the CIA and these entities as kind of being part of or the busy bodies,
[3:22:52.240 --> 3:22:56.320]  the worker bees of this global institution.
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:22:59.720]  And keep in mind that that doesn't make the socialists or the communists or the Marxists
[3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:04.200]  the good guys, because as David Rockefeller wrote in his late 1970s editorial for The
[3:23:04.200 --> 3:23:11.080]  New York Times from a China traveler, he says that the revolution in China was a great thing.
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:13.680]  He says Mao's revolution was a really great thing.
[3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:18.760]  He says it's a model technocracy, and he says there's nothing wrong with it.
[3:23:18.760 --> 3:23:22.560]  It's just we have to see which strategies and which plans for world government work
[3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:25.280]  the best in which regions.
[3:23:25.280 --> 3:23:31.320]  And so you can see then that he has no problem with any of these other Marxist revolutionaries
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:36.720]  or dictators or whatever, because to the internationalists, it doesn't matter what
[3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:39.320]  your ideology is, what matters is what works.
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:45.480]  And in some places, a radical Bolshevik or a radical Maoist attitude or ideology works
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:52.400]  great to destroy the existing culture and integrate it a new technocratic order.
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:23:56.720]  And you're going to see that what we're going through today is no different than Bolshevik
[3:23:56.720 --> 3:24:02.400]  revolution 100 years ago or what we're seeing David Rockefeller talk about with Maoism
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:04.640]  and how these were great things.
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:08.360]  And this is a key thing to get here, because we just saw this week, right, Klaus has a
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:11.720]  bust of the I Lenin.
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:16.720]  We know that the Western elites put money into the revolutionaries.
[3:24:16.720 --> 3:24:23.840]  And so if we understand this key point that the revolutionary is typically you can't understand
[3:24:23.840 --> 3:24:26.960]  revolutionary movements without understanding where their money comes from.
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:30.160]  Always ask where do they get their funding and then you'll start to see, wait a minute,
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:36.880]  there tends to be a really rich guy behind the socialist agendas.
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:42.320]  And so what we start to notice is that corporations, private tax free foundations, this is some
[3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:47.160]  of the Reese's committee looked into several decades ago, Norman Dodd's famous talk.
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:52.000]  Why is it that these really, really wealthy people and families and foundations and tax
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:58.280]  free NGOs, whatnot, why is it that they're putting so much money into these leftist liberation
[3:24:58.280 --> 3:25:03.680]  type causes that are not really liberation, they're all just about consolidating power
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:06.560]  and shifting and transferring the money upwards.
[3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:11.800]  Well, Rockefeller goes into that in his chapters where he says, well, I got to be good buddies
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:16.440]  with Zbigniew Brzezinski, I read his books and we decided we would have to set him up
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:22.160]  a, his own little committee, the Tri-Lateral Commission will put him as the head of that.
[3:25:22.160 --> 3:25:26.040]  He says, me and Kissinger decided that.
[3:25:26.040 --> 3:25:32.600]  He says, and the goal would be that we would have to set forth a new economic world order.
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:37.800]  He says that Jimmy Carter was my choice guy for this and this is even hints at the fact
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:43.320]  that Bilderberg was behind the 1970s oil crisis that Kissinger was involved in and that was
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:46.840]  spearheaded by Kissinger at Bilderberg.
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:51.080]  So we started to realize that even in David Rockefeller's chapter on Bilderberg that
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:56.920]  there's these admissions that Bilderberg is setting world policy.
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:02.440]  And he, Rockefeller says that there have been a few people who stepped up to think at different
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:05.200]  times, they might challenge this international network.
[3:26:05.200 --> 3:26:10.320]  And he says Reagan for a little while thought that he might make a move against the international
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  order and challenge the Tri-Lateral Commission and we can all remember what happened to Reagan
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:20.120]  when he, for a brief time attempted to do this.
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:26.040]  And that's exactly what happens is that they will, you know, basically take care of you.
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:30.480]  So let's look at a little bit of Bilderberg and how Bilderberg actually gives us a window
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:36.280]  into decades ago planning back to the 1950s for the very thing that we're seeing rolled
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:37.280]  out right now.
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:43.000]  So remember, just think about these patterns of fake revolutions, liberal revolutions,
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:48.920]  socialist revolutions funded by really rich people to consolidate, destroy and bring in
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:49.920]  the technocracy.
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:50.920]  That's all it is.
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:55.680]  So austerity in these different things will be tools that were planned decades ago by
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:26:57.400]  the entities like Bilderberg.
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:26:59.680]  And remember that's where Klaus comes out of.
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:03.360]  Klaus was formerly headman over at Bilderberg.
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:08.720]  Now he steps into this more public role of head of World Economic Forum.
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:14.680]  And all that is is just kind of the frontispiece or the front pop version of what Bilderberg
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:18.280]  represented back to the 1950s when it started.
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:22.840]  So if we go back to 1955, there's a famous document that was leaked from the Bilderberg
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:28.520]  meeting back then called the Garmisch-Hartenkirchen Conference.
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:34.800]  And this was back in 1958, and excuse me, the original Bilderberg is 1955.
[3:27:34.800 --> 3:27:37.480]  This was a 1958 meeting.
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:42.960]  And this proposed in the 1950s the EU common market.
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:47.600]  So what we start to realize is that the EU common market was not something 20, 30 years
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:48.600]  ago.
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:51.240]  This was planned back in 1958.
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:55.920]  And it was known from this leaked Bilderberg document.
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:27:58.800]  There's actually a book on this, Bilderberg, well, there's two books.
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:03.200]  There's Bilderberg book group by Daniel Esslin and then there's Shadow Masters by Daniel
[3:28:03.200 --> 3:28:04.200]  Esslin.
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:08.240]  The Shadow Masters book has several of the leaked documents towards the end of the book.
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:14.760]  So what that shows us is that it's not just that they had had a plan for EU common market.
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:20.200]  It's that they had planned for a new world economy that David Rockefeller was talking
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:22.520]  about back in the 50s and 60s.
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:27.280]  In the 1970s, they started rolling out that terminology of a new economic order under
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:28.280]  Carter.
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:31.800]  And when we come back, we're going to look at more recent Bilderberg meetings that tie
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:35.800]  in directly with what the World Economic Forum is rolling out right now.
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:41.720]  And we'll see that this is a completely continuous agenda, in this case, going back 50 years
[3:28:41.720 --> 3:28:47.600]  to the original Bilderberg meetings, 60, 70 years back in the 50s.
[3:28:47.600 --> 3:28:50.680]  And there are about 10 points that are laid out.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:53.560]  We're going to look at your scene rollout right now.
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:54.560]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:29:03.560]  This is Alex Jones Show.
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:09.760]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the Great
[3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:14.560]  Reset, the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on.

[3:29:24.080 --> 3:29:25.080]  your call.

[3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:35.240]  life.
[3:29:35.240 --> 3:29:39.880]  We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:42.280]  be millionaires and movie stars.
[3:29:42.280 --> 3:29:43.280]  But we won't.
[3:29:43.280 --> 3:29:46.280]  And we're just learning this fact.
[3:29:46.280 --> 3:29:49.880]  So don't fuck with us.

[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:42.840]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:47.920]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[3:30:47.920 --> 3:30:48.920]  like here in America.

[3:31:07.280 --> 3:31:13.000]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:18.240]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they
[3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:22.760]  come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:31:22.760 --> 3:31:26.400]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:30.760]  to get high quality Faraday cages many of which are made here in America and are very
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:35.680]  compliant meaning U.S. government military grade at InfowarsStore.com.

[3:32:16.680 --> 3:32:21.640]  Because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[3:32:21.640 --> 3:32:27.280]  whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[3:32:27.280 --> 3:32:33.760]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[3:32:33.760 --> 3:32:34.760]  than ever.
[3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:39.040]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover
[3:32:39.040 --> 3:32:45.600]  like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[3:32:45.600 --> 3:32:49.880]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia so pray for these folks big time
[3:32:49.880 --> 3:32:55.200]  this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into Infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[3:32:55.200 --> 3:32:57.200]  bare amount.
[3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:13.680]  Leading up front a assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:13.680 --> 3:33:19.360]  Welcome back to Alex Jones, your guest host Jay Dyer, jaysanalysis.com.
[3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:26.120]  You can follow me on YouTube, Twitter, Rockfin is where I post a lot of the spicier content
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:32.400]  that you can't find anywhere else and of course here on band.videofuturenews.news you can look
[3:33:32.400 --> 3:33:36.800]  under Jay Dyer and you'll find my videos and about a year's worth of lectures that we've
[3:33:36.800 --> 3:33:42.960]  done now through many many many dozens of global elite texts now and we're talking about the
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:48.960]  Bilderberg group as one of these key central cornerstones you could say of the coming technocracy
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:56.680]  of this century long at least plan to work the world towards a world government now I'm
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:00.480]  not saying Bilderberg's been there for a century Bilderberg dates back to the 1950s almost
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:05.800]  a century but in Eselin's book for example he mentions a few years ago I think this is
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:12.760]  Bilderberg 2009 there was a leak of the plans of Bilderberg that year so here we go let's
[3:34:12.760 --> 3:34:21.080]  go back to 2009 and look at this list and let's see if we've moved from 2009 to 2022
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:27.080]  in this direction one of the so the list has number one to create one international identity
[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:32.440]  by empowering international bodies to completely destroy national identity through subversion
[3:34:32.440 --> 3:34:38.480]  within thus they would establish a universal set of values and no others would be allowed
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:42.440]  to flourish in the future I mean now that we've seen the rise of technocracy we've
[3:34:42.440 --> 3:34:48.880]  seen the proposal of the QR codes the social credit score the passports vaccine passports
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:55.080]  clearly we can see with the censorship that they are rolling out this plan right away
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:59.320]  contingent also upon this one national identity would be the destruction of the existing nation
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:04.560]  states and cultures so degrade and destroy from within that was key in the lockstep documents
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:10.920]  if you remember not just that you would have a totalitarian control from these young global
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:15.440]  leaders the Klaus talked about right the lockstep document says these young global leaders
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:24.040]  would intentionally provoke and roll out the hard-fisted approach that the jackboot approach
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:28.440]  to make the population mad when all you're angry when all you want it's just an angry
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:32.880]  award that was part of the plan right to make them and I'm not saying you can't get mad
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:40.240]  you have to right but the point is that the people like Trudeau are there on purpose
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:46.280]  to wreck the existing system this is a key point that a lot of people understand it's
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:51.800]  an idea of creative destruction it's a psychological warfare technique to from within subvert and
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:58.240]  destroy the existing system and when you understand people like Biden and Trudeau and these various
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:04.720]  ministers and so forth from that perspective suddenly their actions make sense right they're
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:09.960]  not just dummies they're not just well just they just they're not that intelligent the
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:15.640]  liberals are so stupid they don't know how to run anything some of them are stupid right
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:22.520]  but they answer to a higher power and higher people that are not stupid and those not stupid
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:26.760]  higher people tell them what to do they have their job and they must complete their job
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:32.480]  or else they will suffer ruin and in the case of Trudeau great example right if he doesn't
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:37.280]  get this under control and bring it in reign it in he's going to be politically thrown
[3:36:37.280 --> 3:36:42.800]  out but that's part of the way the system works by design is that the political class
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:47.400]  can be thrown out you know Biden can be gone in no time and then we'll get another puppet
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:52.960]  in there another goober up there rambling and just basically as a mouthpiece of class
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:58.520]  and these people and so it's important to understand that the first point that's laid
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:05.600]  out from the 2009 Bilderberg meeting was subversion from within and that's precisely how to understand
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:11.240]  these people right their job is to muck up the system destroy and subvert from within
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:17.840]  I was just reading a book on the the Vietnam War by Douglas Valentine called the Phoenix
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:22.920]  Project Phoenix program excuse me and one of the things that the Viet Cong had as well
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:30.440]  as their strategy was to infiltrate the structures of the other side and destroy it from within
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:35.440]  just do anything and everything that will mess up the system gum up the works so keep
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:42.280]  doing things that make people mad keep provoking and if you do this well enough then the people
[3:37:42.280 --> 3:37:47.440]  will back down the people will submit and eventually the existing system will collapse
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:52.920]  so that you can integrate it into the global order the next point in the Bilderberg meeting
[3:37:52.920 --> 3:38:01.480]  from a decade or so ago was centralized control of the masses by means of techniques that
[3:38:01.480 --> 3:38:07.400]  came out of MKLTRA mind control direct all humanity to to to obey a central planning
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:12.000]  committee's wishes the blueprints of this plan would be chillingly similar to what's
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:17.960]  described in Zabignan Brzezinski's famous book between two ages America's role in the
[3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:23.800]  technocratic era so Brzezinski's classic technocratic book which we've covered many
[3:38:23.800 --> 3:38:29.320]  times here is is the model by which Bilderberg and remember he these are early old school
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:34.840]  Bilderberg people right Kissinger Brzezinski Rockefeller they're behind these technocratic
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:39.120]  books that are published decades ago that we've covered and those books are the sort
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:43.880]  of constitution of the world government they're the operating plan of course new ones are
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:48.480]  updated like Jacques Attali's book which we covered last week but it's the same plan
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:55.200]  you understand that the things that happen in our our day are not random organic events
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:01.160]  that just happen right history is just one dang thing after another some university professors
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:06.440]  will say no it's not it is not it is in fact a plan that is rolling out at least in the
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:12.560]  last hundred years or so it's a plan and the next point is very crucial right remember
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:19.320]  this is Bilderberg 10 12 years ago the next point on their agenda was a zero growth society
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:26.120]  now that's not just population that's also economy so they want to get the economy stagnated
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:31.800]  and the population growth stagnated and by the way stagnating the economic growth also
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:39.080]  helps in stagnating population growth the sexual agenda that's going on out there right now
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:44.800]  that's a big part of zero population growth right messing up the ability of men and women
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:49.280]  to pair bonds so that they don't create more humans that's the main reason for a lot of
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:55.200]  the promotion of the extreme sexual forms of degeneracy that are being that are being
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:39:59.440]  promoted right now and it only gets worse right only goes from one extreme to another
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:06.280]  next it's going to be the bestiality and stuff like that and that's on purpose and by design
[3:40:06.280 --> 3:40:12.440]  you have to understand that degeneracy and toxic culture is a key element of psychological
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:18.760]  warfare because it's about demoralizing the population getting them to destroy themselves
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:23.120]  and thus as a foreign enemy you have a lot less work to do if the enemy is destroying
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:27.440]  themselves then let them have at it right the beta fish right with from Russia would
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:31.360]  love right the the villains sitting there watching the the two fish right destroy each
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:38.200]  other as a model for how specter works so zero population growth and zero economic growth
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:44.080]  would lead to a post industrial society which would lead to Klaus's fourth industrial revolution
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:50.320]  so notice Klaus's plan absolutely perfectly identical with the ZPG zero population growth
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:56.560]  society and the austerity society what have we been hearing in the last two years as a
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:01.640]  result of the lockdowns look how beautiful it was for the planet look how the planet
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:06.120]  was able to come alive and flourish mother earth is now you know basically giving off
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:12.040]  her pheromones she's alive now guy is alive and now we need climate lockdowns that's that
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:17.320]  was always what they wanted to do climate lockdowns now we can have carbon taxes now we can have
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:23.520]  carbon credits based on blockchain that's all in Klaus's book zero population growth
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:32.400]  is thus connected to a banker run IMF run World Bank run austerity based society if
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:38.400]  you don't go along we'll bankrupt you and they just announced right now if Russia does
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:45.640]  not back down they will enact economic sanctions against Russia and they claim that Russia has
[3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:50.280]  hacked the banks in Ukraine of course we all know from bolt seven that the CIA has the ability
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:55.520]  to spoof hacks and that they've done that many times they'll say oh it's China oh it's
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:42:00.240]  Russia oh it's the Russians hacked the DNC oh come on everybody knows what vault seven
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:08.160]  is give us a break the next point after zero population growth would be international treaties
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:14.120]  like like NAFTA as we said by the way would be part of that ZPG future versions of NAFTA
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:21.720]  and North American Union type treaties as well as integrated treaties and other continents
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:29.120]  a state of perpetual imbalance crisis crisis crisis chaos I mean that is perfectly analogous
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:34.440]  to what we're seeing right now right with the situation in Ukraine constant war the situation
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:41.360]  of these exaggerated pandemics right the exaggerated lockdown threats the new variants oh this
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:45.960]  variant this week's variant exaggeration exaggerate and hype up the crisis to keep
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:51.920]  people in a perpetual state of imbalance and anxiety this the Alex Jones show don't go
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:58.200]  anywhere we get back we're going to go through the rest of the Bilderberg plans to life changing

[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:09.040]  in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because
[3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:18.680]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat
[3:44:18.680 --> 3:44:26.160]  for and now we're just thrown it all away and I see the general public ENA medically
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:33.560]  induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled 20 and I know we're
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:38.680]  being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this is the
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:45.200]  process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:50.520]  and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[3:44:50.520 --> 3:44:55.000]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:45:00.120]  know it anything of real quality anything of lasting durability anything that's really
[3:45:00.120 --> 3:45:06.640]  satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain and when it comes
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:14.360]  information boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:20.800]  great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build on tashes their their transhumanist
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:27.320]  nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:33.880]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives their covetous area their world's
[3:45:33.880 --> 3:45:40.000]  going to end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:47.320]  of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes
[3:45:47.320 --> 3:45:51.000]  with hard work and with research and with diligence and that's why it's hard to share
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:54.960]  in fall wars links and band of video links that's why we've got to share them now more
[3:45:54.960 --> 3:46:01.440]  than ever whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:08.560]  for the assault on our democracy we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorists
[3:46:08.560 --> 3:46:18.000]  the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:20.840]  them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us
[3:46:20.840 --> 3:46:26.800]  go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:32.280]  up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate
[3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:39.360]  the awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force this is the final
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:47.240]  battle of the information war give now buy products donate before everything changes

[3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:12.200]  bringing up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:19.680]  look back to the show show we are covering the past meetings and points of plan from
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:23.920]  bill berg and how they seem to reflect things that are happening today now I said by the
[3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:30.880]  way I was wrong I said 2009 actually I think this is the 2005 bill berg conference which
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:36.680]  it's plans match very closely to things that were seeing rolled out now now remember of
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:42.160]  course they were planning for decades ahead and that's why this is relevant so the next
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:46.960]  point was the as I said the perpetual state of crisis and imbalance keep the world in
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:53.720]  its political situation and constant uproar and upheaval the next point was try to central
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:47:58.640]  these are these are goals by the way right so this was this doesn't mean that in 2005
[3:47:58.640 --> 3:48:02.560]  this would all be the case these are the future goals that we're seeing rolled out now so
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:07.760]  what this demonstrates the reason I'm doing this is to show you guys the proof that what
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:13.840]  they were planning you know 10 12 15 years ago is what rolls out now next point was the
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:18.680]  centralization and control of all education and some of you that know the history of say
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:25.720]  Marxism if you've read the plan the the planks of the Marxist party the Communist Party you
[3:48:25.720 --> 3:48:30.440]  know that some of these line up with that and you probably well this is a bunch of
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.640]  communists right how can communists we said no that's the point right communists I've
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:40.120]  always been funded by very wealthy people Marx was funded by Ingalls a wealthy stock
[3:48:40.120 --> 3:48:47.640]  owner Trotsky Lenin those people they got money from bankers and elites in the west
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:55.280]  in the fascist even those groups got money from industrialists in the west right so revolutionary
[3:48:55.280 --> 3:49:00.840]  movements and this is something most people can't grasp is that revolutionary movements
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:06.360]  are tools of destruction and if you can make a revolutionary movement big enough it can
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:12.280]  move and impel the world into a new world order and that's why the revolutionaries of
[3:49:12.280 --> 3:49:19.240]  today according to Jacques Attali in his book he says now the tip of the spear for democracy
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:24.360]  and world revolution liberalism is transhumanism that's the future revolution that's where
[3:49:24.360 --> 3:49:32.920]  we're going but at this point we're looking back we're saying okay so the communist planks
[3:49:32.920 --> 3:49:39.400]  that Bilderberg is promoting right the biggest capitalist on the planet the bankers the Fortune
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:45.320]  500 the Fortune 500 the top universities the top media people they go to Bilderberg by the
[3:49:45.320 --> 3:49:48.960]  way many of them also go to the trilateral commission and many of them are also members
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:53.920]  of the CFR I know you guys probably have that chart right the shows that the same people
[3:49:53.920 --> 3:49:56.520]  that go to Bilderberg are the same people that go to the trilateral commission they're
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:49:59.920]  the same people that are part of the CFR there's a giant chart that the people have drawn up
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:07.720]  this shows this just in media that alone proves that this is a coordinated plan and so remember
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:15.000]  the communist socialist plans are just as useful to the monopoly capitalists as they are to the
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:19.720]  lower level dumb liberals right the college professor liberal with a ponytail that thinks
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:24.920]  he's fighting the system promoting his communism and his socialism he's just a tool of very
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:31.640]  wealthy people that's it centralization of all education so whether it's the european community
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:36.360]  the future american union that they would like to eventually have where they have a total north
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:44.120]  american union the future asian union would seek to integrate education into a global standardized
[3:50:44.120 --> 3:50:50.680]  education model thus the youth of the future would be completely ignorant of any real lessons of
[3:50:50.680 --> 3:50:57.720]  history or any notions of civil rights freedoms and liberty that would all be deleted and done
[3:50:57.720 --> 3:51:02.200]  away with and if you remember when we covered Jacques at the least book i covered it more
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:07.400]  detail on my website for the member section but in the later sections of that book that he predicted
[3:51:07.400 --> 3:51:15.080]  in 2006 what would be rolling out right now he says by 2030 2050 when they roll out the technocratic
[3:51:15.080 --> 3:51:22.600]  sky net government he says that education will be basically the ai bot that's in your house
[3:51:22.600 --> 3:51:28.360]  controlling what you see and what you know about the external world so eventually right alexa will
[3:51:28.360 --> 3:51:35.480]  evolve into some sort of ai bot probably something like the amc show humans or whatever that show was
[3:51:35.480 --> 3:51:40.760]  where the everybody has their own private ai bot or whatever walking around i think about iamrobot
[3:51:40.760 --> 3:51:49.480]  right the azimov story with wil smith the ai bot will be your human assistant your assistant for
[3:51:49.480 --> 3:51:53.880]  your for your living for your education and that will be the medium by which you you understand
[3:51:53.880 --> 3:51:58.920]  the external world and they will have it totally controlled such that you will not know about the
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:04.680]  history of the world you won't know about the past so that the children that will be born into the
[3:52:04.680 --> 3:52:12.600]  you know 2030 to 2050 period will be completely brainwashed and controlled via an ai assistant
[3:52:12.600 --> 3:52:16.840]  tech thing that will be you know if they don't already have the neural link you know sort of
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:23.960]  mind meld stuff by then the full-on matrix atelie says that your education and what you know about
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:30.680]  the world will be controlled via this bot that's it you won't go to you know link into a free search
[3:52:30.680 --> 3:52:35.720]  engine to figure out you know doing doing your own research you will accept what the robot tells
[3:52:35.720 --> 3:52:40.920]  you basically that's what atelie says and so even though bill derberg is saying this back in 2005
[3:52:40.920 --> 3:52:48.520]  they're saying that in the future there will be a single global education it'll be globally
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:55.160]  standardized and you will not get access to information that does not fit with the technocratic
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:53:01.640]  myth and narrative there will be a centralized control of all foreign and domestic policies in
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:06.520]  other words you can't have nation states you can't even have governments doing their own thing
[3:53:06.520 --> 3:53:11.080]  everybody everybody will be submitting to this centralized government and eventually it will
[3:53:11.080 --> 3:53:19.720]  be a technocratic computer run government the un will be able to take on greater and greater
[3:53:19.720 --> 3:53:27.400]  roles in determining global policy wow did we see that in the last two years who has run the whole
[3:53:27.400 --> 3:53:33.560]  program about medicine and the technocracy in terms of the stabbies the un tells the national
[3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:39.240]  governments what is true what is false what is scientific fact what is not they just dictate it
[3:53:39.880 --> 3:53:45.880]  and so the regional bodies regional medical institutions or whatever they don't have any
[3:53:45.880 --> 3:53:52.840]  say so you submit to what the un says the tech overlords just censor and submit to what the un
[3:53:52.840 --> 3:53:58.360]  says so back in 2005 bill derberg was saying this is what will come in the future and we're seeing
[3:53:58.360 --> 3:54:08.520]  it right now in 2022 eventually the greater and greater evolving power of the united nations they
[3:54:08.520 --> 3:54:15.880]  say they hope will lead to a world citizenship and a world tax you will be taxed for your existence
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:23.240]  because you're a carbon emitting toxic entity what did we just see when we covered the un
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:29.240]  transhuman the uk transhumanist document the same idea the future is biosecurity by which
[3:54:29.240 --> 3:54:38.440]  your very existence is now a threat you are a a biospreader you are a a a entity an engine that's
[3:54:38.440 --> 3:54:47.560]  basically just creating diseases and so since you're a potential bio threat we need biosecurity
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:53.560]  by which the international government through medicine will regulate everything that you do
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:59.720]  including your carbon allotments and your diet and it will all be tied into insurance and actuaries
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:04.200]  and they have planned this for decades you understand this has been planned for decades
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:11.320]  they write books on this so if you don't recognize this and resist this they're going to do it
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:15.960]  and the main reason they can get away with it is that most people
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:21.320]  don't believe that people are doing this they just refuse to believe it you can't refuse to believe
[3:55:21.320 --> 3:55:26.920]  facts facts as people on the internet say don't care about your feelings facts don't care about
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:31.320]  your feelings right and that'd have been Shapiro quote facts don't care about your feelings and
[3:55:31.320 --> 3:55:37.240]  that's true right i mean it you can't deny this if it's in your face and if you deny it you're
[3:55:37.240 --> 3:55:42.680]  going to be a slave that's the point and they're counting on you not believing this is real and
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:50.920]  being a slave next point we will create a complete western world trading block the entire western
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:57.320]  hemisphere will be a block and then there will be a southern hemisphere block and this will be
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:03.720]  similar to the the models of the european union which it was the builder group that set up and
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:11.880]  planned the european union as we saw next will be the expansion of nato nato would be expanded to
[3:56:11.880 --> 3:56:18.200]  put pressure on russia whoa what are we seeing right now that very thing right nato was supposed
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:23.320]  to go away right it wasn't supposed to be this offensive thing oh surprise it actually is by the
[3:56:23.320 --> 3:56:30.520]  way and that's that helps explain what's going on right now right it's not russia that's the at
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:36.680]  fault here it's not russia that's doing false flags did you notice that was all those claims a few
[3:56:36.680 --> 3:56:43.800]  weeks ago of russia will stage a false flag it even says sponsored by rathion like sponsored by
[3:56:43.800 --> 3:56:50.280]  bowing right so the very propaganda now even lists that it's sponsored by the military industrial
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:55.080]  complex corporations it's just we're living in in a in a orwell world right now
[3:56:57.800 --> 3:57:03.720]  russia is not hacking ukrainian banks right next it says we need a global legal system they're
[3:57:03.720 --> 3:57:09.240]  already moving to do that international courts will be set up all the nation states will submit to
[3:57:09.240 --> 3:57:12.840]  international courts and if you don't you'll be called a rogue state a terrorist state and then
[3:57:12.840 --> 3:57:20.200]  finally a socialist welfare state that is the social credit system that is the universal basic income
[3:57:20.200 --> 3:57:27.000]  that will be set up to get you onto their system on the basis of being on the dole right and getting
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:34.840]  you on the dole is just it is precisely how they will control you you will now be required to have
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:39.880]  their social credit their credit their their system their blockchain i'm not saying all
[3:57:39.880 --> 3:57:44.280]  blockchains are bad but theirs and that will be the world government that's what bill deberg planned
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:49.720]  back 12 micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this
[3:57:49.720 --> 3:57:55.480]  gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s government
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:58:01.720]  gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:07.160]  involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and it's a
[3:58:07.160 --> 3:58:11.960]  research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way
[3:58:11.960 --> 3:58:16.440]  intersection there's the stops on you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's
[3:58:16.440 --> 3:58:21.400]  also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that
[3:58:21.400 --> 3:58:26.920]  this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know rand and others you know
[3:58:26.920 --> 3:58:30.600]  maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function
[3:58:30.600 --> 3:58:34.280]  you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're
[3:58:34.280 --> 3:58:38.760]  literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main
[3:58:38.760 --> 3:58:43.160]  definition it's still a gain of function they're making something deadly that spreads more easily
[3:58:43.160 --> 3:58:47.400]  to hurt people thank you mike we love you the average person on the face of this incredible
[3:58:47.400 --> 3:58:53.960]  planet is still unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side
[3:58:53.960 --> 3:58:59.640]  and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world for the united
[3:58:59.640 --> 3:59:04.360]  states of brazil and of course triggered by the bricks of the uk nations were pulling out of the
[3:59:04.360 --> 3:59:09.640]  private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their great recess and their
[3:59:09.640 --> 3:59:17.240]  program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical
[3:59:17.240 --> 3:59:22.760]  consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow
[3:59:22.760 --> 3:59:28.680]  because the left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released
[3:59:28.680 --> 3:59:35.400]  a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's
[3:59:35.400 --> 3:59:39.800]  that simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate
[3:59:39.800 --> 3:59:48.920]  combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win if
[3:59:48.920 --> 4:00:10.920]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you
