[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Intro
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Australian jets and torpedo boats.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  The CIA had manipulated the news in the United States.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion. It just can't end.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  We need to go into the capital!
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  You silenced those voices.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  If I were the devil,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  If I were the prince of darkness,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  Thee.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  So I'd set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  Do as you please.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  And then I'd get organized.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  churches at war with themselves,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  and nations at war with themselves
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  And with promises of higher ratings,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  but neglect the disciplined emotions just let those run wild.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  then from the schoolhouse,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  and give to those who wanted
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  This isn't a game.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  that swinging is more fun,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  And thus I could undress you in public
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  What are you doing?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zones.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  John has a long mustache.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  this is your song.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Uncle Sam
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  and the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:35.000]  Thunder!
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  And I'll tell you what.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  Crank that AC-DC up.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  Thunder!
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  You know, I remember when I was a child,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  you know, they'd play this song at all the big sporting events or pregame,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  and I'd get all jacked up to watch my favorite team.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  Man, I hear that now, and I'm like, I'm fired up to fight tyranny.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  I'm fired up to come on air and speak truth to power.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  I'm fired up to inform the masses and save humanity.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  That's what gets me fired up now.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  Yeah!
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  I don't even know if I could really get that fired up for a sporting event.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  I mean, I still like going.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  Don't get me wrong.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  I'll have a great time.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  But that human energy, that ancient energy,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  knowing you're fighting for something good,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  you're fighting for prosperity in the future,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  that's what gets my blood going now.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  As always, an honor and a privilege to be filling in for Alex Jones here
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  On this Friday, April 28th transmission,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  Owen Troyer with you for the rest of this transmission.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  I'll also be back for the Veterans Call-In Show on the War Room today.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  So any veterans listening that want to have their voices heard,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  you'll get that opportunity for three hours on the War Room today.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  We do have, I'm very excited, for Judge Joe Brown in studio.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  He's going to be sitting right there to my right in just an hour.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  Very much looking forward to that conversation.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  You want to talk about an individual that has just incredible life experience
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  and just such a smart guy to talk to, Judge Joe Brown with me in studio.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  And then I've got a decently sized news desk today,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  but we can cover news all day long.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  Remember what Tucker Carlson said in his two-and-a-half-minute video
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  that was so key.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  And I think one of Tucker Carlson's best abilities is to take complex
[00:08:49.628 --> 00:09:00.628]  To take complex issues and scenarios and really boil it down to make it easily understandable and consumable.
[00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:02.628]  And so what am I talking about?
[00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:06.628]  Well, we've got situations developing.
[00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:18.387]  That are good in that the corporate media and the establishment attacks against RFK
[00:09:18.387 --> 00:09:28.307]  Jr. are going to have a similar impact on what happened to Donald Trump and Republicans
[00:09:28.307 --> 00:09:29.307]  in 2016.
[00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:32.107]  Now, I don't think it's going to be nearly as big.
[00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:37.627]  I could be wrong about that just because I don't really, I mean, I'm not into Democrat
[00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:38.627]  stuff.
[00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:41.067]  I'm not into liberal stuff.
[00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:48.627]  So there could be a powder keg there, but at the time, I mean, with Donald Trump it
[00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:54.507]  was obvious pretty much out of the gates, to me at least, how that was going to go.
[00:09:54.507 --> 00:10:01.307]  I don't really have that same measurement of the RFK situation, but watching the corporate
[00:10:01.307 --> 00:10:07.547]  media censor him and what he has to say, and watching the Democrat party keep him
[00:10:07.547 --> 00:10:13.307]  away from the public so no debates, they'll try to cancel the primaries if they can, altogether.
[00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:23.578]  This is going to have a major effect on the American left, because let's not forget.
[00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:34.472]  Most of the Republican Party loyalists and voters were not anti-establishment like they are now.
[00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:38.472]  That was not a substantial thing.
[00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:43.472]  Sure, you had the anti-establishment right wing, just like you have the anti-establishment left wing,
[00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:48.472]  but it was nowhere near where it's at today, and that was because of Donald Trump,
[00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:51.472]  the media response, the censorship, and everything else.
[00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:57.472]  Well, now that's happening to RFK Jr., and some liberals and democrats are scratching their heads saying,
[00:10:57.472 --> 00:11:00.472]  well, wait a second, what the heck is going on here?
[00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:03.472]  It just shows how corrupt the corporate media is.
[00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:10.472]  So we've got a big story with that, and I think it also ties into what's going on with Tucker.
[00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:14.472]  A lot of liberals like Tucker Carlson.
[00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:21.235]  When he makes statements like he did,
[00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:24.235]  saying, you know, most of what we talk about is really inconsequential,
[00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:27.235]  here are the real things that matter, and he's right.
[00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:40.790]  That is a universal message that will land for some liberals, and I think it
[00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:46.031]  will kind of, I don't know what the angle here is, if it's, will they stop being so
[00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:50.751]  intolerant? Will they stop being so hateful? Will they stop buying into the
[00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:54.111]  lies that their friends in the media and the government tell them?
[00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:59.511]  Because they like Tucker Carlson. Some of them know Tucker Carlson. They know
[00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:03.071]  he's not a racist. He's not a bigot. He's not this, that, or the other thing. They
[00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:07.951]  know that, and then watching the media lie about him, watching the media censor
[00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:12.111]  RFK Jr., maybe they'll finally get it. Now, will they be able to connect that to
[00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:16.831]  what was done? Have that understanding? I'm not sure. I'm not even sure if it
[00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:23.191]  would matter, but I see that going on big time right now, and there's no amount of
[00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:29.711]  censorship that the American left can engage in that will hide the fact that
[00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:37.391]  Joe Biden is completely incompetent and mentally and physically incapable of
[00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.310]  being president for another four years, let alone another two, let alone another
[00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.711]  six.
[00:12:42.317 --> 00:13:04.317]  So for them to be censoring RFK Jr., a truly viable challenge in the Democrat Party to Joe Biden, and even Marianne Williamson, who I don't really think is a viable threat, but she's put in enough of the work politically to at least get recognition.
[00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:11.951]  So I don't think they take this one lying down, and this isn't going to be like Bernie
[00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:19.431]  Sanders in 2016 and 2020, like a stalking horse for Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, pretending
[00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:24.031]  he wants to run, getting the big populace left, anti-establishment left behind him,
[00:13:24.031 --> 00:13:30.351]  doing all the organic grassroots fundraising and activism, and then just laying down when
[00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.671]  it's time to go.
[00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:34.951]  When the light turns green, he turns his engine off.
[00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:35.951]  It's not going to be like that.
[00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:45.151]  RFK Jr. is serious, and I think Marianne Williamson is serious enough to at least raise a fuss
[00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:50.551]  and have an issue with how she's been treated by the Democrat Party and the mainstream media.
[00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:57.391]  So yeah, we've dealt with this now for a while, the censorship, the lies, the attacks, the
[00:13:57.391 --> 00:14:02.711]  corporate pests aimed against us and everything else, and now the left is getting a little
[00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:07.711]  taste of that, and they're getting a little experience with that.
[00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:08.991]  We'll see how deep it goes.
[00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:14.195]  But they can't stop the debate on Joe Biden's health.
[00:14:14.195 --> 00:14:16.195]  We also have some news.
[00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:23.461]  Dealing with the geopolitical developments in Ukraine and now China.
[00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:27.609]  And the easiest way to put it is
[00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:34.469]  Well, this wouldn't be the best metaphor, but we've all heard you know when when dad's away the kids will play well
[00:14:34.689 --> 00:14:40.049]  the United States of America is no longer respected by any foreign power and
[00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:42.929]  so Russia and China and
[00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:50.949]  Iran and others are just gonna do whatever the hell they want not fearing any response or any legitimate threat
[00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:53.409]  from the United States of America
[00:14:54.249 --> 00:15:00.649]  Which you could argue is a good thing or a bad thing the point is the story is that our world ranking is
[00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:03.409]  sliding and
[00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:05.569]  It is
[00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:10.249]  Directly because Joe Biden is the president of the United States and everything that follows
[00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:16.088]  So it's not just that the crime rates are skyrocketing. It's not just the inflation
[00:15:16.289 --> 00:15:19.088]  They just came out with a new GDP growth 1%
[00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:23.969]  I mean folks this country is moving at a snail's pace and
[00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:28.569]  Of course it is with Joe Biden as your president. That's that's the physical representation
[00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:33.289]  So this is all directly
[00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:39.848]  Right back to the Biden White House and the world knows it the note the world knows the Biden White House is a joke
[00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:43.969]  The world knows Joe Biden is incompetent and uncapable incapable
[00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:47.329]  So we've got that and so much more today on the Alex Jones show
[00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:49.209]  Do not go anywhere
[00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:55.169]  The only place you should go is info or store.com to make a purchase so we can keep this broadcast on the air
[00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:00.969]  Just weeks ago
[00:16:00.969 --> 00:16:01.649]  I
[00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:07.209]  Warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson to take him off the air people said no way
[00:16:07.209 --> 00:16:10.689]  He's the most pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions of stolen money
[00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:13.569]  They only had to cross on the air because they believe they control him
[00:16:13.569 --> 00:16:16.529]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air
[00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:22.609]  it's the same thing with them for wars, but info wars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or

[00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:06.089]  They decided to not herp walking not put him in handcuffs not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump
[00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:08.209]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:10.609]  We were waiting for the mugshot we learned today
[00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.089]  They wouldn't have it so we've made our own and it says political

[00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:03.049]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly
[00:18:03.689 --> 00:18:10.168]  Acid on earth and they've got our children drinking that this is a psychotic death cult
[00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:13.649]  Period case closed out to get you and your family
[00:18:13.649 --> 00:18:18.489]  We sell the Alexa pure breeze made by the my patron supply ready our group

[00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:27.449]  They went out hired engineers reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price
[00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:29.729]  And they made it as good
[00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:36.129]  In all the studies it reduces things to non detectable levels thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay two or three times
[00:18:36.129 --> 00:18:38.729]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good
[00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:45.089]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading competitor and the media
[00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:51.529]  Says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water. You should also filter your shower water
[00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:54.529]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but but I'm done talking about that

[00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:09.689]  Words planned for our future that is a hellish future now
[00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:11.809]  You'll be always while they still allow books
[00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:15.649]  I guess they're starting to ban them be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World

[00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.409]  We got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now
[00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:32.249]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World a signed copy and in for short icon
[00:19:32.249 --> 00:19:36.168]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air

[00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:47.969]  But I want to encourage all of you who?

[00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:59.089]  Give them to the local school. This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support
[00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:06.449]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:32.120]  Alright, let's start here by getting into the Democrat Party's treatment of Robert F.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:43.280]  Kennedy Jr. candidate for president and their censorship of his campaign and his statements, specifically recently on ABC News.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.720]  Now, there is this is a very deep, deep pool to dive into.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:21:02.320]  It goes beyond just the surface of the obvious ABC News censoring R.F.K. Jr. and then lying about what he's saying.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.920]  ABC News admits it censored R.F.K. Jr. interview for false claims about COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:16.520]  Another ABC News host tells R.F.K. Jr. he's too critical of the CIA, proceeds to censor him while speaking about vaccines.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:24.560]  Folks, can you imagine some I mean, this is beyond the pale.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.880]  Can you imagine somebody going up to anybody in the Kennedy family and saying you're too critical of the CIA?
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:37.740]  Oh, you mean the CIA that killed our family members?
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.060]  We're too critical.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.160]  You're too critical of that rapist that raped your mother.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.340]  You're too critical of that rapist that raped your daughter.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.980]  How dare you?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.060]  You're too critical of the CIA that killed your father.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.660]  Wow.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.220]  Please keep doing that.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.100]  That will only give more fuel to the RFK campaign.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:07.820]  So he goes on ABC News, ABC News Live Prime with the host there.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.460]  I don't even know her name and it's funny because I'm reading all these articles and
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.820]  nobody even says her name and it just shows how irrelevant she is and there's a reason
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.020]  why she's irrelevant because she censors real information and doesn't bat an eye.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.080]  And that's a whole other story that comes out of this.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:27.540]  But here's the clip where they cut Robert F. Kennedy's segment short because he's talking
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.540]  about the vaccine.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.100]  Here it is in clip four.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.540]  We should note that during our conversation, Kennedy made false claims about the COVID-19
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.540]  vaccines.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.220]  Data shows that the COVID-19 vaccines prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths from
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.220]  the disease.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.300]  He also made misleading claims about the relationship between vaccination and autism.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.540]  Research shows that vaccines and the ingredients used for the vaccines do not cause autism,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.140]  including multiple studies involving more than a million children and major medical
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.460]  associations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the advocacy group Autism
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.460]  Speaks.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.780]  We've used our editorial judgment and not including extended portions of that exchange
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.140]  in our interview.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.460]  We thank Mr. Kennedy for the conversation.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.340]  Again, I forget the name of this lady.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.000]  She's been around for a couple of years now.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.340]  She's not really, you know, it's not like she's been around forever, but she's been
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.500]  around long enough to be considered corporate establishment press now.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.460]  But but before I even get into the RFK situation, let's talk about the situation in the media.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.820]  What is this woman's job?
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.820]  I'm sorry, I forget her name.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.420]  If you guys could find her name for me, that'd be great.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.380]  If not, it's no big deal because what's her name?
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.940]  Her name is irrelevant.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.940]  What's her name?
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.020]  Her name is unimportant.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.020]  What's her name?
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.020]  Her name is sellout.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.020]  What's her name?
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.620]  Her name is corporate press head.
[00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:48.230]  But so, what is her job?
[00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.909]  What is her job?
[00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:59.790]  Her job is to sit down at that news desk and read whatever is on that teleprompter.
[00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.950]  That is her job.
[00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.950]  And I've dealt with these people, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:13.510]  Most of them, folks, are about as informative and informed themselves as the canister of
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.270]  hairspray they use every day before they go on air.
[00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:22.670]  Most of them are so high on hairspray and makeup that they really don't even have a
[00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.430]  clue the world they live in, and that's just the God's honest truth.
[00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:34.629]  Most of them are just obsessed with themselves and the prestige that comes with being on television.
[00:24:34.629 --> 00:24:39.510]  What they read off that teleprompter, they don't know, they don't care.
[00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.430]  Lindsay Davis is her name.
[00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.909]  So again, she's been around long enough now.
[00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:45.629]  She knows the game.
[00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:47.510]  She's corporate press now.
[00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:53.350]  She's not exactly legacy, but ABC News, so she's there with the legacy media.
[00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.870]  So this is just an important understanding to have.
[00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.590]  She doesn't know anything about the vaccines.
[00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.909]  She doesn't know anything about the vaccines being linked to autism.
[00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:05.710]  She doesn't know anything about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.909]  She doesn't know anything about all the deaths, all the strokes, all the heart attacks, all
[00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:10.149]  the cardiac arrest.
[00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:11.149]  She doesn't even know.
[00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:13.730]  I bet she doesn't even know what the VAERS reporting system is.
[00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.270]  She doesn't know any of this stuff.
[00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:19.990]  And she goes on TV and reads off that teleprompter as if she does.
[00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.070]  She's a liar.
[00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:28.250]  You are a liar, Lindsay Davis, and I'm sorry that you chose that, because you might not
[00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.330]  actually be a liar as a person.
[00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.330]  You might actually be a good person.
[00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:39.250]  But you go on corporate news, ABC, and you lie to your audience when you tell them that
[00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.169]  the COVID-19 vaccine has no data that shows side effects, and when you tell them there's
[00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:45.250]  no link between vaccines and autism.
[00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.570]  You just lied.
[00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.689]  Whether you know it or not, you just lied.
[00:25:51.689 --> 00:26:00.570]  So you have to understand, most of your local TV show hosts, not all, there are exceptions,
[00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.570]  but I've been there.
[00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.570]  I've been in local TV.
[00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.570]  I've been in local radio.
[00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.929]  I know them.
[00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:09.530]  Most of them, their day goes like this.
[00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:16.050]  They wake up, they drive their fancy cars to the studios, they probably look at some
[00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:21.370]  news and some stuff, and then they sit and make up for an hour or two hours, and then
[00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:26.209]  their producers bring them all of their talking points and what's going to be put on that
[00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:28.370]  teleprompter for them to read.
[00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.610]  And then they read it, and then they go home, and they start the whole process over.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:41.880]  I don't need to spend a bunch of time explaining what we do here at InfoWars, because it's a lifestyle for us.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.580]  No, there's no teleprompters in here.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:53.580]  There's no corporate-backed producers or sponsors telling us what we can and can't say.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.580]  No, it's truly a lifestyle.
[00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:07.150]  There's not too many people that you could call 30 minutes before a three-hour show and say,
[00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.150]  hey, I need you to host, that could actually come in and host that show.
[00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.150]  All of our hosts, all of our guests here could do that because it's a lifestyle.
[00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:19.150]  We live it, we breathe it, just like most of you in the audience.
[00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:24.150]  Not like Lindsay Davis on ABC News who gets paid to read off a teleprompter and lie to you.
[00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.150]  And yes, it's so perfect that the crew puts this video up.
[00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.150]  I mean, let's go ahead and go to some audio.
[00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.150]  We might as well as we go to break here because this is everything.
[00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.150]  This is your corporate press.
[00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.150]  They're all lying to you.
[00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.150]  And I'm sorry because many of them are actually probably good people
[00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.150]  and they don't even realize they're lying to you because they're being lied to.
[00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.150]  But they've been now put in a position to lie to you.
[00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.150]  This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.150]  Here's your corporate press.
[00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.150]  And this is all local news.
[00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.150]  On social media, more alarming.
[00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.150]  Some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.
[00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:58.150]  The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.
[00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.150]  More alarming.
[00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:05.150]  Some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.
[00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:12.150]  Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and general control.
[00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.150]  If you're not hearing an audio glitch.
[00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.150]  Yeah, keep that up behind me.
[00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.150]  You're not hearing an audio glitch.
[00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.150]  That's the Mockingbird Press.
[00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.150]  That's the mainstream media.
[00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:31.150]  All parroting and reading the exact same corporate talking points and corporate teleprompters that they're told to read.
[00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.150]  And they don't even know what the hell's going on.
[00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.150]  But you see, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:38.150]  I didn't give that video to my crew.
[00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.150]  They live this.
[00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.150]  We're synced up.
[00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.150]  When I start talking about the fake corporate controlled press,
[00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:53.150]  they immediately think, hey, let's pull up that compilation of all those local TV hosts saying the exact same thing on the exact same story.
[00:28:53.150 --> 00:29:00.150]  We'll get into the RFK Junior side of this on the other side of the break.
[00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.150]  Turbo Force is back.
[00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.150]  Sold out for eight months.
[00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.150]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.150]  We made it even stronger.
[00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.150]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:18.150]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:24.150]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.150]  Should be called 10 hour energy.
[00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:38.150]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.150]  It is the super fuel.
[00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.150]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.150]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.150]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.150]  They go good with this.
[00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.150]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.150]  This is the boss.
[00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.150]  Turbo Force back in stock.
[00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.150]  Discounted.
[00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.150]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.150]  More power.
[00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.150]  More strength.
[00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:01.150]  More energy.
[00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.150]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.150]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.150]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:18.150]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:27.150]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.150]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:37.150]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.150]  I know you spread the word.
[00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.150]  I know you pray for us.
[00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.150]  And that's wonderful.
[00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.150]  Keep doing it.
[00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:49.150]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.150]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:58.150]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.150]  Please take action now.
[00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:16.150]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.150]  So support Infowarsstore.
[00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:23.150]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.150]  I don't know.
[00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.150]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:32.150]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.150]  Krill oil.
[00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:40.150]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.150]  And I would urge everyone.
[00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.150]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.150]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.150]  But the day will come.
[00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.150]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.150]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.150]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.150]  Absolutely.
[00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.150]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.150]  You have to have these products.
[00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.150]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.150]  I want you all to know something.
[00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.150]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.150]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.150]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.150]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.150]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.150]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.150]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.150]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.150]  Years ago.
[00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.150]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.150]  Not for a second.
[00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.150]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.150]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.150]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.150]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.150]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:08.310]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:22.600]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.600]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.560]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:41.920]  You know, I don't want to make a thing out of this, but I will put a bookend on the last
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:49.360]  segment talking about the controlled corporate press, local media, with a little bit of an
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:34:01.320]  anecdote here, because when I decided to move from St. Louis to Austin, Texas, in 2016,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:08.560]  and join InfoWars, you know, I had a lot of people at the time sharing their opinion with
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.560]  that choice, because I had my foot in the door in a bunch of different media outlets,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.120]  a bunch of different walks and potential career opportunities, and there were a lot of naysayers
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.680]  saying this is a big mistake, you shouldn't do this, they're crazy down there, Alex is
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.280]  crazy, it's going to be bad for your career, and I didn't, I mean, I would listen to that,
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.480]  it never really had any impact because I knew it wasn't true, because I saw the one thing
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:37.240]  that was important to me about InfoWars and Alex Jones, which was they're not controlled
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.240]  and they're not going to censor me.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.520]  And that was the most important thing.
[00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:48.890]  So, when you see your local news all saying the exact same thing like these compilations
[00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:55.970]  we roll, and there's dozens of them out there, or when you see ABC News censoring a presidential
[00:34:55.970 --> 00:35:04.210]  candidate during an interview, and then having to take his statements and lie about them,
[00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.210]  saying oh, there's no problem with vaccines ever, vaccines are perfect, they're great,
[00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:13.090]  they've never caused autism, the COVID vaccine is a total success, all this other nonsense,
[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.490]  total lies, total corporate funded propaganda.
[00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.370]  That's all that is.
[00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.450]  So no, I knew the world I lived in.
[00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.450]  I understood the media landscape.
[00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:28.450]  And there really was no other choice for a young man like me to go,
[00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.450]  who wants to speak his mind and do his thing.
[00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:37.450]  And needless to say, the, we'll call them naysayers at the time,
[00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.450]  realized I made the right decision.
[00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.450]  But let's get into the real story here.
[00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:46.450]  So, you saw the ABC News host, let's play it one more time.
[00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.450]  They have RFK Jr. in for an interview.
[00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.450]  And then they cut the interview short.
[00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.450]  And then they censor him.
[00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.450]  And then they lie about what he said.
[00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.450]  And they make this statement after they cut his interview short.
[00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.450]  Here's the statement again.
[00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.450]  We should note that during our conversation,
[00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.450]  Kennedy made false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.450]  Data shows that the COVID-19 vaccines prevented millions of hospitalizations
[00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.450]  and deaths from the disease.
[00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.450]  He also made misleading claims about the relationship between vaccination
[00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.450]  and autism.
[00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.450]  Research shows that vaccines and the ingredients used for the vaccines
[00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:17.450]  do not cause autism,
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.450]  including multiple studies involving more than a million children
[00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.450]  and major medical associations like the American Academy of Pediatrics
[00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.450]  and the advocacy group Autism Speaks.
[00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.450]  We've used our editorial judgment in not including extended portions
[00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.450]  of that exchange in our interview.
[00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.450]  We thank Mr. Kennedy for the conversation.
[00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.450]  So, that's Lindsay Davis from ABC News.
[00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.450]  She probably makes at least half a million dollars a year
[00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:44.450]  to be a propaganda agent for the corporate media.
[00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.450]  That's what she does.
[00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.450]  She's not a journalist.
[00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.450]  She's not a show host.
[00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.450]  She's not an interviewer.
[00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.450]  She's not a newswoman.
[00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.450]  She is a propaganda agent.
[00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.450]  Maybe she doesn't even realize it.
[00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.450]  But let's address what she says.
[00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.450]  RFK Jr. lies about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.450]  Our data shows otherwise.
[00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:08.450]  Wait a second.
[00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.450]  Wait a second.
[00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.450]  Wait a second.
[00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.450]  Should we find the video compilations
[00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.450]  where the COVID-19 vaccine,
[00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.450]  according to the corporate press,
[00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:23.450]  went from 100% effective to now 0% effective?
[00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.450]  How about that?
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:33.319]  How about that? Oh, that was that was ABC News. Oh, that was CNN. Oh, that was MSNBC.
[00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:38.560]  Oh, that was CBS Evening News. Oh, they told you the COVID-19 vaccine was safe
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.200]  and effective. Now we have all the data that proves otherwise. What about the
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.879]  VAERS reports? The VAERS reports, I mean, do I need to bring my graphs in here
[00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:54.480]  again? Where you'd have, according to the Vaccine Adverse Reaction Survey, the
[00:37:54.799 --> 00:38:00.200]  government website, where you report your vaccine injuries, and they believe
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.520]  that it's probably at the most 10% of the vaccine injuries that get reported
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.799]  there. Some people think it's 1%. So anywhere from 1 to 10%. So choose your
[00:38:08.799 --> 00:38:15.759]  math, how you want to extrapolate that. Going from about a couple hundred
[00:38:15.759 --> 00:38:19.120]  vaccine deaths a year, according to the VAERS report, a couple hundred vaccine
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.359]  deaths a year to in 2021, when the COVID vaccine hit. What was the final number
[00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:29.120]  that year, guys? Like 30,000 vaccine deaths. All COVID-19 vaccine deaths,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.200]  30,000 at least in the year 2021. And this is all government official data. And
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.279]  you can go, it's not, they don't just give you numbers. You can actually go
[00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:47.560]  down and download the entire files of all the vaccine adverse reaction reports.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.560]  You can download the files and the reports, you can see the documents, and
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.759]  you'll see, you pull up and you're scrolling through this Excel
[00:38:53.759 --> 00:38:58.560]  spreadsheet, and it's all COVID-19 vaccine, death, COVID-19 vaccine, heart
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.839]  attack, COVID-19 vaccine. It's just, it's stroke. And then Lindsay Davis, a
[00:39:04.839 --> 00:39:09.160]  paid propaganda agent at ABC News, censors and silenced a presidential
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.919]  candidate, RFK Jr., and says he's lying to you about the vaccines, when that's
[00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:18.120]  exactly what they've done for more than two years. Really, for more than 20
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:24.040]  years, actually. Polio vaccines, MMR vaccines, Dardosil vaccines, flu
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:30.040]  vaccines, they lied to you about every single vaccine. And then RFK Jr. wants
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.720]  to provide a different opinion, or you might say, tell the truth about the
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.759]  vaccines. And what happens to him? He gets silenced, he gets censored, they
[00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:41.759]  cut his interview short, and then they lie about him and what he says
[00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:48.439]  afterwards. Do you really think every Democrat voter is going to take that
[00:39:49.319 --> 00:39:53.399]  sitting down? Do you really think that liberals are going to see that and say,
[00:39:53.399 --> 00:39:54.480]  hey, that's okay.
[00:39:54.710 --> 00:40:01.510]  Now, I get it, you're sitting there thinking, oh, and the liberals have lost it.
[00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.510]  They're gone.
[00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.510]  They're out of their minds.
[00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.510]  They're out of their gourds.
[00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.870]  They're sending men into women's bathrooms.
[00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.390]  They're chopping off little boys and girls' private parts.
[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:14.310]  Folks, that's not everybody.
[00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.630]  Most Democrats and liberals still live inside of their own bubble and don't see what's going
[00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:23.710]  on in the world, but if they're paying attention to the RFK campaign, they're going to figure
[00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.430]  it out real quick.
[00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.270]  They might not have liked Donald Trump because he was a Republican.
[00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.830]  They might have not liked Donald Trump because he's a rich man.
[00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:34.670]  They might have not liked Donald Trump because he's white, so they didn't really pay attention
[00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.550]  and they just accepted all the propaganda.
[00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:41.270]  It's going to be different now that they're doing this to RFK Jr.
[00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:45.230]  So I've got other examples of this from today.
[00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:51.390]  The best example being the mainstream corporate press and the Democrats and the liberals that
[00:40:51.390 --> 00:41:00.230]  run it complaining because you dare say something negative about Joe Biden's health, or you
[00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.430]  dare make fun of Joe Biden.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:10.550]  After all you did to Donald Trump and his family, now you want to say, hey, we need
[00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.930]  to have some fair and balanced rules here.
[00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.710]  We can't be attacking and saying these things about Joe Biden.
[00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.990]  You can't do that.
[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:23.750]  After what you guys did to Donald Trump, you think we give a damn about your calls for decorum?
[00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:29.070]  You think we give a damn about your calls for decency?
[00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.070]  Give me a break.
[00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.070]  But it's the same thing.
[00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:37.270]  They sit there and lie about Donald Trump 24-7 and they attack Donald Trump 24-7 and
[00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.110]  then somebody says something about Joe Biden and they say, you can't say that about Joe
[00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.110]  Biden.
[00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.910]  It's the same thing with the vaccines, with RFK.
[00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.070]  They tell you the COVID vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.070]  They're not.
[00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.750]  They tell you the flu vaccine is effective.
[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.750]  It's not.
[00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.710]  They tell you the Gardasil vaccine is great for your daughter.
[00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.430]  It's not.
[00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.030]  And then when RFK says, hey, you might want to look into these vaccines.
[00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.870]  They say, cut this interview short and now send out a special report saying he's wrong
[00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.910]  and we've got the real data.
[00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.310]  That is unreal.
[00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.850]  And what else are you supposed to think?
[00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.850]  What else are you supposed to think as an American?
[00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.850]  What else are you supposed to think as a consumer?
[00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.850]  What else are you supposed to think as a thinking human being?
[00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.850]  They lie about vaccines all day long.
[00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.850]  They censor RFK Jr. telling the truth.
[00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.850]  They lie about Donald Trump all day long.
[00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.850]  They censor somebody telling the truth about Joe Biden.
[00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.850]  Well, the conclusion is pretty obvious, isn't it?
[00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:40.350]  You're not watching news.
[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.350]  You're not listening to the press.
[00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.350]  You're not looking at and listening to individuals that want you to be informed.
[00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.350]  No, in fact, quite the opposite.
[00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.350]  They all want you misinformed and propagandized
[00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.350]  and in fear so that they can control you.
[00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.350]  I want you to think for yourself and be free.
[00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.350]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.350]  that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson
[00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.350]  and take him off the air.
[00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.850]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.850]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.850]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.850]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:16.850]  he was taken off the air.
[00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.850]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.850]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox
[00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.850]  or controlled by George Soros
[00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.850]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.850]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.850]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.850]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch
[00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.850]  or by George Soros.
[00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.350]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.850]  So I want to thank you for your support
[00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.350]  and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.350]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.350]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.350]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer,
[00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.350]  and your financial support
[00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.350]  while getting great products at the same time
[00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.350]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.350]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.350]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.350]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air
[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.350]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.850]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.850]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:04.850]  It is.
[00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.850]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.850]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.850]  The fish oil's better than it.
[00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.850]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.850]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.850]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.850]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:19.850]  Krill oils is the best.
[00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.850]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.850]  And I'm sorry.
[00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:23.850]  You want something like this,
[00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.850]  you don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.850]  The Krill is the best.
[00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.350]  You want something like this,
[00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.350]  you don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:30.350]  The Krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.350]  It's so good.
[00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.350]  In my view.
[00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.350]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.350]  but let me tell you something.
[00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.350]  I eat five capulets of Krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.350]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.350]  So your brain is made
[00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.350]  basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.350]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.350]  but you notice I just obsess
[00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.350]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.350]  I just can't lie to you.
[00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:54.350]  I just can't do it.
[00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.350]  InfowarsStore.com.
[00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.350]  Infowars.com.
[00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.350]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work
[00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.350]  for the United States government.
[00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.350]  A flying disc has been found
[00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.350]  and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.350]  Here is a bulletin from PBS News.
[00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.350]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:16.350]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.350]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked
[00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.350]  by Israeli jets and computer boats.
[00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.350]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.850]  They took the babies out of incubators
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.850]  and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:30.850]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.850]  It just happened.
[00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.850]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.850]  Death, death, death.
[00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.850]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:40.850]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.850]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.850]  You silenced those voices.
[00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.850]  What we want to do in Davos
[00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.850]  is push the reset button.
[00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.850]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.350]  we are going to start going to prison.
[00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.350]  Because you don't know, I don't know.
[00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.350]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is
[00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.350]  before midnight strikes.
[00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.350]  And again, magnesium is critical
[00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.350]  for your muscles and everything.
[00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.350]  Krill oil.
[00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.350]  What I'm watching right before my eyes
[00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.350]  is a composite overview
[00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.350]  of nutritional supplements
[00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.350]  that will keep you alive.
[00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.350]  And I would urge everyone.
[00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.350]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.350]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.350]  But the day will come.
[00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.850]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.850]  As you're drinking filtered water,
[00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.850]  a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.850]  You have to have these products.
[00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.850]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.850]  on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.850]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:22.750]  I don't want to set the world on fire.
[00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:30.750]  Alright, I'm going to get into the corporate brass and their double standards here,
[00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:34.750]  but how they're actually really hurting themselves with the censorship of RFK Jr.,
[00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.750]  but they have no choice.
[00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.750]  And so that's what the liberals are about to figure out.
[00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:44.750]  Before I do that, though, ladies and gentlemen, normally when I host the War Room,
[00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.750]  I will drink Turbo Force at about 2.30 to go on at 3.00.
[00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:54.750]  It gives me sustained energy for the show, but today in the morning I like to drink coffee.
[00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.750]  So I'm drinking coffee today, and I've told you about this before,
[00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.750]  and I've got to tell you about this again because I'm not really a coffee drinker.
[00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:03.750]  I used to drink a lot of coffee.
[00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.750]  I don't really drink it as much anymore,
[00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.750]  and I certainly don't like the additives that people put in the coffee
[00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.750]  with the creamers and the sugars and everything else,
[00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:18.750]  but there is one thing that I like to put in coffee that makes it extremely desirable for me,
[00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.750]  and that is Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.750]  In fact, I've got the canister right here.
[00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.750]  I've got it next to my desk because I'm putting spoonfuls in.
[00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.750]  Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:33.750]  Now, this is not meant for a coffee additive, but it works great as one.
[00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.750]  I'm going to tell you that, and it's extremely healthy.
[00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:41.750]  The primal human nutrition made with cartilage, bone broth, and other paleo ingredients.
[00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:44.750]  It's the next generation of advanced paleo nutrition.
[00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.750]  It's got the chaga mushrooms in there.
[00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:50.750]  It's got added electrolytes, collagen, soluble fiber, and so much more,
[00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:51.750]  including the bone broth.
[00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:58.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, oh, not to mention the protein goes great in a post-workout protein shake as well.
[00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:00.750]  Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:03.750]  It's your support there that keeps us on the air
[00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.750]  so that we don't have to be like Lindsay Davis of ABC News
[00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.750]  and read for you corporate talking points from big pharmaceutical companies
[00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.750]  and be a total sellout.
[00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.750]  We don't have to be sellouts like Lindsay Davis at ABC News.
[00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.750]  We get to be real people telling you real things and what we really think,
[00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.750]  and it feels good.

[00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.750]  But I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus in coffee,
[00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:30.750]  if you're a coffee drinker and you're putting creamers and other sugars that are unhealthy in your coffee,
[00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:31.750]  stop it.
[00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.750]  Stop it today.
[00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.750]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.750]  Get yourself a canister of Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:38.750]  Just give it a try.
[00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.750]  Just give it a try, especially if you like chocolate flavored.
[00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:45.750]  I mean, it makes your coffee taste like you're drinking, I wouldn't say hot cocoa.
[00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.750]  Some of the crew compares it to like Ovaltine chocolate milk.
[00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.750]  Yeah, I would say maybe chocolate milk, but since you drink your coffee warm, maybe hot chocolate.
[00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:56.750]  But it's not really rich like that where you can maybe drink one cup of hot chocolate
[00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.750]  and it's too rich you can't have another.
[00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.750]  It doesn't really do you like that.
[00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:02.750]  It's smooth.
[00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:03.750]  It's light.
[00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.750]  It goes great in coffee.
[00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.750]  It goes great in protein shakes, and it just is great for your health,
[00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.750]  and it helps support the InfoWars.
[00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:13.750]  Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:19.750]  Cannot recommend it enough, and I'll be sipping on it all day in my coffee.
[00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:21.750]  So.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:33.700]  We saw a major realignment and reawakening of the right-wing American Republican voter
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.899]  with the censorship of Donald Trump, the attacks against Donald Trump, the lies against Donald
[00:50:37.899 --> 00:50:42.259]  Trump, and that whole campaign in 2015, 2016, and then during his presidency.
[00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:47.339]  I see a similar thing happening now on the left side of the aisle with RFK Jr.
[00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:52.540]  Now this is going to go down completely differently, I suspect, but it's going to have a lot of
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.600]  similarities.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.939]  Not every liberal Democrat likes to chop up and mangle little boys and girls.
[00:50:58.939 --> 00:51:03.220]  Not every liberal Democrat thinks the border should be wide open.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.060]  Not every liberal Democrat likes vaccines.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.399]  Not every liberal Democrat wants people to be censored.
[00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:16.399]  And those that don't are probably just not really sure what's going on right now.
[00:51:16.399 --> 00:51:19.879]  They kind of see all the attacks and everything going on on the right wing and kind of focus
[00:51:19.879 --> 00:51:20.879]  on that.
[00:51:20.879 --> 00:51:25.680]  They're not really realizing what's going on in their own party, how corrupt it's been.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.560]  But this stuff with RFK Jr. is going to be that major awakening moment.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:36.040]  And I'm already seeing it from anti-establishment left people who don't like Joe Biden, are
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.439]  seeing how the Democrats are railroading Joe Biden down your throat, and they see how the
[00:51:40.439 --> 00:51:45.540]  corporate press is protecting Joe Biden and attacking RFK Jr., who's actually popular.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.460]  Right now, he's polling at about 20 percent.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:53.540]  I suspect that's only going to skyrocket, especially if they continue to attack him and
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.379]  censor him.
[00:51:55.379 --> 00:52:01.379]  So okay, RFK's, one of his big issues is against big pharma and vaccines, and he's totally
[00:52:01.379 --> 00:52:03.660]  right about that, and they don't want that.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.500]  Most mainstream press is sponsored by big pharmaceutical companies, and most politicians
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.460]  take millions of dollars from big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.939]  Sadly, now Donald Trump is included in that.
[00:52:13.939 --> 00:52:18.839]  And it sucks because I remember in 2016, he did not take any money from big pharmaceutical
[00:52:18.839 --> 00:52:19.839]  companies.
[00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:20.839]  He did not.
[00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:26.620]  And it was one of the easiest bait and switches I ever did on Bernie supporters when I would
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.419]  go out and have public debates.
[00:52:28.419 --> 00:52:29.419]  I can't do that anymore.
[00:52:29.419 --> 00:52:32.580]  I've had to retire from that because I just get assaulted and attacked.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.060]  Not to mention, I need to be a good boy because of my probation right now for standing on
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.060]  the grass in D.C.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.700]  You know, that's how it goes.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.140]  But one of my greatest and easiest bait and switches in 2015 and 2016 debating liberals,
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.580]  I'd say, yeah, you know that Donald Trump, and these were Bernie supporters, that Donald
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.339]  Trump taking millions of dollars from big pharmaceutical companies, I just can't accept
[00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:53.339]  that.
[00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:54.859]  And they'd say, yeah.
[00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:55.859]  That's why I like Bernie.
[00:52:55.859 --> 00:52:58.020]  And I'd say, haha, I'm actually kidding you.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.020]  It was Bernie that took millions of dollars from big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.220]  Trump took zero.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220]  That would always get him.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:07.299]  But you can't say that anymore, sadly.
[00:53:07.299 --> 00:53:11.779]  So it's going to be R.F.K., Jr. hammering back against these vaccines.
[00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:15.899]  And it's the mainstream press now censoring him for doing it.
[00:53:15.899 --> 00:53:18.259]  But that's not all they're going after R.F.K., Jr. for.
[00:53:18.259 --> 00:53:20.859]  Now this is just sick.
[00:53:20.859 --> 00:53:27.020]  And this is actually worse because it's easy to understand how a vaccine manufacturing
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:33.819]  company or a big pharmaceutical company that pays billions of dollars to media corporations
[00:53:33.819 --> 00:53:38.140]  to control what they say, oh, they're just marketing their product on the air.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.500]  Yeah, you think that's really what it's all about?
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.500]  No.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.620]  That's like a quarter of what it's about.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.859]  If anything, it's like 20% they want their product marketed on air, and 80% they want
[00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:55.040]  to be able to control the press so that if their products go bad, they won't have any
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.160]  negative press about it.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.700]  But you can kind of wrap your head around that and say, okay, and plus they all lied
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.980]  about the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:09.540]  But let's not forget just just, you know, for a little for a little added for a little
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:10.540]  added.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.779]  What do they call it in a painting when you kind of just paint something off on the side
[00:54:12.779 --> 00:54:13.779]  that really has nothing to do with it?
[00:54:13.779 --> 00:54:14.779]  I forget what it's called.
[00:54:14.779 --> 00:54:19.460]  But, you know, just for a little bit of that, let's not forget that Joe Biden and Kamala
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.460]  Harris.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.460]  Who else was it?
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:26.520]  All the Democrats at the end of 2020 all said they would not take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.700]  They called it Trump's vaccine.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.700]  They said it would be deadly.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.700]  They said it would be dangerous.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.700]  They told you not to take the vaccine.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.500]  And then as soon as Joe Biden got in the office, all of a sudden they all loved the vaccine.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.220]  The vaccine ingredients didn't change.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.580]  The vaccine manufacturers didn't change.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.379]  Nothing changed about the vaccine.
[00:54:41.379 --> 00:54:42.899]  Just who was in the White House changed.
[00:54:42.899 --> 00:54:44.460]  And then all of a sudden they loved it.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:48.259]  But my point is, you can kind of wrap your head around, okay, they want to censor information
[00:54:48.259 --> 00:54:51.379]  about the vaccines that's killing people that they lied to you about and that their corporate
[00:54:51.379 --> 00:54:57.100]  sponsors pay these media these media programs to run their shows.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:01.060]  This is, this is truly on a new level.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:07.100]  ABC News host tells RFK Jr. he's too critical of the CIA, proceeds to censor him while speaking
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.100]  about vaccines.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.680]  Too critical of the CIA.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.100]  Same Lindsay Davis, Lindsay Davis.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.100]  How would you do that?
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:23.560]  You have been very critical of multiple government agencies from the CIA to the FDA, CDC and on.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.680]  How would you run those?
[00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:29.330]  Oh, you're too critical of the CIA.
[00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.890]  You're too critical of the CIA that helped kill your family members and then cover them
[00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:38.450]  up, those murders, with the corporate press.
[00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.650]  So folks, that is dark.
[00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:46.810]  It's one thing, and again, Lindsay Davis, folks, has no clue what planet she's on, okay?
[00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:51.210]  Again, I'm sure she might be a very nice lady, I don't know her, but I'm telling you, as
[00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:56.170]  a corporate prostitute, she clearly doesn't have a clue what planet she lives on.
[00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.810]  Do you think she even knows about the JFK files?
[00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.250]  Do you think she even knows?
[00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.570]  I mean, does she even know who John F. Kennedy Jr. is?
[00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.570]  I mean, I'm sure she's not that stupid, but it's like...
[00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.570]  Do you understand what you're doing here?
[00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:14.570]  You're too critical of the U.S. government that kills your family members.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:23.080]  Wow. That has to make him feel some type of way.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:31.080]  That has to make him feel some type of way to have that go down.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:36.080]  So I think RFK Jr.'s poll numbers are going to increase.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:44.080]  I think that the more activity that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. engages in,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:48.080]  campaign activity, political activity, rallies, TV interviews,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.080]  I mean, he needs to be on full blitz mode right now while Joe Biden is weak.
[00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:58.750]  And you might say, well, Joe Biden's always going to be weak.
[00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.029]  Yeah, well, he's weak now.
[00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:01.390]  The window of opportunity is now.
[00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:10.350]  You swing, you swing at the 0-3 fastball with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth
[00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:12.110]  inning down three runs.
[00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:12.830]  You're swinging.
[00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.150]  You're swinging.
[00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:21.710]  So he needs to be swinging here and he needs to be pushing the gas because that's the only
[00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:22.430]  chance he has.
[00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.509]  And I think he's going to.
[00:57:24.509 --> 00:57:26.190]  That's what I'm that's what I'm seeing going on.
[00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.670]  Now, we got more on this.
[00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:38.509]  Where the corporate press that lied about Donald Trump and just did the most absurd and
[00:57:38.509 --> 00:57:42.830]  rude and crude things towards Donald Trump and his family now saying, don't say anything
[00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:44.830]  negative about Joe Biden and his family.
[00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:45.790]  You can't do that.
[00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:48.670]  We're going to have Joe, Judge Joe Brown in studio.
[00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:54.430]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.029]  We made it even stronger.
[00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.350]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:07.310]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:13.630]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.390]  Should be called 10 hour energy.
[00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:20.430]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things in amino acids
[00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:25.950]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:26.450]  name it.
[00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.430]  It is the super fuel.
[00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:31.870]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:32.910]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:33.790]  They're two different tropics.
[00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:34.990]  They go good with this.
[00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:37.070]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.230]  This is the boss.
[00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:40.990]  Turbo Force back in stock.
[00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.710]  Discounted Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.190]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:54.910]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.630]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.270]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.070]  Period.
[00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.029]  Case closed.
[00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:03.470]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:08.350]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:09.870]  It's been around about 15 years.
[00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:11.710]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:16.190]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.710]  that sells for twice the price.
[00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:21.230]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.390]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:24.430]  Thousands of chemicals.
[00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:25.950]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.830]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:33.150]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:34.029]  leading competitor.
[00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:39.550]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.150]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:42.590]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.270]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.910]  The point is you get the filters at MFORSTORE.COM.
[00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:48.029]  They're discounted right now.
[00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.910]  Only back in stock.
[00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:58.590]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:19.529]  It is mind control. I'm telling you folks, the corporate media, it's already done irreversible
[01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:24.610]  damage to itself from free-thinking Americans, but specifically those on the right wing.
[01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:34.610]  The left wing hasn't really had this realization yet, and the left-wingers that have, have left the Democrat Party and the liberal ideology, but now it's getting worse.
[01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:46.610]  This is from CNN last night, because all they do is lie, and usually nobody calls them out on their lies.
[01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.610]  The media never calls the Democrats out on their lies. They're all in it together.
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:01:01.610]  But it's starting to reach this point where members of the press that are left-wing are realizing, you know, I can't be a liar forever, and some of these lies are just too big to ignore.
[01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:11.610]  Here's a perfect example of that in clip five on CNN last night, where Randi Weingarten, kind of like Anthony Fauci says, oh, I never said lockdown, and there's like hours of clips of him saying it.
[01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:17.610]  So here's Randi Weingarten having her come-to-Jesus moment on CNN last night.
[01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:25.610]  Yeah, we don't know each other, but speaking on behalf of millions of American parents, I have four at home.
[01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:29.610]  I had to teach them at home. My wife had to teach them at home.
[01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:37.610]  I am stunned at what you have said this week about your claiming to have wanted to reopen schools.
[01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.610]  I think most – you'll find that most parents believe you were the tip of the spear of school closures.
[01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:49.610]  I heard numerous statements you made over the summer of 20, scaring people to death about the possibility of opening schools.
[01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:56.610]  And I hear no remorse whatsoever about the generational damage that's been done to these – I have two kids with learning differences.
[01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:02.610]  Do you know how hard it is for them to learn at home and not in a classroom that was designed for them?
[01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:11.610]  And for you to sit in front of Congress and the American people and say, oh, I wanted to open them the whole time, I am shocked.
[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:17.610]  I'm stunned. I'm stunned. And there are millions of parents who feel the exact same way.
[01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:25.610]  Yeah, we're all shocked and stunned that these people lie to us and expect no pushback.
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:30.610]  I mean, folks, we're talking about the most obvious, blatant lies. You can't even believe.
[01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:40.610]  I walk up to you. I shake your hand. You meet me. You say, hey, Owen, that's a nice navy blazer you have on with the white and yellow stripes.
[01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:46.610]  And I say, I'm not wearing a navy blue blazer with white and yellow stripes. That is not true.
[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:53.610]  OK. But OK, aside from the fact that they want to lie and get away with it, how about this?
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:03:00.610]  Anthony Fauci, oh, I never called for lockdowns. I was never a lockdown guy. That wasn't me.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.610]  Oh, yeah. Here's you on 30 different television interviews. Here's an hour of you talking about lockdowns.
[01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:09.610]  Here's all your presentations with Donald Trump talking about lockdowns and 15 days to slow the spread and everything.
[01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:17.610]  Oh, what? Not me. Oh, I never did that. Oh. And now you have Justin Trudeau in Canada.
[01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:23.610]  Oh, I never wanted to make the vaccines mandatory. I never wanted to make anybody take the vaccines.
[01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:29.610]  I was all about vaccine choice. I never shut anybody's bank accounts down. We never stopped the rally.
[01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.610]  That wasn't me. Oh, OK. But hold on a second. Hold on a second.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.660]  Forget that the fact that they're obviously lying.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.660]  Where did their confidence go?
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.660]  What happened to their confidence?
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.660]  They were confident that the vaccines worked.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.660]  They were urging you to get that vaccine
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.660]  because they were positive about how much it worked.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.660]  Now they're saying, oh, no, no, no.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.660]  We never wanted you to take that vaccine.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.660]  We never mandated that vaccine.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.660]  What are you talking about? That's not us.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.660]  No, that was you.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.660]  And you were exuding the utmost confidence
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.660]  when you were doing it.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.660]  Same thing with the lockdowns.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.660]  You were so confident schools had to be closed.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.660]  You were so confident businesses had to be closed.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.660]  You were so confident that was what we had to do
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.660]  to stop the spread.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.660]  And you were confident and you were proud in that moment.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.660]  And now you want to say, I never did lockdown.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.660]  It wasn't me. I never said lockdown anything.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.660]  Or Justin Trudeau, I never said mandate a vaccine.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.660]  I didn't say that about the vaccines.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.660]  We didn't shut down any protests,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.660]  shut down any bank accounts.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.660]  What happened to your...
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660]  Okay, well, you're obviously lying,
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.660]  but, I mean, you were confident.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.660]  You were exuding the utmost confidence
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.660]  telling us to take the vaccine and shut our businesses down.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.660]  So it's not just that they're lying.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:54.660]  Folks, they throw every ounce of themselves behind these lies
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.660]  and then expect you to act like they never said it.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.660]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months,
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.660]  and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.660]  We made it even stronger.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:10.660]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.660]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.660]  or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:21.660]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.660]  that time release over 10 hours.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.660]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.660]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.660]  and a bunch of other key things in amino acids
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.660]  that turbocharge everything
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.660]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.660]  It is the super fuel.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.660]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:42.660]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.660]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.660]  They go good with this.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.660]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.660]  This is the boss.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.660]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted,
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.660]  InfowarsStore.com.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.660]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:08.660]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.660]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:15.660]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.660]  And I'm joined by the great Judge Joe Brown
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.660]  at JudgeJoeBrownTV on Twitter,
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.660]  his website, thejudgejoebrownshow.com.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.660]  And there is all kinds of stuff
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.660]  I want to talk to Judge Joe Brown about right now.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.660]  But, Judge, let me just ask you,
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.660]  what's at the top of your mind today?
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.660]  I mean, we've got the mainstream media collapsing in on itself
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.660]  with the firing of Tucker Carlson,
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.660]  the censoring of RFK Jr.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.660]  You've got the double standard
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.660]  in how they cover Joe Biden
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.660]  versus how they cover Donald Trump.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.660]  You've got the political persecution of Donald Trump.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.660]  These are some big things I'd like to hear your opinion on.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.660]  What is the biggest story to you right now?
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.660]  Well, it's the lack of good common sense.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.660]  That's the mainstream story right now.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.660]  Let's take what they're doing.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.660]  This character Bragg is doing to Trump
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.660]  with these indictments.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.660]  It's a lack of thought.
[01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:28.850]  He's essentially saying that Trump committed a felony by paying a young lady to keep quiet
[01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:32.730]  about certain embarrassing things, Stormy Daniels.
[01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:41.130]  Now, when I was in law school, and when I taught law students myself, I always learned
[01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:48.230]  and taught that you flip the script, ask the thing the other way around.
[01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:54.530]  If somebody says, if you don't pay me something, I'll embarrass you.
[01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:55.530]  What is that?
[01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.530]  Extortion.
[01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:57.530]  It's blackmail.
[01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:58.530]  Blackmail.
[01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:59.530]  Extortion.
[01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:00.530]  It's a felony.
[01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:03.650]  Sorry, I was pretending to be your law student for a second here.
[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:04.650]  Yeah.
[01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:10.050]  So Bragg indicted the victim of blackmail.
[01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:13.090]  So I mean, think how preposterous that is.
[01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:19.410]  Next thing is American law encourages settlement rather than going to trial.
[01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:25.730]  So if somebody complied with the spirit of the law, they attempted to settle this matter
[01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:31.330]  rather than trying it, you indict them for complying with the law.
[01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.810]  When you have a settlement, there's a gag provision.
[01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.410]  You don't tell the details.
[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:46.130]  So when the corporate entity files its returns, and it says for a matter involving Stormy
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:52.970]  Daniels, and it doesn't get explicit, well, if they had, since it's a public record, that
[01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:56.170]  would have violated the gag provision.
[01:08:56.170 --> 01:09:00.090]  So again, you've indicted somebody for what?
[01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:06.410]  Complying with the law, and you've indicted them because they didn't violate the law.
[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:13.050]  Next thing is you want to hold Trump responsible for what a corporation did.
[01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:23.090]  Well, under the 15th Amendment and through a long series of cases, corporations are fictitious
[01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:24.330]  people.
[01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:28.730]  That's how you don't have to worry about your money.
[01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:34.250]  If a corporation gets in trouble, you might lose what you invested, but they can't go
[01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.810]  after your bank account.
[01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:44.610]  So here you are going after a private citizen for what another person did.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:52.660]  He supposedly got benefit of this corporation helping him with the
[01:09:53.010 --> 01:10:02.810]  payout on the blackmail, and another individual was brought in that too, but nine times out
[01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:10.290]  of 10, anytime you get a settlement or a fine or a cost, it's a relative or business associate
[01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:14.530]  or a friend that's helping out the individual in question.
[01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:21.290]  So in other words, this silly simpleton up there decided to campaign on, I'm going to
[01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:28.610]  take down Trump, so you individually got to get in the way of 360 million Americans and
[01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:36.090]  decide that you want to impose your little sick, far out fantasy of the world on somebody
[01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:44.570]  else for simply doing what is par for the course for the entirety of this country's history.
[01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.570]  It's ridiculous.
[01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:51.210]  And the same thing with what's going on down there in Georgia.
[01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:57.570]  Now that one about, go find some more votes.
[01:10:57.570 --> 01:10:58.570]  That's not illegal.
[01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.610]  That's just simple advocacy.
[01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:02.210]  That's First Amendment.
[01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:09.330]  It may not be your idea of the exactitude of the language that's required, but it's permissible.
[01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:15.170]  And the whole thing, what is it, 73 to 76% of the American population thinks something
[01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.890]  was wrong with that 2020 election.
[01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:24.290]  And it's an interesting side effect down here in Memphis and Shelby County, where I am running
[01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:33.210]  for mayor, well, right after the Justice Department on the one hand said there was nothing wrong
[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:39.490]  with that election, a few days later, they issued their quarterly report down here in
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:45.650]  the Memphis area, said once again, these hacked and corrupted election machines prevented
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:48.290]  a fair election from occurring.
[01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:52.770]  Now Memphis is about the 14th largest city in the United States.
[01:11:52.770 --> 01:12:00.850]  So if it had a problem, how can you turn around and say the same agency of government say there
[01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:06.370]  was no problem, say it's inconsistency and we just don't think about these things.
[01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:09.690]  So maybe we need to start getting deep off in it.
[01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:16.490]  But with that said, I'm surprised that all of these learned legal authorities around
[01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:20.410]  the country haven't mentioned this.
[01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:25.090]  They haven't even done what I downgrade a first year law student on for not picking
[01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.090]  up.
[01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:32.770]  Okay, is that bribery by saying here, here's money that you want so you don't embarrass
[01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:33.770]  me?
[01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:38.690]  Or is that blackmail for having to pay somebody to be quiet?
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:46.940]  Well, it's funny that you bring this up, because that part, I had not really heard that angle.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.160]  The stuff with the non-disclosure agreement, I'd kind of heard before, but not the way
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.660]  you presented it.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.700]  But you said it so perfectly.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.840]  Trump is the one who's victimized by a blackmail extortion campaign.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:05.440]  Trump is the one who actually has followed the agreements in the non-disclosure document
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.960]  that he signed with Stormy Daniels.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.040]  He's the only one following the law here.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.240]  He's the victim.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.320]  He's the one that ends up getting prosecuted.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.160]  I mean, that really is the absurdity of it in a nutshell.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.720]  And you know what that is?
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:27.040]  Bragg may be guilty of some ethical lapses that the state bar might need to look at.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.400]  It's malicious prosecution.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.880]  And in any event, when it comes to trial, the subject is being removal.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.240]  And the other thing is, it's on a challenge of some judge that, as the balls might say,
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.600]  it doesn't even state a crime dismissed.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.920]  So where are we going in American law if we allow this?
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.800]  And the other thing is, you haven't heard what I said before about the blackmail.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.800]  Why not?
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.720]  Well, you know, let me say this.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720]  I didn't go to a bad law school.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]  It was UCLA.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.960]  I kind of came out at the top of the damn thing.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.120]  But then I got to thinking about it.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:10.560]  I don't look that old to me, but I've been doing this for a half century.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.040]  And I just said, most of the people that have been in this game as long as me are dead now
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.680]  or, you know, disabled or long retired.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.680]  How come it is that there's nobody out there now that thinks clearly like, wow, first year
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.920]  law students, you didn't get this.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.480]  What's the matter with you?
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:35.160]  Judge, judge, we've got people in this country that can't even pass a basic first grade biology
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.160]  test now when it comes to what a man and a woman is.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:44.680]  So I don't know if a first year law student not understanding this should be such a surprise.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.320]  But you know, I got to tell you, I'm not about that.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.680]  The latest member of the Supreme Court gets asked, what's a woman?
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.720]  I don't know what's a woman.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.560]  She could have said herself.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.960]  I mean, she's like, I'm the first black woman.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.960]  I'm the first black woman.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.680]  But she doesn't even know what a woman is.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.320]  Yeah, you won't be on U.S. Supreme Court.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.920]  You don't know what a woman is.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.440]  Now, I know two people, the Honorable Bernice Donald, who was on the Sixth Circuit Court
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.360]  of Appeals, Roger E. Clifton, who's on the same circuit, Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  I know them.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.600]  You mean they certainly could tell you what a woman is.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  This is ridiculous.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.560]  And you know what else it is?
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:37.000]  It is a direct code signal, political signal to the transsexual community that she's going
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.480]  to be on their side, which is inappropriate.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.600]  Yeah, and that kind of delves into a lot of these issues we find out with the child sexual
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.000]  abuse issues.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.040]  Judge Contenji Brown is ruining the good name of Judge Joe Brown here.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.740]  We will not stand for that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.880]  We will not stand for that.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.880]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:25.889]  You know, I'm not really an authoritarian dictator, but if I ever was, I would preserve
[01:20:25.889 --> 01:20:32.130]  Judge Joe Brown's DNA and I would clone him as many times as needed to fill every judge
[01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.530]  seat in my country.
[01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:40.610]  I'm not an authoritarian dictator, so I'm just saying, if I was, and maybe if there's
[01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:44.450]  one in the future, Judge Joe, we may have to preserve your DNA, just in case we get
[01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:45.809]  to that point.
[01:20:45.809 --> 01:20:51.969]  But it is a shame that Judge Brown Jackson is destroying your good name with her nonsense.
[01:20:51.969 --> 01:20:58.730]  But quickly, let's finalize the Trump stuff here, because again, this is such a key takeaway,
[01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:00.610]  what you said there in the first segment.
[01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:06.530]  Trump gets blackmailed, so he has to have a nondisclosure and apparently hush money
[01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:08.750]  with this lady to stop the blackmailing.
[01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:13.370]  He does it, is the story, what they want us to believe, and then has the NDAA.
[01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:18.490]  So he's the one that gets blackmailed, tries to stop this from destroying his life.
[01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:20.370]  Then he signs the NDAA.
[01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:22.090]  He's the only one that's abided by it.
[01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:26.650]  I don't believe Stormy Daniels is, clearly she's violated it, and yet, so Stormy Daniels
[01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:31.490]  is really the one, it appears, has broken the law twice in this situation, and yet it's
[01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:34.610]  Trump the one ended up being indicted.
[01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:37.450]  I mean, is that the proper analysis here?
[01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:42.410]  I'd say that would be quite true.
[01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:49.370]  Again, Trump is the victim of a blackmail attempt, an extortion attempt.
[01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:56.490]  He complies, and because he complies as a victim, he's prosecuted.
[01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:03.290]  There is a nondisclosure agreement that would be violated if the corporate entity fully
[01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:07.330]  disclosed what it was about, since that would be public record.
[01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:14.610]  So he doesn't violate the gag, or somebody doesn't violate it on his behalf, he's prosecuted.
[01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:20.370]  The next thing, American law, irrespective of what the issue is, does encourage settlement.
[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:25.730]  So he complies with the spirit of the law, or somebody does that on his behalf, and he
[01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:27.730]  gets re-indicted.
[01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:35.570]  That's absolutely ridiculous, and what it goes on to show is a lack of sophistication,
[01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:42.770]  and experience in the law that is so manifest these days, where you get people in high positions
[01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:44.690]  that aren't really qualified.
[01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:46.770]  Now, I'll give you an example.
[01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:52.530]  Right here in Shelby County, when I was on the bench, this has been some years ago, we
[01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:54.690]  got a new DA appointed.
[01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:57.650]  He was two and a half hours late for his swearing in.
[01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:58.850]  You know why?
[01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:03.890]  Because he'd never been to the criminal justice center a day in his career.
[01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:05.570]  He did not know where it was.
[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:10.050]  They had to literally tell him, hey, stay by the phone booth, we'll send somebody to
[01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:11.090]  get you.
[01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:14.450]  Now, that's how bad it gets.
[01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:20.530]  Well, and that leads me to where I wanted to go next, was, you know, not every judge,
[01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:27.570]  not every person involved with the legal process in this country is as mad as people like Judge
[01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:32.370]  Brown Jackson, or as incompetent as this other gentleman that you just mentioned.
[01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:35.010]  You've been around for a long time.
[01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.610]  A lot of people look up to you, respect you, I'm sure like to communicate with you about
[01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:39.250]  these issues.
[01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:42.050]  Are you hearing from lawyers?
[01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:45.570]  Are you hearing from other judges, prosecuting attorneys, et cetera?
[01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:49.410]  Are they talking to you saying, hey, what the heck is going on in this country?
[01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:53.330]  The story of Donald Trump was one of the biggest stories in the world, certainly the biggest
[01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:54.770]  story in America at the time.
[01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:57.330]  Do people reach out to you and they say, Judge, what is going on here?
[01:23:57.330 --> 01:23:59.170]  I can't believe this has happened to my country.
[01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:01.330]  Yes, they do.
[01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:05.250]  But the problem is, is that mainstream media wants to suppress that.
[01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:10.450]  By the way, there's something interesting that you can look at and observe.
[01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:12.850]  There's this thing called Twitter space.
[01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:15.170]  You have to use your cell phone to call in.
[01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:19.410]  And when you do, you can join in this roundtable discussion.
[01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:26.770]  And it usually records the number of people who are in on the operation.
[01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:33.490]  Now, we noticed that when boss Elon Musk gets on and does a Twitter space,
[01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:41.170]  the flunkies he hasn't found out about and fired yet, they turn off the algorithm so
[01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.930]  the boss doesn't notice it.
[01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:51.570]  So I noticed we were doing a Twitter space a week or so ago, and Musk was on with BBC.
[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:53.730]  Well, he came on later.
[01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:57.650]  So we were showing 63 people tuned in.
[01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:59.410]  Musk got on.
[01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:05.970]  And two minutes later, the algorithms went off and it jumped up to 6,900 people on it.
[01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.050]  It went up to almost 8,000.
[01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:13.970]  And then a minute or two after he signed off, they turn it back on and it dropped down to
[01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:14.610]  84.
[01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:19.650]  This, say, it's interesting when this happens.
[01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:25.970]  So wait, do you think that's going on because there's people trying to control what content
[01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:29.810]  people can and can't see on Twitter, but then they don't want Elon Musk to know they're
[01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:30.310]  doing that?
[01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:32.850]  They don't want him to know.
[01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:38.930]  See, when you've got a bureaucracy, the science of bureaucracy suggests that there are a lot
[01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:45.490]  of people in and about the bureaucracies who aren't on board with the people at the top.
[01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:46.690]  Sometimes that's good.
[01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.890]  Sometimes that's bad.
[01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:52.530]  But they do their thing because there are switches they can flip now, dials they can
[01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:58.450]  turn, memoranda they can sit on and things not done.
[01:25:58.450 --> 01:25:59.810]  No, it's bureaucracy.
[01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.250]  But that happens.
[01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:02.850]  And why do they do that?
[01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:07.650]  It's so that they don't want anybody to say, wow, this is trending.
[01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.410]  Why are all these people listening here?
[01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.010]  Let's see what they've got to say.
[01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:20.450]  Now, a gentleman, a young man who raises his three kids by himself and former NBA player
[01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:28.530]  Kwame Brown and I were on one time on YouTube and we screenshot when we got up to nine point
[01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:29.810]  eight million views.
[01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:35.010]  So they didn't want anybody to see this because that's viral.
[01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:38.370]  They didn't want anybody to hear what we were saying.
[01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:44.210]  So it dropped down to six point three, five point eight million and a quarter.
[01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:48.610]  Now it's six hundred and ninety some thousand, which means, oh, wow.
[01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:51.330]  That must mean I don't feel like bothering.
[01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:55.330]  But if it's nine point eight million, I got to see what everybody's talking about.
[01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:58.610]  You see, it's a propaganda technique.
[01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:06.530]  You understand that one of the preeminent principles of propaganda is to get the other
[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:14.690]  side to feel a lack of confidence that they have something worth saying or holding to.
[01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:21.090]  So you convince them that nobody is listening to them and you convince others that nobody
[01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:21.970]  wants to hear it.
[01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:27.810]  Nobody pays attention and gets tempted to get outside the party line.
[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:31.570]  See, we have a big problem in America right now.
[01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:34.930]  I had a visiting foreign professor.
[01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:41.490]  Fifty five years ago, I wound up being her teaching assistant and she told me she said
[01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:50.690]  America is in grave danger of becoming a fascist nation, not from some jackboot wearing goose
[01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:52.930]  stepping uniform thugs.
[01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:57.330]  But she put it in a humorous way in today's terms.
[01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:07.890]  But she said from some pink panty wearing long haired hippies who would be glad to impose
[01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:13.330]  the worst methods of fascism so they can pursue their perversions.
[01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:18.290]  And that's kind of where we are right now.
[01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:23.250]  Yeah, and that is a much deeper thought that we can go into on the other side of this break.
[01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.050]  And I want to kind of finish some of the points that you made there.
[01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:28.290]  We're about up against the break.
[01:28:28.290 --> 01:28:31.810]  But for example, you know, a lot of people think, well, how can this be going on at Twitter
[01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:33.410]  with Elon Musk still in control?
[01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:39.330]  I'll address that and the larger issue about what you're talking about when Judge Joe Brown
[01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:43.250]  and Kwame Brown do a show that gets 10 million views.
[01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:46.210]  Well, why do they want you to know it got 10 million views?
[01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:47.330]  Well, I'll tell you why, folks.
[01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:51.170]  It's the same reason why they don't want you to know Donald Trump gets millions of views
[01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:51.970]  on his rallies.
[01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:55.090]  Joe Biden couldn't get a thousand people to tune into a speech he did the other day.
[01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:03.810]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.170]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:07.890]  People said, no way he's the most powerful ever happened.
[01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:10.050]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:12.610]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:15.810]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.570]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:23.730]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe
[01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:24.290]  Rogan.
[01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:29.250]  We are only beholden to our viewers, our listeners, and when you support us, we're
[01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:30.050]  unstoppable.
[01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:34.690]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:38.370]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:41.570]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:44.130]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:45.490]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:49.330]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products
[01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:51.250]  at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:52.610]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:29:52.690 --> 01:29:57.330]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit
[01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:58.210]  to these tyrants.
[01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:24.850]  should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:29.890]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:35.650]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:36.150]  it.
[01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:39.890]  It is the super fuel.
[01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:41.330]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:42.370]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.250]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:44.450]  They go good with this.
[01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:46.530]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:48.690]  This is the boss.
[01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:51.410]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted.
[01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:53.170]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:55.650]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:05.490]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:09.250]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:11.330]  and your body and keep us on air.
[01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:16.610]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of
[01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:19.810]  you for years, and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:25.410]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:28.530]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:31.650]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:33.010]  That's great, and I thank you.
[01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:34.530]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:38.450]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD

[01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:47.650]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:48.930]  So get off the bench.
[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.810]  Get in the game.

[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:04.210]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:07.250]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:26.020]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:28.020]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:32.140]  All right, Judge Joe Brown made a great point at the end of that segment.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:36.940]  I want to respond to some of the other stuff he said.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.700]  You know, people might be surprised when they hear these stories about Twitter still dealing
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:45.500]  with censorship and other stuff behind the scenes.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:50.140]  You know, folks, we've got a pretty small crew here, not too big a crew, probably the
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.820]  best crew we've ever had.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:54.700]  I trust every single one of the crew members here.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:58.300]  But I mean, even a small crew like this, folks, we've had people in the past that can sabotage
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.460]  stuff and bad actors here.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.580]  And you think, well, how can that be going on in a small crew?
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.580]  It happens.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:08.700]  Imagine when you're Elon Musk with a huge company, one of like five or six huge companies
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.220]  that he runs.
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:13.620]  It's a lot easier for bad actors to get in there.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:19.220]  But now to get to the issue that you highlighted, why would YouTube want you not to know that
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:25.620]  Kwame Brown and Judge Joe Brown get 10 million views on a show they did?
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:30.340]  Well, it's the same reason they don't want you to know that Joe Biden the other day went
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:34.700]  live on, I think it was a Twitter video or YouTube video, and he couldn't even get a
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.660]  thousand people to tune in.
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.780]  Trump goes live on his Rumble channel and hundreds of thousands tune in.
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:45.220]  Right side broadcasting, hundreds of thousands of tune in because it's the championship effect.
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:49.860]  Why do they sell a champion's hat and a shirt after the team wins a championship?
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.860]  Because people want to be part of the winning team.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:56.220]  And so if they think, hey, Judge Joe Brown and Kwame Brown are the winning team, they're
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.580]  getting 10 million views and more people are going to watch them.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.580]  They can't have that.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:05.140]  They have to have all these losers that don't get those views, get the views because they
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.860]  aren't speaking their own minds.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.220]  They're speaking corporate propaganda.
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:10.700]  So just speak to that for a second.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.620]  People may be not understanding how Elon Musk's Twitter could still be dealing with bad actors
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:23.580]  and why censoring popular content is such a major agenda right now that we see from the
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:24.580]  American left.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:34.380]  Well, OK, first off, Musk is concentrating on getting the Starship going.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:40.020]  The Starship is a massive heavy lift rocket system.
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:47.940]  It's got 18 million pounds of thrust, which is the most powerful device humans have ever
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:48.940]  made.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:56.620]  It is capable of putting 150 tons of payload in the low Earth orbit and taking 100 people
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:59.260]  to the moon or to Mars.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:05.300]  And they're trying to get this thing operational in the next few months or at least get a successful
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.300]  launch orbit in recovery.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.820]  Now, is that the Falcon 9, the Starship Falcon 9?
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.820]  Is that what it is?
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:15.140]  Well, yeah, that's one of the things they're calling it.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:21.460]  But when you put the whole thing together, it's the biggest missile or rocket or system
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.780]  ever put together.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:28.300]  It's Dwarfs, Saturn 5.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:34.620]  And I remember years ago, a roommate and I went down to Florida to watch the night launch
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.540]  and we were a long way from that.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:41.420]  It lift the sky up and became daylight.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.420]  The ground shook.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:48.180]  We were told to try holding up car keys and they rattled and shook.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:59.180]  And this is not the entirety of this system, it's part of it, but it is a monstrous thing.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:05.340]  And because it looks like an old sci-fi rocket out of Buck Rogers, the scale of the thing
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:08.900]  is not apparent, but it's enormous.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:17.940]  So just think, you can get a hundred passengers on board, you're blasting a 747 into orbit,
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:20.660]  so to speak.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:26.340]  So in other words, Musk is busy trailblazing for the future of humanity.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.620]  Sometimes bad actors at Twitter fall through the cracks.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.620]  Yeah.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.900]  And he hasn't had a chance to get everybody out.
[01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:36.950]  So they take their shot.
[01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:40.950]  And some of these algorithms are running quietly,
[01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:44.950]  and just like anything else that we might have to deal with
[01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:53.950]  that is adversely into doing what some people want to do
[01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:58.950]  where they don't want any competition in the thought process,
[01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:00.950]  they sneak stuff in.
[01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:03.950]  And that's the way of it.
[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:06.950]  So we kind of have to sort of be vigilant
[01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:10.950]  and help Mr. Musk out and report this.
[01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.950]  Nowadays, for example, the blue check thing has been democratized,
[01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:20.950]  and the funniest thing I've seen in a long time
[01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:24.950]  is this spoof they have on there.
[01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:27.950]  Help out a liberal.
[01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:31.950]  They have money, but they can't see how to spend it.
[01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:36.950]  Send in what's necessary, $9,
[01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:39.950]  so you can get a liberal a blue check,
[01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:42.950]  so they can feel comfort.
[01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:47.950]  They're doing charity drives for blue check.
[01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:50.950]  You know, like the polar bear in danger.
[01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:54.950]  Send in $19 a month to the World Wildlife Fund.
[01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:55.950]  That's funny.
[01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:56.950]  We should queue up.
[01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:57.950]  It's Sarah McLaughlin, I think.
[01:38:57.950 --> 01:39:01.950]  It's like, on the eyes of an angel.
[01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:05.950]  It's like a liberal has just lost their Twitter verification,
[01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:11.950]  but you can send them $9 a month and save them from being abysmal.
[01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:18.950]  So the point is that these clowns out there don't get it.
[01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:22.950]  They think that if they restrict what people can hear,
[01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:23.950]  they will buy into that.
[01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:26.950]  Now, look at that thing you just got through mentioning
[01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:28.950]  about the election bit.
[01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:34.950]  73% to 76% of the American public does not buy that election.
[01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:36.950]  There you go.
[01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:38.950]  That's it.
[01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:39.950]  Yeah.
[01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:40.950]  Oh, my God.
[01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:42.950]  Wait, is this real?
[01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:43.950]  This is it.
[01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:44.950]  Okay, the Babylon Bee did that.
[01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:47.950]  I mean, okay, so the humor's already been done.
[01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:48.950]  Good.
[01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:49.950]  There it is, though.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:58.220]  That's, that's, that's funny stuff.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:01.340]  This is hilarious when you look at it.
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:10.140]  She's got to be rubbing somebody down there who's in her lap and going, oh my God, $8.
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:15.740]  Just $8 and save a liberal.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:16.740]  Oh my gosh.
[01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:21.490]  But it's the state of things.
[01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:22.490]  I mean, it's it's it's amazing.
[01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:24.490]  The Babylon Bee has to exist.
[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.490]  Now, you don't even know.
[01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:27.490]  You don't even know what's humor and what's not.
[01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:30.490]  They got our blue check.
[01:40:30.490 --> 01:40:31.490]  Hey, watch this.
[01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:32.490]  This is so funny.
[01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:34.490]  Guys, give us the video, the audio here.
[01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:37.490]  Oh, maybe we can't get the audio.
[01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:38.490]  I don't know.
[01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:39.490]  There we go.
[01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:41.490]  Become an absolute waste of a human being.
[01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:44.490]  Browser database of needy lips today.
[01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:45.490]  Please act now.
[01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:50.490]  Because due to inflation, $8 will soon be worth $4.
[01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:53.490]  And then you'll have to pay $16.
[01:40:53.490 --> 01:40:56.490]  Right now, there's a lip who's in need.
[01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:58.490]  And you can help.
[01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:59.490]  Don't wait.
[01:40:59.490 --> 01:41:02.490]  Every minute, more lips fade into obscurity.
[01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:06.490]  And even though they're definitively rich enough to pay for themselves,
[01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:11.490]  their liberal worldview dictates that you should be the one to shoulder the burden.
[01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:14.490]  It's the compassionate thing to do.
[01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:17.490]  I want it.
[01:41:17.490 --> 01:41:19.490]  I want it.
[01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:24.490]  So it's the typical, you know, they don't like spending their own money,
[01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:25.490]  but they love spending someone else's.
[01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:26.490]  It's okay.
[01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:28.490]  Elon Musk can't get you here.
[01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:30.490]  You're going to stay verified.
[01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:31.490]  It's kind of like taxes.
[01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:33.490]  Isn't it kind of like taxes?
[01:41:33.490 --> 01:41:36.490]  Because, you know, all these people that want more taxes,
[01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.490]  you're free to pay more taxes.
[01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:39.490]  I guarantee you.
[01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:41.490]  You cut a check to the government right now.
[01:41:41.490 --> 01:41:43.490]  You cut a check to the IRS, the Treasury right now.
[01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:44.490]  They will take your money.
[01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:46.490]  They will gladly take your money.
[01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:48.490]  Quit asking them to take my money.
[01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:50.490]  I don't want them to take my money.
[01:41:50.490 --> 01:41:52.490]  Well, that's it.
[01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:55.490]  See, they don't get it.
[01:41:55.490 --> 01:42:04.490]  It's somebody else should be paying so we can be what we want to be.
[01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:08.490]  That's the wrong thing.
[01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:11.490]  Be all you can be.
[01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:13.490]  You can be a damn fool.
[01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:16.490]  But be what you ought to be.
[01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:22.490]  And, by the way, I gave a speech one time or some remarks to an assemblage of
[01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:25.490]  the Corps of Engineers out in Los Angeles.
[01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:29.490]  There were about 250 officers and noncoms in there.
[01:42:29.490 --> 01:42:33.490]  And when I said that, I said, you know, the Army's got it wrong.
[01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:37.490]  It's not be all you can be because you can be a damn fool.
[01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:40.490]  It's be what you ought to be.
[01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:42.490]  And they gave me a standing ovation.
[01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:44.490]  That's Judge Joe Brown.
[01:42:44.490 --> 01:42:46.490]  We're up against a break here.
[01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:47.490]  One more segment with Judge Joe Brown.
[01:42:47.490 --> 01:42:49.490]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:55.490]  And when we upload this video later to Bandot Video, take it and spread it far and wide.
[01:42:56.490 --> 01:43:15.490]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.490]  So support InfoWars store.
[01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:22.490]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:23.490]  I don't know.
[01:43:23.490 --> 01:43:26.490]  Drugs are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:31.490]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:32.490]  Krill oil.
[01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:39.490]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:41.490]  And I would urge everyone.
[01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:42.490]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:44.490]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:45.490]  But the day will come.
[01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:48.490]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:50.490]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.490]  Mineral fusion.
[01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:52.490]  Absolutely.
[01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:55.490]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:58.490]  You have to have these products.
[01:44:03.490 --> 01:44:04.490]  This is their big move.
[01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:08.490]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:09.490]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:11.490]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:13.490]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:16.490]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:17.490 --> 01:44:21.490]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.490 --> 01:44:23.490]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:26.490]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:29.490]  No, no, no.
[01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:30.490]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.490 --> 01:44:33.490]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.490 --> 01:44:37.490]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:39.490]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.490 --> 01:44:42.490]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:45.490]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:48.490]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:44:48.490 --> 01:44:49.490]  You're right.
[01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:51.490]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:51.490 --> 01:44:53.490]  And we say no.
[01:44:53.490 --> 01:44:55.490]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:03.490]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:06.490]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists.
[01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:11.490]  The fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:45:11.490 --> 01:45:14.490]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:45:14.490 --> 01:45:21.490]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
[01:45:21.490 --> 01:45:28.490]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time,

[01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:42.490]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:48.490]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening,

[01:45:58.490 --> 01:46:07.490]  Right now I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsStore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:10.490]  that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:19.490]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:28.490]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsStore.com and never experience these great products and never fund the operation.
[01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:31.490]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:34.490]  That's great and I thank you, but we need funds to operate.
[01:46:34.490 --> 01:46:42.490]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sleep Aid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill.
[01:46:42.490 --> 01:46:45.490]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:47.490]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:56.490]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:56.490 --> 01:47:03.490]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:26.260]  Alright, last segment here with Judge Joe Brown and a couple segments ago, I don't remember
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:35.220]  how exactly you put it, but basically how they're putting degenerates and inept minds
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:42.740]  in positions of power so that they can get away with or even normalize their degeneracy
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:46.300]  in all kinds of different walks of life.
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:50.280]  And so I'm kind of butchering, trying to paraphrase how you put it.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:56.020]  But I think I get what you're saying, specifically relating to Judge Katenji Brown-Jackson.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.820]  It's like a sign where, you know, they make jokes on Family Guy where a transgender person
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:06.020]  is at a bar watching an adult film and the bartender walks over and says, hey, you can't
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.020]  watch that in here.
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:08.020]  This is a family establishment.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.020]  He says, oh, no, it's OK.
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.020]  I'm transgender.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.500]  And the bartender goes, oh, oh, I didn't realize that.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.060]  Then do whatever the hell you want all the time.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.300]  And it's kind of like that's the attitude they want people to have engaged in degenerate
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.340]  behavior to say, hey, let's normalize this.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.420]  Let's promote this.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:27.020]  And then the real degenerates love it because then they can kind of get away with it.
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:29.580]  I'm paraphrasing here, but expand on that idea.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:35.580]  Well, it's not even just degenerate physical conduct.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:42.980]  It's another kind of degeneracy that's even more insidious.
[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:50.500]  Way humanity has evolved, when the Titanic goes down, the men get up and say, ma'am,
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:54.900]  you and your child may have my seat on the lifeboat.
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:56.480]  I'll drown with the ship.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.540]  You can survive.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:05.380]  You are a resource, and it's a man's job to defend, protect, and provide for women and
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.380]  children.
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:14.540]  Well, they've co-opted that, and they want to get on the lifeboat instead of the women
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.300]  and children.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:23.540]  And then when it comes to that, the other problem is that, you know, there's this thing
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:26.180]  called sexual attraction.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:30.940]  One of my favorite pastimes, and for most men, used to be girl-watching.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:35.300]  I even had a few songs about it.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:39.700]  So we can't girl-watch now because you don't know what you're looking at.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:48.140]  Now if you take lions, tigers, grizzly bears, birds, alligators, whatever, the boys and
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:52.140]  girls look differently, different.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:58.220]  They smell different, they're different sizes, they act different.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:03.940]  And humans look very different when they're unclothed, but humans don't walk around naked
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:06.900]  except maybe at resorts.
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:15.380]  So there is this tradition where the clothes you wear kind of reflect what's underneath,
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.220]  but when they stop doing that, that throws it off.
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:25.740]  You see, when boys and girls grow up, they have to learn to deal with each other.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:30.900]  The opposite sex is mystifying and baffling.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:38.300]  And this thing called sexual gratification, you know, getting satisfied, getting it off,
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:45.460]  getting it on, you know, that becomes very satisfying, and it becomes an incentive to
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:50.140]  go out and find out how to deal with the opposite sex.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.740]  When you take that out of the picture and say, you don't need to worry about that, you
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:51:02.300]  can go get your gratification over here, that has a bad fallout, wherein the boys and
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:08.340]  girls don't get one-on-one A in school, they never really did formally, but they don't get
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:13.220]  it in the culture they're in, they don't get it in their entertainments, and they're kind
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:18.380]  of left baffled by how do we get along with the opposite sex.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.180]  So it has all kinds of detrimental effects.
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:26.660]  Now, I don't care if somebody gets their freak on in the bedroom, that's their thing.
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:28.780]  Be gay if you want.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:35.540]  But see, there is a cult involved with this, and I was in an affair in Atlanta this last
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:42.780]  weekend, and a very nice young lady who identified herself as a lesbian, she introduced
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:50.540]  her wife, she stood up in the audience, they were attractive, but she absolutely condemned
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.300]  LGBTQ.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:59.900]  She said, it's a cult, it's poisonous, and they're trying to pervert the family.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:04.140]  They're trying to pervert the interaction between men and women.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:11.780]  They're trying to absolve the concepts of duty, honor, obligation, responsibility, accountability.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:17.540]  They're trying to destroy this paradigm where men especially and women also try to make
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:23.260]  where they live a better, safer, more secure place filled with economic prosperity, sense
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:30.940]  of purpose, morality, and ethics, where people can be brave and courageous when necessary
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:36.100]  but are otherwise men and women of public peace, dignity, and order.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:41.900]  They want to destroy this fund that men and women traditionally have had with each other.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:49.100]  I mean, it's about the next generation, the generation after that, and Mother Nature's
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:54.620]  been working at that for a very long time.
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:57.980]  Done pretty well, too.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.980]  And what do you make of it?
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:04.860]  Because I kind of, I mean, I'll go one step further where, okay, let's say in the 90s,
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:10.460]  early 2000s, you had, I guess, what they call the LGBTQ community at the time.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:14.340]  It was just, you know, everybody was considered queer or I guess gay.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.340]  And so they'd have the gay pride marches.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:22.900]  And it was basically groups of people dressed relatively normally, maybe wearing some flags
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.060]  and some other symbolism.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:29.140]  But I mean, for the most part, the average person could see that and at least relate
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:31.180]  to it in some way, shape, or form.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:38.340]  You look at a gay pride parade in the year 2022-2023, it's just a sexual degeneracy club.
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.240]  It's like going to the strip club or something, and they have these little kids there.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.900]  And so that's how I kind of see it, too.
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.140]  It's like this disguise, like a Trojan horse.
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.300]  It's like, hey, we're just trying to have equal rights for all.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.900]  We just want equal rights for gay people.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.540]  Well, you've already got them.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:55.180]  And now all of a sudden, you're turning it into something completely different.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:54:00.180]  You want to normalize degeneracy, normalize sexual perversions.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:04.560]  And sadly, that's where we would normally draw the line.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:07.980]  But they've got this whole thing where, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:14.580]  Anything you speak out against what the LGBTQIA plus 669 hut hut hike community is doing, well,
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:15.940]  now you're a bigot.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:28.100]  You know, somebody showed me a video one time, and I looked at it, and this woman was saying,
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:36.140]  this is a gay, one of these LGBTQ things, and the males were up there with their stuff
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.140]  hanging out.
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:40.540]  And this woman was saying, honey, go up there and get on the float.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.100]  He wants you to pull his wing.
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:43.100]  Go do it.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:47.060]  And I'm going, whoa, and I'm out.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.540]  You know, this is a little bit far out here.
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:53.820]  That's not a good thing.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.900]  You don't sexually use children.
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:04.020]  And the other thing is, oh, he wanted to be a girl since he's been two, so I'm trying
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:06.020]  to help him out.
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:11.180]  Well, mommy, mommy, mommy, I want to be a snake.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.860]  All right, honey.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:18.420]  First, wait, mommy will help you get your arms and legs amputated so you can slither
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:19.420]  around.
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:22.900]  See, that's not the way.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:23.900]  Look at this.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:26.580]  And people might think, hey, that's a reach.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:30.380]  No, that's a that's a logical conclusion to this trend.
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:34.300]  If you can if you can mangle and mutilate a little child that says they want to be something
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:38.260]  they're not, then who's to say it doesn't stop with them wanting to be snake people or
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.260]  whale people or whatever?
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:47.140]  Yeah, and then see, look at the names they have and why do we have them talking to?
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:56.700]  These children and they get dressed up as a parody of women, they look like harlots
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:04.460]  who have aged and are madams in a bravo, so they put this negative image out there to
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:13.980]  the children, they're dressed up as females and psychologically human children are most
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:17.900]  receptive to the female until they get almost eight years old.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:24.620]  So they put them in first, second, third grade talking to the kids in the libraries and in
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.900]  the school system.
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:29.059]  And that means they're most receptive to that.
[01:56:29.059 --> 01:56:33.900]  So they start getting this thing in their heads that stays with them for the rest of
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:39.900]  their lives. Now, I can remember the songs that I got taught first, second, third grade,
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:44.300]  some of the things we got taught in school and they've stuck with me.
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:46.180]  And I'm thinking, oh, my goodness.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:51.020]  I'm an old man, so to speak.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:56.900]  So what are these kids going to think when they get old, man, what kind of crazy stuff
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:58.380]  in their heads are they going to get?
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.540]  Now, don't get me wrong, you can be gay all you want, get your freak on.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:10.059]  But it is inappropriate to be exploiting and using sex to any child, whether it is
[01:57:10.059 --> 01:57:12.180]  heterosexual or homosexual.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.100]  And this stuff has gotten out of hand.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.460]  And it is not just homosexual.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.740]  It is something else.
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:28.300]  It is an attempt to put a secular religion in place, whereas religion is not to be
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:30.220]  integrated with government.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.780]  They're supposed to be separate.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:41.580]  Now. You think Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam.
[01:57:42.059 --> 01:57:45.460]  Judge holds that thought short break, if you can do five more minutes, you'll finish
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:45.900]  that thought.
[01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:54.490]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+.
[01:57:54.490 --> 01:57:56.650]  We made it even stronger.

[01:58:26.050 --> 01:58:27.050]  it.

[01:58:30.889 --> 01:58:32.290]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:33.290]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:34.290]  There are two different nootropics.
[01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:35.290]  They go good with this.
[01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:37.290]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:39.450]  This is the boss.

[01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:26.050]  No, I'm not running for president.

[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:07.740]  Alright, final segment here. I wanted to make sure Judge Joe Brown could finish off his comments.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:16.740]  You were talking about this, it's beyond just acceptance or tolerance, it's the promotion of the transgender individual
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:24.740]  and then really more shockingly and horrifyingly, their access to children.
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:29.740]  And Judge, you were just getting into how you don't really see this anywhere else on the planet.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:39.740]  Okay, let me explain this. Some gay folk I know ran into them in Hollywood and I've encountered other places
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:44.740]  say LGBTQ is a cult and they don't even like it.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:50.740]  As explained to me, it's like being Islamic does not mean you support Al Qaeda or ISIS.
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:58.740]  Being Christian does not mean you supported Reverend Jim Jones and drinking Kool-Aid at large picnics in Guyana either.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:13.740]  Now, when you get into it, you find that there are Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, etc.
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:19.740]  Now if you take Buddhism, it's arguable that there's no deity, it's a system of philosophy.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:26.740]  Well, for LGBTQ, it is a system of philosophy without a deity.
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:33.740]  Now, you can't hang a cross under an American flag on a government building.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:42.740]  You can't put the Jewish star there or the Islamic crescent, but you can put a rainbow flag under it.
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:50.740]  And when you put the rainbow flag under it, aside from getting a lot of other people in the world real aggravated about that,
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:58.740]  what you wind up doing is establishing through the federal government, through state governments,
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:03.740]  through local governments, through schools, through funding, through policy,
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:11.740]  you're trying to push and impose a philosophy that qualifies as a religion.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:24.740]  Secular mayhaps, but it is recognizable as a religion, and that is way beyond what America allows and what America ought to be about.
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:33.740]  You can't have a nativity scene, so how in the world are you supposed to have a rainbow moment when they're sponsored by the government?
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:43.740]  Now, that said, I don't really care what somebody does about adopting the LGBTQ philosophy,
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:56.740]  but it is not fit or appropriate for the government, either federal or state or local, to attempt to impose that on the people.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.740]  That's where it goes way wrong.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.740]  Well, I've talked about this a lot as well.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:11.740]  I think the whole reason why you see all these different genders and now all these different flags is because it is an attempt to replace,
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:17.740]  whether it's something in culture, be it a religion or just your sovereign nation state.
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:18.740]  That's what it's all about.
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:26.740]  They don't want you to identify with your heritage of a Christian family or a Islamic family, whatever the case may be.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:33.740]  They don't want you to feel connected to your fellow citizens of the United States of America or wherever it is.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:38.740]  They want you to think that your sexual identity is now what you should relate to,
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:42.740]  and so that's why they have all these different flags and they wave all these different flags.
[02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:46.740]  I do believe they're using this as a control mechanism.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:50.740]  They'd like to for the future of the citizens of this planet,
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:54.740]  but that's why I think they do all these different genders that don't exist and all these different flags they make up
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:59.740]  because they want that to be their new sense of pride, their new sense of belonging,
[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:05.740]  not their country, not their culture, not their religious affiliation or even just your basic community.
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:11.740]  They want it to be about, hey, who around the world likes to stick their ding-a-ling in another man's exit hole?
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:13.740]  And that's how we identify.
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:17.740]  Judge Joe Brown, final response, 30 seconds.
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:19.740]  Okay.
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:26.740]  The best thing for everybody is to accept you have obligations as both a citizen and as a human.
[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:36.740]  You have obligations to your neighborhood, your family, your people, your country, and you have obligations to humanity.
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:40.740]  It's dangerous being a human on this planet for a number of reasons.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:47.740]  So find pride and satisfaction confronting and overcoming adversity.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:53.740]  And if you perish in the process, that makes you something of a hero or a shero.
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:55.740]  So do what you are supposed to do.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:57.740]  Do what you ought to do.
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:05.740]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:08.740]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:10.740]  They shot quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:13.740]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:16.740]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.740]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:24.740]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:28.740]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.740]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.740]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:38.740]  We're underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:41.740]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.740]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.740]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:48.740]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.

[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.740]  Big Brother.
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:10.740]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.740]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:14.740]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.740]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:21.740]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:24.740]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:29.740]  Well, that was a great hour-long interview with Judge Joe Brown.
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:33.740]  I hope that you will go to band.video.
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:37.740]  And when we have that full hour-long interview updated, uploaded, rather,
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:41.740]  I hope that you will take it and you will share it far and wide.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:45.740]  Truly a great mind in Judge Joe Brown.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:47.740]  And let me just tell you, from getting to this point,
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.740]  and having dinner with him, really just such an interesting guy.
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:52.740]  There's not enough throwbacks like Judge Joe Brown out there
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:55.740]  that just have such a unique life experience
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:58.740]  that needs to be shared with the world.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:02.740]  And you got a little hint of that here today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:07.740]  Now, I didn't plug last hour because I didn't want to take any time
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:10.740]  to talk about Judge Joe Brown.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:13.740]  But I did want to talk about Judge Joe Brown.
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:18.740]  I didn't plug last hour because I didn't want to take any of the time
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:20.740]  away from Judge Joe Brown.
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:24.740]  But we are supported by the listeners shopping at infowarstore.com.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:28.740]  And if you like the Alex Jones Show,
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:33.740]  then you're probably going to like the Alex Jones for President T-shirt
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:36.740]  that we have available right now at infowarstore.com.
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:41.740]  Now, I have to warn you, do not have regrets on this.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:46.740]  A lot of the times that I go out and shoot videos on the streets
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:49.740]  and I'm wearing an Infowars T-shirt,
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:53.740]  recently an example would be the Clown World T-shirt I was wearing
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:57.740]  when I was out there with all the trans kids activists last month.
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:00.740]  And people were sending me messages saying, even just out there in person,
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:02.740]  where did you get that T-shirt? I love that T-shirt.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.740]  I've got to get one of those T-shirts.
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:06.740]  Well, you could have gotten it at infowarstore.com,
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:09.740]  but it was limited edition, so you can't get it now.
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:14.740]  This Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt is limited edition.
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.740]  And so, once it sells out and once it's pulled from the site,
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:19.740]  that's it, folks. That's it.
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:22.740]  So, if you like this T-shirt and you want to make sure that you have one,
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:24.740]  secure it now before it's too late.
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:29.740]  Alex Jones for President 2024 T-shirt, limited edition, infowarstore.com.
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.740]  We've also got the President Trump Mugshot Political Prisoner T-shirt,
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:37.740]  as well, if you like that.
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:41.740]  So, those are our two limited edition T-shirts that we have right now at infowarstore.com.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:48.740]  Not to mention all the great supplements that people love so much, including myself.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:51.740]  This is how we fund what we do here.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:56.740]  No big corporate sponsors telling us what to do, like ABC News,
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:59.740]  where you're not allowed to say anything negative about a vaccine.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:05.740]  We don't have to worry about that here, thanks to your continued support at infowarstore.com.
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:09.740]  All right, we've got a lot yet to cover.
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:17.740]  And as a reminder, we do have Jay Dyer hosting here in the fourth hour.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:21.740]  You know, guys, they never aired.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:25.740]  Tucker Carlson had Jay Dyer on his special series.
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:29.740]  I don't think they ever got to air that on Fox Nation.
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:34.740]  I think Jay Dyer's appearance, I mean, I'll go ahead and spoil it,
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:37.740]  he did a Klaus Schwab impression.
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:39.740]  It certainly is rich.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:42.740]  They did upload it to Fox Nation.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:43.740]  Okay, so good.
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.740]  So, Jay Dyer recently featured with Tucker Carlson.
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:47.740]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:54.740]  And I will be back hosting the War Room, and it is the Veterans Call-In Show today.
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:59.740]  And I'm very much looking forward to the veterans that will be calling in today
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.740]  and hearing from you on all of these different things.
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:10.740]  And there's one question I'll have for the veterans today that I think you're going to want to hear,
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:20.740]  and that's, is it time for us to start flying the flag in the distress symbol way?
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:29.740]  Meaning, I made the decision that we're now using the distress American flag symbol
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.740]  on the War Room every day.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:34.740]  And, you know, there's kind of a mixed response to that.
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:36.740]  I want to hear what the veterans think about that.
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:37.740]  Is America in distress?
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:43.740]  Is it appropriate to fly the flag at the distress level?
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:45.740]  And what they think about that as well as the other stuff.
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:49.740]  So looking forward to hearing from the veterans coming up today as well.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:53.740]  In the meantime, this is what I was talking about earlier.
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:11:01.740]  You can look, there's all kinds of different evidences, let's say, of this phenomenon.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:05.740]  The Joe Biden-Kamala Harris 2024 campaign is off to an awkward start.
[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:12.740]  Only 1,800 people tune in to watch Joe and Kamala crash and burn on campaign call.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:22.960]  This is so funny because, remember we were talking to Judge Joe Brown, he said him and
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.759]  Kwame Brown, former NBA basketball player, first round draft pick, he's the number one
[02:11:26.759 --> 02:11:32.080]  pick overall, and they did a show and they got 10 million views and then that show has
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.320]  to be censored.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:43.599]  Folks, you can go look at all the different channels where they upload Biden content on
[02:11:43.599 --> 02:11:50.719]  the internet, whether it's YouTube or Facebook or wherever, it doesn't get any viewers.
[02:11:50.719 --> 02:11:53.000]  It doesn't get any viewers.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.360]  And what's interesting about this and I, you know, well, I don't know if I should tell
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:07.280]  you what goes on behind the scenes at some of these places, but let's just say the fact
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.599]  that they can't even fake it.
[02:12:10.599 --> 02:12:16.639]  Let's just say the fact that they can't even fake Joe Biden having any popularity or any
[02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:26.599]  general interest from the public is extremely damning to his current presidency and campaign.
[02:12:26.599 --> 02:12:33.179]  Now, Donald Trump was live yesterday and do you guys remember the number when we tuned
[02:12:33.179 --> 02:12:38.400]  it on to his channel on Rumble, I think it was like 50,000 people that were tuned in
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.920]  there on Rumble when he was live.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:46.559]  And this is Rumble, so it's, you know, it's still behind YouTube as far as the audience
[02:12:46.559 --> 02:12:50.040]  numbers are concerned.
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:55.759]  And it's, I mean, I wouldn't say it's shadow banned, but you know, you're basically operating
[02:12:55.759 --> 02:13:00.920]  at a much lower wattage on Rumble than you would be on YouTube if you're allowed to be
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.599]  on there still.
[02:13:02.599 --> 02:13:04.280]  And Trump smashes it.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.200]  They do right side broadcasting gets banned from YouTube, right side broadcasting picks
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:09.299]  up a Trump rally.
[02:13:09.299 --> 02:13:13.679]  They get 250,000 people to tune in live.
[02:13:13.679 --> 02:13:19.080]  Trump fires up a rally video in New Hampshire yesterday, tens of thousands tune in live.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.040]  Nobody pays attention to Joe Biden.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.599]  Nobody pays attention to who is supposed to be the president of the United States, who's
[02:13:25.599 --> 02:13:28.000]  the real president.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.280]  And there's the video of Donald Trump making fun of Biden yesterday because he doesn't
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:32.280]  know where he is.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.280]  He doesn't even know how to walk.
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:35.639]  I mean, how bad is it going to get?
[02:13:35.639 --> 02:13:37.920]  I mean, honestly, at this point, he's going to be in a wheelchair.
[02:13:38.130 --> 02:13:44.690]  But maybe even before the, maybe even before the next election.
[02:13:44.690 --> 02:13:51.090]  So there is Donald Trump's right side broadcasting live stream video from yesterday.
[02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:57.370]  Over 600,000 views on Rumble on a network that has been censored and banned.
[02:13:57.370 --> 02:14:00.450]  Joe Biden, the President of the United States, fires up a live stream, can't even get 2,000
[02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:01.450]  people to tune in.
[02:14:01.450 --> 02:14:08.650]  Folks, me, one of the most banned individuals in America, I fire up a getter live stream,
[02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:13.210]  we're rolling around in the Infowars tank, I fire up a getter live stream, we get more
[02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:14.890]  than 2,000 people to tune in live.
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:28.140]  It just goes to show you the lack of popularity here, and you can fool some people some of the time, you can't fool all the people all the time.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:32.140]  This whole Biden facade is about to collapse, folks.
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:43.140]  Especially now with RFK Jr. running a serious campaign to become the Democrat nominee, unlike Bernie Sanders that was just a stalking horse the whole time.
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:49.140]  This is going to be impossible to put back into the bag, and it's not going to matter.
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:56.140]  My prediction remains the same, that Joe Biden will be the Democrat nominee, and then Joe Biden will win the presidency.
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:15:01.140]  That's the way I still see it right now, that could change, but that's where I see this going.
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:03.140]  So how are they going to pull that off?
[02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:11.140]  Donald Trump, if he's the nominee, or whoever it is on the Republican side of the aisle, is easily going to probably get, I'd say, 80 million votes this next go-around.
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:19.140]  That's how bad, that's the true state of things on the left side, and how the center of America now views the left.
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:24.140]  I'm telling you, I suspect the next Republican nominee to get 80 million votes.
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:28.140]  So what are they going to tell you, Joe Biden got 90?
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:30.140]  Well yeah, that's their plan.
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:33.140]  If Donald Trump gets 100 million votes, Joe Biden will get 101.
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:38.140]  If Donald Trump gets 150 million votes, Joe Biden will get 151.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:41.140]  If Donald Trump gets two votes, Joe Biden will get three.
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:42.140]  You see how that works?
[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:45.140]  But nobody's going to buy it anymore, folks.
[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:47.140]  The real world still exists.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:50.140]  Trump gets 50,000 at a rally, Biden gets 50.
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:53.140]  Trump gets 50,000 to tune into a live stream, Biden gets five.
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:55.140]  You can't hide this forever.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:02.140]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:04.140]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:08.140]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:13.140]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:17.140]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:24.140]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:26.140]  it's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:30.140]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:35.140]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:39.140]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:43.140]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com,
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:46.140]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:48.140]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:52.140]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:57.140]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:58.140]  Please take action now.
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:04.140]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:17:04.140 --> 02:17:06.140]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:07.140]  It is.
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.140]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:13.140]  The fish oil's better than it.
[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:15.140]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:17:15.140 --> 02:17:17.140]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:20.140]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:23.140]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:26.140]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:29.140]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.140]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:34.140]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:36.140]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:42.140]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:48.140]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:51.140]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:52.140]  I just can't do it.
[02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:54.140]  InfowarsStore.com
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:18:00.140]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:08.140]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:12.140]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:15.140]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:21.140]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:25.140]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:29.140]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:33.140]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:36.140]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:18:37.140 --> 02:18:40.140]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:42.140]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:45.140]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:50.140]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:56.140]  InfowarsStore.com
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:03.140]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:06.140]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:09.140]  This is a psychotic death cult, period.
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:10.140]  Case closed.
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:12.140]  Out to get you and your family.
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:17.140]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:20.140]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:26.140]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:29.140]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:19:29.140 --> 02:19:33.140]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:37.140]  But you can go pay two or three times, there's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:42.140]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:48.140]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.140]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:51.140]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:52.140]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:55.140]  The point is you get the filters at m4store.com.
[02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.140]  They're discounted right now.
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:58.140]  Finally back in stock.
[02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:03.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:06.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:33.179]  And I'm telling you, Joe Biden's got a big problem on his hand.
[02:20:33.179 --> 02:20:39.300]  No, it's not his criminally acting as an unregistered foreign agent in the White House and as vice
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:40.300]  president.
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:47.339]  No, it's not his son, Hunter, and all of his crime, corruption and assorted activity.
[02:20:47.339 --> 02:20:52.220]  No, it's actually Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:21:00.099]  And you know, he's kind of been more of a activist than a politician in recent years.
[02:21:00.099 --> 02:21:06.460]  So it's hard to really get a feel for what his political savvy might be, what his political
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:07.460]  savvy might look like.
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:08.460]  We're getting it.
[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.099]  I'm starting to see it now.
[02:21:10.099 --> 02:21:16.859]  This man is extremely politically savvy, and he gets it because I mean, I'm not talking
[02:21:16.859 --> 02:21:17.859]  to RFK.
[02:21:17.859 --> 02:21:21.220]  I don't I don't know anybody working on his campaign, at least that I know of.
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:24.019]  I do know some people that are friends with him.
[02:21:24.019 --> 02:21:26.660]  But what have I been saying this week?
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:31.660]  I said RFK needs to press the gas and he needs to be doing something every day.
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:35.300]  That's the only way he can properly apply pressure to Joe Biden.
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.939]  They're going to cover up all the Biden crimes, folks, believe me.
[02:21:37.939 --> 02:21:38.939]  I get it.
[02:21:38.939 --> 02:21:40.419]  The House Oversight Committee is exposing it.
[02:21:40.419 --> 02:21:41.500]  You're going to see a lot more.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:42.539]  It's all cut and dry.
[02:21:42.539 --> 02:21:43.539]  It's all there for the public.
[02:21:43.539 --> 02:21:45.380]  Joe Biden, unregistered foreign agent.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:47.380]  I mean, it's just it's all there.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:51.099]  Hunter Biden, the tax evasion, again, unregistered foreign agent.
[02:21:51.099 --> 02:21:53.460]  So that's all there.
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:57.580]  The Democrats, the Bidens still own the Justice Department.
[02:21:57.580 --> 02:21:58.740]  So nothing's going to come of that.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.740]  We'll see all the crimes.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.900]  It'll all be exposed and then we'll be shocked that nothing gets done.
[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:09.220]  No, the real way to apply pressure to Joe Biden is what RFK Jr. is doing, and that's interviews
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.900]  every day, campaigns every day.
[02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:16.500]  Make yourself in the public available to the public every day for multiple hours just to
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:24.419]  show how Joe Biden is a non-existent factor.
[02:22:24.419 --> 02:22:26.580]  And the media was already complaining about it.
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:29.720]  Hey, why don't we get a press conference?
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:30.720]  And so then what did they do?
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.580]  They had the scripted fake press conference.
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:35.580]  Just yesterday.
[02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.580]  So here's RFK.
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:38.900]  This is this is I'm telling you, this is just winning stuff.
[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:39.900]  This is.
[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:44.900]  Again, I don't want to say it perfectly parallels what Donald Trump was doing on the Republican
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:48.820]  side of the aisle in 2016, but there are a lot of similarities.
[02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:57.419]  So here is RFK Jr. on with Kim Iverson, another great alternative press member, RFK Jr. exposes
[02:22:57.419 --> 02:23:03.339]  climate scam, says WEF and Bill Gates exploiting issues to clamp down totalitarian controls
[02:23:03.339 --> 02:23:05.419]  on society.
[02:23:05.419 --> 02:23:10.199]  Where do you stand on climate policies that are being enacted right now?
[02:23:10.199 --> 02:23:14.339]  There is a difference between environmentalism and climate change.
[02:23:14.339 --> 02:23:20.380]  Where do you stand on all of that and what types of policies do you support?
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:27.400]  The climate climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know, the World
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:33.720]  Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big, you know, mega billionaires.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:40.220]  The same way that COVID was exploited to use it as an excuse to clamp down top down totalitarian
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:47.560]  controls on society and to and then to give us engineering solutions.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:52.080]  And if you look closely, as it turns out, the guys who are promoting those engineering
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:57.000]  solutions are the people who own the IPs, the patents for those solutions.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.039]  Oh, it's a way, you know, it's there.
[02:24:00.039 --> 02:24:01.039]  It's being used.
[02:24:01.039 --> 02:24:06.839]  They've given climate chaos a bad name, you know, because people now see that it's just
[02:24:06.839 --> 02:24:12.900]  another crisis that's being used to streamline the wealth of the poor and to, you know, to
[02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:14.900]  enrich billionaires.
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:22.259]  And, you know, I for 40 years have had the same policy on climate and engineering.
[02:24:22.259 --> 02:24:28.019]  You can go check my speeches from the 1980s and I've said the most important solution
[02:24:28.019 --> 02:24:33.580]  for environmental issues, not top down controls, is free market capitalism.
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:39.820]  And by that, and what we have in this country now is not free market capitalism, it's corporate
[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:41.820]  crony capitalism.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:47.880]  It's capital, it's cushy kind of socialism for the rich and a brutal, barbaric, merciless
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.400]  capitalism for the poor.
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:58.439]  In farm, the free, a true free market promotes efficiency and efficiency means the elimination
[02:24:58.439 --> 02:25:01.900]  of waste and pollution is waste.
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:09.900]  In a true free market, you can't, a true free market would require us to properly value
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:14.539]  our natural resources and it's the undervaluation of those resources that caused us to use
[02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:16.419]  them wastefully.
[02:25:16.419 --> 02:25:20.419]  In a true free market, you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and
[02:25:20.419 --> 02:25:21.900]  without enriching your community.
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:27.179]  But what polluters do is they make themselves rich by making everybody else poor.
[02:25:27.179 --> 02:25:31.460]  They raise standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for the rest of
[02:25:32.019 --> 02:25:35.820]  the world and they do that by escaping the discipline of the free market.
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:42.140]  You show me a polluter, I'll show you a subsidy, I'll show you a fat cat using political clout
[02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:45.980]  to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay its production
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:46.980]  costs.
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:54.419]  So, you know, in terms of carbon industry, all of the things that people are trying to
[02:25:54.419 --> 02:26:03.460]  do to promote, to end carbon, we should be doing anyway because, you know, carbon means
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:06.500]  cutting down all of the mountains in West Virginia.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:12.859]  It means, you know, we polluted 2,200 miles of rivers and streams in Eastern Kentucky
[02:26:12.859 --> 02:26:15.900]  and West Virginia.
[02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:21.339]  Every freshwater fish in America now has mercury in its flesh on coal-burning power plants.
[02:26:21.339 --> 02:26:25.220]  That is a theft from the public.
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:29.740]  The waterways and lakes on the Appalachian, on the high Appalachian, every one of them
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:32.980]  is now sterilized from acid rain.
[02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:38.500]  We need to be reducing, whether you believe in climate change or not, carbon-based climate
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:43.460]  change, we need to be reducing our dependence on carbon.
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:48.779]  Carbon receives globally about $5.2 trillion in subsidies a year.
[02:26:48.779 --> 02:26:55.740]  If you end those subsidies, carbon cannot compete against more efficient and cleaner
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:58.060]  energy sources and that's what we should be doing.
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:05.179]  We should be ending subsidies for the carbon industry and we should be using true free
[02:27:05.179 --> 02:27:10.179]  market capitalism and finding the most efficient source of energy.
[02:27:10.179 --> 02:27:11.740]  Here we go.
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:13.660]  It's on.
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:14.660]  It's on.
[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:18.699]  Now, Kim Iverson, I don't know if I would say she's left-wing or right-wing.
[02:27:18.699 --> 02:27:21.619]  She's really just right down the middle, I would say.
[02:27:21.619 --> 02:27:23.779]  She just tries to do fair and balanced reporting.
[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:30.460]  But what I find funny is people that do fair and balanced reporting get called
[02:27:30.460 --> 02:27:33.660]  right-wing and conservative now just because everybody knows liberals and
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:37.340]  Democrats lie. So anybody that's honest and tells the truth is just considered
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:40.660]  right-wing conservative whether they are or not. And so that's probably how
[02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:45.100]  they're gonna paint RFK now. Because what are you gonna do? You can't stop him.
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:49.220]  He's not gonna stop campaigning. He's not gonna stop doing interviews. He's not
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:52.980]  gonna stop running for president. They'd love that. So what I mean are they
[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:56.060]  gonna kill him? Is the CIA gonna kill a third member of the Kennedy family?
[02:27:56.060 --> 02:28:02.100]  I mean that'd be something. No I don't see that happening either. I think that
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:07.340]  they're gonna have to do something to label him a right-winger. They might
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:11.820]  even call him a MAGA. I'm serious. These people are so out of control. And now
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:17.380]  RFK Jr. is applying so much pressure to the Joe Biden campaign. This is
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.859]  unstoppable. Folks I'm telling you right now Kennedy
[02:28:21.859 --> 02:28:26.820]  is polling at about 20% on the Democrat side. If that number gets to 25 or 30
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:32.380]  percent this is this they're not gonna be able to put this genie back in the
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:37.140]  bottle. Joe Biden already got away with not running a presidential campaign but
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:40.260]  that was against Donald Trump. So the Democrats accepted it. They hated Donald
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:43.900]  Trump so much they would sacrifice their own mother to get Donald Trump out of
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:48.100]  their way. But with RFK this is a different scenario. If Biden does not
[02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:52.580]  campaign, which we know he's not gonna do, how are they going to steal this
[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:56.980]  nomination? It's gonna be so obvious.
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:02.619]  Just weeks ago I warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against
[02:29:02.619 --> 02:29:05.779]  Tucker Carlson and take him off the air. People said no way he's the most powerful
[02:29:05.779 --> 02:29:09.260]  that ever happened. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:12.100]  had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him. But as soon
[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:15.580]  as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air. It's the same thing
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:20.619]  with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or
[02:29:20.619 --> 02:29:25.660]  owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and our
[02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:30.340]  listeners. And when you support us we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:36.619]  Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we the
[02:29:36.619 --> 02:29:39.619]  people. So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to
[02:29:39.619 --> 02:29:44.580]  understand. Please don't take Infowars for granted. We're barely hanging on. We
[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:47.980]  need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support. We're all getting great
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:51.300]  products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com. So don't procrastinate.
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:54.859]  Go to Infowarsstore.com. Get amazing products that keep us on the air and
[02:29:54.859 --> 02:30:00.460]  never submit to these tyrants. In the early 1900s certain companies were
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:05.779]  off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding
[02:30:05.779 --> 02:30:11.460]  communities began to get sick. Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to
[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:16.539]  install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid. Still
[02:30:16.539 --> 02:30:21.820]  highly toxic but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:25.939]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them one of their
[02:30:25.939 --> 02:30:29.820]  major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury who was
[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:34.820]  responsible for the Public Health Service at the time. And by 1950 the US
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:39.580]  government began buying this toxic untreated industrial waste product and
[02:30:39.699 --> 02:30:44.180]  dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's causing
[02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:49.859]  various cancers and other disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro you can have clean
[02:30:49.859 --> 02:30:55.140]  drinking water and a remedy to this madness. Available now at Infowarsstore.com
[02:30:55.140 --> 02:31:02.420]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't
[02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:06.699]  think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers
[02:31:06.699 --> 02:31:10.779]  supporting us. When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes,
[02:31:10.779 --> 02:31:17.300]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we
[02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:20.980]  look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:26.380]  day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself
[02:31:26.380 --> 02:31:30.340]  and the whole Infowars crew I thank you for your past support. And I want to encourage you
[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:35.420]  now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:38.460]  you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But
[02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:42.980]  most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy
[02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:46.420]  great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keep us on
[02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:50.060]  air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at
[02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:54.580]  Infowarsstore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com
[02:31:54.580 --> 02:31:58.300]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now. Ladies and
[02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:02.460]  gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book that
[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:06.340]  documents the globalists in their own words plan for our future. That is a
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:10.220]  hellish future. Now you'll always, while they still allow books I guess they're
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:13.380]  starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War
[02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:17.859]  for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowarsstore.com. But you will never be
[02:32:17.859 --> 02:32:22.180]  able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:26.260]  out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The
[02:32:26.260 --> 02:32:30.420]  Great Reset and the War for the World a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com. And
[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:34.619]  there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So
[02:32:34.619 --> 02:32:37.660]  you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll
[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:41.260]  also know that you help keep Infowars on the air. I want to thank those of you
[02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:44.619]  that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to
[02:32:44.619 --> 02:32:49.300]  encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed
[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:53.500]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to
[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:57.020]  the local school. This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your
[02:32:57.020 --> 02:32:57.460]  support.
[02:32:58.619 --> 02:33:04.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:21.400]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:27.400]  you are the resistance. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:35.039]  You ever try to campaign as a Democrat? Ever wonder what's that like? Here's a little taste
[02:33:35.039 --> 02:33:38.039]  of it. Here's what it might be like in Clip 11.
[02:33:38.039 --> 02:33:45.039]  Hello, who is this? My name is Richard Lee, and I'm running for
[02:33:45.039 --> 02:33:49.039]  City Council, so I just wanted to introduce myself.
[02:33:49.039 --> 02:33:53.039]  Excuse me? My name is Richard Lee, and I'm running for
[02:33:53.039 --> 02:33:59.039]  City Council, so I just wanted to say hello. Are you a Democrat?
[02:33:59.039 --> 02:34:03.039]  Yeah. Then leave.
[02:34:03.039 --> 02:34:10.039]  Thank you. Yeah.
[02:34:10.039 --> 02:34:15.039]  Do you think Elon Musk can build a spaceship large enough to fit every liberal progressive
[02:34:15.039 --> 02:34:20.039]  Democrat on it and blast it to Mars? We want it to arrive safely.
[02:34:20.039 --> 02:34:24.039]  You know, they hate Earth so much, it's all going to burn up and be, you know, basically
[02:34:24.039 --> 02:34:28.039]  a rock, just completely burned to a crisp, they say, in, what, ten years now?
[02:34:28.039 --> 02:34:32.039]  Do we have ten years left? Five years? Who knows? Or maybe it's already there.
[02:34:32.039 --> 02:34:37.039]  So they should all just go to Mars. Do you think Elon Musk can build a spaceship big enough for that?
[02:34:37.039 --> 02:34:42.039]  That'd be a good use of his time, I think, and all the public money he gets.
[02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:48.039]  So, yeah, folks, the whole facade that the Democrat Party is popular at all
[02:34:48.039 --> 02:34:53.039]  is really, really starting to wane.
[02:34:53.039 --> 02:34:58.039]  It continues, though, with Tucker Carlson. And guys, will you bring me that New York
[02:34:58.039 --> 02:35:03.039]  Times tweet? Because this is so key. I want to get into the latest here with Tucker Carlson.
[02:35:03.039 --> 02:35:10.039]  But let me just go back to a big story from yesterday.
[02:35:10.039 --> 02:35:16.039]  And it's still big today. U.S. Army PSYOP expert.
[02:35:16.039 --> 02:35:21.039]  Fox News fired Tucker Carlson to maintain semi-lobotomized,
[02:35:21.039 --> 02:35:26.039]  quasi-retarded population. That's an exact quote.
[02:35:26.039 --> 02:35:31.039]  That's not paraphrasing. That's your exact quote.
[02:35:31.039 --> 02:35:36.039]  But what does that really mean?
[02:35:36.039 --> 02:35:41.039]  What is this Army PSYOP expert really saying?
[02:35:41.039 --> 02:35:46.039]  The mainstream media is meant to make you uninformed,
[02:35:46.039 --> 02:35:51.039]  keep you ignorant, and have you passionate about things
[02:35:51.039 --> 02:35:56.039]  that do not matter. And while I can relate and forgive,
[02:35:56.039 --> 02:36:01.039]  for example, you have the NFL draft going on right now,
[02:36:01.039 --> 02:36:06.039]  which, by the way, you know that whole joke about football being gay?
[02:36:06.039 --> 02:36:11.039]  There is nothing gayer in football than the NFL draft.
[02:36:11.039 --> 02:36:16.039]  There is nothing gayer. Now it's like a weird fashion show and some weird fan fest.
[02:36:17.039 --> 02:36:22.039]  But here's why I'm saying this.
[02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:27.039]  I don't even get mad at a football fan that puts on a ridiculous outfit
[02:36:27.039 --> 02:36:32.039]  to go to a draft party, or the football fan that does the body paint
[02:36:32.039 --> 02:36:37.039]  and screams for their team for three hours on Sunday.
[02:36:37.039 --> 02:36:42.039]  It's fun. You're a fan. Maybe your dad was a fan too and took you all the games.
[02:36:42.039 --> 02:36:47.039]  I'm not even mad. The point is that, use this as an analogy.
[02:36:50.310 --> 02:36:54.310]  An NFL football fan that goes to the games every Sunday,
[02:36:54.310 --> 02:36:58.310]  does three hours of tailgating, watches all the news on your football team,
[02:36:58.310 --> 02:37:00.310]  follows all the talk shows on your football team,
[02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:05.310]  and it's that somehow becomes connected to your reality,
[02:37:05.310 --> 02:37:10.310]  and your prosperity, and your future, and your emotions, and your state of mind.
[02:37:10.310 --> 02:37:16.310]  When really at the end of the day, it has absolutely no meaning whatsoever.
[02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:19.310]  It's a child's game.
[02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:30.550]  Can you imagine how many football fans out there with that passion if they applied that to things that actually mattered?
[02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:33.550]  But that wouldn't be fun, that wouldn't be easy, so they don't do it.
[02:37:33.550 --> 02:37:39.550]  But that's what I'm talking about. That's your semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:48.550]  Again, I'm not insulting you if you're a football fan, but if you are that football fan and you don't even have a clue what's going on in the world,
[02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:57.550]  then you are that semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded member of the population that the Army PSYOP expert is talking about.
[02:37:57.550 --> 02:38:03.550]  That's you. And you have every right to be that person. That's where the establishment wants you.
[02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:06.550]  That's where your government wants you.
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:14.940]  So, they don't want you to know that the vaccines are dangerous, could cause autism, potentially
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:15.980]  kill you.
[02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:19.180]  They want you to be retarded and uninformed.
[02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:22.740]  They don't want you to know about Seymour Hersh breaking the news that we all already
[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:26.900]  knew that Joe Biden blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a total act of terror.
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:33.580]  They don't want you to know about Anthony Fauci funding the Wuhan lab, the gain of function
[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:36.380]  research, lying about it under oath.
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:41.840]  They want you uninformed, semi-lobotomized, and say, what is the lobotomized thing?
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:48.199]  So the retarded thing is, you can't think, you can't even find information, you don't
[02:38:48.199 --> 02:38:56.840]  even know what's going on, and then the lobotomized thing is, even if you get to see it, you now
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.439]  can't even properly respond to it because you've been lobotomized.
[02:39:01.439 --> 02:39:06.080]  Like for example, you see a Tucker Carlson show, oh, he's a racist bigot.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:12.599]  You can't even consume or respond to what he's saying.
[02:39:12.599 --> 02:39:15.880]  But what is the takeaway here that he says?
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:24.720]  And it's not just Tucker Carlson, quite frankly, it's many others like Alex Jones and Infowars.
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:26.720]  What does Tucker Carlson do?
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.720]  What does Alex Jones do that really changes the world?
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:35.380]  It's not just the news coverage.
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:39.920]  It's not just what they talk about or even how they say it.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:44.980]  It's the fact that they make you think.
[02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:52.439]  They don't make you feel, you might feel something, but they make you think.
[02:39:52.439 --> 02:39:57.279]  And then once you think, you might get curious.
[02:39:57.279 --> 02:40:02.080]  And then if you get curious, you might become resourceful.
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.800]  And then if you get resourceful, you might start to do some research and become informed.
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:14.560]  And then if you're informed, all of a sudden, the establishment propaganda and control doesn't
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.279]  work on you.
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:21.400]  That's why they had to censor Alex Jones.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.400]  That's why they had to fire Tucker Carlson.
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:28.400]  That's why the U.S. Army PSYOPs expert says
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  the establishment wants a semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  They don't want you thinking for yourself.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  They don't want you researching for yourself.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.400]  They don't want you to be resourceful.
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  They want you to take whatever it is they regurgitate to you,
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  accept it as truth, and then move on, paint your body,
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:50.400]  and go to your favorite football team game.
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:54.400]  Meanwhile, you're having everything stolen from you
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  in the past, present, and future.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.400]  But you're a semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded member of the population,
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:02.400]  so you don't even know what's going on.
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  You're essentially a dodo bird getting eaten up for sport.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  Now, the New York Times with this today.
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.400]  This is hilarious.
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  They are obsessed.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  So it just shows you that they...
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  Now, remember this.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:24.400]  Monday and Tuesday, what was the response from the haters in the media?
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:28.400]  What was the response from the tyrants, the authoritarians, the leftists in the media?
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:31.400]  They were all celebrating, it's over for Tucker.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:35.400]  They were holding his beheaded head up, bleeding out from the neck.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  They were scalping him.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.400]  They were celebrating it.
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  Kat Abou, whose job it is to follow Tucker Carlson,
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.400]  thought she was finally over her job, but not so fast, Kat.
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  I think you're still going to be employed.
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.400]  You can still watch Tucker Carlson for work and hate him so much.
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:50.400]  But remember, that's what they were doing.
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  They were celebrating.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:52.400]  It's over for Tucker.
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  We got him off the air.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  Yeah, pop the champagne, blow up the confetti.
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.400]  We've done it.
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.400]  Yay, it's here.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  And then what happens?
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  Tucker Carlson does a two-and-a-half-minute video on Twitter
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:02.400]  that gets 70 million views.
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:04.400]  Oh!
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:06.400]  And so now they're back at the attack.
[02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:10.690]  So this is the New York Times.
[02:42:10.690 --> 02:42:14.690]  When Tucker Carlson was the most watched host on primetime cable news,
[02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:20.690]  he used a simple narrative to instill fear in Fox News viewers and promote extremist ideas.
[02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:27.690]  Now remove the noise and let's focus on the signal.
[02:42:27.690 --> 02:42:31.690]  Narrative to instill fear.
[02:42:31.690 --> 02:42:35.690]  Narrative to instill fear.
[02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:38.690]  Narrative to instill fear.
[02:42:38.690 --> 02:42:42.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coming from the New York Times,
[02:42:42.690 --> 02:42:44.690]  this coming from liberal Democrats,
[02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:54.690]  your entire operational procedure and practice relies on you having false narratives to instill fear.
[02:42:57.690 --> 02:43:00.690]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months,
[02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:02.690]  and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:04.690]  We made it even stronger.
[02:43:04.690 --> 02:43:08.690]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:15.690]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:15.690 --> 02:43:21.690]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:23.690]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:43:23.690 --> 02:43:28.690]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:33.690]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver.
[02:43:33.690 --> 02:43:35.690]  You name it.
[02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:38.690]  It is the super fuel.
[02:43:38.690 --> 02:43:40.690]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:41.690]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:42.690]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:43:42.690 --> 02:43:43.690]  They go good with this.
[02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:45.690]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:43:45.690 --> 02:43:47.690]  This is the boss.
[02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:51.690]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:51.690 --> 02:43:54.690]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:43:57.690 --> 02:44:00.690]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:44:00.690 --> 02:44:05.690]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:07.690]  And that war is something that we can win.
[02:44:07.690 --> 02:44:09.690]  But it takes dedication.
[02:44:09.690 --> 02:44:10.690]  It takes commitment.
[02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:14.690]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to Infowarsstore.com
[02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:17.690]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life

[02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:45.690]  You've been listening for years.
[02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:48.690]  But you've never taken the step to go to Infowarsstore.
[02:44:48.690 --> 02:44:51.690]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[02:44:51.690 --> 02:44:52.690]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[02:44:52.690 --> 02:44:54.690]  So, again, please take action.
[02:44:54.690 --> 02:44:56.690]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today.
[02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:57.690]  And I thank you.
[02:44:57.690 --> 02:45:01.690]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:04.690]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:45:04.690 --> 02:45:07.690]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:45:07.690 --> 02:45:12.690]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[02:45:12.690 --> 02:45:15.690]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:45:15.690 --> 02:45:18.690]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:45:18.690 --> 02:45:21.690]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[02:45:21.690 --> 02:45:24.690]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:45:24.690 --> 02:45:29.690]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[02:45:29.690 --> 02:45:32.690]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:39.690]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[02:45:39.690 --> 02:45:41.690]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:46.690]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:50.690]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:52.690]  And a remedy to this madness.
[02:45:52.690 --> 02:45:56.690]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:56.690 --> 02:46:01.690]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:03.690]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:05.690]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:46:05.690 --> 02:46:07.690]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:46:07.690 --> 02:46:09.690]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:46:09.690 --> 02:46:12.690]  And it says, Political Prisoner.
[02:46:12.690 --> 02:46:14.690]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:17.690]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:19.690]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:46:19.690 --> 02:46:21.690]  Political Prisoner.
[02:46:21.690 --> 02:46:23.690]  With Trump on the front.
[02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:26.690]  There in a mugshot jail background.
[02:46:26.690 --> 02:46:27.690]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:46:27.690 --> 02:46:31.690]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:46:31.690 --> 02:46:33.690]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:34.690]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:46:34.690 --> 02:46:36.690]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:46:36.690 --> 02:46:37.690]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:46:37.690 --> 02:46:38.690]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:39.690]  2024.
[02:46:39.690 --> 02:46:40.690]  It's a fun, conversational piece.
[02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:41.690]  And a limited edition shirt.
[02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:43.690]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:51.690]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowars.com
[02:46:51.690 --> 02:46:56.690]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:46:58.690 --> 02:47:02.690]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:04.690]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:29.160]  All right, final segment for me before Jay Dyer takes over, but I'll be back hosting
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:32.320]  the war room, covering the rest of the news that I couldn't get to in three hours, The
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:37.000]  Alex Jones Show, and taking calls from our great veterans out there, it is the Veterans
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  Call-In Special.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.960]  But first, finishing up here, so, do I really have to give you all of the examples of liberal
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:48.199]  Democrats using false narratives to instill fear?
[02:47:48.199 --> 02:47:50.880]  Do I really have to give you all the examples?
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.840]  Oh, police are racist, oh, COVID is going to kill you, you're going to die if you don't
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:58.240]  get a vaccine or wear a mask.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.440]  Oh, the gay community is being hunted and killed by Christian conservatives.
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:04.760]  I mean, all fake news.
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.680]  I can go on, all their false narratives to instill fear, and the fact that they're pointing
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:13.199]  the finger at Tucker Carlson for doing exactly what they do is right out of the Communist
[02:48:13.199 --> 02:48:15.240]  Manifesto.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:17.680]  It's right out of the rules for radicals.
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:25.320]  These are hardcore communist, leftist, fascist, tyrant, control freaks, and everything they're
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:29.240]  guilty of, they accuse you of, and the latest now being Tucker Carlson, so that when the
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:34.199]  New York Times says, Tucker Carlson uses false narratives to instill fear, that's the New
[02:48:34.199 --> 02:48:35.199]  York Times.
[02:48:35.199 --> 02:48:40.320]  Tucker Carlson uses the truth to destroy your false narratives.
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.680]  They cannot get over him, and they really thought they had him defeated, folks.
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:50.320]  These people are so high off their own flagellation.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.199]  They really thought they had Tucker Carlson defeated.
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.119]  And when he came back out, because imagine, if Elon Musk doesn't take over Twitter, Tucker
[02:48:57.119 --> 02:49:03.160]  Carlson is not allowed on Twitter, and he doesn't get 70 million views in 24 hours on
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:04.560]  a Twitter post.
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:08.520]  But because Elon Musk did buy Twitter, he can now do that, and that just shows the power
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:10.840]  of independent media.
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:13.840]  So the liberal Democrats were celebrating on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:15.800]  They thought they had Tucker Carlson defeated.
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.520]  They were wrong again, and now they're back into the panic mode, knowing that they haven't
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:21.520]  defeated him.
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:27.160]  I mean, you can use all the different analogies, like a Lazarus situation.
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.440]  This is a political media Lazarus, except he was never dead.
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:34.080]  They just thought he was.
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:37.279]  Now here's where they're going to run into real problems.
[02:49:37.279 --> 02:49:39.680]  A lot of liberals like Tucker Carlson.
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:47.520]  Rainn Wilson is a, well, he's a well-known actor, obviously, but he's a big-time liberal
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.080]  lefty.
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:55.840]  And he tweeted this out in response to a Yahoo story.
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.320]  Tucker Carlson issues vague statement in wake of his firing from Fox News.
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:00.320]  Vague statement?
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:01.320]  It wasn't a vague statement at all.
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:03.400]  He issued a very clear statement, actually.
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:07.119]  It wasn't the statement you were looking for, so you didn't hear it, because you're part
[02:50:07.119 --> 02:50:09.880]  of the quasi-retarded population.
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:13.680]  But Rainn Wilson responds, and he says, I never thought I'd say it, but I agree with
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:17.760]  Tucker Carlson on almost everything he's saying here.
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:26.920]  You know, oddly enough, because look, you're trained to respond to stimuli, whether you
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:29.119]  realize it or not.
[02:50:29.119 --> 02:50:34.520]  Some of this stuff happens organically, some of this stuff you choose to make happen.
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:43.680]  So liberals like Rainn Wilson see Fox News, and they can't even hear what Tucker Carlson
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:44.680]  is saying.
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:45.680]  It doesn't matter.
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:51.880]  It doesn't matter whether Tucker Carlson says A, B, or C, they can't even hear it,
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:56.920]  because as soon as they see Fox News, that hatred boils up inside of them, and it blinds
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.920]  them, and it makes them deaf.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:05.080]  And so that's the stimuli they respond to is, oh, Fox News, oh, I hate that.
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:09.400]  And then they can't hear it, see it, whatever, properly.
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:14.840]  But now that Tucker Carlson isn't on Fox News, all of a sudden, these liberals might actually
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:17.480]  listen to what he has to say.
[02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:21.080]  All of a sudden, these liberals might realize, wait a second, I actually agree with the things
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:25.080]  Tucker Carlson is saying.
[02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:31.240]  So these are like Pyrrhic victories for the establishment.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:36.500]  It's a Pyrrhic victory for them removing Tucker Carlson off Fox News.
[02:51:36.500 --> 02:51:40.500]  I think overall that's going to be a major loss for them.
[02:51:40.500 --> 02:51:48.500]  And I think we're already seeing the signs of that being the case.
[02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:55.500]  Now here's another example when it comes to the media's, just the blatant,
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:59.500]  just the blatant one-way street they expect you to exist on.
[02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:06.500]  Olivia of Troy, big leftist.
[02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:11.500]  Nikki Haley saying Joe Biden will likely die within five years is vile.
[02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:14.500]  Will she apologize for saying this about a sitting U.S. President?
[02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:18.500]  That's funny, Olivia of Troy, I never heard you complain about any of the stuff
[02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:20.500]  that the Democrats were doing to Donald Trump.
[02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:23.500]  You know, New York Street Theater depicting his assassination.
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:25.500]  Kathy Griffin depicting his beheading.
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:31.500]  All the late-night talk show hoes with all their weird stuff.
[02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:34.500]  You never had a problem with any of that.
[02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:38.500]  And, you know, maybe what Nikki Haley said is vile, maybe it's true.
[02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:41.500]  Because the real issue is not what Nikki Haley said.
[02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:43.500]  The real issue is Joe Biden's health.
[02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:48.500]  You guys have just been lying about that, too, and you've been in denial of that, too.
[02:52:48.500 --> 02:52:52.500]  So when somebody's telling the truth about it, you have to come out and try to stop them.
[02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:57.500]  But, okay, let's even say you think that that's vile and you have a problem with that.
[02:52:57.500 --> 02:53:04.500]  I'm sorry, I can't hear you because you didn't say a damn thing about all the vile commentary
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:07.500]  and content that was coming out against Donald Trump and his family.
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:10.500]  So you are just a fraud.
[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:15.500]  You're a member of the quasi-retarded population.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:21.500]  Joe Rogan says there's no 2024 solution for Democrats other than Biden dying, like, very soon.
[02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:24.500]  Folks, everybody gets it.
[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:27.500]  They stole two nominations from Bernie Sanders.
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:32.500]  They're about to steal a third from RFK Jr.
[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:37.500]  And then they'll probably steal the presidential election from Donald Trump for Joe Biden again.
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:40.500]  And everybody freaking knows it.
[02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:42.500]  Now, here's the thing.
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:48.500]  Most people still aren't that politically active or concerned, so they really don't care.
[02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:50.500]  They know it's going on, but they really don't care.
[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:54.500]  I think that's what's about to change, and people like Joe Rogan are a perfect example,
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:56.500]  where he doesn't really like to get political.
[02:53:56.500 --> 02:54:02.500]  Now, all of a sudden, he's making majorly impactful political statements because he knows the situation is serious.
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:04.500]  And how are they going to fake this?
[02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:10.500]  Joe Rogan's approval rating hits record low as he launches reelection effort.
[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:17.500]  Will there be a time where RFK Jr. actually – see, folks, they're going to have to do something here.
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:21.500]  They're going to have to do something major to stop this momentum from RFK Jr.,
[02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:27.500]  because at this rate, by the end of the year, RFK Jr. will be pulling higher with Democrats than Joe Biden.
[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:30.500]  They cannot let it get to that point.
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:36.500]  So I won't even bother making any predictions right now other than there are major conversations
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:40.500]  happening behind the scenes about what to do with RFK Jr.,
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:46.500]  because even if the Democrats wanted to replace Joe Biden, it's not with RFK Jr.,
[02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:51.500]  and they really don't have any other players on the field right now.
[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:54.500]  There's an undercurrent in the Democrat Party I've talked about before,
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:55:01.500]  where in the near future post-Biden, AOC in the political wing and Jen Psaki in the media wing
[02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:06.500]  are planning a hostile takeover of the Democrat Party.
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:13.500]  But how are they going to hide this Joe Biden lack of ability and popularity ahead of the 2024 election
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:17.500]  when RFK Jr. is surging? They're going to have to do something.
[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:22.500]  Karine Jean-Pierre says it's entirely normal for Joe Biden to have note cards
[02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:25.500]  with the reporter's scripted questions and answers on it.
[02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:27.500]  It's totally normal.
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:35.500]  Oh, it's hilarious, isn't it?
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:39.500]  I'd love to see what Joe Biden could do without his note cards or without a teleprompter.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:42.500]  That would be something, wouldn't it?
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:50.500]  And look, you might say that there is a sense of normalcy for a president to get a packet
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:56.500]  or some form of information about a group of reporters he's about to face
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:00.500]  that's totally different than what Joe Biden has.
[02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:07.500]  Yeah, there are teams working with the president to make sure that he doesn't walk into a gang of jackals
[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:09.500]  without being somewhat prepared.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:14.500]  But you know, they tried to do that with Trump, and after about two months, he just gave up.
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:16.500]  It's like, do you remember the end of Trump's presidency?
[02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:21.500]  He would walk up to the gang of media jackals, and he'd just be like, fake news, go ahead.
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.500]  Fake news, go ahead. Fake news, go ahead.
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:27.500]  He didn't even bother preparing anymore because it doesn't even make a difference.
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:30.500]  But oh, that's normal. It's normal to have completely scripted press conference.
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:34.500]  I mean, Jean-Pierre, you really sold yourself out, didn't you, for Joe Biden?
[02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:36.500]  You're going to regret that.
[02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:39.500]  A little girl refuses Joe Biden's invitation to see inside the White House.
[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:40.500]  Good Lord.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:45.500]  Another awkward moment was caught on camera when Joe Biden invited a little girl to see inside of the White House,
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:46.500]  but she refused.
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:51.500]  That's the only way they get Joe Biden to do anything, folks, is they tempt him with ice cream and little children.
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:53.500]  You think I'm kidding? I'm not.
[02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:58.500]  The only way they get Joe Biden to leave the White House is with little children and ice cream.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:02.500]  And yes, he's now probably a dozen times in the last three years
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:07.500]  invited minors to go into his back room or have private meetings with him.
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:09.500]  What the hell is that?
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:15.500]  And then there's Kamala Harris, who's just an embarrassment every time she opens her mouth.
[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:21.500]  Kamala Harris cites Squid Game as an example of intertwined history of U.S. and South Korea.
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.500]  Folks, this is so pathetic.
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:29.500]  The Squid Game was a popular TV show from a couple of years ago that came out of South Korea that was popular here in America.
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:34.500]  And that's what Kamala Harris says we have in common with South Korea?
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:43.500]  My goodness, if you thought she was ignorant before, it has been totally confirmed now.
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:54.500]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:56.500]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:58.500]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:01.500]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:04.500]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:06.500]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:13.500]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:16.500]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:19.500]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:23.500]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:27.500]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:30.500]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:33.500]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:34.500]  We're barely hanging on.

[02:58:55.500 --> 02:59:04.500]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:06.500]  So support Infowars Store.
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:11.500]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know.
[02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:12.500]  I don't know.
[02:59:12.500 --> 02:59:15.500]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:20.500]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:59:20.500 --> 02:59:21.500]  Krill oil.
[02:59:21.500 --> 02:59:28.500]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:30.500]  And I would urge everyone.
[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:31.500]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:33.500]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:34.500]  But the day will come.
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:37.500]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:39.500]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:41.500]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:44.500]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:59:44.500 --> 02:59:47.500]  You have to have these products.
[02:59:50.500 --> 02:59:55.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.500 --> 03:00:04.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:08.500]  I am your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:13.500]  And I've been doing a lot of reading lately into Huxley's works.
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:18.500]  We just covered last fourth hour that I hosted a couple weeks ago, Brave New World.
[03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:21.500]  I read another one of Huxley's books this week.
[03:00:21.500 --> 03:00:24.500]  I read The Doors of Perception.
[03:00:25.500 --> 03:00:30.500]  And this is a fascinating text because it's one of the early texts that really popularized,
[03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:37.500]  far before the 1960s counterculture revolution, the idea of experimentation with hallucinogens,
[03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:42.500]  not just for breakthrough experiences in terms of consciousness and creativity,
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:45.500]  but for breakthrough experiences in a religious way.
[03:00:45.500 --> 03:00:52.500]  And so The Doors of Perception, as you may know, that would be the basis for the rock band The Doors,
[03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:57.500]  Jim Morrison's The Doors, to title their band.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:00.500]  And also, if you didn't know, Jim Morrison and The Doors,
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:03.500]  they come out of a scene called the Laurel Canyon scene.
[03:01:03.500 --> 03:01:10.500]  The Laurel Canyon scene was, in my view, a heavily influenced and co-opted scene.
[03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:15.500]  In other words, it had a lot of deep state military intelligence background to it.
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:20.500]  And in my view, it's one of the key elements that we can look to to see that the counterculture
[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:22.500]  is something engineered and co-opted.
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.500]  And we're going to be looking at that today because when Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception,
[03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:29.500]  he wrote this in 1954.
[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:34.500]  So this is several years before the 1960s and even the Laurel Canyon scene,
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:37.500]  far before that in terms of the Haight-Ashbury district,
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:41.500]  when we typically think of the beginning of the 1960s counterculture.
[03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:44.500]  By the way, if you didn't know, Jim Morrison's dad was Admiral Morrison,
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:49.500]  who was involved in the Gulf of Tonkin accident, which was a false flag.
[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:53.500]  One of the most famous false flags, and that was his dad.
[03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:55.500]  There's some weird things about Jim Morrison.
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:02:00.500]  Did you know that he went through a blood-drinking witchcraft initiation
[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:02.500]  when he was dating a witch at one point?
[03:02:02.500 --> 03:02:05.500]  That's actually in the Oliver Stone film with Val Kilmer.
[03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:06.500]  Great film.
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:10.500]  And they actually include that scene if you've never seen it.
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:14.500]  I recommend you go and watch it.
[03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:19.500]  The Doors of Perception deals with a trip that he took to Hollywood.
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:22.500]  I didn't actually know because I had not yet read this book.
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:23.500]  It's famous.
[03:02:23.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  I had heard of it, but I'd never gotten through it until recently.
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:31.500]  He talks about that he took this trip to Hollywood in the 1950s
[03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:35.500]  for an American Psychiatric Association meeting.
[03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:39.500]  While he was at the hotel and hanging out in the Hollywood area,
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:42.500]  he decided to try mescaline.
[03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:45.500]  He recorded the experience and wrote down a lot of his ideas as a result of this,
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:48.500]  and this becomes the book The Doors of Perception.
[03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:53.500]  It also comes from a William Blake title about cleansing the doors of perception,
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:57.500]  which deals with the artist's perception of true reality and true being
[03:02:57.500 --> 03:02:59.500]  and inspiration and creativity.
[03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:01.500]  Now, if you don't know, of course, William Blake was very influenced
[03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:05.500]  by Hermeticism and alchemy, and he includes a lot of that
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:08.500]  in his paintings and in his poetry.
[03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:11.500]  And so that's where Huxley is pulling from.
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:16.500]  But the reason this is so important is not because of wannabe shamans out there
[03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:20.500]  and brujos and people that want to go to Peru and,
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:24.500]  yeah, I want to go meet a shaman in Peru, man, and go on a vision quest.
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:26.500]  That's not the point.
[03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:30.500]  The point is that this would become part of MKUltra.
[03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:35.500]  This was a key element, a key time period when MKUltra was just kicking off.
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:42.500]  And as you know, MKUltra comes out of the Tavistock and British versions
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:45.500]  of Shellshock Experimentation and Mind Control.
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:47.500]  Now, on my channel, if you go to YouTube,
[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:52.500]  I just lectured through the first half of Dr. John Coleman's very rare,
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:55.500]  very hard-to-get Tavistock book.
[03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:58.500]  In the past, we've covered Daniel Estelin's Tavistock book.
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:00.500]  This is a different Tavistock book.
[03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:05.500]  This is one of the first written on Tavistock in the year 2005.
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.500]  And at that time, it was right before, I think, Dr. John Coleman passed away,
[03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:14.500]  the purported MI5, MI6 whistleblower who went into the details of how British
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:18.500]  intelligence was really behind the 60s counterculture and a lot of this stuff.
[03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:20.500]  We're going to find a lot of overlap.
[03:04:20.500 --> 03:04:23.500]  And he speaks heavily of the Fabian socialists.
[03:04:23.500 --> 03:04:26.500]  And I'm going to make that tie-in and get into some of that work.
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:32.500]  But a key figure in this architecture from Tavistock and the Estelin Institute
[03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:34.500]  is the figure of Huxley.
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:40.500]  And Huxley is crucial for the popularization and the mass initiation
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:47.500]  through the counterculture drug culture of LSD and all the other hallucinogens.
[03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:49.500]  So we're going to get to that in a moment.
[03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:50.500]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:52.500]  This is The Alex Jones Show, and I'm your guest host,
[03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:54.500]  Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:56.500]  More Infowars in the store right now.
[03:04:57.500 --> 03:05:01.500]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:08.500]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:12.500]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:15.500]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:19.500]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:21.500]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:25.500]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:28.500]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for decades.
[03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:32.500]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[03:05:32.500 --> 03:05:36.500]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:39.500]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:41.500]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:44.500]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:49.500]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:05:56.000 --> 03:06:05.280]  One, two, three.
[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:06.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:06.280 --> 03:06:11.060]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and we are talking about other texts that
[03:06:11.060 --> 03:06:17.360]  Aldous Huxley wrote, one of those key formative figures preparing the way for the mass initiation
[03:06:17.360 --> 03:06:23.160]  that would occur in the 1960s and up until today, bringing us into the phase of the final
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:26.760]  revolution that Aldous and his brother Julian wrote about.
[03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:29.000]  Julian has a book about the final revolution.
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.600]  Aldous writes about the final revolution in many, many places.
[03:06:31.600 --> 03:06:36.400]  Of course, we know Brave New World, the dystopian novel that we covered two weeks ago in the
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:42.680]  fourth hour, deals with the mass drugging of the population, and they're being initiated
[03:06:42.680 --> 03:06:48.880]  into a kind of weird new world religion of sex magic, drugs, and orgies.
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:49.880]  That's in the novel.
[03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:52.000]  And we're already kind of on the cusp of that now.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:56.880]  All of the weird inversions that you see and everything going crazy in society, it's not
[03:06:56.880 --> 03:07:03.280]  primarily something that's just an organic revolution or counterculture revolution.
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:10.080]  All the counterculture stuff, especially of the 20th century and today, is largely manufactured,
[03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:17.720]  created, and steered by social engineers, particularly the premier engine of which is
[03:07:17.720 --> 03:07:21.360]  the Tavistock Institute, the Tavistock Clinic.
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:22.400]  Where does this come from?
[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:26.560]  Well, you've heard of Edward Bernays' classic book, Propaganda.
[03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:30.960]  And on my channel, of course, as you know, we lecture through dozens of these global
[03:07:30.960 --> 03:07:34.920]  elite texts, and we've done it for years now, going on six, seven years.
[03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:40.520]  We've been through probably 60 now, maybe 70 white papers, key texts of the elite.
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:45.600]  And we did Bernays this propaganda many years ago.
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:48.600]  And if you recall, there's a curious statement on the very first page.
[03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:50.600]  Do you remember what it is?
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:51.600]  The famous quote.
[03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:53.600]  He says, we are governed.
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:54.600]  Our minds are molded.
[03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:55.600]  Our tastes are formed.
[03:07:55.600 --> 03:07:59.600]  All of our ideas are suggested largely by men that we have never heard of.
[03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:04.600]  But it is the logical result of the way in which this democratic society,
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:07.600]  it's a fraud, democratic society is organized.
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:12.600]  Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this if they're to live together.
[03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:16.600]  Our invisible governors are unaware.
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:20.600]  We are unaware of the identity and this leadership.
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:23.600]  He says that they control through social engineering.
[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:26.600]  It is a conscious manipulation, he says,
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:31.600]  by intelligent individuals to control this democratic society.
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:34.600]  They constitute an invisible government.
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:37.600]  And that is the true ruling power of this country.
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:39.600]  He's talking about America.
[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:43.600]  Edward Bernays, father of modern propaganda, advertising, all that.
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:46.600]  Relative of Sigmund Freud.
[03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:49.600]  Do you know what institution he's talking about?
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:52.600]  He's talking about the Tavistock Institute.
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:53.600]  Why is that so important?
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:54.600]  Where does that come from?
[03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:55.600]  Who cooked this up?
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:56.600]  Well, guess what?
[03:08:56.600 --> 03:09:02.600]  It's cooked up by all the same Fabian socialists that I've lectured on for the last six months, a year.
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:07.600]  The Lord Milner, the Lord Rothschild, the Cecil Rhodes circles,
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  they came up with the Tavistock Clinic, the Tavistock Institute.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:15.600]  And what's the history of this?
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:18.600]  Well, around the time of World War I,
[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:21.600]  there was an institution founded by British intelligence at that time,
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:23.600]  known as Wellington House.
[03:09:23.600 --> 03:09:29.600]  And Wellington House was creative in its propaganda right before World War I.
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:33.600]  They were really part of getting the U.S. involved in World War I.
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:38.600]  And one of the ways they did was they came up with a weaponized term called isolationist.
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:42.600]  You remember this was used when Ron Paul was running back in the day.
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:44.600]  Oh, Ron Paul's an isolationist.
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:47.600]  He doesn't want us involved in foreign entanglements.
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:52.600]  That's the classical American decentralized approach of states' rights.
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:54.600]  That's the classic American approach.
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:57.600]  Decentralization, we don't want a giant federal government
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:01.600]  that tells us we have to be involved in every European foreign conflict.
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:07.600]  Now, the World War I and World War II events themselves were the means by which
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:12.600]  this secret inner core that Bernays is talking about out of Tavistock,
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:14.600]  run by British intelligence,
[03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:20.600]  that was the means by which they got the United States into global policing
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:23.600]  and the vehicle for global governance.
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.600]  That's what Dr. Carol Quigley writes about in his gigantic tome, Tragedy and Hope.
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:32.600]  But the means that they used to achieve this were the perfecting of the scientific technique
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:37.600]  of social engineering, social control, and public opinion making.
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:41.600]  One of the early Tavistock luminaries was Walter Lippmann,
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:46.600]  who wrote the famous book in, I think, 1920, Public Opinion.
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:49.600]  Just like this book, Propaganda.
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:55.600]  And so they perfected the technique at Wellington House of coming up with weaponized terms
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.600]  that were then used by the Woodrow Wilson administration
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:02.600]  because he was an agent of these people.
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:06.600]  He had a handler called Colonel Edwin Mandel House.
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:10.600]  And that's how the Federal Reserve and all of that got pushed and set up.
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:12.600]  That's how there was the 14 freedoms
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:16.600]  and the idea that America would now be an engine for these people,
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:20.600]  Tavistock and the Fabians and the Royal Society.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:28.400]  They wrote at this time the idea that America could be a manifesto of justice.
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:30.400]  And this was something that Woodrow Wilson put forward.
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:35.400]  You could almost see the beginnings of social justice warriors here with Woodrow Wilson maybe.
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:40.400]  And they came up with the idea of demonizing the Kaiser for World War I
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:42.400]  and why we needed to be involved in World War I.
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:44.400]  And they called him the butcher.
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:48.400]  Guess what? They used the exact same propaganda for Saddam.
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:51.400]  The butcher of Baghdad.
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:52.400]  Same propaganda.
[03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:54.400]  Putin is Hitler.
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:59.400]  Even though Russia fought Nazis, Putin is Hitler.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:04.400]  So Wellington House, this intelligence wartime warfare apparatus around World War I
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:08.400]  that influences Woodrow Wilson and the American structure,
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:15.400]  evolves into the Tavistock Clinic, the Tavistock Institute for Social Engineering.
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:20.400]  And it evolved out of the 1936 text by Oswald Spengler.
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:22.400]  Now I'm not saying Spengler was involved in this.
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:30.400]  But the British intelligentsia read Spengler, the famous theorist of history
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:35.400]  who theorized that history and its empires have civilizational cycles.
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:44.400]  Civilizations have a birth, an ascent, an apogee, and then a decline and a collapse.
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:47.400]  And then it gives way to a new form, a new civilization.
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:49.400]  And you can never repeat the old civilizations.
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:52.400]  There's always a new form.
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:56.400]  And so Spengler's decline of the West,
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:00.400]  which was his theory about how as a result of the past patterns of history,
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:03.400]  Western civilization would collapse and decline.
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:08.400]  They read that, these Wellington House strategists like Arnold Toynbee and others,
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:10.400]  and they said, hey, we could actually weaponize that.
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:17.400]  Let's take the track of how Spengler describes the decline and let's weaponize it
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:24.400]  and turn it into an actual way to accelerate the decline and collapse of Western civilization.
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:28.400]  Because, as we've said, the Tavistock social engineers and the Fabian socialists
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:34.400]  behind all this already had in place at that time, back then,
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:38.400]  the technocratic government that they wanted to bring in, the global technocracy.
[03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:46.400]  In fact, Lord Halford Mackinder, the famous British theorist of heartland theory, rimland theory,
[03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:48.400]  which we've lectured on many times,
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:54.400]  Lord Halford Mackinder said, we must have global governance now at all costs, no matter what.
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:13:59.400]  Even if it was required a socialist dictatorship, we will have it, no matter what.
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:15.600]  And he wrote about that and theorized and strategized that in the 1920s and 30s, way, way early on together with Toynbee and HG Wells and all the same characters you always hear me talk about, because all of these people wrote books and it's all public.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:26.320]  But another thing they wanted to do was study how to master perception, perception management,
[03:14:26.320 --> 03:14:27.480]  perception control.
[03:14:27.500 --> 03:14:35.100]  Don Draper, Mad Men, same stuff because the same people behind that show or what that
[03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:41.540]  show is about, the Mad Men, the Ad Men, that's talking about these people, Lipman, Bernays,
[03:14:41.540 --> 03:14:41.900]  these people.
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  How do we make public opinion?
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  Well, one way they figured out how to make it and to master it was through wartime operations.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  Wartime psychological operations.
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  Not just against the enemy, but how to get the people in the homeland, your people, the West,
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  on board with all of the wars and the entanglements.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  Simplest way to do it, create a villain.
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  Saddam's the butcher of Baghdad.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  Osama bin Laden.
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  Within a few minutes of the World Trade Center towers.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  Osama bin Laden.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  We must invade Afghanistan.
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  Stuff that had nothing to do with 9-11.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  It becomes the pretext for everything else.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  All of the global imperium and the loss of liberties, etc, etc.
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  That's all mastered at Tavistock and Rand Corporation.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  A lot of the Tavistock people also worked at the Rand Corporation.
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  Cross-pollination.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  Dr. Kurt Lewin.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Spent time in MIT.
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  Spent time doing stuff at Rand.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  One of the famous Tavistock guys.
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Jay's analysis.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  And go to the Infowars store and get those products now.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  I dare you.
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Exposing the cartels.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  Coming under fire.
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  Or you're on the streets of some American city.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  Hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  And again, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team.
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:42.000]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  So, it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  It's really just incredible.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  So, for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  I know you spread the word.
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  I know you pray for us.
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  And that's wonderful.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  Keep doing it.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:50.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  Please take action now.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfowarsStore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:26.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfowarsStore.com and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  Sure, you share a link.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  You share an article.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  You tell folks about the show.
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our SweepAid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  All of these are really great products.
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  They keep us on air.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfowarsStore.com right now and get these great Infowars products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  It's been around about 15 years.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:33.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  The point is you can get the filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  They're discounted right now.
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  Finally back in stock.
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:17.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer, today's analysis we're
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:25.440]  talking about the seminal text of the 1960s counterculture from 1954 from Tavistock and
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:32.039]  British intelligence operative, in my view, Aldous Huxley, the doors of perception and
[03:20:32.039 --> 03:20:37.440]  how Huxley was crucial in kicking off the drug revolution and the drug experimentation
[03:20:37.440 --> 03:20:38.440]  of the 1960s.
[03:20:38.440 --> 03:20:43.359]  In fact, there's a lot of references throughout this book to all kinds of things that you
[03:20:43.359 --> 03:20:47.539]  wouldn't necessarily expect, he not only references all kinds of religious traditions
[03:20:47.539 --> 03:20:51.560]  and a kind of a syncretist blending of all the religions, he says a mesclun might be
[03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:58.720]  the key by which, and perhaps future iterations of, you know, these entheogens turning them
[03:20:58.720 --> 03:21:04.039]  into things like LSD, right, they might be the key by which humans as a whole could
[03:21:04.039 --> 03:21:07.760]  achieve initiation.
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:11.520]  And he never really says exactly what into what, he just talks about initiation into the
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:16.600]  pure vision, into the vision of the light, perhaps he means something luciferian, in
[03:21:16.600 --> 03:21:20.760]  fact at one point he mentions luciferianism in this novel, he also mentions adrenochrome
[03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:28.760]  in the first three or four pages, by the way, but he talks about the perceiver who
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:35.000]  is initiated through, in this case, the mesclun or any other kind of hallucinogen like this,
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:41.359]  he says that these things without pretensions are satisfied to be merely themselves, they
[03:21:41.359 --> 03:21:46.680]  are sufficient in their suchness, he uses these really generic, deep-sounding terms instead
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:54.880]  of being or existence, he'll say the suchness, not acting as a part to go it alone in isolation,
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:22:01.400]  in luciferian defiance of the grace of God, he says that individuality is luciferian,
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:07.380]  and we see the wholeness, everything becomes one, monism, pantheism, and in fact at one
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:12.359]  point he even says that when you do these drugs you see your own potentiality to be
[03:22:12.359 --> 03:22:17.960]  omniscient, so this kind of delusion that he has divine powers and divine insight, he
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:23.080]  can potentially know and see all things, which is literally what he says, leads him towards
[03:22:23.080 --> 03:22:31.199]  the end of the book to say that if you think about the religious mystics of the past and
[03:22:31.199 --> 03:22:34.640]  their experiences, and we look at things like the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which is something
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.400]  that his other intelligence cohort, Tim Leary, was a big fan of, we'll talk about that in
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:44.800]  a second, he says that there's a pure vision of light that one sees in these books and
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:49.320]  in these drugs, and that pure light, which we're reminded of course that lucifer can
[03:22:49.320 --> 03:22:54.039]  appear as an angel of light, he says that pure light that can be seen is something that
[03:22:54.039 --> 03:23:01.840]  perhaps the state should even mandate people go through, I'm not joking, he says maybe
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:07.520]  we ought to even have state-mandated drug trips, well that sounds a lot like what's
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:13.199]  in Brave New World, so you thought he was exposing, no, he's exposing the Brave New
[03:23:13.199 --> 03:23:18.960]  World dystopia, he's a hero of freedom, no, he says that we should have mandated drug
[03:23:18.960 --> 03:23:25.840]  trips that are for those that we call the angels, I don't know, he says Blake's angels,
[03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:30.600]  Blake's angels, I think he means the artistic and creative and genius elites of society
[03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:37.600]  should undergo mandatory drug trips, and by the way, he quotes HG Wells countless times
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:43.920]  throughout the novel, in fact, the doors in the wall is a phrase he uses from HG Wells,
[03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:51.080]  consummate globalist, socialist, etc., he says maybe we should even mandate this, and
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:55.359]  he says that when we look at the religious landscape of America, he says that the traditional
[03:23:55.359 --> 03:24:01.920]  religions are dead and they're boring and they're, you know, calcified and then they're
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:06.080]  stultified and all this kind of stuff, which, okay, that might be true, but he says the answer
[03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:12.039]  to this is to have a new religion, something like Native American religion, something like
[03:24:12.039 --> 03:24:16.680]  we see Mickey and Mallory doing in Natural Born Killers, I'm not joking, he actually
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:21.960]  says that, he says we have to have a new kind of world religion where we all just trip
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:26.600]  balls, we're tripping balls, man, that's the new world religion. Now, where did he come up with
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:33.560]  this? Is he just an organic, random thinker, some cool hip guy? No, he was hanging out and
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:40.440]  partying with none other than the beast, Alistair Crowley. Yes, according to Dr. Richard Spence,
[03:24:40.440 --> 03:24:48.279]  Crowley and Huxley partied together, did drugs together, hung out, because both were serving
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:54.840]  British intelligence. Of course, Crowley was an agent of MI5, kind of a provocateur,
[03:24:55.640 --> 03:25:01.240]  and this is not unique to Huxley. Huxley is just one of the first to talk about this.
[03:25:04.199 --> 03:25:08.440]  If we move on and we look at books like the Psychedelic Experience,
[03:25:08.440 --> 03:25:15.480]  Timothy Leary says that this could be a guide, right, to initiate the masses or to initiate
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:21.160]  people into understanding and seeing the pure light. But it's not, of course, anything to do
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:25.800]  with God, Western civilization's idea of the Bible, and there's nothing like that. This is
[03:25:26.440 --> 03:25:31.640]  the new, unknown, secret, hidden God of the esotericists and of the occultists,
[03:25:32.359 --> 03:25:37.560]  and that's explicitly what Leary says in that book. Now, where does all of this come from,
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:43.400]  this idea of utilizing drug trips and whatnot? Well, guess what, that's what the British Empire
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:47.320]  was so good at. There's a famous book on this, have you heard of it? It's called Dope Inc.
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:56.199]  It's about how Britain, prior to the 20th century, ran a giant worldwide opium operation,
[03:25:57.320 --> 03:25:59.480]  and it was, guess what, it wasn't just making money.
[03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:05.080]  Drugs as means of control, drugs as social control.
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:10.520]  So when Alistair Crowley was doing his occult
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:14.279]  drug trip experiences, and he wrote a book called The Drug Diaries,
[03:26:15.240 --> 03:26:19.640]  and then Huxley read these books, and then they read each other's books,
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:27.160]  Huxley and his social engineer crews realized that these are great means for social control.
[03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:31.000]  So even if you don't believe in the demonic or demons or spirits or any of that,
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:38.600]  drugs are a key tool for social control, according to the social engineers themselves.
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:46.600]  And so that is why they saw such a power in the promotion of the sexual revolution and the
[03:26:46.600 --> 03:26:52.119]  drug revolution in the 1960s, and why all of these people promoted it years, decades before it
[03:26:52.119 --> 03:27:01.000]  happened. Did you know that in the 1920s and 30s, there was a mini sexual revolution, not just in
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:07.560]  the U.S., not just in America during the decadence of the period that F. Scott Fitzgerald writes
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:13.560]  about in The Great Gatsby, and we read about it in, or if you've seen the modern German TV series
[03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:22.039]  Babylon Berlin by Tom Tykower, right, that's taking place during the degeneracy of the pre-Weimar,
[03:27:22.039 --> 03:27:24.920]  the Weimar Republic, the Berlin era right before World War II.
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:31.560]  And then we had this, you know, stock market crash and all that, which was engineered by the elite,
[03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:40.359]  by the way. Well, that was a period of intense Skittle stuff, T-R-A-N-S stuff, the trans stuff
[03:27:40.359 --> 03:27:40.920]  was going on.
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:47.200]  All of that was going on in the 1920s and 30s and these people at
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:49.200]  Tavistock studied it.
[03:27:49.200 --> 03:27:55.200]  They studied the It Girl, Clara Bow, Joan Crawford, Louise Brooks,
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:59.200]  how that could steer the youth and the culture.
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  They want to be like the It Girl who cut her hair, bobbed it, was wild,
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:05.200]  slept around, all that kind of stuff.
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:09.200]  They knew in the 20s and 30s that this could all be weaponized
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:11.200]  as culture creation.
[03:28:11.200 --> 03:28:13.200]  And all of these books talk about it.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:15.200]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:19.200]  It's admin and social engineers and psychiatrists and psychologists.
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.200]  In fact, Huxley was going to the American Psychiatric Association
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:27.200]  meeting when he went and was tripping mescaline in Hollywood
[03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:31.200]  and partying.
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:35.200]  And I'm not trying to be a Puritan as if like,
[03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:38.200]  every drug is bad and I'm a good person because I don't drink alcohol.
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:39.200]  I'm not being a teetotaler.
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:40.200]  That's not the point here.
[03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:44.200]  The point is that all this stuff is studied for social control.
[03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:48.200]  I'm sure there are real medical applications of everything that exists.
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:50.200]  Everything that exists, God gave us.
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:53.200]  But it's also weaponizable and that's what we're talking about today
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:54.200]  on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:54.200 --> 03:28:55.200]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:29:09.200]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food
[03:29:09.200 --> 03:29:14.200]  but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:16.200]  So support InfoWars store.
[03:29:16.200 --> 03:29:20.200]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:21.200]  I don't know.
[03:29:21.200 --> 03:29:24.200]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes
[03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:29.200]  and, again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:30.200]  Krill oil.
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:35.200]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:38.200]  of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:41.200]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins,
[03:29:41.200 --> 03:29:44.200]  maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[03:29:44.200 --> 03:29:47.200]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:49.200]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[03:29:49.200 --> 03:29:51.200]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[03:29:51.200 --> 03:29:54.200]  Drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:29:54.200 --> 03:29:57.200]  You have to have these products.
[03:29:57.200 --> 03:30:01.200]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:05.200]  that have gone to InfoWarsStore.com and gotten the great products
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:08.200]  that enrich your life and empower your immune system and your body

[03:30:09.200 --> 03:30:13.200]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners
[03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:18.200]  that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:18.200 --> 03:30:21.200]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[03:30:21.200 --> 03:30:25.200]  never actually go to InfoWarsStore.com and never experience these great products
[03:30:25.200 --> 03:30:27.200]  and never fund the operation.
[03:30:27.200 --> 03:30:30.200]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:30:30.200 --> 03:30:31.200]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:33.200]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:36.200]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people
[03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:39.200]  like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep aid
[03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:41.200]  and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[03:30:41.200 --> 03:30:44.200]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:46.200]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:49.200]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate,
[03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:52.200]  and go to InfoWarsStore.com right now
[03:30:52.200 --> 03:30:55.200]  and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:57.200 --> 03:31:02.200]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic
[03:31:02.200 --> 03:31:04.200]  fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:31:04.200 --> 03:31:07.200]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:31:07.200 --> 03:31:12.200]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:31:12.200 --> 03:31:15.200]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:31:15.200 --> 03:31:17.200]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:31:17.200 --> 03:31:21.200]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:31:21.200 --> 03:31:23.200]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:31:23.200 --> 03:31:26.200]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[03:31:26.200 --> 03:31:28.200]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[03:31:28.200 --> 03:31:32.200]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:36.200]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:41.200]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:31:41.200 --> 03:31:46.200]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:50.200]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water,
[03:31:50.200 --> 03:31:52.200]  and a remedy to this madness.
[03:31:52.200 --> 03:31:56.200]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:56.200 --> 03:32:00.200]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months,
[03:32:00.200 --> 03:32:02.200]  and it's TurboForce Plus.
[03:32:02.200 --> 03:32:04.200]  We made it even stronger.
[03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:08.200]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:32:08.200 --> 03:32:14.200]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:14.200 --> 03:32:20.200]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:32:20.200 --> 03:32:22.200]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:26.200]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things,
[03:32:26.200 --> 03:32:30.200]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything,
[03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:34.200]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:32:34.200 --> 03:32:37.200]  It is the super fuel.
[03:32:37.200 --> 03:32:40.200]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:32:40.200 --> 03:32:42.200]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[03:32:42.200 --> 03:32:44.200]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:32:44.200 --> 03:32:46.200]  This is the boss.
[03:32:46.200 --> 03:32:49.200]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted.
[03:32:49.200 --> 03:32:51.200]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:51.200 --> 03:32:54.200]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:32:57.100 --> 03:33:05.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.100 --> 03:33:20.100]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, jaysanalysis.com.
[03:33:20.100 --> 03:33:25.100]  You can also follow me on Twitter and all the other social media outlets under Jay Dyer.
[03:33:25.100 --> 03:33:30.100]  I would ask that you do that. Of course, we don't get a lot of algorithmic promotion.
[03:33:30.100 --> 03:33:35.100]  We do well on Twitter, but if you go over to YouTube and you find my channel,
[03:33:35.100 --> 03:33:39.100]  go ahead and support and share that stuff, like that stuff, because, of course,
[03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:44.100]  the algorithm doesn't promote the stuff that we talk about typically because it's pretty edgy.
[03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:48.100]  Now, I want to remind you, too, that I've got two live events coming up,
[03:33:48.100 --> 03:33:54.100]  so if you want to come see me live June 3rd and 4th, Owen Schroer will be there with us as well in Nashville.
[03:33:54.100 --> 03:34:00.100]  Big live event. We got, I don't know, maybe 15, 20 people at a giant two-day event.
[03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:04.100]  You can go to my website, jaysanalysis.com, and you can see the two events there.
[03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:08.100]  You get tickets to that live event June 3rd and 4th in Nashville.
[03:34:08.100 --> 03:34:16.100]  Also, I'll be live in Hollywood if you want to come out and see me at the Van Nuys area.
[03:34:16.100 --> 03:34:22.100]  I guess that's Burbank-ish area. That will be July 6th in L.A.
[03:34:22.100 --> 03:34:26.100]  We'll be doing a five-hour presentation, big live event.
[03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:30.100]  Go get your tickets also on the website. All that stuff's also, just scroll down my Twitter feed.
[03:34:30.100 --> 03:34:33.100]  You'll see it all there, too, if you're looking for it.
[03:34:33.100 --> 03:34:39.100]  But I'm going to be doing a deeper dive into a lot of this Huxley stuff on my YouTube channel as well,
[03:34:39.100 --> 03:34:43.100]  so if you want to go follow me there, you can. We'll be doing that later today.
[03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:45.100]  But we're talking about the doors of perception.
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:51.100]  We're talking about how Huxley was beginning to see at this time the potentiality for using drugs
[03:34:51.100 --> 03:34:57.100]  and using the older model of British imperial control, the opium model, the opium war,
[03:34:57.100 --> 03:35:02.100]  for a new way to revolutionize society.
[03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:09.100]  It wasn't just about the individual going on a vision quest and figuring out his inner demons
[03:35:09.100 --> 03:35:15.100]  and his own little journey or whatever. No, this was a way to control and steer society.
[03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:20.100]  He talks about it that way, and every one of the psychonauts after him talks about it that way,
[03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:21.100]  Terrence McKenna.
[03:35:21.100 --> 03:35:25.100]  Oh, Terrence McKenna and the food of the gods, he says.
[03:35:25.100 --> 03:35:30.100]  We should go back to a Mother Earth Gaia religion.
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:34.100]  Right. And it should be based around the mushroom.
[03:35:34.100 --> 03:35:40.100]  And so what's amazing is that technocracy has for 100 years,
[03:35:40.100 --> 03:35:46.100]  you read books like Patrick Wood's Technocracy Rising, has seen the power of drugs
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:51.100]  for controlling society. That's exactly what is in Brave New World.
[03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:57.100]  You understand when he wrote that, he knew that the fake world religion would be combined with drugs
[03:35:57.100 --> 03:36:02.100]  to control society. And he didn't get that from him himself.
[03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:10.100]  In fact, before him in 1917, an old rare book, look at this old rare book
[03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:18.100]  from HG Wells, God, the invisible king, not talking about the God that you think of,
[03:36:18.100 --> 03:36:23.100]  not Jesus, not the Trinity, not any of that.
[03:36:23.100 --> 03:36:28.100]  What God is he talking about? The hidden God that you can only see when the doors of perception
[03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:35.100]  are open, when your doors of perception are cleansed via counter initiation,
[03:36:35.100 --> 03:36:40.100]  then you see the true God is Lucifer. That's what HG Wells said.
[03:36:40.100 --> 03:36:45.100]  He says, I'm not an atheist. I follow God. It's just a God called Lucifer,
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:51.100]  the light bringer, the light bearer, the pure light that he talks about seeing in this book
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:55.100]  and the pure light that Tim Leary says you will see.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:12.400]  In the Tibetan book of the dead, because the Tibetan book of the dead, he says is the same journey, the same vision quest that the individual sees when they do the drug trip, when you do the LSD trip, the mescaline trip, just like the after death journey.
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:18.400]  And that's why throughout this book, Huxley says, it's like opening up the multiverse, dude.
[03:37:19.400 --> 03:37:27.400]  Now wait a minute. Are you, are we supposed to believe in science? Or are we back to religious superstition and metaphysics?
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:29.400]  The multiverse, man.
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:32.400]  Because the multiverse is like Marvel comic book type stuff.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  It doesn't seem very scientific, seems very superstitious.
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  Quantum foam, man.
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  But you see, that's why it's a new religion.
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  Because scientism combines very well, scientism is a kind of a religion,
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  it combines very well with...
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:38:03.800]  ...this New Age spirituality that these guys were promoting, even in the 1890s with the Fabian Socialists, and Madame Blavatsky, again, working at the behest of the British Empire.
[03:38:03.800 --> 03:38:14.800]  And so they were studying the drug trips, the drug journey, the vision quest, all this stuff was being studied, and in the US, who did Huxley go work very closely with?
[03:38:14.800 --> 03:38:30.800]  The Esalen Institute, the US-based brains behind the 1960s counterculture spiritual revolution and spiritual movement, and the New Age movement, which would then be kicked off as the counterculture sexual revolution, drugs revolution.
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:40.800]  We could never be where we are today with the biological revolutions, that you can identify as whatever you want, without Tavistock.
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:50.800]  So who's in the background, all the way back to World War I and the Fabian Socialists back then, who's in the background of not the war itself, but managing the public perception?
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:39:06.800]  Tavistock. Tavistock is there at World War I, it's there at World War II, it's there in the Cold War, it's there throughout the 1960s counterculture revolution, and what was Tavistock so heavily pushing in the last five years?
[03:39:06.800 --> 03:39:08.800]  The Trans Agenda.
[03:39:09.500 --> 03:39:18.500]  Openly. In fact, they were being sued, I don't know what the result was, by a thousand families in the UK for transitioning and pushing this on kids.
[03:39:18.500 --> 03:39:23.500]  That's the ideological source of the Trans Agenda.
[03:39:23.500 --> 03:39:33.500]  The corporations are pushing it because corporations get their studies and their R&D from Tavistock and Rand Corporation and MIT.
[03:39:33.500 --> 03:39:36.500]  The same place.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  What's up the ideology and the studies and the research for how to change identity.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  Guess who came up with the plan of changing identity changing images of man.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  Tavistock Dr.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  Kurt Lewin changing identity is a Tavistock creation.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:55.000]  Now.
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  I know that that existed in the in the past that people have there been people
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:04.000]  born, you know with both parts, you know, they've been I know I know all that.
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  But it was never in history scientifically engineered and weaponized as it has been
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  by design by the same Institutes and the same people that I'm talking about.
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  John Rawlings Reese is another crucial British intelligence character who would go on to
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  work at Tavistock to push all kinds of ideas like this.
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  All of these Fabian socialists all these Royal Society elites.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:34.000]  They're pushing the exact same thing and they have been.
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  And Reese came up with some fascinating things.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  One of these was this idea of how do we change America back into this kind of
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  attache of an inner core of British intelligence elite.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  Not going to be done overnight.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  We're not going to be able to do it right away.
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  We can't install a dictator.
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  He says we got to have we're going to use this fiction.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  But he said it's a new term.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:00.000]  I'm going to I'm going to key.
[03:41:00.000 --> 03:41:03.000]  It's called long-range penetration.
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  Long-range penetration.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  And what that means is that you utilize the society's ideology itself and you
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  gradually change it through future shocks.
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:18.000]  That's a Tavistock idea.
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  So when Alvin Toffler came up with the idea of long-range penetration.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  That's a Tavistock idea.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  So when Alvin Toffler was writing about that and talking about that in the
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  70s, he was getting that from Tavistock.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  What are future shocks?
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  Future shocks are changes that are so disruptive to society so quick so many
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  of them so extreme that the public goes into a kind of panic.
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:50.000]  The term they use is maladaptive response passive maladaption panic
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:52.000]  fragmentation and dissociation.
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  So the way that they would study the trauma-based mind control on an
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  individual.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  Put the put the individual into a panic crisis mode.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  He fragments on an individual level his relationships his psyche and then he
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  dissociates into fantasy fantasy worlds.
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  That can be done on a macro scale for the whole society crisis response model.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:19.000]  They call it contrived crises are steered in the direction.
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  That was the original intended goal the whole time.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  Strategy of tension exactly what Brzezinski said about Gladio exactly what
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  Kissinger and those guys engineer Gladio operations to do strategy of tension
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  cause the chaos steer the society to the end goal.
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  It was always the plan managed crises.
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  Do you think the last three years was not a Tavistock managed crises?
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  Of course it was admittedly the British the Canadian government admits.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  They use PsyOps to trick you and scare you into this.
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  This is the Alex Jones.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  Just weeks ago.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  and take him off the air.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  People said no way is the most pop would ever happen.
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  They only had their curls on the air because they believe they control him.
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  It's the same thing with them for wars, but info wars is not owned by Fox or
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  Encouragers listeners understand.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:42.000]  Please don't take info wars for granted.
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  We'll get a great products at the same time.
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  And then for sure, I come.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  Go to him for sure.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:56.000]  I come get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  It is.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:12.000]  The fish oil is better than that.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:14.000]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  Krill oils is the best.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  And I'm sorry.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:24.000]  You want something like this?
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:28.000]  It's so good in my view.
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:46.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:50.000]  But you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:01.000]  Turbo forces back sold out for eight months and it's turbo force.
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  Plus, we made it even stronger.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:14.000]  Turbo forces back in stock at info or store.com or triple a two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  It's not just wide spectrum Nash, natural herbs that time release over 10 hours to be called 10 hour energy.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things in amino acids that turbo charge everything.
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  And are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  It is the super fuel.
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  They're two different new tropics.
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:42.000]  They go good with this.
[03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:46.000]  This is the boss.
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:48.000]  Turbo force back in stock.
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  Discounted info or store.com.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:46:00.000]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:03.000]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:06.000]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:07.000]  Period.
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  Case closed.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:14.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  It's been around about 15 years.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:30.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  Thousands of chemicals.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:48.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:51.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  The point is you get the filters at m4warstore.com.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:55.000]  They're discounted right now.
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:56.000]  Finally back in stock.
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:03.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.300 --> 03:47:18.779]  Welcome back to Alex Jones, we're talking about the planned mass initiation ritual initiating
[03:47:18.779 --> 03:47:26.820]  the masses into a new religion via not individual drug drips per se, but via the control and
[03:47:26.820 --> 03:47:29.259]  dominance of Big Pharma.
[03:47:29.259 --> 03:47:35.699]  Big Pharma now has its octopus grip on top of the population in a similar way to the
[03:47:35.699 --> 03:47:36.699]  British Empire.
[03:47:36.699 --> 03:47:39.340]  So I'm not saying the British Empire is controlling everybody, no.
[03:47:39.340 --> 03:47:44.179]  The inner core elite groups that were running the British Empire, the steering committees,
[03:47:44.179 --> 03:47:49.099]  the Royal Society, Royal Institute for International Affairs, Fabian Socialists, etc.
[03:47:49.099 --> 03:47:57.220]  That clique set up the model for putting Pratt House in New York based on Chatham House
[03:47:57.220 --> 03:48:02.179]  in the UK, the secret inner elite that run everything.
[03:48:02.179 --> 03:48:08.939]  That's the model that comes out of the Republic of Plato, comes out of Plato's later laws,
[03:48:08.939 --> 03:48:15.099]  the Council of Night, which is a secret intelligence apparatus of oligarchs that run the country
[03:48:15.099 --> 03:48:21.539]  with a bunch of front goobers as their public face of politicians that take the heat, the
[03:48:21.539 --> 03:48:24.179]  Bidens, the AOCs.
[03:48:24.179 --> 03:48:32.140]  Meanwhile, the deep state, the shadow state, the cryptocracy is who really runs things.
[03:48:32.140 --> 03:48:37.259]  And everybody's energy, everybody's focus, everybody's anger is always directed at the
[03:48:37.259 --> 03:48:45.740]  public goobers, who are meant to be goobers, but never, ever focusing on the Brzezinskis,
[03:48:45.740 --> 03:48:49.019]  the Kissingers, the Jacques Attali's.
[03:48:49.100 --> 03:48:57.100]  The Dr. Kurt Lewins, the John Rawlings-Reeds of Tavistock.
[03:48:57.100 --> 03:49:05.460]  As propaganda itself said, Bernays book said, 99% of you don't even know these people.
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:07.360]  That's who's really calling the shots.
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:15.060]  The real ballers and shot callers are not AOC and Biden.
[03:49:15.060 --> 03:49:22.180]  These people call the shots because they utilize long-range penetration to set up organizations
[03:49:22.180 --> 03:49:26.420]  and using the quadrillions of fiat money that they printed to buy up everything.
[03:49:26.420 --> 03:49:29.300]  It's an amazing scam, an amazing trick.
[03:49:29.300 --> 03:49:40.859]  Tavistock said, the best way to condition the public is to put our guys at Esalen, National
[03:49:40.859 --> 03:49:48.340]  Institute of Health, MIT, et cetera, et cetera, and get them to steer by being intelligentsia,
[03:49:48.340 --> 03:49:53.580]  by being in control, get them to initiate people, get them to indoctrinate people.
[03:49:54.060 --> 03:50:01.179]  For example, at the National Training Laboratory that was set up on the Avril Harriman property,
[03:50:01.179 --> 03:50:06.619]  this National Training Laboratory would set up an invisible army, an invisible college,
[03:50:06.619 --> 03:50:13.099]  an invisible army, what Bernays said, it would be the true rulers and controllers of society.
[03:50:13.099 --> 03:50:26.140]  So the generals, the CEOs, the government officials, they're sent and trained at places
[03:50:26.140 --> 03:50:29.259]  like the National Training Laboratories.
[03:50:29.259 --> 03:50:30.340]  What are they trained in?
[03:50:30.340 --> 03:50:38.580]  They're trained in the techniques of Dr. Kurt Lewins, not just the three-system response
[03:50:38.580 --> 03:50:46.300]  that we talked about, the three-system response model, but they're trained in behavioral psychology,
[03:50:46.300 --> 03:50:47.060]  public manipulation.
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:51:05.840]  Key operatives of this power structure, of Tavistock, and some of the things that they
[03:51:05.840 --> 03:51:11.320]  pushed would also be pushed by Huxley and others, which is the idea of indigenous traditions
[03:51:11.320 --> 03:51:15.840]  are magically more spiritual and superior to everything else, right?
[03:51:15.840 --> 03:51:20.160]  If you're rolling around in mud and feces, that's way more spiritual, right?
[03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:27.240]  Obviously, a guru rolling around in feces is way more spiritual than building giant
[03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:28.240]  cathedrals.
[03:51:28.240 --> 03:51:29.240]  Totally.
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:40.780]  The archaic revival, the shamanic traditions, all of that being pushed is not done organically.
[03:51:40.780 --> 03:51:46.780]  There are individuals who organically get into it, sure, but it is pushed from behind
[03:51:46.780 --> 03:51:56.660]  the scenes by these people, Havistock, Rand, Esalen, and dozens, hundreds of other think
[03:51:56.660 --> 03:52:01.060]  tanks, foundations, and NGOs that push all of these things.
[03:52:01.060 --> 03:52:06.500]  The Ford Foundation, the Soros Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment,
[03:52:06.500 --> 03:52:11.300]  Brookings Institute, the CFR, on and on and on and on and on.
[03:52:11.300 --> 03:52:14.660]  That's the real power structure, and it's in all of your faces.
[03:52:14.660 --> 03:52:17.000]  It's not Joe Biden.
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:20.420]  Is anybody going to wake up to this?
[03:52:20.420 --> 03:52:25.060]  Everybody's talking about this or that conservative talk person who's divorced.
[03:52:25.060 --> 03:52:27.140]  None of that matters.
[03:52:27.140 --> 03:52:28.500]  This is what's really going on.
[03:52:28.500 --> 03:52:30.460]  These are the people that really run you.
[03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:35.520]  And because you talk about divorces and nonsense, that's why these people think they have the
[03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:36.340]  right to rule you.
[03:52:36.400 --> 03:52:44.680]  You don't know who these people are.
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:46.000]  You don't know who Kurt Lewin is.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:47.720]  You don't know what Tavistock is.
[03:52:47.720 --> 03:52:53.680]  Now, this audience knows what I'm saying in general, speaking to a more general sense.
[03:52:53.680 --> 03:52:56.760]  You don't know what they're teaching at the Wharton Business School, whether they're teaching
[03:52:56.760 --> 03:52:59.240]  Fabian Keynesian economics, do you?
[03:52:59.240 --> 03:53:01.800]  Do you know about that?
[03:53:01.800 --> 03:53:04.640]  Do you know that John Maynard Keynes was a Fabian socialist?
[03:53:05.300 --> 03:53:14.300]  Do you know that Lord Gray was the architect of World War I through Wellington House, which was the predecessor to Tavistock?
[03:53:14.300 --> 03:53:25.300]  Do you know that Bertrand Russell supported the sexual revolution back in the 20s and 30s, the pre-sexual revolution I was telling you about, and that all these people studied it to weaponize it?
[03:53:25.300 --> 03:53:34.779]  Do you know about Dr. Emery's passive maladaption phases to controlling and steering society?
[03:53:34.779 --> 03:53:39.140]  Stanford Research Institute putting out Changing Images of Man, written by these people.
[03:53:39.140 --> 03:53:42.460]  Stanford Research Institute is a Tavistock Institute in America.
[03:53:43.500 --> 03:53:48.500]  Not only do they push, it's all the rainbow skills stuff is this.
[03:53:48.500 --> 03:53:49.500]  You understand.
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  It's not an organic revolution of liberties and freedoms.
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:53:59.000]  It's steered, controlled, and engineered to control you.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  To control you through base desires, through your passions.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:07.000]  And I mean, we're all, you know, I think it's a fallen world,
[03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:10.000]  so we're all going to be subject to this to a degree,
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  but the way to get out of it is not more liberalism, more, more,
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  give us more liberalism, vote out the scoundrels, put in a new crop of scoundrels,
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  vote in more scoundrels, and let's yell at them,
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  then we'll vote in some more scoundrels.
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:24.000]  That's what Quigley says.
[03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  Quigley says the system was set up so that you would yell at one crop of scoundrels
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  and vote out, vote in the new ones.
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  It's a scam.
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:35.000]  I'm not saying that you can't be involved in politics.
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  I'm just saying that all this stuff's created.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  The pop stars, they studied this in the 20s and 30s, how to create the it girl.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  Paris Hilton wasn't the first it girl.
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  It goes back to the 20s and 30s, which at that time, by the way,
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  there were no, if you watch the Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie movie, Babylon,
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  which I do recommend watching.
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  It's actually a good portrayal of, like, what all of that pop culture,
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  Hollywood culture is.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  Go watch Babylon, and you'll see its rise and its descent,
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  and it takes place, by the way, during that period in 1910, 1920s,
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  when there were no controls.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  There were no Hayes Code.
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  There were no moral code or whatever.
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  So it was pretty risque back then.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  That's that time period that I'm talking about,
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  that Tavistock was interested in studying for social control,
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  social engineering, public opinion-making, polling.
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  One thing that Dr. Coleman talked about that's not as relevant to us nowadays
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  because of the Internet, but used to be, particularly in World War II,
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  the boomer era, post-World War II boomer era,
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  that polling was a big deal.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:48.000]  But they figured out how to just make fake polls,
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  and everybody would go along with it.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  So just say, oh, 80% of America supports this war.
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  You don't want to be part of the 20% of maladjusted, malicious individuals,
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  do you?
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  No, oh, I support it.
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  Well, yes, whatever you say, I support it, you see.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  So they just made fake polls.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  In a sense, the polls were fake.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  They were always fake.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  Gallup polling comes out of this, Tavistock.
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:20.200]  And the polling is intended to engineer your perception.
[03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:21.200]  That's the whole purpose of it.
[03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:24.200]  It's nothing to do with gauging what people really thought.
[03:56:24.200 --> 03:56:30.200]  It was about getting you to go along with what they call groupthink.
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:32.200]  Guess who came up with groupthink?
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:34.200]  Tavistock.
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:38.200]  Groupthink is a Tavistock idea, Tavistock terminology that they came up with
[03:56:38.200 --> 03:56:45.200]  regard to how to steer people into accepting total collectivization
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:47.200]  and total unanimity with certain groups.
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:49.200]  Now, I'm not saying it's wrong to have groups.
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:50.200]  That's not the point.
[03:56:50.200 --> 03:56:57.200]  But it's wrong to weaponize and steer people into destructive,
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:00.200]  stunting, intellectually stunting groups.
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:04.200]  But corporations love this because they love groupthink.
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:07.200]  And so it's actually corporations that would farm out
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:10.200]  and purchase a lot of this research from Tavistock.
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:14.200]  So, understand, it's a research and development clinic.
[03:57:14.200 --> 03:57:18.200]  It's just the premier psychological work for operation.
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:20.200]  And it's been around for so long.
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:26.200]  And this is one great example of Tavistock operations.
[03:57:26.200 --> 03:57:29.200]  And if you're wondering how the country went in this direction,
[03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:32.200]  just look at the Rand Corporation and look at Tavistock.
[03:57:32.200 --> 03:57:34.200]  Just look at the Rand Corporation and look at Tavistock
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:37.200]  because they're in the business of steering culture.
[03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:39.200]  So, if you want to get my books, go to jasonhouses.com.
[03:57:39.200 --> 03:57:40.200]  Go to the shop.
[03:57:40.200 --> 03:57:44.200]  Get these giant, excellent 600-page books that I wrote.
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:50.200]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs,
[03:57:50.200 --> 03:57:53.200]  not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:57:53.200 --> 03:57:55.200]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:57:55.200 --> 03:57:57.200]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:57:57.200 --> 03:57:59.200]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:57:59.200 --> 03:58:04.200]  And it says, Political Prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:58:04.200 --> 03:58:06.200]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:58:06.200 --> 03:58:09.200]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:58:09.200 --> 03:58:12.200]  Political Prisoner with Trump on the front.
[03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:15.200]  They're in a mug shot jail background.
[03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:16.200]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:58:16.200 --> 03:58:20.200]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:22.200]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:23.200]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:58:23.200 --> 03:58:25.200]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[03:58:25.200 --> 03:58:26.200]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:58:26.200 --> 03:58:27.200]  Alex Jones for president.
[03:58:28.200 --> 03:58:31.200]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited-edition shirt.
[03:58:31.200 --> 03:58:33.200]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:41.200]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mug shot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:58:41.200 --> 03:58:45.200]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:58:47.200 --> 03:58:50.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:58:50.200 --> 03:58:53.200]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[03:58:53.200 --> 03:58:55.200]  plan for our future.
[03:58:55.200 --> 03:58:56.200]  That is the hellish future.
[03:58:56.200 --> 03:59:00.200]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:59:00.200 --> 03:59:03.200]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:59:03.200 --> 03:59:06.200]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:06.200 --> 03:59:09.200]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:59:09.200 --> 03:59:11.200]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:59:11.200 --> 03:59:14.200]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:59:14.200 --> 03:59:17.200]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:59:17.200 --> 03:59:19.200]  a signed copy, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:19.200 --> 03:59:23.200]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:59:23.200 --> 03:59:26.200]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[03:59:26.200 --> 03:59:29.200]  you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:59:29.200 --> 03:59:32.200]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[03:59:32.200 --> 03:59:33.200]  or unsigned copies.
[03:59:33.200 --> 03:59:37.200]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:59:37.200 --> 03:59:40.200]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies,
[03:59:40.200 --> 03:59:43.200]  and donate them to the library, or give them to the local school.
[03:59:43.200 --> 03:59:46.200]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:59:47.200 --> 03:59:52.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:59:52.200 --> 03:59:54.200]  it's Alex Jones.
