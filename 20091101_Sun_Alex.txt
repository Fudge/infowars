[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:32.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:43.240 --> 00:55.120]  201-2244-888-2012-244 and we'll get you up and on the air today there is a
[00:55.120 --> 01:01.360]  article that was posted this morning by McClatchy newspapers they own hundreds
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.440]  of newspapers around the country like the Fort Worth Star Telegram that is the
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.200]  most detailed mainstream media report that I've seen about Goldman Sachs now
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.000]  this tells us really nothing new that we didn't already know but it's the first
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.440]  national publication to break down all the crimes of Goldman Sachs who are
[01:23.440 --> 01:30.480]  private shareholders in the private Federal Reserve system and so this will
[01:30.480 --> 01:36.880]  be news to the American people and this writer Greg Gordon deserves the Pulitzer
[01:36.880 --> 01:43.040]  Prize but they normally give that out to lackeys of the establishment who put
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.960]  out pro-globalist propaganda but this is real reporting and it is the first time
[01:49.960 --> 01:53.800]  I've seen it all boiled down in one place and they have gotten some internal
[01:53.800 --> 01:57.600]  Goldman Sachs documents so there is actually some new information here but
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.800]  it verifies what we already knew Goldman Sachs helped engineer the housing
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.400]  collapse knew the whole time this was going to happen and set it up so they
[02:07.400 --> 02:16.320]  could destroy their competition in the process and it is just an absolutely
[02:16.320 --> 02:23.400]  amazing amazing report so we're gonna be going over that today and dovetailing it
[02:23.400 --> 02:28.200]  with the Wall Street Journal admitting that the carbon tax is a world
[02:28.200 --> 02:32.360]  government plan run by the banks I wonder how Rupert Murdoch allowed that
[02:32.360 --> 02:42.240]  story to come out today and tie it also in with statements last week by the Duke
[02:42.240 --> 02:48.600]  of York on a Queen Elizabeth II sons banker bonuses minute says the Duke
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.920]  50 billion in bank bonuses just over there in England and counting he says
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.520]  that's a no big deal and that we should all thank the banks for the great job
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.320]  they're doing so this is the let them eat cake attitude that we see also a
[03:03.320 --> 03:10.880]  huge stack of really important news and information on the flu front headlines
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.440]  like boy rushed a hospital after swine flu jab public school nurses give swine
[03:16.440 --> 03:24.160]  flu vaccine to kids without parents okay since child a hospital countless local
[03:24.160 --> 03:31.240]  news reports of people being paralyzed from the swine flu vaccine from other
[03:31.240 --> 03:39.520]  vaccines the FDA admitting that the vaccines are paralyzing people I know
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.920]  people who are getting sick from vaccines I don't have to read it in the
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.120]  news but it it's not really in the national news though it's all over
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.720]  local news and Texas and Kentucky and New York and Massachusetts and California
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.640]  so we'll try to break this national international media blockade where the
[04:00.640 --> 04:04.440]  national and international media the big nightly news programs aren't talking
[04:04.440 --> 04:15.320]  about it but all over the country ABC Fox CBS they're all reporting what's
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.080]  going on in the government's admitting it then I'm driving into work today and
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.600]  here dr. Deena Dell on the local station I'm on 590 saying that it's all made up
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.800]  nobody's getting sick from the shots and that he's glad that conspiracy theorists
[04:28.800 --> 04:31.880]  aren't taking it because then we're all gonna die and that's good for the gene
[04:31.880 --> 04:35.600]  pool to get rid of us just a bizarre statement I mean all I'm doing is
[04:35.600 --> 04:42.040]  reading newspapers and watching local TV newscasts that I see online because
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.280]  internet viewers get their news from the web we get a wider spectrum people that
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.040]  still only watch television or mainstream radio I they're in the dark we'll
[04:51.040 --> 04:54.680]  break all that down after this one minute break that's coming up have a host of
[04:54.680 --> 05:00.560]  other news items will be going over as well today stay with me hello this is
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.720]  Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going into a battle and they

[06:00.760 --> 06:06.560]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[06:06.560 --> 06:14.080]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network thank you for joining us
[06:14.080 --> 06:20.160]  on this Sunday November 1st 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next two
[06:20.160 --> 06:23.520]  hours and we're going to open the phones up and be taking some of your phone
[06:23.520 --> 06:28.520]  calls today as well but I would hope that callers would call in on the four
[06:28.520 --> 06:33.800]  or five big news items or news stacks that I have here because I do want to
[06:33.800 --> 06:42.640]  get your response your view on what's happening there is a real gulf developing
[06:42.640 --> 06:53.640]  between internet news customers and people that only get their news from
[06:53.640 --> 07:01.000]  mainstream television and talk radio or their local paper there is a real
[07:01.000 --> 07:09.120]  dichotomy here a gulf a separation this weekend I spent several hours
[07:09.120 --> 07:17.280]  searching the term paralyzed Gillian beret syndrome flu vaccine bad reaction
[07:17.280 --> 07:24.840]  and no exaggeration my wife had to pull me away from YouTube alone because
[07:24.840 --> 07:29.560]  there were more than 30 local newscasts and I printed a bunch of them off if we
[07:29.560 --> 07:35.680]  have time today I'm gonna play some short clips because a we just can't sit here
[07:35.680 --> 07:40.360]  and play everybody else's news but then be people listening won't believe this
[07:40.360 --> 07:46.280]  unless they actually hear it and then see we don't have time to play all this
[07:46.280 --> 07:50.840]  on air I mean it's one thing if I played one two three four five six seven
[07:50.840 --> 07:54.760]  eight nine ten what would happen if I played 30 plus I mean I printed them off
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.400]  I printed off the pages where you can go to YouTube and find them we've been
[07:58.400 --> 08:04.400]  linking to them up on info wars.com and present planet.com news report after
[08:04.400 --> 08:12.400]  news report after news report in DC in Virginia in Texas in Kentucky in New
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.360]  York in California where the Food and Drug Administration admits yes you got
[08:19.360 --> 08:25.040]  paralyzed you can't walk you're having convulsions or yes your daughter died or
[08:25.040 --> 08:32.920]  your father died from the Gardasil shot from the flu shot I mean I've got stacks
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.640]  of these here in front of me I mean here's one you can write this down and
[08:38.640 --> 08:47.840]  anybody can go to YouTube Jerry Edmonds man paralyzed after routine vaccination
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.560]  that's that's the headline and and and that's just one and then they have the
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.760]  FDA going well yes it does paralyze some people and it does make some people
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.640]  have convulsions and it does kill some people but that's the price we're ready
[09:02.640 --> 09:13.200]  to pay then I read the local newspaper or I watch national news Fox CNN it
[09:13.200 --> 09:16.520]  doesn't matter you've all seen it as well and they're saying it's all
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.400]  conspiracy theories no one's getting sick there's no mercury it can't cause
[09:22.400 --> 09:28.040]  Guillain-Barre's disorder syndrome it can't sterilize you or hurt your
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.800]  fertility your ability to have children if you're a man or woman they have a
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.480]  federal program at the through the state health departments in public schools
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.080]  the New York Times writes the curriculum we wrote a story this week at
[09:42.080 --> 09:46.560]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com about that with links to it where they have
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.080]  handouts for the parents and their children at public schools they send
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.160]  home with all of them all over the country it's not an insert from the
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.960]  vaccine the H1N1 or the regular seasonal it's just a sheet saying there's no
[09:58.960 --> 10:04.280]  mercury it can't cause Guillain-Barre it can't cause neurological problems it
[10:04.280 --> 10:10.600]  can't cause autoimmune disorders but then we have the inserts that I've shown
[10:10.600 --> 10:15.000]  over and over again here on television but don't believe me go to FDA.gov and
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.720]  type in flu vaccine bad reactions or flu vaccine fact sheet and you'll have
[10:22.720 --> 10:28.760]  the actual insert that comes with the vaccines and it says may cause Guillain-Barre's
[10:28.760 --> 10:34.200]  or other neurological disorders may sterilize you may hurt your fertility
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.840]  may give you autoimmune disorders and it lists hundreds of them so this is very
[10:39.840 --> 10:48.520]  insulting to anyone's intelligence who runs the mainstream media blockade and
[10:48.520 --> 10:55.120]  by running the blockade you've got local Fox and local CBS and local NBC and local
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.320]  ABC news all reporting the same thing they go talk to the FDA the FDA says
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.560]  yes the vaccines can hurt you or kill you but then the national branches of
[11:07.560 --> 11:16.480]  Fox and CNN and all these other outfits CNN has local affiliates around the
[11:16.480 --> 11:21.840]  country as well like News 8 in Austin there's a big separation one group is
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.560]  lying ball-faced saying there's no mercury saying it can't give you Guillain-Barre's
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.120]  when if you go to the local drugstore and ask not for the fact sheet they give
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.400]  you that's a lie but if you ask for the actual insert that came with the with
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.880]  the bottle with the container it will say everything I'm telling you and then
[11:40.880 --> 11:44.080]  you're gonna have to ask yourself a question even if you're for being
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.000]  vaccinated and trust the government and trust big pharma and trust the mainstream
[11:48.000 --> 11:56.600]  media why are they lying to you and telling you that none of this is in the
[11:56.600 --> 12:03.280]  vaccine and why are they lying and saying there's no bad reactions when
[12:03.280 --> 12:09.600]  there are and why are they calling it a conspiracy theory I mean I was driving
[12:09.600 --> 12:15.360]  in to broadcast today I was listening to a syndicated show that's on locally on
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.520]  a talkstation and it was a medical doctor and he was on there laughing saying
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.120]  the conspiracy theorists say that this stuff can hurt you and don't take it
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.360]  and I and I'm glad they're not taking the vaccines because they're stupid and
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.960]  now they're going to die and so their bad genes won't be passed on in the gene
[12:31.960 --> 12:39.040]  pool and that's twofold deceptive he's implying you're all gonna die if you
[12:39.040 --> 12:46.040]  don't take the flu vaccine seasonal or H1N1 when statistically you know there's
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.040]  30 there's 300 million people in this country and 36,000 die every year from
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.120]  the regular flu the CDC states and that's that's hyped as well most doctors
[12:55.120 --> 13:02.840]  say it's about 15,000 and this new H1N1 killing about 10% statistically this
[13:02.840 --> 13:06.240]  far into the flu season that the regular seasonal does what's a very weak flu
[13:06.240 --> 13:11.320]  why is there all this hype surrounding it why do they want you to take it so so
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.240]  he there's deception first by implying you're gonna die if you don't take the
[13:15.240 --> 13:19.920]  flu vaccines and then there's also deception in implying you're stupid and
[13:19.920 --> 13:24.040]  and that you won't pass on your genes to the gene pool and that you basically
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.440]  deserve to die if you don't take the shot when Reuters did a poll a study
[13:30.440 --> 13:36.200]  earlier in the week stating that more educated you are the less likely you are
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.520]  to take the flu shot in fact that was in my stack will you guys find that and
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.240]  print it again it's actually Burma's found that it was Reuters he's here we
[13:43.240 --> 13:47.720]  can maybe I cleaned my desk off from earlier in the week and forgot to dig it
[13:47.720 --> 13:53.800]  out the problem is I've got too much information too much evidence so all I'm
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.400]  doing is watching local newscast all over the country and in England where
[13:59.400 --> 14:06.240]  people are dying or getting debilitating disorders paralyzed convulsions
[14:06.240 --> 14:11.880]  cheerleaders doctors lawyers young girls are dying all over the place from
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.400]  the Gardasil shop that's finally on the national news I've been talking about
[14:15.400 --> 14:20.320]  that for three years and finally they admit every few days I see national TV
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.040]  reports I heard NPR report oh yes people are dying from it but it's a very small
[14:25.040 --> 14:32.200]  number and it's worth it so go ahead and take it but on all the other issues with
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.680]  the vaccines there they're lying about it the the national news is lying and the
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.600]  government is paying to have fact sheets handed out to people that are lies there
[14:43.600 --> 14:50.360]  is mercury in all of the flu shots that's in the insert and I just don't get
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.600]  I mean I know the media spins and lies but this level of lying so you have local
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.920]  news that's telling the truth generally and then you have national media that's
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.680]  lying and again this is not our opinion it's not local news thinks people are
[15:04.680 --> 15:10.360]  getting paralyzed or having convulsions from the vaccines the FDA is on TV
[15:10.360 --> 15:16.400]  admitting it but saying still the benefits outweigh the dangers even if
[15:16.400 --> 15:20.000]  you believe that lie because we have the internal CDC documents saying I wouldn't
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.480]  give it to my kids yeah we've damaged millions of people yeah it caused the
[15:23.480 --> 15:32.680]  autism that came out in 2002 ABC news but it's just so incredible then there's a
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.720]  whole nother facet to this we have news reports all over the country and I'm
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.720]  gonna cover some of these where the schools are forcibly injecting the kids
[15:40.720 --> 15:45.720]  with the flu shots even when the parents say no and the schools are getting caught
[15:45.720 --> 15:51.560]  so we're gonna cover that when we get back and then an incredible McClatchy
[15:51.560 --> 15:57.120]  newspaper report on Goldman Sachs secretly bet on the US housing crash
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.560]  stay with us we'll be right back the illusion created by the power elite is

[20:06.720 --> 20:11.040]  broadcasting network network
[20:11.040 --> 20:27.520]  okay I'm gonna continue with the flu and all the different facets to this giant
[20:27.520 --> 20:31.720]  hyped up hoax that the mainstream media and big farmers pushing the Boston
[20:31.720 --> 20:37.960]  Globe reports that in a two-week period the flu vaccine makers the five big
[20:37.960 --> 20:42.520]  companies have had a seven billion dollar windfall and they've spent hundreds
[20:42.520 --> 20:47.160]  of millions of dollars paying for all sorts of TV ads and public relations
[20:47.160 --> 20:52.320]  hype to scare the population we're gonna get into that then a report how
[20:52.320 --> 20:59.640]  Goldman Sachs secretly bet on the US housing crash this individual Greg
[20:59.640 --> 21:04.640]  Gordon with McClatchy newspapers deserves a Pulitzer Prize for what
[21:04.640 --> 21:09.240]  they've done we're gonna get him on in the next week just a stunning article
[21:09.240 --> 21:13.360]  how they basically engineered the whole thing and this confirms what the
[21:13.360 --> 21:18.600]  different experts that we interviewed for fall the republic stated that Goldman
[21:18.600 --> 21:24.640]  Sachs is the center of the spiders web and didn't just lie about the housing
[21:24.640 --> 21:28.960]  market and and set people up but we're actually involved in engineering it as
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.480]  this report states to bring down their competition because all the major
[21:34.480 --> 21:40.240]  regulators in the Federal Reserve and in the Treasury Department all of them
[21:40.240 --> 21:48.760]  were former heads or top executives of Goldman Sachs so they went and took over
[21:48.760 --> 21:52.000]  their competition like Bear Stearns and others we're gonna be covering that next
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.720]  hour also next hour
[21:56.440 --> 22:02.720]  national media especially big think tank run media owned by George Soros and the
[22:02.720 --> 22:08.360]  Democratic Party has really been coming after me with nasty attacks and I've
[22:08.360 --> 22:13.000]  talked to several high-level media sources one of them contacted me I wanted
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.960]  to check into it so I contacted one of my sources and obviously I'm not gonna
[22:16.960 --> 22:21.600]  give you my sources journalism 101 is you burn your sources you don't get
[22:21.600 --> 22:25.520]  sources anymore that's how we're able to break so many major stories here but
[22:25.520 --> 22:31.280]  this news deals with Alex Jones yours truly this talk show host specifically
[22:31.280 --> 22:36.760]  and the fact that I am on the White House enemies list and they are coming
[22:36.760 --> 22:52.400]  after me and I'm not scared I'm not shooken up but I am concerned and it
[22:52.400 --> 22:58.440]  has a weight of focusing me and and really making me count the cost and
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.240]  think about why I'm on the air why I have the two biggest alternative news
[23:02.240 --> 23:12.840]  sites info wars.com prisonplanet.com and it is it is a great responsibility and
[23:12.840 --> 23:23.000]  it's exhilarating but also bizarre to be listed now by the mainstream media as
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.280]  the most dangerous alternative media outlet in the world Jason Burmese was
[23:28.280 --> 23:35.280]  up here working on his film yesterday invisible empire we produce films in
[23:35.280 --> 23:39.480]  this office and he walked into the coffee room and we have C-span on in
[23:39.480 --> 23:42.640]  there we have TVs on all over the building different news so we can catch
[23:42.640 --> 23:48.320]  it and it was a big journalism conference we have these video clips I'll
[23:48.320 --> 23:55.360]  probably play them on tomorrow's radio show I may even play some next hour but
[23:55.360 --> 24:00.640]  the point is they open the conference this was Washington Post reporters new
[24:00.640 --> 24:07.880]  Republic reporters talking about how important I am how big I am how I have
[24:07.880 --> 24:13.920]  an international following and how I'm basically a threat to the establishment
[24:13.920 --> 24:19.560]  and I'll be honest with you I never intended when I set out 14 years ago on
[24:19.560 --> 24:26.080]  local access TV and then 13 years ago on local radio and then syndicated 12
[24:26.080 --> 24:33.840]  years ago limited syndication smaller show to to to turn into what it has
[24:33.840 --> 24:40.640]  become today and I'm just having to assess what I've gotten myself into I
[24:40.640 --> 24:43.800]  mean I'm glad I've gotten myself into this because I want to stand up against
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.960]  corruption and lies but I never thought that I would have to be the man for the
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.840]  job I never wanted to be the leader I never wanted to reach me to read major
[24:53.840 --> 24:59.080]  newspapers reporting that I am surveilled by the US Army I mean I'm a guy
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.480]  who carries the trash out in the morning and books my children breakfast with my
[25:03.480 --> 25:10.040]  wife and who just tries to tell the truth and the truth I'm telling is so
[25:10.040 --> 25:14.840]  dangerous to the establishment ladies and gentlemen that I do get death threats
[25:14.840 --> 25:23.120]  a lot of dirty tricks are carried out against us and the heat is intensifying
[25:23.120 --> 25:26.720]  to a level I'd ever before seen I don't spend a lot of time on the broadcast
[25:26.720 --> 25:34.680]  talking about this but I'm being forced to more and more discuss it just so the
[25:34.680 --> 25:39.000]  fact that we can defend ourselves and so listeners and readers of our news
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.200]  websites and and viewers of my films will understand what we're facing and
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.880]  support us and redouble your efforts in supporting us and redouble your efforts
[25:48.880 --> 25:54.160]  spreading the word about this radio show and the films and the websites because
[25:54.160 --> 26:00.960]  we're doing something right we're doing something right and that's why we have
[26:00.960 --> 26:08.600]  the establishment coming after this and we're making history here so I'm going
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.560]  to talk about that in the last 20 30 minutes of the radio show today I need
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.400]  to get going though with all the flu news and the adverse reactions and the
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.960]  illnesses and the deaths being reported all over Europe by mainstream media and
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.680]  the national news blackout here in this country there's a national news blackout
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.160]  it's all over local news here inside the United States and I want to give you
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.480]  some of those sources and also talk about how public schools are forcibly
[26:35.480 --> 26:41.520]  inoculating children from Kentucky to New York even when the parents say you
[26:41.520 --> 26:47.240]  were not allowed to not to inoculate my child and this is even shocking yours
[26:47.240 --> 26:51.480]  truly I mean it's it's one thing to read government documents and know they're
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.560]  setting up world government and that we have a tyrannical scientific
[26:55.560 --> 26:59.960]  dictatorship forming it's another thing to be inside the New World Order now
[26:59.960 --> 27:07.360]  and to have Ban Ki-moon the head of the UN secretary general write an editorial
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.560]  that was published in hundreds of papers last Sunday and Monday admitting that
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.440]  world government is here using the term world government admitting the carbon
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.080]  taxes is meant to destroy our industrial capacity and to take over our lives I
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.480]  mean it's one thing to do the research and to intellectually know this it's
[27:25.480 --> 27:32.800]  another thing to see it actually unfolding and then to know that good
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.840]  things are happening people are starting to wake up but are they waking up too
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.960]  late and then to realize if I am the biggest threat to the New World Order
[27:41.960 --> 27:47.440]  along with my audience it's the audience the real threat that is a sad state of
[27:47.440 --> 27:55.400]  affairs and it's also something I never bargained for and there's no turning
[27:55.400 --> 28:05.480]  back I mean I wouldn't have done anything different it's just it's so big it's
[28:05.480 --> 28:10.720]  it's so incredible and I just pray that God gives me the strength and the courage
[28:10.720 --> 28:26.880]  to do what has to be done and I'm I I'm just now really admitting to myself just
[28:26.880 --> 28:34.680]  how important we are and the responsibility is hitting home I want to
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.480]  add a program note we have a new affiliate we've been on 590 a.m. the

[34:11.160 --> 34:15.280]  some banking news and then as I said in the last two segments in the last half
[34:15.280 --> 34:22.080]  hour tonight I'm gonna talk about this radio show my little media operation
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.720]  it's turned into alternative media empire that's how the establishment builds
[34:27.720 --> 34:33.000]  it in all their publications now the fact that we're gonna try to step up our
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.680]  game because of the responsibility we have I have been kind of psychologically
[34:38.680 --> 34:47.080]  in denial for several years about how big we really are and for people that
[34:47.080 --> 34:53.360]  haven't ever experienced this it's it's it's quite a wait and to know that the
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.560]  mainstream media is publicly saying I must be destroyed and demonized and
[34:58.560 --> 35:06.560]  lied about is shocking and I bought a movie because I'll a lot of times watch
[35:06.560 --> 35:14.560]  news when I'm on the treadmill but more often than not I'll buy DVDs blockbuster
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.760]  or a Best Buy or wherever and I'll watch them while I'm jogging and I watched a
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.360]  film I saw nine ten years ago when it came out I saw in the theater with
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.280]  Russell Crowe and Al Pacino and I watched it in the last two days while I was
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.920]  jogging on the treadmill and it was called the insider and I was watching
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.880]  that movie that's based on a true story dealing with the tobacco companies and
[35:39.880 --> 35:45.560]  it really hit me that in the movie the wife divorces him and they're crying
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.640]  when they're getting death threats and they're crying when that they send the
[35:49.640 --> 35:56.200]  FBI to try to set him up and it you know he barely makes it with the stress and
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.280]  he's this big hero he goes through all this and it's a true story and then they
[36:01.280 --> 36:04.760]  won't let CBS News air the piece about how they know the cigarettes are
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.440]  poisonous and addicting and they put additives in to make it more addictive
[36:08.440 --> 36:12.600]  than crack and they've all you know this is all come out in court now and the
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.840]  tobacco companies lost and it's now part of the public record but before this in
[36:16.840 --> 36:22.000]  the early 1990s and mid 1990s it was a conspiracy theory to say that cigarettes
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.600]  could kill you or that cigarettes were addictive and that additives were put in
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.760]  them to make them more addictive and I just thought about on so many levels
[36:36.760 --> 36:42.400]  watching that movie it did really wake me up I don't want to say shook me up
[36:42.400 --> 36:48.760]  but well I guess it did kind of shake me up because I thought well in this
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.360]  movie they they send them death threat emails they have people in their yard at
[36:52.360 --> 36:59.200]  night they put bullets in their mailbox they make him lose his job and I thought
[36:59.200 --> 37:05.080]  I've gone through no exaggeration probably 20 times what this guy went
[37:05.080 --> 37:10.560]  through and my wife is so great that even though we have three children she
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.200]  just says we're gonna fight them that much harder and when I met my wife she
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.520]  wasn't even into this stuff she didn't even really believe in all and then over
[37:19.520 --> 37:25.880]  the time she found out it was real and and you know I didn't go out and meet a
[37:25.880 --> 37:29.480]  woman who I liked it was my girlfriend who had to agree with me I've been with
[37:29.480 --> 37:34.120]  her now for 11 years and it just really hit home how much my wife has put up
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.000]  with dead animals put on our front porch people calling up saying I see your
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.160]  little dog in the backyard and she looks out and there's the little dog oh your
[37:43.160 --> 37:46.480]  little dog's getting a drink of water I can't wait to kill your dog and you know
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.480]  rape and kill you and and they're there at your house and and and to have the
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.840]  army watching us and to to have been physically attacked before and told to
[37:56.840 --> 38:02.920]  shut up with four guys pounding on me and to have all the other harassment that
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.880]  goes on and the COINTELPRO and and the ways they try to set me up and and the
[38:08.880 --> 38:14.120]  lies and to watch in the movie which is based on true story how they created
[38:14.120 --> 38:19.000]  this fake dossier on him of all these lies and things he didn't do or things
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.160]  they took and twisted and I just realized it's admitted I'm on the
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.800]  White House enemies list they openly announced that they're coming after me
[38:28.800 --> 38:34.760]  on television and in newspapers and I just sit here and take it like it's no
[38:34.760 --> 38:44.480]  big deal and my wife sits here and takes it like it's no big deal and it's just
[38:44.480 --> 38:54.360]  crazy it it's crazy and I realized that I've never tried to be a macho person or
[38:54.360 --> 38:59.240]  a tough guy but my whole life I really have been macho and a tough guy and it's
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.320]  a good thing I've got a wife and a family that are strong people as well but I
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.960]  guess we all are Texans and you know I'm proud of my roots and my ancestors and
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.800]  we're not cowards and we're not gonna run and we're in the right and what we're
[39:11.800 --> 39:16.320]  doing is important and look how many people I have reached over the years
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.880]  going past the threats and the attacks and all of it alright I said I'd cover
[39:22.880 --> 39:26.360]  this at the end of the show and I do have a lot of news I want to get to and I
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.240]  am going to take some calls today but specifically on the flu okay we don't
[39:31.240 --> 39:34.000]  normally screen your calls but occasionally I only want callers on
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.520]  certain subjects we can talk about Goldman Sachs and it coming out in
[39:37.520 --> 39:40.800]  a clatchy newspapers they got the documents the Goldman Sachs knew the
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.080]  whole time what was going to happen with the housing bubble did it on purpose
[39:44.080 --> 39:47.600]  controlling federal regulators to use it to be able to shut down their
[39:47.600 --> 39:54.840]  competition and make tens of billions of dollars you know those are the
[39:54.840 --> 39:57.880]  subjects that I want to discuss here and then I want to hear from you are
[39:57.880 --> 40:01.040]  they trying to force your children to take it are they trying to force you to
[40:01.040 --> 40:05.080]  take the shot at work do you know someone who's been paralyzed from it
[40:05.080 --> 40:14.600]  specifically that's what I want to hear from you on 888-201-2244-888-201-2244
[40:14.600 --> 40:20.160]  and if you're listening locally in central Texas you can also call us on
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.600]  512-646-1776 okay recapping what I covered at the start of the radio
[40:26.600 --> 40:29.080]  broadcast
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.720]  national TV and the public schools are are are reporting and handing out
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.600]  flyers that say there's no mercury in the shots it can't cause neurological
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.560]  disorders it can't cause autoimmune disorders and it can't sterilize you or
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.760]  hurt your fertility when the inserts on all five of the H1N1 vaccines state it
[40:48.760 --> 40:55.680]  can do all of those things but then meanwhile we have local CBS ABC Fox you
[40:55.680 --> 40:59.680]  name it all over the country we have these linked up on infowars.com and
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.120]  prisonplanet.com reporting that this is happening and that people are getting
[41:03.120 --> 41:08.040]  hurt and the FDA is on the local TV shows admitting that these are side effects
[41:08.040 --> 41:15.080]  so to me I don't know about you this is a big news story that I mean that's all I
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.680]  do here is I point out absurdity here's all these local newscast and doctors and
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.520]  people reporting this and then the national news is saying it doesn't
[41:23.520 --> 41:28.440]  exist and it's a conspiracy theory and if I'm a radical and a bad guy for
[41:28.440 --> 41:34.560]  pointing this out then then so be it I just think I'm normal and I mentioned at
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.440]  the start of the show Reuters reports in U.S. less education means more H1N1
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.440]  concern and it goes on to say that they talked to three thousand and three U.S.
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.840]  adults and people with higher education and higher incomes are not taking the
[41:48.840 --> 41:53.160]  flu vaccine but they spun it to just say they're not concerned about it no
[41:53.160 --> 41:58.320]  they're educated they read the insert not the propaganda on the news and so they
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.720]  don't take it and I mean don't believe me about this just go to a search engine
[42:04.720 --> 42:10.080]  for yourself and type in man paralyzed at her flu shot woman paralyzed girl dies
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.640]  I mean I've got the headlines all right here look at this Belfast telegraph I
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.560]  mean this is out of Ireland boy rushed a hospital at her swine flu jab and he
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.880]  was given the shot and they admit he's had a bad reaction is paralyzed from it
[42:23.880 --> 42:30.360]  here's New York Daily News public school nurses give swine flu vaccine to kids
[42:30.360 --> 42:36.320]  without parents okay since child the hospital and then it just list all these
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.120]  New York schools giving shots to children even when the parents say no and
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.080]  then every time they get caught they say oh we screwed up same story in

[47:11.680 --> 47:15.800]  swine flu shot effort might come up short with only 140 million doses ready
[47:15.800 --> 47:20.240]  by October so the fed say health workers and pregnant women will be at the top
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.200]  of the vaccination list but come a far as Brian Johnson says a local couple has
[47:24.200 --> 47:30.040]  a warning doctor said Jerry Evans got a tetanus and a pneumonia shot in June now
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.160]  he's in a wheelchair his legs paralyzed his arms weak the shots caused Guillain
[47:35.160 --> 47:40.280]  Beret syndrome I could be over this and six to eight months I may have flocking

[47:59.440 --> 48:04.640]  syndrome the Emmons worry about plans for a massive swine flu vaccination
[48:04.640 --> 48:12.080]  program okay ladies and gentlemen that is one minute of one of more than 30 local
[48:12.080 --> 48:16.640]  newscasts from around the country saying the same thing now that was one from
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.800]  just the regular shot the regular seasonal we are now getting newscast
[48:22.800 --> 48:26.360]  and we'll play some later if we have time clips of them where they're
[48:26.360 --> 48:30.200]  admitting this is happening and saying yes it can do this and yes it did do
[48:30.200 --> 48:37.480]  this the clip you just heard was from KOMO channel 4 and if you will just go
[48:37.480 --> 48:44.320]  to YouTube and type in man paralyzed woman paralyzed cheerleader paralyzed
[48:44.320 --> 48:51.640]  girl dies after shot you can read where they are admitting it you can watch the
[48:51.640 --> 48:56.840]  videos you can go follow the links to the TV station and you can spend hours
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.760]  and hours watching these and then you can turn on national news and hear them
[49:00.760 --> 49:06.640]  say none of this is true and none of this is happening now a whole nother
[49:06.640 --> 49:15.760]  issue is that Kentucky California Texas Massachusetts New York scores of
[49:15.760 --> 49:21.360]  newscast I mean I'm now seeing them without looking five or six times a day
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.720]  reporting that the schools are lining the kids up even when the parents say no
[49:25.720 --> 49:32.560]  and giving them the shots when there's no law they can do that this is what the
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.800]  government did 70 years ago sterilizing over half a million people they would
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.560]  just come get your kids and sterilize them under the eugenics act the government
[49:42.560 --> 49:48.320]  is out of control and I look at this report out of the New York Daily News
[49:48.320 --> 49:57.120]  this is just one of scores and this one article headline public school nurses
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.760]  give swine flu vaccine to kids without parents okay sins child to hospital and
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.600]  then it just list the children and list the schools and the schools say oh we
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.400]  just made a mistake even when the parents tell them don't do it in another
[50:11.400 --> 50:17.000]  case in Kentucky this little boy was given the flu vaccination and the
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.960]  medical doctor had told him since his son was already sick with other
[50:19.960 --> 50:24.200]  illnesses and that's on the insert that he was not to be given it because he had
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.400]  asthma and can cause an autoimmune response an inflammatory response and
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.640]  can kill him and they still did it they still did it to his son and we're only
[50:34.640 --> 50:37.960]  finding out about the cases where they go to the hospital they give them the
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.720]  shot or they give them the nasal vaccine and they go into convulsions or they
[50:41.720 --> 50:46.040]  start having asthma attacks and we only hear about the cases where they go to
[50:46.040 --> 50:52.520]  the hospital now in the last two months we got scores of phone calls on air and
[50:52.520 --> 50:56.120]  many of you listening heard them where people would name the school name the
[50:56.120 --> 51:00.160]  school district where their child would come home and say I was given the
[51:00.160 --> 51:04.280]  seasonal flu shot they would call the school the school would lie about it and
[51:04.280 --> 51:08.640]  then later it came out they had now that's in the news that the schools are
[51:08.640 --> 51:13.560]  lying at first saying we didn't give your son or daughter of the shot so
[51:13.560 --> 51:17.720]  there's a several issues here not just the efficacy and the safety of these
[51:17.720 --> 51:24.640]  vaccines but more importantly why are they lying about it I mean even if you
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.160]  believe in all of this why are they lying why is this a good thing and I have
[51:29.160 --> 51:33.360]  articles out of the US and England here's one England's chief medical officer
[51:33.360 --> 51:38.960]  calls H1N1 vaccine resisters extremist for putting up posters around England
[51:38.960 --> 51:42.680]  saying the shot could be dangerous times of London reports but a separate
[51:42.680 --> 51:48.080]  British news reports half of doctors are refusing to take swine flu shot
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.720]  themselves and a majority of German doctors are refusing and it's now come
[51:52.720 --> 51:56.240]  out even in Time Magazine we first reported this a month ago it's now in
[51:56.240 --> 52:02.800]  Time Magazine the current issue you can read it online the headline is a better
[52:02.800 --> 52:08.760]  flu shot and then you read how in Europe the military and the government
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.840]  officials are given flu shots without the squalene without the mercury without
[52:12.840 --> 52:17.440]  the aluminum without the ender look into without all the adjuvants that
[52:17.440 --> 52:25.240]  accelerate the autoimmune response and kill people that's what's causing the
[52:25.240 --> 52:29.920]  hemorrhagic type fever in the lungs the autoimmune response that's how they're
[52:29.920 --> 52:33.880]  filling in an hour and killing you and then they admit in these reports that
[52:33.880 --> 52:38.960]  the first shots that were given weren't shots at all they were nasal remember
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.960]  the first vaccine that went out a month ago was nasal live virus and they
[52:42.960 --> 52:47.320]  admit on the insert that it can breed the virus it can mutate in your sinus
[52:47.320 --> 52:51.240]  cavity and then that spreads it so the drug companies first put out an
[52:51.240 --> 52:58.720]  inoculation that spreads it I mean this is so huge ladies and gentlemen Ron Paul
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.760]  we have a video Congressman Ron Paul you're looking at the number one
[53:02.760 --> 53:07.640]  Republican contender in 2012 by the way Ron Paul questions why Obama daughters
[53:07.640 --> 53:11.800]  haven't taken the swine flu shot he first questioned this two weeks ago they
[53:11.800 --> 53:18.640]  still haven't here's that time magazine article in Germany a better vaccine for
[53:18.640 --> 53:22.840]  politicians back zoom in on that with the document cam for prison planet TV
[53:22.840 --> 53:30.200]  viewers that's time magazine Germany a better vaccine for politicians and then
[53:30.200 --> 53:36.240]  it admits it I mean here's another one out of Sweden deaths in Sweden is the
[53:36.240 --> 53:40.760]  headline from the flu vaccine deaths I've got the one in Telegraph saying the
[53:40.760 --> 53:49.960]  same thing I mean this is just amazing and then meanwhile I'm being demonized
[53:49.960 --> 53:56.280]  by Salon every two or three days the big government organ I've been demonized
[53:56.280 --> 54:00.440]  by the new Republic I'm being demonized the White House Lamar
[54:00.440 --> 54:04.480]  Alexander is now given a speech confirming that people are on a White
[54:04.480 --> 54:08.560]  House enemies list it's been in other newspapers and then I talked to a high
[54:08.560 --> 54:13.440]  level reporter two days ago who told me who called me and said you better watch
[54:13.440 --> 54:19.560]  it we've seen documents that were not able to publish at this time that you
[54:19.560 --> 54:25.680]  are near the top of the list and that you are targeted for destruction whatever
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.600]  that means well we know what that means they're lying about me they're
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.360]  demonizing me they're doing co- and tell pro operations to have alternative
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.120]  media who are paid for by the government attack me and lie about me and I'm
[54:38.120 --> 54:42.400]  gonna talk about this next hour but I mean the point here is is that I then
[54:42.400 --> 54:47.480]  called another high-powered reporter I know and they said yes that's that's
[54:47.480 --> 54:54.240]  that's going on look all I'm doing is I bring all the news together and show
[54:54.240 --> 54:58.640]  people the inconsistencies in the lies and for some reason no one else seems to
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.200]  be doing that so this radio show is so if I mean we are reaching over 2 million
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.080]  people a week on the radio over 2 million of people a week separately with
[55:07.080 --> 55:12.360]  individual unique visitors to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it's
[55:12.360 --> 55:15.720]  growing that's what scares the establishment you go to the Alexa.com
[55:15.720 --> 55:19.800]  ratings all the other rating services our numbers are going parabolic straight
[55:19.800 --> 55:27.600]  up and this isn't an ego trip it's actually freaking me out but it's freaking
[55:27.600 --> 55:33.400]  me out on so many levels why am I bad why am I so evil I'm not evil I'm telling
[55:33.400 --> 55:38.120]  the truth and the establishment is scared and that shows their week it shows
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.440]  they're not invincible and that's the exciting thing about this and I I've
[55:42.440 --> 55:45.760]  undoubtedly paid a great price and will pay an even greater one in the future and
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.800]  I'm glad for what I've done I just I'm proud of my work but I do want to tell
[55:50.800 --> 55:53.960]  listeners and supporters we need your support now more than ever and if I'm
[55:53.960 --> 55:57.720]  gonna get burned by these people I might as well get burned for really really

[56:19.880 --> 56:24.200]  everything the economists and experts we interview and the Obama deception and
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.800]  fall the republic say that's why we're so dangerous was because we were telling

[56:35.120 --> 56:40.160]  done thousands and thousands of radio interviews TV interviews it was funny to
[56:40.160 --> 56:43.880]  make fun of Alex Jones in the past and the establishment used me as like a
[56:43.880 --> 56:50.560]  clown to try to discredit people but it backfired on them because now my films

[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:35.800]  news dealing with the dollar right now let's go to Rodney in Virginia Rodney
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:41.520]  you're on the air welcome Jones like like you said it's Rodney in Virginia I
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:48.720]  got a comment about the swine flu the swine flu vaccine my wife is 20 weeks
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:53.760]  pregnant and we went to her OB appointment last week and they were
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:59.400]  pushing the swine flu vaccine on her and I asked the nurse that told her
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.880]  about the swine flu that she needed to get swine flu vaccine well what about
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:06.320]  the mercury in it let me just say last weekend was the first time I ever
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:09.600]  listened to your show when you mentioned the mercury and I'm not the type of
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.560]  person that will just automatically believe everything I hear so I
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:18.720]  actually went and looked at the insert and and looked at the information and
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:22.600]  got the information firsthand for myself and I asked her you know she my wife's
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:26.200]  not allowed to eat the fish that's harvested from the local waters here
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:29.880]  because of the high mercury content and because of the damage you can cause to
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:36.160]  the baby and yet they're pushing the vaccine that is you've gone and gone
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:39.960]  and caused brain damage to my unborn child and I asked the nurse about it and
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:44.000]  they're not even educating the medical professional she had never
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:48.360]  even heard about the mercury content well up until six months ago all the
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:52.320]  inserts and they still say don't give it to pregnant women but the media is
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.000]  saying give it to pregnant women now and did you not see where it said mercury on
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.880]  the insert yes I did that's that's the reason why I mean I went to the
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.080]  pharmacy where they're doing those the the vaccine that mask and I see the
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.480]  information on the on what information do you have on this I want to know for I
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:15.840]  want to read with my own eyes from the information you have that this is safe
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:19.200]  for me to give to my wife because everything she takes affects my child
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:26.560]  you know and like I said I've never in I'm not the type of person I'm I'm not
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:30.280]  one of those highly educated people you were talking about earlier I swing a
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:36.880]  hammer for 11 carpenters bill America as far as I'm concerned but but you know
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:44.200]  we have a responsibility to to question everything we're told especially when it
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.840]  comes to the house because they're lying to you about that what else are they
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:52.480]  lying about well good job Rodney we are getting reports of miscarriages after
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:57.680]  people take the shots in the vaccine so it's your decision but folks you better
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:02.360]  think twice let's go ahead and talk to Tracy in Illinois Tracy go ahead
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:08.880]  hey done Alex good I want to just let you know I received a notice in the mail
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:13.560]  from the state of Illinois where the national medical support notice even
[1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:17.000]  though this hasn't passed yet but I've been informed that when medical
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.080]  insurance coverage is ordered through employment the national medical support
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:25.680]  notice is sent to the employer or union to enforce requirement to enroll the
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:30.960]  employees dependents in a health care plan just to be clear just to be clear
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.000]  what you're saying and I'd read this in the news people are already getting
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.800]  letters saying it's the law you've got to have insurance even though the health
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:43.600]  care bill hasn't passed kind of like they admitted the NSA was spying on
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:48.920]  Americans without warrants for decades before Congress passed the law saying they
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:52.480]  could do it and so they haven't even passed the law yet but they're sending
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:58.640]  you a notice yes that is correct I mean I think it's a crock that you know
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:02.320]  Congress is up there debating this and they're already sending out the paperwork
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:06.280]  saying this is gonna be the way it is and you know you do me a favor will you
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:11.680]  scan that in and email it to Aaron with two days at infowars.com and and

[1:06:53.600 --> 1:07:00.680]  I'm friends with Dale Dudley and he told me that after he got a flu shot about
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:07.680]  six months ago that he got peril he got numb and paralyzed he couldn't move his
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.280]  fingers couldn't hold a pen went to all these specialists and medical doctors

[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:22.840]  brain and it was probably from a vaccine I mean well ladies and gentlemen I know
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:28.400]  people who are being affected by this and there are literally hundreds of
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:33.320]  newscasts I've watched over 30 last night just searching the term on YouTube
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:38.040]  alone where in every case they they say yes doesn't happen to most people and
[1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:42.160]  it's good to still take the shot but it did take this young healthy woman and
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:45.840]  paralyzer or that this woman's having trouble walking or this woman's having
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:54.440]  convulsions and that's all on local ABC CBS NBC Fox they're all reporting it and
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:58.440]  it's not debated and then national news says as a conspiracy theory it's not
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:03.640]  happening when it's on the drug insert it's on the vaccine inserts do not
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:10.160]  believe me I've probably done 50 60 more shows in fact print it again I clean my
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:17.520]  desk off FDA.gov reactions to flu shot and then the actual sheet I'll show it
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:20.360]  later in the show on prisonpundit.tv and for radio listeners I'll give you the
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.040]  actual URL you know because I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna just say but then
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:27.920]  don't believe me when I show you the insert that says it can brain damage you
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:32.000]  give you autoimmune disorders and all of this I want you to go to the local drug
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.600]  store and say I don't want your fact sheet a lot of them will give you a lying
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.040]  sheet with all these lies saying no mercury can't paralyze you can't give
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:44.080]  you autoimmune disorders can't give you cancer doesn't you but then you get the
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:49.800]  insert and it says it all that on there read the fine print and then ask why are
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:57.520]  they lying to you why were they told the lie to you let's go ahead and just play
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:03.240]  a minute or so of one Fox News piece out of DC this is the local Fox affiliate
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:09.160]  in DC here it is right off the top tonight a shocking side effect to a
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:17.840]  routine vaccination you heard her right a regular flu shot gone horribly wrong
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:24.160]  tonight the warning this woman wants everyone to hear good evening everyone
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:28.400]  I'm Brian Bolton and I'm Sean Yancy a few weeks ago Desiree Jennings was training

[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.320]  disabled by a very rare reaction to a seasonal flu shot plenty of coffee has
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.400]  more on this serious side effect the vast majority of doctors say flu shots
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:45.280]  are safe in this case the FDA says they found nothing wrong with this
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:49.680]  particular batch but sometimes there are complications and that's apparently what
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:55.080]  happened to Desiree Jennings and now her life will never be the same here 26 year
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:58.800]  old Desiree Jennings is the picture of health she's a Redskins cheerleader
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:04.020]  ambassador and an avid runner her life changed forever on August the 23rd when
[1:10:04.020 --> 1:10:09.760]  she says she got a seasonal flu shot in a local grocery store I was trained for a
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:16.320]  half marathon okay now ladies and gentlemen when I tell you there are
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:23.360]  hundreds of local newscast in fact let's just do this for everybody on air and
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:29.760]  later I'll play it Google girl dies after Gardasil and because that's it's a
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:34.200]  shot for girls and we could play for the next 10 hours we could play newscast
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:38.600]  back-to-back never playing the same one where people died and they go oh yes it
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.520]  it's a reaction but it's still still good you're dead now or you're paralyzed
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:51.840]  now it's not just the flu shot ladies and gentlemen here it is this is from
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:11:03.720]  this FDA gov and it's got the mercury everything in fact I'll just underline
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:10.320]  the mercury part and it says gillian beret brain damage sterilization miscarriage
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:14.040]  here we'll just zoom in on the mercury part actually have a copy of this it's
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:20.240]  all highlighted but there it is mercury this is from fda.gov I don't know maybe
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:25.720]  I'm a conspiracy theorist okay I'm gonna shut up and take calls just now all over
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.800]  the country they're forcibly injecting children they don't have a law they're
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:32.680]  just doing it and tell them the parents go to hell I just read New York Daily
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:36.240]  News and the kids go to the hospital after the shots you only hear about the
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.800]  ones that fall down having convulsions and the hospitals don't deny they've had
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.480]  a bad reaction they say yeah and you should take the shot see they just throw
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:49.160]  it in your face tracing in Illinois you're on the air then flu fighter who
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:54.240]  says he's in the military Kevin Dave and others go ahead tracing yes I had called
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.160]  in here I received the an Illinois employer handbook and it's a guide to
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:01.960]  Illinois new hire reporting income withholding and the national medical
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:07.000]  support notice processes and which is under the heading national medical
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.240]  support notice when the medical insurance coverage is ordered to employment the
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:17.440]  national medical support notice is sent to the employer or union to enforce the
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:24.240]  requirement to enroll the employees dependent and a health care plan now
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:29.960]  the news did report a week ago believe it was Reuters we can pull it up that the
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.840]  Obama administration has health and human services already ordering the state
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:37.280]  health departments total violation of the 10th the 9th amendment total federal
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:41.280]  takeover we hear the White House saying all the states will decide but that
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.320]  they're already ordering people without the law even passing the 1900 page
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.680]  behemoth that has the death panels in fact I have that here in my stack
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:54.360]  mainstream news that has the public option that has the fines if you don't
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:59.560]  have health care they're lying again already sending it out before it's even
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:06.080]  law ordering you to prepare to be forced to get health insurance that's right I
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:09.400]  mean it's outrageous that they can do this you know this is the United States
[1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:14.200]  of America not the corporate states of America well the issue here I mean
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:18.760]  there's twofold it's a violation of states rights and the White House is lying
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:24.040]  saying the states will decide it's in the bill they won't decide it does have
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:30.440]  rationing and it's just totally un-American to make you get the
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:36.720]  insurance what it is is a tax yeah I believe it's a tax on everybody just
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.520]  like you've been talking you know it's just another tax like the green tax was
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:43.840]  going to be coming you know it's just they won't be satisfied till you're
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:48.640]  completely working for them and every penny you get to go to them and I'll
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:53.200]  show this article again on air it's insurers stand against committee's
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:58.040]  plan Wednesday October 14th I was in an airport two weeks ago and picked this up
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:01.680]  now I already knew the insurance companies wrote the bill and then the
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:06.400]  controlled media says oh the insurance companies are fighting it no this is the
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:10.160]  head spokesman for the health care insurers of America the lobbyist
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:17.840]  spokesman for all 1,300 members and they brag in here we wrote this bill but
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:21.280]  we're gonna fight it if it doesn't have big fines it doesn't force you to have
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:25.600]  coverage so Obama had it added back in the insurance companies wrote this
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:29.360]  stinking thing and the media says they're against it they even the
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:33.720]  headlines deceptive they're threatening to pull out if the bill isn't written the
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:42.400]  way they want with the forced I mean here's the Wall Street Journal but
[1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:46.600]  again the headlines deceptive it has the statements from the health care
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:52.880]  industry from the health care insurer industry well listen send me that notice
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:56.560]  because it's one thing to have Reuters spinning it going oh Obama's already
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:00.480]  telling people they have to get health care or they'll be fine but I want to
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:03.400]  have the actual notice what's the headline on the nose I bet we can find
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:08.360]  it online right now what's the headline on that Illinois version national

[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.720]  did you i mean did you hear us three weeks ago reporting
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:39.080]  the german officials and the military are given a
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:43.160]  quote clean vaccine and now it's in time magazine
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:47.240]  today this just came out actually last night
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:50.760]  i listened to you like i've already heard bases i've written to you more than i
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:54.440]  listen to my wife sometimes don't tell her i said that
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:59.160]  but um i've seen i've seen what you're talking about i kind of
[1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:04.680]  irritates me i try to uh i try to refuse the flu vaccine
[1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:08.360]  uh here that's what i haven't given i'm not giving up my information
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:11.240]  and uh i had to write a letter on why i wanted to so
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:15.000]  i wrote a letter i i printed documents from sorry
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:20.040]  from dr tenpenny backing up my claims i got doubled too bad so sad shut up and
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:24.120]  cut whatever else we can take administrative action against you
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:28.360]  well since i'm not ready to give up my livelihood yet i don't really have a
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:33.000]  fallback plan i decided to go ahead and let and go ahead and take it
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.800]  then when i went to do it i said no i ain't doing this
[1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:39.800]  i'm in a gallery so i've postponed it in the meantime
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:43.080]  i've contracted a phylus infection which this
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:46.520]  earlier in the broadcast area you're talking about how
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:50.840]  uh the first flu vaccination was actually going to make it uh
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.160]  a kind of spread of a virus a phylus infection
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:59.080]  is that what you were saying yes let me let me let you go and comment on this
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:05.560]  i'm not the one saying this the mayo clinic is one place to get it
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:12.840]  it a month ago the first several million dosages doses of
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:19.000]  the live nasal h1n1 flu vaccine they didn't put the injections out first
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.440]  that started a week and a half ago for the first two and a half three weeks it
[1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:25.560]  was nasal and on the box it says live virus
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:29.160]  and on the insert it says may give you the flu
[1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:33.000]  it may breed in the sinus and then spread the flu
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:40.120]  and then i had the dallas county manager the head of the dallas county
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:43.480]  health department on was that monday yeah had him on monday
[1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:47.640]  and he admitted he said yes uh it can spread it and does spread it
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:51.000]  so just because people may not have believed the insert
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.640]  i had a major health department head on from dallas county the head
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:59.160]  on air to say yes but we still think it's a it's good to do
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:07.560]  now the 1918 flu the 1976 flu broke out on military basis after
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:11.560]  inoculations you can also become an incubation chamber
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:15.000]  a petri dish with the injections not just the nasal
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.760]  and so that's why normally you see these huge breakouts on bases
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:22.440]  is because they're they're giving people inoculations and then it's spreading it
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:28.360]  and that's in the inserts but i don't know if that's what happened to you
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.320]  it's just incredible let's take another call here
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:35.240]  let's talk to kevin in michigan kevin you're on the air
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:41.240]  hi alex welcome yeah i've uh watched fall public that was really great um
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:46.280]  i want to go about the this flu stuff it's been blowing out a proportion
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:49.400]  people are just getting costs and stuff and then they
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:53.240]  they've got the swine flu they've closed schools down
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:59.080]  and you know it's only a couple cases and they declared a federal emergency
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:03.320]  under um control level six uh they tried to force
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:07.240]  new york health workers to take it they refused they had to stop that
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:10.520]  so they're just threatening to fire them using color of law
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:13.800]  what do you think of them trying to forcibly not trying
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:17.720]  new york daily news you name it reporting they're forcibly injecting the kids
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:21.800]  against the parent's wishes and some are going to the hospital
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:25.400]  i'm not happy about that at all and i don't want to happen to us and
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.960]  i'm not good enough and my kids aren't either good good to hear from you sir but
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:34.120]  again that's your decision you're making yep uh and and i've made my decision my
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:39.560]  family's not getting it look here's the issue use your brain
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:43.080]  every mainstream news article i've seen and i've read hundreds and i've read them
[1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:46.600]  on air when they talk about deaths here in austin
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:51.000]  it will say in the paper two children have died then it mentions one was on a
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.200]  ventilator the other had holes in their heart
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:58.280]  and and and had been on uh you know in the hospital for all of their six months
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:01.880]  of life almost everyone that's dying from it
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:06.040]  has diabetes has had amputations has had art heart failure
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:10.680]  they're very old or they're very young and they're sick
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.120]  and then i see articles later oh this person didn't really die of a swine
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:17.880]  flu a week later it was a false positive we thought they did
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:21.720]  the regular swine flu and i again i had the head of the
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:25.320]  dallas county health department on just so he would agree with me for listeners
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:28.440]  i already knew all this but i said isn't it true that you're
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:33.000]  having one-fifth as many flu cases of h1n1 as you are the regular seasonal
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:37.080]  flu isn't it true it's very mild and he said yes but it
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:41.160]  still can kill some people but i said wait a minute well the regular flu can
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:44.360]  kill you and then we have all these medical
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:47.720]  doctors on who say get lots of sunshine vitamin a
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:54.040]  vitamin d vitamin c lots of sleep wash your hands
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:58.440]  oh oh google this people won't believe it the government of canada
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:03.720]  toronto star the mail also the associated press
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:08.440]  you have searched the term you have twice the chance
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:12.200]  taking regular seasonal flu shot doubles chances of h1n1
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:15.960]  that was the headline in one of the papers taking
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:20.440]  the regular seasonal shot that everybody ran out scared and got in the last six
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:25.480]  months of fear mongering since april five and a half months whatever it is
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:29.720]  it doubled your chances of getting the regular flu which is what
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:34.440]  dr horowitz and dr blalock and dr sherry tenpenny
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:39.640]  and all the other doctors said in april in may in june in july in august
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:45.480]  in september they all already had the cdc documents they already knew that
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:49.800]  and finally top canadian doctors that were moral in the government
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:56.680]  there it is canadian study links swine flu shots swine flu raises concern
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:02.120]  abroad prompt changes at home okay that's news radio 620
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:08.200]  doing a blurb it's toronto star the daily mail
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:12.360]  i mean that's a good one but i want them to see the headline
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:15.480]  i want people just go to google i want people to see the headline
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:24.760]  headline regular seasonal flu shot doubles chances of contracting h1n1
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:27.560]  doubles
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:31.480]  doubles but you can read the fine print that article in fact that that radio
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:35.960]  station article probably has a link to one of the mainstream ones
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:39.720]  anyways see i mean that's the point i could just go on and on and on and on
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:43.720]  and on and on and on the canadian government said don't take the regular
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:47.880]  flu shot because of this and then you tune into local radio or
[1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:51.240]  national radio or tv they're saying it's all a conspiracy theory

[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:42.360]  and he's five years old he beat it in two days
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:49.480]  okay and just a couple weeks ago his son sends home a form letter saying that
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.920]  they're going to work with the health department to
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:56.280]  do two rounds of swine flu vaccinations
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:00.040]  and uh we've got them on the exemption form from the school
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:04.760]  and it's just unbelievable the links that these people are going to to
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:08.280]  what do you think of the reports new york daily news and others
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:11.640]  that they're injecting children even when the parents say no
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:15.400]  and then saying oops oops it was an accident when it's
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:19.320]  clearly on an accident and the schools have been caught lying
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:22.760]  and saying they didn't inject them until it gets proven
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:26.840]  alex it scares me to death i mean we we put that we put them on an exemption
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:30.920]  form for a reason and i'm deliberating whether to keep them
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:34.120]  home while they're doing those things but i will make it well the problem is
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:37.480]  that the the the nasal vaccine they've been doing
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.160]  is what's spreading it and they admit that what's your son's name
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:45.480]  his name is connor kennel and i mean do you want to put him on air for a second
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:49.720]  yeah connor do you want to say hi to alex real quick
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:53.720]  okay well he's he's kind of chickening out now but he's a big fan he's been
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.200]  listening to the program um just to verify what you said earlier
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:02.920]  about uh the uh vaccination the flu vaccination

[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:13.080]  very uh she's very uneasy about the swine flu scare but
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:16.520]  i looked at the document when they said when parents asked the school
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:18.920]  nurse questions and she's getting a lot of them
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:23.160]  she's supposed to say well you're the only one that has complained

[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:54.200]  write the myths paper handout pamphlet and

[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.520]  health issues that make this vaccination potentially dangerous
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:38.440]  sarah roberts talked with the upset father and school officials for tonight's
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:41.880]  top story school officials say that it was
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:47.240]  a mix-up a case of mistaken identity okay seven-year-old student to receive
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:52.680]  that is one of countless tv reports you can watch on youtube
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:56.040]  i mean i'm not even looking for these and they're just everywhere
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:48:00.840]  as they forcibly inoculate people and headline public school nurses give
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.400]  swine flu vaccine to kids without parents okay
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:07.800]  since child to hospital and they just list case after case in new york city of
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:10.920]  this this is your lawless criminal government
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:14.760]  that's taking over society through the schools that's in the federal documents
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:18.440]  they've been federalized they're training them to do whatever they want
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.480]  whenever they want that they own your children
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:25.400]  now briefly going back to george i'm sorry to other college that's all i have
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:27.880]  time for but on the weekday show i'll cover this

[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:34.760]  finishing up now now for what i got from what you said but correct me if i'm
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:38.440]  wrong is the school nurse was upset about this and wouldn't let you have it
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:42.040]  but had a sheet that she was supposed to read to you saying you were the only
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:45.240]  concerned parent well she showed me she leaked me a
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:47.880]  sheet tell me this is what we're supposed to act like this is what we're
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:50.680]  supposed to do and she showed me that i'm not
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:53.000]  going to give it to you if i let you take a look at it
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.480]  okay look that took a look at where are you in texas i'm in ron paul's district
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.400]  bersoria county okay so you're south of austin yes
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:06.200]  okay and uh what did the sheets say it just says uh when parents complain just
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:09.000]  let them know just tell them that they're the only one that has
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.680]  complained basically even though she's got numerous complaints and
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.720]  questions we're just supposed to be more like a psychological isolation technique
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:23.080]  well exactly uh it's peer pressure i hear talk show hosts on radio and tv say
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:26.920]  just laugh at conspiracy theorist and that's a talking point i've seen it on
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.880]  fox cnn there's a medical doctor has a syndicated radio show i heard him today
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:35.800]  saying just laugh at them let them know their cooks laugh at them see here we
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:38.520]  are with the inserts the documents the proof
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:43.160]  their answer is to just laugh at us and isolate us using peer pressure

[1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:22.600]  coming up but uh tomorrow i wrote a bunch of
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:25.960]  notes today i wanted to go off of so i really got my points across but we're
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:28.120]  out of time so i'm just going to do an abbreviated
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:33.320]  breakdown of this we know we're on the white house enemies list
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:37.400]  i was sent by the army last year when we were protesting the fed in dallas
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:41.560]  they sent me a leak document we posted it that ron paul myself and others are
[1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:44.360]  considered terrorist we broke the mayak and homeland
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:47.640]  security report that said that is well earlier this year so i was sent those
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:51.640]  documents i don't know by who in the army i called phone numbers on it they
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:54.920]  confirmed that the army is watching in the fed
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:58.600]  protest who just want to audit and abolish the fed that we didn't have
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:03.000]  before 1913 the private fell reserve
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:06.440]  and then later it was in the baltimore sun that indeed the army is watching in
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:08.920]  the fed people and tea parties but myself
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:12.600]  particularly has been listed that's high treason by the military we are not the
[1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.920]  soviet union i'm not a dangerous person i don't
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:18.520]  commit any crimes all i do is expose corruption
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:22.920]  okay but they've got the army illegally surveilling us
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:26.680]  then it came out in major newspapers that we covered here in the last month
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:31.480]  that i'm on the white house enemies list number 24 then
[1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:35.640]  senator lamar alexander a week and a half ago took to the senate floor and
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:39.480]  said i've seen the enemies list it's wrong i worked for nixon during the
[1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:44.680]  enemies list this is wrong this is dangerous don't do it
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:50.040]  i then got a call friday from a super high-powered reporter
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:52.840]  and they said i just want to tell you that this may be breaking in the next
[1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:57.160]  few months but you are indeed on the enemies list
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:00.440]  and this these people are very dangerous and i'm sure you've noticed they're
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:04.520]  already coming after you and i said yes and it's george soros has a whole bunch
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:08.120]  of publications media matters a whole bunch
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:12.280]  they're all uh i'm being attacked by the new republic
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:19.240]  can west i'm being attacked by salon the wall street journal sent
[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:23.880]  one of their top reporters sarah mcbride here it was definitely a hit piece but i
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:27.080]  wasn't going to be a wimp i had her here
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:31.560]  and she kept looking around for people for background for bad stuff there
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:35.720]  isn't anything and she called me and she said you
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:40.600]  were right the top brass above the editor called me and said
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:45.720]  just don't go with the story then she kept trying to change it and
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:49.080]  but she did it she said she was trying to do it fair so she wouldn't make stuff
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:53.000]  up about me and that was definitely she was
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:56.280]  sent to do a hit piece and the wall street journal was going to do a front
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:59.800]  page on alex jones and just didn't do it
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:03.080]  because they know a fake hit piece will blow up in their face
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:07.080]  these other i mean folks i'm being attacked every day
[1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:11.960]  by mainstream media now and and i'm i'm getting a lot of death threats people
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:15.800]  call my wife up and say hi is alex there and she says no may i leave a message
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:19.080]  for him well who's this i i'm his fiance we're
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:22.920]  going to get married my wife says that's impossible that's my husband
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:26.840]  and the woman says well i'm pregnant and then hangs the phone up and by the way
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:31.320]  no number comes up when they call this is the type of stuff
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:35.240]  uh you want to know the stuff i go through
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:38.520]  watch the movie the insider with russell crow and al Pacino
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:41.800]  it is no exaggeration as i've been doing this longer
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:46.120]  20 times worse probably i mean it just it's i don't ever really talk about it
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:51.080]  or give it attention because it it it doesn't get to me other
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:54.120]  than the fact some days i don't have any energy or i'm tired
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:57.880]  when i get a death threat or some type of dirty trick i know i'm doing the right
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:03.400]  thing it actually helps me but i've been told that the that that
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:07.640]  it's all going to intensify now and so i wanted to prepare the listeners for
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:12.120]  whatever new lies they spew whatever new fraud they put out
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  i got sent internal emails that i'm not at liberty release a month ago
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:22.680]  from a major media outlet where they were ordered to attack me and i was leaked
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:26.760]  this and it was a concerted fake grass roots
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:30.920]  attack against me on the internet folks
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:34.200]  all i'm asking for is your support and and if we're going to have them come
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:37.160]  after us then we might as well go 110 percent
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:40.440]  you know that that's why they say sign your john handcock
[1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:43.400]  everybody that signed the declaration independence was a dead man if they
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:46.360]  didn't win a lot of them did get killed their families got killed
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:48.600]  they lost their treasure they lost their blood
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:53.400]  that their names got destroyed and john handcock signed it big and bold
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:56.440]  giant across the front and that's what i'm doing
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:00.600]  and that's why in fall the republic and the graphics is the constitution and it's
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.280]  alex jones i'm signing it you know i mean i i i am
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:09.240]  signing it right now my declaration against tyranny and dehumanization
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:12.840]  i'm not looking for a fight with the new world order i'm not looking to be
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.920]  martyred i'm not looking to be a tough guy i'm just an average good old boy from
[1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:21.000]  texas who learned about the world government read the cfr documents found
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.360]  out how they wanted to go after the second amendment and break up families
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:29.320]  and have year-round school and cps take people's kids and force inoculations
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:32.840]  and i made the commitment to fight them 14 years ago
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:36.520]  and it's been devastating to the globalist and we're now being attacked
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:40.040]  because we are having such an effect because we teach people
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:43.240]  how to empower themselves and to take action
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:46.760]  i love you all i want to thank you all pray for us we're going to continue
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:55.160]  onward great job crew back live tomorrow
