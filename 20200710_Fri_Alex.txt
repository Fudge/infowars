[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Victimizers beware, the races and bigot's greatest nightmare
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  Don't show justice, warrior, threat-trigger
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's a biased response team
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  If you've been offended, your feelings must be defended
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  What do you want me to go?
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  The freedom of expression is a microaggression
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Here comes Angelo Frey
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  He's always ready to fight fascism with fascism
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  The Starbucks windows don't stand a chance
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Ethic enhancer
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  He's a systematic racist and funder
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  He's the hero of the races and everywhere
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  Using the powers of screaming and shame
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  They win every debate by calling your names
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  They're heroes who think that they're victims
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  The look of justice, warrior
[00:51.000 --> 01:02.000]  It's July 10th on this live Friday
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Transmission on your host Alex Jones
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  We're 115 days off from the election
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  Out of all these stacks of incredibly important news
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  This article is a continuation of what foreign affairs
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  Of the CFR put out a few weeks ago
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  And of what Joe Biden has been saying
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  In fact, reprint me these please
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  That Trump is a dictator already, illegitimate
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  He's going to try to stay in office
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  And that anyone that aids him when they announce
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  That he loses the election will be removed forcibly
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  And will be put in prison
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  Now, this is coming out of the council on foreign relations
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  And out of the Atlantic council
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  And now it's in the Stanford advocate newspaper
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  They are beating this drum long and hard
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  Now Goldman Sachs came out two days ago
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  In fact, pull that from the stack again
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  And they said, well, there's a good chance
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  The election is going to be contested like in 2000
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  But this time, if the Republican can test it
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  They're saying we're going to use the military
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  To come in and take you all out
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  So what I'm going to do is
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  I'm going to get the Biden clips where he said a month ago
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  We'll use the military to take Trump out
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  And I'm going to get the foreign affairs CFR statements
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  The Atlantic council statements
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  And some of the other preparations
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  And the signals we're getting from the U.S. military brass
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  That they're not going to support the president
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  Now, the general military will
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  But the actual brass have all been selected
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  The establishment to the years to be absolute sellouts
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  These four star generals are just almost all of them
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  To complete trash
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  And I was warned about this by one star generals
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  And colonels and majors and stuff
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  30 years ago, don't put your faith in the military
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  They've selected really bad people at the top
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Here's the new headline
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Trump could lose and not leave
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  But cabinet members who try to help face prison
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  So they're going to say 25th amendment
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  If Trump challenges any of the mail-in ballots
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  Or any fraud
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  And there's any fighting that goes on that's totally constitutional
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Then he'll be removed
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  So that's what they're trying to set up
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  And they want the economy so bad
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  And riots going on
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  All because of the COVID hoax
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  That they can point at Trump and say it's his fault
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Remember what Bill Maher said on HBO
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Remember what the Democrats said on CNN, MSNBC
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  Before the COVID thing got launched in November
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  That we heard about by January
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  We got to make things so bad
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  And harass Trump supporters so much
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  And ruin their lives so bad
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  And create a depression, a stock market crash
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  That's worth it to drive Trump from office
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  So the globalists get back in control
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  So they're launching
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Well, they were always planning to launch
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  When Hillary got into
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  But they're just accelerating it
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  And I think we've done a great job
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  This is really blowing up in their face
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  They can't help themselves
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  And so now you've got all these tyrants saying
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Perds, Trump supporters
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  Imprison us
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  Hey, this isn't Russia or China
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  Where one half a percent are armed, dumbass
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  You're not going to have your Bolshevik way
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  With us just so easily
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  So you better pray to your mommy every night and day
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  That you're not successful in starting a hot war
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Because you start it
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Your globalists aren't going to be able to hide out
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  In Kauai or in Tasmania
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Or in the bush of Australia
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  Or in New Zealand or in Switzerland
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Everyone knows where you are
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  So I would advise you to stop now
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  But people like Hitler
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  And people like you never stop
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Not until you're in a bunker
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  We crawl in there and get your ass

[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  A giant contested election
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  The cherry on top
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  The detonator to take this country
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Into hot civil war
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Inside the Pentagon
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  Everyone is being approached
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  And being asked
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Will you support
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  A coup
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Against President Trump
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  That even came out three years ago
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  That a former top Obama official
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  From the Pentagon
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.000]  That's the headline
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Former Obama official
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  Canvassing the
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Pentagon on whether they will support
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  A coup against Trump
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  That was back when they were trying to block
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  His electors from seating him
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  On January 20th, 2017
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  As the 45th president
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  Of the United States of America
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  Well now I have the
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  Council on Foreign Relations
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  America's Democratic Unraveling
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  On page 50
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  On page 5 it says
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  The armed forces will be needed to remove Trump
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  That if he contests the election in any way
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  He will be removed by the US military
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  Here's a new one out of the Stanford advocate
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  Anyone saying that he
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Will not leave will be arrested
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  Trump could lose and not leave
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  But cabinet members who try
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  To help face prison
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  And what did Goldman Sachs say
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Yesterday
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  They said it will be contested they believe
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Because of all of the
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  Mail-in mallets and all the craziness
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  And the courts ruling that they're going to
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  Let states
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  Count the popular vote
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  And then not send forward their delegates
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  This is going to turn into a giant court battle
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  By design
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  Just like the Democrats did with
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  Russiagate, Ukrainegate and the rest of it
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  That's their admitted plan
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  They're not going to accept the
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  Results of the election
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  And they're letting Trump know
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  You don't go
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  We're going to arrest you
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  And we're going to arrest your cabinet members
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I told you this was going on
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Before it was ever in the news
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  I talked to a member of
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  Congress
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  And I talked to a member of
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  The US Senate
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  And they told us that
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter was
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  Quarterbacking on the hill
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  A plan to use the military to take Trump out
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  I went on
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  And I talked about that
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  And I said she's trying to
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  Get the electors to not
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  Seat him
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  I said that two weeks before it came out in the news
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  And she went on Fox News two weeks later and said
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  Alex Jones threatened to kill me
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  He needs to be arrested
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  And the Justice Department later it came out
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  Opened up a criminal
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  Investigation
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  Off of her total lie
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  That I said harm against her
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  I said nothing even near that
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  I said she's engaged in treason
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  She's a treacherous rat
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  She's a piece of garbage
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  This is insane
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  They're trying to overthrow the election
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  And this ongoing coup
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  That never got punished for the four coup attempts
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  Against the president and our election
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  In 2016
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Days
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  So everybody better
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Understand you better strap yourselves in
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  Because
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  Biden has run around on TV
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  Three times
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  And we'll play these clips coming up
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  In the last segment of this hour
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  Three times
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  And said
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  The military is going to remove the president
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  When he contests the election and then Goldman Sachs says
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  It will be contested
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  The Democrats say they will
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  They're going to contest
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  It'll be total fraud
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  That's their specialty
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  When they're the ones stealing it
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  They're the ones in Beaver the Russians
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  The Chai comms so they said the patriots are
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  They're the ones that are
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Herding children so they say we are
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  It's always the inverse
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  Of reality with these people
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  There it is
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Biden military will escort Trump out of the
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  Lighthouse and he loses his election and refuses to leave
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Print me that as well
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  I'll do the presentation in the last segment of this hour
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Let me tell you what we're going to cover
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  In the first hour and then the second hour
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  And the third hour and the fourth hour because it's jam-packed
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  I have absolute smoking gun
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  On top of smoking gun
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  On top of red flag
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  On top of hand and cookie jar
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  On top of just absolute ridiculousness
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  The COVID-19 is a giant fraud
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  At every level, every facet, every angle
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Designed for planetary takeover
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  AI takeover
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  A depopulation you name it
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  And now
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  On the CDC's own website
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  They say that COVID-19
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Is not
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  A
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  Epidemic
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  And that actually
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  It is a
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Nose-diving death curve
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  And that's why every headline you see says
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  America's entered
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  A black hole of COVID
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  America failed
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  America sucks
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  America open to early
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  America
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  Unbelievable
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  Meanwhile, right here on the CDC website
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  It says it's not
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Because they admit
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  That almost all the cases are false positives
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  Because again, if you've ever had coronavirus
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  Of the flu
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  On average in a decade
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  You can lose the immunity
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  And it won't show up between about 10 years
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's why you take a shot every 10 years
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  If you believe in all their crap
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  And it turns out they're almost all false positives
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  But they're ramping up testing
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  Everywhere
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  And this whole thing is based
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  On that fraud
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  And so when they say you're a hero
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  And you need to wear your mask and all this
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  No, you're going along with total depression
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  Election fraud
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  The end of the country
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  The third world hundreds of millions dying
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Billions
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Like a zombie apocalypse
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Racing over our borders and the UN
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Will direct the planetary collapse
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  And we'll have world government
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  And we'll be conquered militarily, economically
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Spiritually, culturally
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  This is the assault
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  I have all the documents
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  And I will go into it in great detail
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  Again, in the third hour
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  Today
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  With all the details
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  We can defeat this
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  If the people and the military
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  And the congress and our allies around the world
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  Understand they're under the exact same attack plan
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Bolsonaro understands
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Boris Johnson understands on the surface
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Nigel Farage understands
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  This is not some type of fear porn
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  This is the reality
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  It's like you hear your door knocked in
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  And dudes in black masks are in there with crowbars
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  You're going to roll over and piss yourself
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Or you're going to grab your shotgun and go to work
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  You better get yourselves ready
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  And I don't want you to physically
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Get your shotguns to go to work
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  It's an allegory of politically blasting the truth out
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  Not complying, saying no
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  I go in places all the time
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  The problem is I got to have some money go with me now
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  So I can always give it on tape
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  And I just refuse
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  I don't even say I have a medical reason not to wear it
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  That's the law, that's a waiver
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Or I have anxiety, I don't have to
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  I start getting in their face about it
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  And when they say fine, you can't shop here
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  I say great, I'll never be here again
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  Tell your manager
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  They always go sorry, I know it's a fraud too
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  Okay
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  Because it's a test
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  To see what you'll submit there, sorry
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  We have massive news here
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  Not just tied into this
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Well, just wait till next segment
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  On the COVID-19 hoax
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  I'm loaded for bear, this entire group of stacks here
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Is unbelievable
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Each one is three hours of radio time
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  I mean, it's just all over the top
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  We got Bohemian Grove news
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  The Supreme Court
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Has handed over half of
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  Oklahoma
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  So they can defend a
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Convicted child rapist, I'm not kidding
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  That's no joke
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  Supreme Court gives half of Oklahoma
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  A way to save pedophile rapists
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  Speaking of that, there's new news on
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  Gaslighting Maxwell
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Mainstream news now admits
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Everything you do is tracked by your phone
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  You're being listened to by corporations
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  And they even can control
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  What you're going to do later
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  By stimuli to manipulate you
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Journal reports how you feel depends
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  On where you are and they're admitting
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  That the phones are tracking and watching you
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  And actually creating psychological
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  Profiles on you to control your life
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  So I thought you might want to know that
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  We've got the latest SJW
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  To tear down the nation operation
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  They're now pushing for Ford
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  To no longer sell
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  Police cars to police, I'm not kidding
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And so much more
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Joe Biden has officially adopted
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  The Bernie Sanders platform
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And once replacement migration, no borders
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  And 600 million migrants we pay
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  For here, double the U.S. population
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Within 20 years, total destruction
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  Is your absolute annihilation
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Of all your freedom
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  That young lady about the viral video
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  About she supports Trump, they're taking her
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  High school diploma away
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  I am cutting the sad on Friday

[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  Amount of things like bodies
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  Our ultimate turmeric formula
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Because quite frankly, the supply chain
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Has broken down with COVID-19
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  And a lot of products we've been unable
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  To even get back in stock
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  Because the companies we get them from
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Are partially shut down, this is totally crazy
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  So you've got just a few days left

[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  At InfowarsStore.com
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  M4WareStore.com
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  You're listening to the
[18:03.000 --> 18:29.000]  Alex Jones Show
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  Alright, I'm going to absolutely blow you away
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  With the facts, with the evidence
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  The COVID-19
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  Is an absolute planetary takeover plan
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  And how to defeat it
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  Because people are submitting
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  At a great level, but even small levels
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  Of resistance will derail it
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  And we've got way higher numbers
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  Of the resistance than we need to even stop it
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  But people need to know
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  How to be targeted about this
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  And how to expose the entire fraud
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  You don't battle little pieces of it
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  That gets lost in minutia
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  You could give this different psychological names
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  But if you study
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Authoritarians throughout history
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  It's a formula they've deployed
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  And in the 19th, 20th, and now 21st centuries
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  It's become not an art form, but a science
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  So we have a document here
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  I'm going to do a primitive
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Illustration here
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Here we are in January
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  And they've not closed
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  The noose in around us yet
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  But monkey see monkey do
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  We sit there and we watch
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  What's happening in China and the apocalyptic images
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  So we get scared
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  And so
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  That is the new normal
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  Once it comes here, and we're told
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Just 15 days, because the hospitals will be overwhelmed
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  We're going to lock you in your house
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  So they close the noose down
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  Really, really tight
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Then they know that you're going to really get upset
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  Do your research, find out it's a fraud
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  If they don't release the noose
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  After a couple months, they release it
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  But not all the way
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  They release it about 90%
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  But then instantly
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  Begin contracting it back
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  Down
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  Again
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  And they do this over and over again
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Each time, not releasing it as much
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  As they did last time
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  So through successive approximation
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  Incrementalism
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  You end up where their in game is
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  Down here, a post human world
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  Okay
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  In fact, when I talk about monkey see monkey do
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  Get this yesterday
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  I search into this
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  Monkeys now adopting wearing masks
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  In India
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  In Africa
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  In Southeast Asia
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  Monkeys have all now been seen
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Picking up masks out of trash piles
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  And putting them on
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Now we're a lot smarter than
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Our fellow primate
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  These different types of monkeys that are doing this
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  But they think of humans as more advanced
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  As successful
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  They watch us closely
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  We drop food and stuff for them
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  And they know that we're more advanced
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  So they're now putting the mask on
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  They're now beginning to wear
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Clothing
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Now there you go, there's a monkey wearing
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  A mask, this is happening all over the world now
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Okay
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Because they've been watching us doing it
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  Let's move on
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now are we smart enough
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  To not be like the monkey and see that
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  We're being put into
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  A social construct called peer pressure
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  Now normally peer pressure
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  If you grew up in a village of a couple hundred people
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  In some seaside little town
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Whether it was in the Pacific ocean
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  And you're Asian or whether you were
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Northern European or whether you were in African
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  On the west coast of Africa
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  Your tribe cared about you
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  They stood up for you against other tribes
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  They taught you how to fish, they taught you how to hunt
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  They taught you how to cook, they taught you how to sew
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  They taught you medicine, the witch doctors
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  Talked about different herbs and plants
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  If somebody was a little weird or bad
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  They got thrown out of the tribe or they got their head beat in
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  They got thrown off a cliff
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  That's how justice operated
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  How we built civilization
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  But when you get to this point
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  Of corruption
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  And of the globalist feeding on us
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  And breeding us like cattle and controlling us
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  And that there's a scientific establishment
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  That's broken the social construct
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  With us and broken the social compact
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Compliance is not
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  Success
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  You're 10 years old with your tribe
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  And the 70 year old elder and your
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  30 year old dad and all the rest of them
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  Are telling you things
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Most of the time it's going to be right
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And complying is a good thing
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  You comply with David Rockefeller and Bill Gates
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  And Queen Beatrix
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  Who openly say they want your ass dead
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  You're an idiot
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I'm not complying with none of it
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  I'll comply with common sense
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  I will not comply with my own destruction
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Let's lay it out right now
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  CDC feels pressured from
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  Trump as Riff grows over
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  Coronavirus response
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  Because Trump knows it's a fraud
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  He knows that bureaucracy works for Bill Gates
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  Trump as I told you first
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  A month and a half ago was going to sideline Fauci
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  It happened two weeks later
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  They even used the term sideline
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Had that directly from the White House
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  That they got the message
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  I've advised the White House destroy him
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  Destroy Gates, annihilate them
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  They've got the patents on the vaccines
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  They preplanned it all
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Trump's the real deal
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  He's got to hit them now
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  He can't wait
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  He's the president
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  He's a trader working with China
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  Hit them politically president as hard as you want
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  The American people will back it
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  Or maybe Fauci just goes away on a long trip
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Along Bill Gates somewhere
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  Vacation together someplace we never see him again
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  Who knows
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  They're like Whitman, Price from the Dodd
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Paid in full
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  Last season's winners
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  Let's continue
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  Colorado Town threatens a year in jail
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  For residents who refuse to wear
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  Mask
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  $2,000 fines in Austin
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  See it gets more draconian
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  They tighten the news
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Loosen the news
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Tighten the news but don't loosen it as much
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  Tighten it more the next time
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Don't loosen it as much
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  Because they found you'll struggle out
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  No, it's death up front
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  But if they can just
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  Tighten it and then let it go
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  Tighten it and then let it go
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  And that's, boa constrictors actually do that
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  They get around you and they squeeze
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  When you really fight hard, they kind of let off a little
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  No one you're going to inherit
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  So the best thing to understand is
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  You've got a boa constrictor just got around you
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  And if you think listening to it
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  And doing what it says while it hisses in your ear
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  It's a good idea, well then just lay back
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  He's going to break your ribs
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  And go and swallow you down whole
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  As for me, I'm going down fighting with old Bill Gates
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Fouts, he says
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  He hasn't briefed Trump on COVID-19
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  In two months
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  The U.S. is
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Typing into the dark
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  COVID hole
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  And there's no plan to get out, says CNN
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  Meanwhile, the deaths have totally plunged
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  Because everybody found out
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  They were killing the old people and killing people
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  So they can't do the ventilators
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  We need ventilators
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  We need millions of them
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  Or we won't get up to the two million dead
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  Said Cuomo
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  I need hundreds of thousands in New York alone
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  But you didn't get them
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  So you couldn't kill enough people
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  See
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  They've got it all planned out
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  But see, we didn't go along with it
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  So now they've got all these cases
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  But the doctors are learning that steroids
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Stop it and that it's an autoimmune
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  And hydroxychloroquine
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  They demonize, stop it and take it and zinc
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  Stopps it and so they're pissed
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  Because it's not going the way
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  It was supposed to
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  So let's get into it right now
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  When we come back
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  CDC
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  Says COVID-19 no longer an epidemic
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  As current rate of decline
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Of deaths
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  Not increase of cases that are false
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  And then the big enchilada
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  When we come back, I haven't gotten to this yet
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  We have the video
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Head of emergency management
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  For the state of Texas
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  Should wear a mask inside their homes
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  See, that's also over to window
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  You're struggling saying I don't want to wear it outside
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  Or in restaurants, he goes, hey, that's not enough
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  Not even in your own house
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Should you not have a mask off
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  And so that makes it sound reasonable
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Hey, you know, you should be wearing it
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  In your house, buddy
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Not just outside
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  And this morning
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  I went
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  I'll tell you all these stories when we come back
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  On the other side, there is just so much going on
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  It is so
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  Over the top, all of it
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  And the only way to override it is to meet it head on
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  Admit it's all a fraud
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  Admit it's a criminal action
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Call people out in charge of it as the murdering
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  Mastermind criminals they are
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  And I know that's going to happen, we're going to win
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  Stay with us
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  Get behind
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  We need to get back to the land
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  Back to self-sufficiency
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  And back to being prepared
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  Is having friends and family with a bug out plan
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  If there is a total collapse and water filtration
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  And food to last you at least a few months
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  And the food we have is very high quality
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  It's in great containers
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  That are great to be mobile
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  They have wide selections, special diets
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  You name it, it's the best price you're going to find
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  But you need to get the orders
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  In now, in the lull before the storm
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  I told you lockdown 2 was coming
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  The new world order is making it smooth
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  Whether Trump loses or wins
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  Things are just going to get more crazy
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  And this food lasts 25 years
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Inside the containers
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  Something you know is the ace in the hole
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  For you and your family in the future
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  And the little bit of profit that comes in
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Funds the info war to continue
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  To warn the people
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  So you're also funding info wars
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  To the powerful Paul Revere organization in the world
[27:51.000 --> 28:20.000]  It's powered by you
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  All of us, we are Hispanics
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Cubans, Puerto Ricans
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  We used to be on
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Monster and Red Bull and Rolla
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  And I have love's way
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  Because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  And I just want to thank you for that man
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Long term high quality energy powder there is
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  He didn't want his name on it
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  Because obviously the political issues
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Just for the design of it and we believe
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  It's the youngest but healthiest energy out there
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  And you're saying that it's made your life better
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  So that means a lot to me, thank you
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  To all your truck drivers, we love you
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  I must end this special
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Our extended July 4 special
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  By Monday the 12th
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  That is our drop dead date
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  It absolutely has to happen
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  Because a lot of these products that have been sold out
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  We can only get limited supplies of them
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  Because the supply chain is breaking down
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  Winter sun with vitamin D3
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  And vitamin K sold out for months
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Back in stock 50% off
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  Ultra 12 high quality B12 taking over the tongue
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  Sold out for months back in stock 50% off
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  Bodies are ultimate turmeric formula
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  Super strong turmeric concentration
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  Sold out for months back in stock
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Limited amount 50% off
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Double patriot points
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  Free shipping, it's the same thing with vitamin
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Refusion, survival shield
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  X3 and so much more
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  And it funds the information war
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  The globalists want you sick and weak
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  And dumb down, they don't want you to know
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  God has given us all their mother nature
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  These products are powerful
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  And loved them, many of you haven't
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  The sale ends just a few days
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  So take action now and get free shipping
[29:57.000 --> 30:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  Fighting enemies, foreign
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  And domestic on your host Alex Jones
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  Okay, let's plow right into the documentation
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  If you go directly to the CDC website
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  It tells you right there
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  That COVID-19 numbers
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  Of deaths have plunged
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  So it's no longer
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  An epidemic, meaning deaths
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  But they can confuse the public
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  By having all these false positive tests
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  And say that it is a pan
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  Demic and as the testing explodes
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  The numbers explode
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  You see the state of Texas doing the most testing of anybody
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  California's second
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  New York third and Florida
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  Fourth
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  That's where you have the big outbreaks
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  Because it's the testing and the CDC website says
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  Most of those are fake
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  Remember, presidents and prime ministers
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  In other countries have sent off
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  Papias and goats and dirt
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  And they test positive for COVID-19
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  Because it's the coronavirus
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  Coronaviruses are the most common thing
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  Floating around
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  That is quasi-alive
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.000]  So continuing, based on death certificate data
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  A percentage of deaths attributed
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  To pneumonia influenza or COVID-19
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  They add all those together
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  Decrease from 9.0
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  During week 25
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  To 5.9
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  During week 26
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  Representing the 10th week
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  Of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  The percentage is currently
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  At the epidemic threshold
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  But will likely change
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  As more death certificates are processed
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  Particularly in recent weeks
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  And these numbers are about two weeks old
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  But the word is it's going to go down even more
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  But they show you all these maps
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  With red everywhere, it's fraud
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  Now here's the headline
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  News 4, San Antonio
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  There's a more detailed article on infowars.com
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  And newswars.com
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  Head of emergency management says
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  Texas should wear masks
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  Inside their own homes
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  And the model he's using is
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  Italy
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  Where most of the deaths were in nursing homes
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  And nurses came out
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  Five months ago in Italy and said
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  They're putting healthy COVID patients
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  To test positive in nursing homes
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  We've never done this
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  They're using them as incubators
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  They're killing old people
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  And even then I thought, well maybe that nurse
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  Is going a little too far
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  Then we learned it was being done here
[32:59.000 --> 33:01.000]  Under the UN regulations
[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  Trump found out and told them to stop
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.000]  They tried to spend it, oh Trump's fault
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  He's the government
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  So the traders of the government follow the UN
[33:09.000 --> 33:11.000]  They do this, Trump finds out, stops them
[33:11.000 --> 33:13.000]  And they go, well don't blame me
[33:13.000 --> 33:15.000]  It was only blue cities
[33:15.000 --> 33:17.000]  And blue states that did it
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  No, you are a murderer
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  Cuomo
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  And Leticia James, your attorney general
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  Is a murderer, she ordered
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  The hospitals and nursing homes
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  When they said this is a death sentence
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  This is a default position
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  Just like it was a default position 10 years ago
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  Never give a pregnant woman a vaccine
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  Set on the insert, induces miscarriage
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Now they say on the news
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  It needs to be done extra
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  To act as seeing evil
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  Governor Northam, a murderer
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Saying they keep babies alive
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  And take their organs
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  But they keep them comfortable
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  So it's okay, see they're just throwing it in your face
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  Breaking your will
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  You say, why are they so evil
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  Why are they so out in the open
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  They're doing it on purpose
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  Psychiatrists are running this
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  This is a psych warfare operation
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  To break your will
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  So head of emergency management
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Says Texans should wear masks
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Inside their homes
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  So this morning I was doing errand
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  I was in a little strip center area
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  It was full of parking
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  So I parked a little down the street by a residential area
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  And I get back in my car
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  And I see what looks like
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Some joggers, walkers
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  About 100 yards away
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  By the time I roll up the window
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  And turn on the car they're about 50 yards away
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  And I'm on my phone, taking a call
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  I notice that they're waiting and pointing at me
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  But they've got a whole sidewalk and everything
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  And so I get off the phone
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  And I'm sitting there watching them
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  And I go, they look about like Chinese
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  They're wearing masks, Chinese man, Chinese woman
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  And they start walking down
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  Pointing at me angry
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  I didn't videotape it, I didn't want to antagonize them
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  I was in a truck with the windows up
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  And it
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  Wasn't enough that I got in at the windows up
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  They were social distancing
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  Probably
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  You know, here working for a tech company
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Probably Chinese citizens
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  Because there, their phones track them
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  For every foot they are
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  And if they go buy another person
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  Their social credit score goes down
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  So to them it's like a big video game
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  To follow the AI to prepare themselves
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  And the AI is already in place
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  The public is just being told about it now
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  So to watch the next level of conformity
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  100 yards away
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  And then 50 yards away
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  And for me, on a quiet
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Street, look like Mayberry
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  Off a little strip center
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  By my neighborhood
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  And now there's reports
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  Of people pulling guns on customers
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  For not wearing masks, the man was arrested
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  That's on m4s.com
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  This is the hysteria
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  So, when you watch
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Santa Anna, our governor
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  Our dictator, our emperor
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  Greg Abbott, who's the only Republican governor
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  But more are now going to capitulate
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Because of his evil leadership
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  That's why it was so evil
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  The man you always see standing behind him
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  Is
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Texas Chief
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  Nim Kid
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  You always see Nim Kid
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  Behind
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  The governor wearing his mask
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  And he says, do not
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Leave
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Your house without a mask, but also
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  In your house, wear a mask
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Because you're such a bad person
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  You're so evil, you're so dangerous
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Today is, we need to do that
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  When we're in our homes also
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  As you know, I'm a lifelong San Antonio
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  And grew up there, worked there for many years
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  And I know how many multi-generational families
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  That we have
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  And while we believe the community is doing
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  A great job of following
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  The rules when they're outside of the home
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  We really need to be thinking about doing the same thing
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  When we're inside the home
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  And all of us are
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  Capable of catching this disease
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  None of us are immune from this
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  And the fact that we need to get across this
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  In order to protect ourselves
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  We need to protect our families and our loved ones
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  We really need to be thinking about the care
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  That we're providing inside the home right now
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  To make sure that we're not spreading this disease
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  Inside the home and then making it come outside the house
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  So let me get this straight
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  What you're effectively saying is that
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  People should be wearing masks inside their own homes now
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Ryan, I'm saying if you can't socially distance
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  And can't socially isolate
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  Or if you've been out in public
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  And exposing yourself
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  And you haven't decontaminated yourself
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  Good enough when you get home
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  If you have someone that has underlying medical conditions
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  That's enough, turn this idiot off
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  If you want to know the road to hell
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  What it's paved with
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  It's paved with chief of Texas emergency management system
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  Nim Kidd
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  You can tell
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  He really means well, he's a good boy
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Well, you can trust him to water your plants
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  When you're on vacation
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  And we're stolen nickel
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  But he's a follower and dumb as a box of rocks
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  Hey Nim
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  The United Nations five months ago
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Released their global guidelines
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  And it said that by the fall
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  They would have contact tracers
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  Going into everyone's homes
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Separating people from old people and children
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  And forcibly testing people
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  And locking down apartment blocks
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  First, started in Spain
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Started just this week
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  In Australia, we played that yesterday
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  You are walking us
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  Into a boa constrictor
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Into a noose that's closing
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  And so
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  They lied about the numbers that would die
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  They lied about numbers of people that died of other things
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  They have fake testing
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Everybody knows that the governor admits that
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  Most of the tests are fake
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  But he still says that we can see one person
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  That's right, the whole economy collapses
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Old people can be put in nursing homes
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  And no one can come see them now
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  And so they can die magically
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  You're setting it up
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  Kim
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Nim, dumb, kid or whatever your name is
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  To let the real killers
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  With their actuaries, the eugenicists
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  The bioethics boards come in
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  You know how to deal with the flood
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  Nim, Kim, you know how to deal with
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  Fires, Nim, Kid
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  You're a firefighter
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  You're not a doctor, Bill Gates isn't a doctor
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  Now you're not a psychotic
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Like Bill Gates that runs this whole thing
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  But let me tell you something
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Murderers, murderers
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  Stop murdering us
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Nim, kid
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  When we come back
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  I'll get into the coup plan against Trump
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  That's now active and live, openly announced by Democrats
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  But first, we'll play the director
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Of the UN emergency response operation
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  His counterpart that wrote this up
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  He's the head of emergency in Texas
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  He gets his orders down to the CDC
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  From the UN
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Directly from Dr. Michael J. Ryan
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  That says we're coming to take
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  Your children, your parents
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  We're coming into your houses
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  And this piece of trash is getting us ready for it
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  He hasn't even gotten the memo yet
[39:53.000 --> 40:17.000]  In about a month he will
[40:17.000 --> 40:25.000]  And that's it for today's episode
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Thanks for watching
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  And I'll see you in the next one
[40:29.000 --> 40:51.000]  Thank you all for your support
[40:51.000 --> 40:59.000]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  And if you go back to those shows
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  We laid out the AI takeover plan
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  The tracking of cell phones
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  How programmed master computers would manipulate control society
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  How they'd be able to not just predict
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  Large groups of human movements and activities
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  But even predict what individuals would do
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  And then once you can predict what individuals
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Would do
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  You can add stimuli through the AI systems
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  Through the computers
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Through digital billboards
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Through face scanning
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  Through the social credit score
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  To control people and make them act like you wanted to
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  But when we cover that
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  The media would attack us and say
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  We were making it up, it was a conspiracy theory
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Even though it was in the actual corporate level
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Blueprint documents
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  Well the next level of the blueprint documents
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Explained to us that they are setting up this control system
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  And phase us out
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  Than what Hitler planned
[41:53.000 --> 42:21.000]  To dismantle the system now
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  We're all feeling the strain from rising pressure

[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  And thank you all for your support
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  The president tweeted earlier
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Linking the closing of the country
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  To your election success
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  In November, is this easter timeline
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  Based on your political interest?
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  What do you mean by my election success?
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  No, you tweeted, you said that the media
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  Wants the country to remain closed
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  To approach your own debate
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Just so you understand, are you ready?
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  I think there are certain people that would like it
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  Not to open so quickly
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  I think there are certain people that would like it
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  To do financially poorly
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  Because they think that would be very good
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  As far as defeating me at the polls
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  So please, bring on the recession
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  One woman said, I want a recession
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  Because that'll help get rid of Donald Trump
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  I call this another Trump slump
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  The threat of recession is real
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  We would see the global economy entering recession
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  In three quarters, perfect timing I think
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  I mean, I've been rooting for a recession
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  But if the global economy, including the United States
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Is taking a step toward recession
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  What does that mean for this presidency?
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  It's political suicide
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  These numbers are irrefutable
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  There are people in your profession
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  That would like that to happen
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  I think it's very clear
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  I think it's very clear
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  That there are people in your profession
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  That write fake news, you do
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  She does
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  There are people in your profession
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  That write fake news
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  They would love to see me for whatever reason
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  Because we've done one hell of a job
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  Nobody's done the job that we've done
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  The president went on Fox News
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  And lied to millions of people
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  About the coronavirus outbreak
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  And bungles its response to the crisis
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  For more on this, it's time for a closer look
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  With the world on edge
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  People are looking to their leaders
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  For reassurance and answers
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  Unfortunately, we have him
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  It's a serious thing that needs to be dealt with seriously
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  And right now, the federal government
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  Is failing to stop lying
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  When in the middle of a
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  Severe public health emergency
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  The president just lies about it
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Over and over and over again
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Trump is lying to people about the potential threat
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  To the coronavirus
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  This may be Donald Trump's Katrina
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  Donald Trump is not in charge here
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  The governors are in charge
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  This is
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  An event that could take down a president
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  And it's lucky that you have this group here
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  Right now for this problem
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  Or you wouldn't even have a country left
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  How dare you
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  That man is failing right now
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  This may be Donald Trump's Katrina
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  Yeah, you kind of have to
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  I mean, let's just
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Let's just lean into that
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  How many deaths are acceptable?
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  How many? None
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  But as far as the winning economy
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  That the president needs from now until November
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  Do you really see that changing?
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  If the stock market were to tumble this year
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  If we don't get near the 3%
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  GDP growth that this administration
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  Has been talking about for years
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  These are all things that Dems can run on
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  And they pose a problem
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  A recession is a survivable event
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  What Trump is doing to this country
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Is not
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  Fear is freedom
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  Subjugation is liberation
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  Contradiction is true
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  Those are the facts of this world
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  And you will all surrender
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  To them
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  You pigs in human clothing
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  I
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  Enjoy
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  That translate to
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  Hope you enjoy your depression
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Sorry
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  Go ahead
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  No, no, I probably
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  Best I don't
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  And that's a couple months old
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  So they planned it all, they ran it all
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  They own the virus
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  That mimics all these other cold viruses
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  So now they can just scare the hell out of everybody forever
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Confuse everybody, lie to you
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Kill old people, create false positives
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  Bankrupt everything, come in your house
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  Take your kids away
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  Here's the head of the UN
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  Global emergency response
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  To disasters and medical crises
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  Dr
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Ryan
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  And he is through the
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  UNWHO down through the NIH CDC
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  To the state of Texas
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  Who this man takes his orders from
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  The Texas division of emergency management
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  Head, chief
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Nim Kidd, who says
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  Don't leave your house to let them ask
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  And you need to wear one in your house
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  And then already in Australia
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  Already in Spain
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  They began coming to the houses
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  Taking the families away
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  Breaking them up, here it is
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  And at the moment
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  In most parts of the world
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Due to lockdown, most of the transmission
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  That's actually happening in many countries now
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  Is happening in the household
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  At family level
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  In some senses, transmission has been taken
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Off the streets and pushed back
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  Into family units
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  Now we need to go
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  And look in families
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  To find those people who may be sick
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  And remove them and isolate them
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  In a safe and dignified manner
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  And by the way, Dr Michael
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Ryan was
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  In the John Hopkins event
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  201 two month drill
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  In October, November last year
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Where coronavirus is released
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And they bring in world government with it
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  And then they just drilled it
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  They announced it, it's a bad pneumonia
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  They know it's treated with steroids
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  They know it's treated with COVID
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  And IT can be treated very well
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  They know people can get it
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  If they're vitamin mineral deficient
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  But that's why they had a battle plan
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  Through Facebook, Twitter, Google
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  To suppress medical doctors
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  And Cedar Sinai
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  And scientists and virologists
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Who would come out and help
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  But what do we do, the medical field's going to expose this
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Well simple, we let the
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Centralized systems say what's available
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  And day one they said
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Starting in January, only the UN
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  Can say stuff about COVID
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  Not your doctor
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Not the CDC, not your state
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  No one but the United Nations
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  You've heard that 10,000 times
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Haven't you, you've read it
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  It's everywhere, just like that
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  You're inside world government
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  Now I've got a lot more on this
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  But $2,000 fines
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Austin, by the way
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  A big tidbit in the announcement that Austin made
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Everybody's getting freaked out
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  By the $2,000
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  A day fines
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  But look right here out of the KVUE
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  News
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  It's got a link to the new ordinance
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  $2,000 fine through December 31st
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  For any violation
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  Of any of the lockdown orders
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Of the lockdown
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  That is going through December 31st
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  So we're already in the lockdown
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  They already passed the law
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  The governor already agreed
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  They're going, gee, I don't know if I'm going to do it
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  It's going to hurt businesses
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  And every mayor follows the same script
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  That comes out of
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Bill and Linda Gates Foundation
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  The big foundations that cooked it up
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Through the UN, down to us
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  And we're now under United Nations
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Global government control
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  And our stinking governor
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  And our stinking emergency head
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  Are just jackass dumbasses
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Who just follow orders
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  Give a hell
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  Unbelievable
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  Trump's figured this out
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  He's fighting back
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  We're going to go over it all
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  But man
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  I've got Savannah Hernandez
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  And Owen Schreuer who are on fire
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  Coming in here
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  And I have not even gotten to my top story yet
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  So
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to do this right now
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  I'm going to mention this
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  I'm going to hit this coming out of the gates at six after
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  The video with me
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  We'll talk about this at first
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  And we'll move into the subjects there on
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  But
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  You understand I've got a stack of news articles
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  And video clips where they're officially saying
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  How they're going to have a coup against the president
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  Physically with the US military
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  And how they're positioning it all
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  The last thing I need guys is the
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Goldman Sachs article
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  Where Goldman Sachs came out yesterday
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Goldman Sachs says election will be
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Contested, I need that please
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  There's a Reuters article
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  So
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Man I tell you there's just so much of this
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  I can't even keep track of it anymore
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  So that's coming up
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  Briefly
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  You want to fund this operation
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  You want to get great products at the same time
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  Now's the time to do it
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  A lot of products you like
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  Have not come back in
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  And people are like where's my product
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  Well the exception of the toothpaste
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  The reason we aren't able to have it for you
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  Is because we have
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Wildcrafted or organic
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Quality and it's always hard to get it
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  And now because of breakdowns around the United States
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  And a lot of these companies are partially shut down
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Or fully shut down
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  Everything's backed up and they're not even taking our money
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  And so the orders we are able to get in
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  On some of our best products that were sold out
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Are limited and aren't as big
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  And so that's why I've got it in this special by Sunday
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  Monday the latest because
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  We're running out of these things
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  That even came back in because we got limited

[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  Now the lockdowns continue
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  It's going to be a total beyond
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Depression breakdown of society
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  So we're fighting as hard as we can
[54:43.000 --> 55:03.000]  Thank you for your support
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  News wars.com
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Infowars.com
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  And a lot of other great sites
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  That are getting massive traffic
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  Thanks to you and your word of mouth
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  That is king
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  That is queen
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  That is the master of our own
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  Destiny's
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  A war on civilization, a war on our health
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  A war on our economy
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  But being aware of it
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  And standing up to it and speaking out against it
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Will defeat it, so take action
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Or be slaves
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  And I wasn't even close to downtown
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  But I was parked on a little side street
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Going to this business
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  When I came back out I saw
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  What looked like two Asian folks
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  Probably Chinese
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  Walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Up ahead of me
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  And the woman stops and points at me
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  So they stop and they wait
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  While I'm inside my truck
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  And they sit there and stretch
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  She keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Like they're waiting for me
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  To go
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  And so then I just sat there
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  So they acted angry and walked past me
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  I almost shot
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  A video of it on my phone
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  But everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  This has been a illness, people are pulling guns on folks
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  That aren't wearing masks
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  This is all cult programming
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  This is all about submitting
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  It's all a giant fraud
[56:43.000 --> 57:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  The Korean constitution
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  You're listening to the African American
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  To run for vice president of the United States
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  Douglass's Rochester, New York statue
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Was recently torn down
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  Coincidentally on the 168th anniversary
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  Of his What to the American Slave
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  Is Your Fourth of July
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  As of this report
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  The morons that toppled the representation
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  Of everything Black Lives Matter claims to be
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  Have yet to be apprehended
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  And the motive still remains unclear
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.480]  Bubba's small it race baiting hit job?
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.360]  Or is this another case of the millennial horde of imbeciles
[57:45.360 --> 57:47.640]  tearing down anything that represents
[57:47.640 --> 57:50.520]  some form of triggering pseudo authority?
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.280]  And if this is a form of retaliation,
[57:53.280 --> 57:55.280]  judging by the drunk college students
[57:55.280 --> 57:57.280]  who did this back in 2018.
[57:57.280 --> 57:59.000]  The six foot seven inch sculpture
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.920]  was ripped from its base at Tracy Street in Alexander
[58:01.920 --> 58:03.840]  shortly after midnight Sunday.
[58:03.840 --> 58:05.520]  A witness gave a cell phone video
[58:05.520 --> 58:08.600]  showing two men carrying that statue down the street
[58:08.600 --> 58:10.240]  to St. John Fisher College.
[58:10.240 --> 58:11.800]  Students were arrested.
[58:11.800 --> 58:13.960]  John Bodicker and Charles Milks
[58:13.960 --> 58:15.760]  charged with criminal mischief.
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.640]  Can we expect the gavel to fall harder on Americans?
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.160]  After the Marxist Black Lives Matter set the stage,
[58:23.160 --> 58:26.280]  as is for the couple who are facing hate crime charges,
[58:26.280 --> 58:28.520]  for daring to paint over the Black Lives
[58:28.520 --> 58:29.920]  mural in California.
[58:29.920 --> 58:32.880]  Will this path transform our court system
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.360]  into a communist style Polit Bureau?
[58:35.360 --> 58:37.920]  The statue pillaging is as confusing
[58:37.920 --> 58:40.720]  as it is stupid, but stupidity is law now,
[58:40.720 --> 58:44.640]  as the Democrats defund movement shifts into high gear.
[58:44.640 --> 58:46.400]  They want to defund the police,
[58:46.400 --> 58:49.040]  but that's not stopping three city council members
[58:49.040 --> 58:52.640]  from having the city pay for their private security
[58:52.640 --> 58:54.320]  after receiving threats.
[58:54.320 --> 58:56.560]  A city spokesperson says the security details
[58:56.560 --> 59:00.120]  are costing the city $4,500 a day
[59:00.120 --> 59:04.160]  for a total of 63,000 for the last three weeks.
[59:04.160 --> 59:06.760]  In a text message, council member Cunningham said,
[59:06.760 --> 59:08.280]  I don't feel comfortable discussing
[59:08.280 --> 59:10.560]  the death threats against me or the level of security
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.120]  I currently have protecting me from those threats.
[59:14.120 --> 59:17.120]  Accelerating a lawlessness that is just showing
[59:17.120 --> 59:19.480]  the first signs of unyielding chaos
[59:19.480 --> 59:22.000]  as homicide skyrockets in New York
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.400]  with an increase in executions in broad daylight
[59:25.400 --> 59:28.160]  and more children are caught in the crossfire.
[59:28.160 --> 59:30.840]  We're fighting the enemy within.
[59:30.840 --> 59:34.560]  When we are shooting each other up on our streets
[59:34.560 --> 59:37.520]  in this city and you shot and killed a baby.
[59:37.520 --> 59:39.640]  Sequoria Turner was shot near here
[59:39.640 --> 59:41.640]  outside the Wendy's parking lot
[59:41.640 --> 59:43.680]  where 27 year old Rayshard Brooks
[59:43.680 --> 59:47.200]  was killed at the hands of a white police officer last month.
[59:47.200 --> 59:48.640]  We talk about black lives matter,
[59:48.640 --> 59:50.920]  but at the end of the day, we kill each other all.
[59:50.920 --> 59:52.120]  We kill our baby.
[59:52.120 --> 59:56.360]  Another violent weekend, deadly for far too many
[59:56.360 --> 59:57.920]  and far too young.
[59:57.920 --> 1:00:00.800]  Jesus, help us mother.
[1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:03.600]  The grief-stricken family of seven year old Natalie Wallace
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.680]  was shot in the head while playing outside
[1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:09.120]  in the yard of her grandmother's home in South Austin.
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:10.680]  But according to Don Lemon,
[1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:12.680]  their lives are a separate issue.
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:14.440]  When you look in the city of Chicago,
[1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:18.920]  there are nine children who died by gun violence,
[1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:21.400]  by black on black gun violence
[1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.520]  from June 20th all the way to today.
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:27.760]  And you're talking about even with the Atlanta Chalmers,
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:31.760]  there were 28 kids who died in two years.
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:35.280]  The gun culture in this country is prevalent,
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:37.640]  but I don't understand what that has to do
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:41.080]  with a movement that's for equality for black people.
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.000]  It's not mutually exclusive
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.600]  that you care about equality for black people
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:50.920]  that somehow you're going to stop random violence
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:54.000]  or unfortunately kids from being shot.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.080]  It just seems like apples and oranges.
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:59.080]  Representative Ilhan Omar clearly stated
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:03.560]  the Democrats remedy for oppression in the United States.
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:07.440]  As long as our economy and political systems
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:12.440]  prioritize profit without considering who is profiting,
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.720]  who is being shut out,
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:18.000]  we will perpetuate this inequality.
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:22.600]  So we cannot stop at criminal justice system.
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.560]  We must begin the work of dismantling
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:29.280]  the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:32.120]  Frederick Douglass, who incisively spoke out
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:35.720]  against oppression during an era of real despotism,
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:38.080]  could have never imagined that his message
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:40.120]  would be forgotten and destroyed
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:43.160]  by people using their own claims of injustice
[1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:46.480]  to destroy themselves and everyone around them.
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:48.040]  John Bown reporting.
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:51.680]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:57.160]  As we enter the critical month of July,
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:59.480]  it is very important for listeners and viewers
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:02.240]  to understand that all of the major
[1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:06.560]  storable food companies had been sold out of food for months.
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:08.760]  My Patriot supply, our supplier,
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:10.880]  was out to an eight week wait,
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.160]  not because they didn't have food,
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:14.120]  but because their four plants were backed up,
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.720]  packaging and getting it out.
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:19.440]  Now, they are at three to four weeks right now.
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:21.080]  They've gotten over the hump.
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:23.240]  Their other competitors are completely sold out
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.440]  or selling old garbage.
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:26.760]  This is high quality food.
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:29.200]  I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:33.120]  and buy more storable food now before the next big hump comes
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.840]  because if you think things are about to settle down,
[1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.960]  think again, the world is only gonna get more insane.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.640]  I've been telling you this for six months.
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:43.960]  and ammo and water filtration, you better get it.
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:45.920]  If you don't have storable food, you better get it.
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:48.720]  Go to infowarstore.com to take care of the water filtration
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:50.040]  and to take care of the storable foods.
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:52.360]  Get your orders in now before the next big rush.
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:03:21.080]  MUSIC PLAYS
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:26.280]  MUSIC PLAYS
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.280]  I know this is a strange question to ask an American politician.
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.520]  Maybe easier around the world.
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.840]  But have you ever considered what would happen
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.880]  if the election result came out as you being the winner
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.120]  and Trump refused to leave?
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.240]  Yes, I have. I was so damn proud.
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:44.200]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:47.040]  and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:51.520]  And you have so many rank and file military personnel
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:54.280]  saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:55.840]  This is not who we are.
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:58.680]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him
[1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:02.200]  from the White House with great dispatch.
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:03.680]  So we're not a military state.
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:06.480]  We're just a state where the WHO, the UN,
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:08.800]  and multinational corporations in rogue states
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:13.560]  and rogue mayors dictate to the president,
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.360]  to the courts, to the legislative branch
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.040]  that we have no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:24.480]  And now the official Democrat Party platform
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:28.560]  is to abolish the US and open us up to 600 million migrants
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.200]  with, quote, replacement migration.
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:31.920]  I'll show you those documents in a moment.
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:37.640]  But first, there is a major move in the New York Times,
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:40.600]  the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post,
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:44.880]  foreign affairs of the CFR across the country.
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.000]  Here's the headline from infowars.com.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Emergency global broadcast, Deep State
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.720]  announces new coup plot.
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.680]  Them leaders and major publications saying military brass
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:57.680]  are preparing to remove Trump.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:00.560]  Don't just believe infowars.
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:01.520]  Here it is.
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:03.880]  This is the latest military would escort
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:05.920]  Trump from the White House.
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:06.880]  Here's another one.
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:10.360]  CNBC, Goldman warns delayed election results
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.640]  this November similar to Bush Gore could rock the market
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:18.280]  and predict there's going to be delayed issues because the
[1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:20.280]  Democrats are trying all this criminal fraud,
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:21.640]  all these mail-in ballots, and they
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:24.320]  say they're going to contest it if Trump wins.
[1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:26.320]  So it's going to be contested.
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:28.840]  And then when Trump contests what they're saying,
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:32.480]  they're setting the stage that the military will
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.800]  remove the president.
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:35.840]  Here's the latest.
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:38.720]  Trump could lose and not leave.
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.520]  But cabinet members who try to help him face prison.
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:46.560]  This is a syndicated column in newspapers all over the country.
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:51.520]  This came out of the Stamfordadvocate.com.
[1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.760]  And it says November is approaching fast.
[1:05:57.480 --> 1:05:59.160]  And it's a whole group of people, again,
[1:05:59.160 --> 1:06:02.160]  from the Washington Posts, where this article originated
[1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:05.440]  from, saying that people better not support Trump
[1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:08.200]  if he challenges the results, even though Democrats are
[1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:10.840]  going to challenge it if he wins, and that they are prepared
[1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.040]  with the military to remove Trump.
[1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:14.760]  This is all part of their bravada,
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:16.680]  preparing everyone, acting powerful,
[1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:18.360]  claiming the military's behind him.
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:24.680]  Just some shadowy group, and that anyone that aids him
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:26.960]  and speaks out and says that he's right,
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:29.080]  you will be arrested for your speech.
[1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:34.800]  And if you complain about the Democratic Party's new platform,
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:37.080]  saying they're going to replace Americans with migrants,
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.080]  $600 million, replacement migration now,
[1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:42.760]  part of the Democrat platform, Biden officially signed on
[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.560]  to it last night.
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.400]  Sachsburg Cohen and the ADL say, you will be purged,
[1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:50.560]  and you will be arrested.
[1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:51.680]  We played the clip yesterday.
[1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.640]  So they're now saying, we're going
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:58.720]  to arrest you if you don't let us take the country over.
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:01.600]  With November fast approaching, here's
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:04.080]  a recurring question that can't easily be dismissed
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:06.520]  as alarmist fretting or grim humor.
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:09.200]  What if President Trump loses his bid for reelection
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:13.640]  but refuses to concede and instead clings to power?
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:16.720]  That means, oh, it's preposterous that he'd win.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:19.600]  And if there's any questions, any challenges, like 2000,
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:21.240]  well, we can't do it.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:23.360]  And they go on in the article.
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:26.600]  It's a long article to say the military is ready,
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:28.080]  and that he will be arrested.
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:31.880]  But also anyone else that does not go along with it,
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:37.080]  anyone on his cabinet, that if they believe the election
[1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:39.320]  has been stolen and they speak out against it,
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:40.920]  that they will be charged.
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:44.880]  And then they talk about there's also specific to the military
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:47.640]  that demand obedience to one only legitimate president
[1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:48.520]  under one provision.
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:50.080]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.520]  executing order under someone who's not
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:54.600]  an lawful president could be deemed
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:58.200]  to have failed to do his utmost to prevent and suppress
[1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:01.680]  mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence.
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:06.560]  The same provision criminalizes even attempting mutiny
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:07.360]  or sedition.
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:11.280]  Moreover, another statutory provision
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:14.960]  criminalizes soliciting or advising
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:16.320]  the commission of mutinies.
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:17.360]  Did you hear that?
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.640]  So if you argue that Trump really won and there's fraud
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:23.240]  and the Supreme Court should challenge this,
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:25.960]  they've already laid out how they're telling the military
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:28.760]  and others, if you stand with the president,
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.720]  you're going to go to jail.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.800]  They're the ones preparing the mutiny.
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:35.720]  They're the ones saying we want a depression and COVID-19
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:36.640]  to shut things down.
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.880]  They're the ones with fake testing numbers
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:40.640]  to jack up the numbers and create fear.
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.800]  They're the ones saying we want a depression.
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.000]  They're the ones saying they hate the American flag.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.040]  They're the ones saying they hate the existence
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:48.240]  of the very country.
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  You got to go read it.
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.920]  It's a long article and I've got a bunch of other ones here.
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:52.800]  Look at this one.
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:57.680]  This is from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:08:59.960]  America's Democratic Unraveling.
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:02.600]  Notice they create the mutiny, say
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.080]  Trump's creating a mutiny.
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:06.720]  They create the unraveling, admit they're doing it,
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:08.480]  then say, oh, Trump's doing it.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:12.000]  And it says right here that because Trump has caused
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.840]  the unraveling, the armed forces may be able
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.720]  to restrain him as well as evidenced
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:18.280]  by the forceful rebuke he received
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.720]  from former Defense Secretary James Mattis
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.360]  that were threatening to deploy US Army
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:24.080]  and National Guard against protesters.
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:25.600]  They weren't protesters, they were looters.
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.040]  But it would be a sad day in America
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.320]  if he had to depend on the military to save our democracy.
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:33.920]  And they go on to talk about the military removing him.
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:35.880]  Savannah Hernandez are a great reporter.
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.680]  And of course, Owen Schroyer, hosting the Warrom,
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:38.640]  are both here.
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:40.440]  We're gonna cover other subjects for you when we come back.
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:42.680]  But right now, Owen, give us a minute or two
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:44.440]  on what you think about this situation.
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:47.880]  They're preparing the groundwork for the open mutiny coup
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.960]  and then saying it's Trump's fault, inverting reality.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:54.680]  I think they've lost confidence in the censorship,
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:56.160]  in the media.
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:58.720]  They see the real polls that have Trump,
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:00.440]  I don't know how far ahead of Biden.
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:01.560]  Biden really has no support.
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.640]  It's just Trump versus anti-Trump at this point.
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:04.800]  He's the placeholder for the coup
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:06.360]  to remove Trump, overthrow the country,
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:07.760]  and then put it in whoever they want.
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:09.680]  So they obviously think that they're,
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:11.920]  just blatant election fraud isn't gonna work.
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.520]  So they're getting ready to kind of unveil this plan.
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.880]  What I think they may do though,
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.600]  they may have television media come on
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:20.760]  the night of the election and say,
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:24.160]  oh, Biden won, Biden won, even though Trump did win.
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.800]  And they'll just have the whole censorship grid rolled out
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:27.880]  just like they did with COVID.
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:29.680]  They'll stop just like they stop any doctors
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.640]  from talking about hydroxychloroquine
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:34.080]  or stop any doctors from talking about the fake test.
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:34.920]  Exactly.
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.040]  This has all been a dress rehearsal
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:37.200]  for stealing the election
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:39.600]  and having big tech AI totally suppress it all.
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:41.280]  And then so they'll come in and they'll say,
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.640]  oh, Biden won, Biden won.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.760]  And then Trump will say, no, Biden didn't won.
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.840]  And then it'll be the president versus the media.
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:48.440]  Just that'll be the playing field.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.000]  You know, our question now, Alex,
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.440]  is we basically have three options.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:54.200]  One option is attack.
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:55.960]  And I mean, literally like it's time to mount up
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:57.760]  and we'll go make our own autonomous zone.
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.640]  And we'll drag these Democrats out
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:01.000]  by the scruff of their neck.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.240]  Yeah, the autonomous zones will be inside the Capitol.
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:04.480]  Yeah, and so that's one.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:05.720]  We can attack, we can do that.
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:07.200]  Two is patience.
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:09.480]  We can sit back and wait and see,
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:11.280]  okay, let's see what happens in the election night.
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  Let's hope for a good thing, maybe a big red wave,
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:14.640]  a bunch of patriots getting to Congress
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.680]  and we can actually do this peacefully and politically.
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:18.480]  And then the third option is retreat.
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:20.880]  Go to the hills, mount up, get emergency food,
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:23.560]  get by body water, get by a mountain,
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:24.920]  get a bunch of guns and ammo.
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:26.000]  Well, I'm doing both.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.840]  So, but I guess the philosophical thing
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:31.400]  we have to wonder now is, for example,
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:33.240]  if we want to attack or if we want to wait
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.080]  or like at what point do we measure?
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:38.200]  At what point do we have to choose
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:39.560]  before we've had the choices taken?
[1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:43.040]  Or is it, okay, if Trump wants to let them
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:45.000]  steal the election from Trump, okay, fine,
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.440]  that's Trump's decision.
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:49.000]  We're not going to let them take our country.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:49.840]  So-
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:51.440]  And they've already told us the contact tracers
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:52.920]  are coming to our houses.
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:53.760]  And they go, oh, by the way,
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:54.800]  they're going to be political.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.640]  They're the youth brigades Obama wanted.
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:57.760]  This is their whole rollout.
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:58.920]  Hey, we want to be on the field.
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:00.000]  We want to be on the front lines.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:00.920]  We are the tip of the spear.
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:02.360]  Trump has let them censor us.
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:03.680]  Trump has let them lie about us,
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:04.720]  sue us into submission.
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:05.560]  We're still fighting.
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:08.280]  So, hey, you know, at the end of the day,
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:10.440]  are we fighting for Trump or are we fighting for America?
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:11.360]  I'm fighting for America.
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:12.200]  Let's be clear.
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:13.800]  But Trump is there for us.
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:14.640]  He's doing a great job.
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.360]  But no one, all the points you made are great.
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:18.560]  But at the end, it doesn't matter.
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:19.680]  We're under globalist attack.
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:20.720]  We've just got to fight.
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:22.080]  I want to hear what Savannah Hernandez thinks about this
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:23.520]  when we come back and they get into other big subjects.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.280]  But when you were saying that, it just hit me.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:28.360]  We've got to hammer this every day for the next 115 days
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:29.960]  so America knows this is coming.
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:32.600]  Because the Democrats and all their elitist publications
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:35.320]  are preparing for the coup and saying they're doing it
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:37.440]  and saying they're going to challenge the election,
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.600]  but Trump isn't allowed to.
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.240]  And they're going to arrest people
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:43.000]  across the board that don't submit.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.920]  We'll talk about this with Savannah Hernandez
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:46.760]  and Owen Schroederhead.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:47.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:49.240]  There could be a more important subject.
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:52.600]  Tell folks to tune into your local radio stations right now.
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:54.560]  I am cutting the sad on Friday.
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:58.240]  And by Monday afternoon, we have to end this special.
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:12:59.600]  Because even though a lot of these items
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:01.240]  have been sold out and just came back in,
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:05.280]  we only ordered a limited amount of things like bodies,
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:06.840]  our ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:08.960]  Because quite frankly, the supply chain
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.880]  has broken down on COVID-19 and a lot of products,
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:14.480]  we've been unable to even get back in stock
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:16.080]  because the companies we get them from
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:17.480]  are partially shut down.
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:18.720]  This is totally crazy.
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.560]  So you've got just a few days left
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:23.360]  to take advantage of the July 4th mega sale

[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:42.880]  even though they're about to sell out.

[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:51.680]  Free shipping, double-patriot points.
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.320]  I must end this special, our extended July 4th special,
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:57.960]  by Monday the 12th.
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:00.560]  That is our drop dead date.
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:02.440]  It absolutely has to happen
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:04.800]  because a lot of these products that have been sold out,
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:06.360]  we can only get limited supplies of them
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:09.320]  because the supply chain is breaking down.
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.920]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.520]  sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.

[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:21.720]  Bodies are ultimate turmeric formula.

[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:29.520]  50% off, double-patriot points, free shipping.
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.600]  It's the same thing with vitamin mineral fusion,
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:35.080]  survival shield, X3, and so much more.
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:36.920]  And it funds the information war.
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.680]  The globalists want you sick and weak and dumbed down.
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:40.520]  They don't want you to know
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.440]  what God has given us all through Mother Nature.
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:43.800]  These products are powerful.

[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:57.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:16.320]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:17.720]  And we talk about a subject like this.
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:19.600]  We start talking fast, we start hyperventilating,
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.400]  because we're not reading off teleprompters.
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:23.440]  We're reading out of the Washington Post
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:26.560]  saying the president's gonna be removed from office
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:29.760]  if he challenges the election in any way.
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:31.760]  Even though the Democrats say they're gonna challenge it
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.440]  and are involved in massive fraud.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.120]  And the military will be arrested
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:37.040]  if they don't follow Democrats' orders
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:38.240]  to arrest the president.
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:42.560]  So this is a constitutional crisis.
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:44.320]  Savannah Hernandez is here with us.
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:45.160]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:46.160]  I wanted to get you guys in here
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:48.320]  about all the SJW activity and Owen
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:50.600]  going down to the Austin City Council yesterday,
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.240]  where they're going $2,000 fines.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:54.560]  They've announced the lockdown of the city to begin
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:57.360]  within the next week till at least December 31st.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.120]  That hasn't been really announced yet.
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:00.360]  It's in the fine print.
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:01.720]  Also, they're announcing
[1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:04.200]  where masks inside your house statewide.
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:06.320]  This is just total cult lever to take over.
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:08.880]  The governor Abbott has totally smoked sorrows.
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:09.720]  You in dope.
[1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:11.120]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:13.680]  But Savannah Hernandez looking at them openly
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:15.160]  after the fake Russia gate,
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:17.760]  trying to block him being inaugurated.
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:22.120]  The fake rape gate, the fake Ukraine gate.
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:23.760]  All of this insane crap.
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:25.680]  The massive censorship, all of it.
[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:28.280]  Where do you think this country's going with 115 days?
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:29.640]  What do we do to beat the drum
[1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:32.000]  to expose this plan they've got?
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.680]  I mean, coming out on air and exposing all of this
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:36.960]  and talking about it is a great way to do that, Alex.
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:39.800]  And I'm glad that you have the platform now
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:42.160]  to be able to do that, to expose this information.
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.120]  Well, the listeners have the platform if they promote it.
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:44.960]  Right, definitely.
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:47.960]  And, you know, they've been laying the groundwork
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:50.520]  for this since Trump got into office.
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:52.360]  Hillary Clinton has already come out so many times
[1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:56.280]  and said that, well, what if Trump loses in 2020?
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.760]  He's not going to leave the White House.
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:16:59.520]  So she's been already laying the groundwork,
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:00.600]  planning the seats for this.
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:03.200]  And then also as well, look at what Twitter did.
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.640]  They're trying to push the idea
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.440]  that million voter fraud was not a real thing,
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:08.280]  that it was fake.
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:10.240]  So we've been constantly lied to
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:11.760]  and they've been laying the groundwork for all this
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.880]  to continue to lie to us
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:15.040]  and push President Trump out of office.
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:16.960]  So this is not surprising in the least
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:18.160]  and it is very important
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:20.000]  that people use their social media accounts
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:20.840]  or go out in the street
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:22.880]  and bring light to this type of issue
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:24.200]  because it's very real
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:26.520]  and it's coming up very quick in November.
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:28.880]  Exactly, we're 115 days out.
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:30.080]  They're going to do it.
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:33.000]  They've beta tested as Owen rightly said.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.680]  This COVID lockdown of information is a total test
[1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:37.720]  and they're saying you're not allowed to say
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:39.640]  voter fraud exists even if you catch it.
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:40.600]  So they're going to deny it.
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:42.240]  They're going to deny the mail in fraud.
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:43.880]  They're going to deny all sorts of shenanigans
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:44.720]  in other states.
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.200]  They're saying they're going to let states just say
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:48.560]  we're going with popular vote.
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:50.720]  If Trump challenges that even when the Constitution says
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:52.680]  that's it, they're going to try to block it.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:54.280]  You can see the Supreme Court now
[1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:56.320]  suddenly ruling against him a whole bunch.
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.640]  You suddenly see the generals talking trash about him.
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:01.200]  They intend to remove Trump in 115 days.
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:02.960]  Remember, I told you he was going to win
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:05.720]  and he's going to really win the real vote, 115 days folks.
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:07.600]  But I think they're going to remove him by code
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:09.920]  unless we admit that they're coming with the coup.
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:11.000]  Savannah?
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.720]  I completely agree and I mean, this has happened
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.480]  time and time again, just like you talked about
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:15.400]  with Russian collusion.
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:17.880]  This has been an attack on the president since the day,
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:20.160]  since before he even got into office.
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:22.200]  So, you know, we're seeing this amp up
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:24.160]  because as you've clearly seen,
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:26.560]  Joe Biden cannot even form a coherent sentence.
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:29.480]  They have nothing to go on and now they're just actively
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:30.640]  trying to push the president out
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:33.080]  because that's really all they can do at this point.
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:35.280]  And then there'll be a panel
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:37.120]  and an emergency congressional hearing
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.560]  and then they will select who the new president is.
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:41.400]  They want this on purpose.
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:43.520]  Just like before they had a pope for life,
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:45.200]  then it was predicted to be two pups.
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:46.480]  I was thinking it might be three pups.
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:48.920]  They want to get rid all over the place
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:50.080]  of anything traditional.
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:52.880]  But here in America, they want to get rid, again,
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:54.760]  of the president really being elected,
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:56.960]  have a big commission, have a big crisis,
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.480]  and then have constitutional amendment
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:18:59.880]  to get rid of the electoral college
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:03.080]  and bring in a new presidential type system
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:04.280]  that's more parliamentary.
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:06.440]  They're going to gut the country all right now.
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:09.040]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the main assault is here.
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:10.320]  Owen?
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:11.400]  Well, the coup is on.
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.200]  I mean, I don't think anybody denies the coup,
[1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:15.520]  whether you're in on the coup or against the coup.
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:16.520]  You're either with the coup
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:18.960]  because you say Trump's a Nazi or racist or whatever.
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:20.640]  So, oh, we're justified in removing him
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:22.080]  from office or killing him.
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:23.320]  And then if you're a Trump supporter,
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:25.280]  you say, look at all the lies about Trump.
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:27.240]  Look at the lies about his crowd size.
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:28.760]  Look at the lies about his past.
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:30.000]  Look at the lies about what he says.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  So there's no doubt the coup is on.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.800]  Again, I mean, Alex, I just get frustrated
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:36.440]  because it's like, we know who did the coup.
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:38.760]  We have the 20 to 30 names who did it.
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:41.320]  And they've already had failed coups, caught red-handed.
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:42.520]  They didn't get in trouble.
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:44.040]  And so if Berman and people don't start
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:46.200]  arresting people last month, we're done.
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:47.240]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:50.320]  It's like, arrests need to happen before the election
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:52.800]  or we're going to face a real coup.
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:54.440]  And I'm afraid it's going to be a war.
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:55.960]  I really am afraid of that.
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:19:58.360]  And I don't think the average leftist
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:01.840]  that we'll play clips of from a rally we had earlier this week,
[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:03.360]  the average leftist is not my enemy.
[1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:04.480]  They're a brainwashed fool.
[1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:07.920]  They couldn't even tell the real story of America
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:11.080]  if they went to college or whatever.
[1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:14.000]  They think Frederick Douglass was a white supremacist.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.680]  They think Orwell, major leftist publications
[1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:19.400]  are calling for him to have his books banned
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:21.640]  because he, quote, didn't like communist.
[1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:22.880]  So that means he's a Nazi.
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.760]  He was in the Spanish Civil War and shot by Nazis
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:28.200]  through the throat and almost killed.
[1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:30.320]  But he was there in Spain around the communists
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:32.360]  and saw them being as bad as the Nazis.
[1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:36.440]  So 1984 was about how Stalin was as bad as the Nazis.
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:39.040]  So you're shot fighting real Nazis
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:41.360]  and the Antifa gets to say you're a Nazi.
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:44.240]  It's all about them being God, them being the boss,
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:45.520]  and all of us, they're slaves.
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:46.960]  That's what it is.
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.120]  We've been, in fact, Alex, you called out the coup
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:49.960]  before anybody else.
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:51.160]  It was literally election night
[1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:52.600]  and people didn't understand what you meant
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:53.680]  when you said it's going to get worse.
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:54.960]  Well, this is what he meant.
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:57.560]  And I'll be honest, Alex, I think about this.
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:00.040]  I think about, you know, is it time for Alex Jones
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:02.120]  and Info Wars to declare war on the deep state
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:04.800]  and literally say, okay, if we don't have arrests
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:09.800]  by October 31st, 2020, we call for 50,000 armed men
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:12.040]  to meet us at the Texas Capitol
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:14.320]  and we'll set up our own autonomous zone.
[1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:16.440]  And we'll go wherever we need to go
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.400]  and drag out whoever we need to drag out
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:19.720]  by the scuff of their neck
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:21.200]  until we start to get some arrests
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:22.560]  or we start to get some action.
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.560]  I don't want to do that.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:24.920]  I know you don't want to do that.
[1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:26.880]  That's why we take political action.
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:28.880]  That's why we come on air every day.
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.520]  But it's reaching a point where, yeah,
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:32.240]  there's an active coup going on.
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:33.960]  It's been going on for four years.
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:37.160]  People should be hanging from ropes for treason right now.
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:38.520]  This is getting out of control.
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:39.520]  And by the way, we're not up here.
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:40.680]  Lined up and shot.
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:43.000]  We're not up here in Camo acting tough about it.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.080]  We're going to have a war with the UN and all this.
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:46.840]  We're already under UN control.
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:48.080]  We're under global control,
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.000]  but we've got pockets of America left
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.920]  and people have to decide what they're going to do.
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:54.800]  I'm just simply telling everybody,
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.960]  when they take Trump out, he's right.
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.440]  He said, look, they don't really hate me.
[1:21:58.440 --> 1:21:59.400]  They hate you.
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:01.000]  I'm just standing in their way.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.440]  That's really what's going on here, okay?
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:04.560]  And Trump is surrounded.
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:06.040]  I'm surprised he's done this much good.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:06.880]  I love him.
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.040]  He's the real deal.
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:10.720]  Everybody else is being threatened with arrest
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:13.840]  or imprisonment or have had the FBI visit them
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:15.240]  because Trump still doesn't have control
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:16.560]  of the Justice Department.
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:18.560]  And so other people, when they get the visits
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:20.720]  or the threats, they turn against the president
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.240]  because they're under duress.
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:23.360]  Why do you think all these big sides
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.480]  have turned against the president?
[1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:26.000]  Because they have a gun to their head.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.080]  They put the gun to my head.
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:28.680]  I said, pull the trigger.
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:30.240]  Most people don't do that.
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:32.000]  Roger Stone said, pull the trigger.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.360]  They're trying to put him in prison.
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.720]  By the way, I know whether Trump's giving him a pardon
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:38.440]  or not, I've been asked not to say.
[1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:40.040]  I'll just tell you, the Drudge Report headline
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:41.320]  is very accurate right now.
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:42.840]  You put it back on screen.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:44.400]  Developing Trump to pardon Stone.
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:46.040]  Well, yeah.
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:47.600]  Yeah, you see.
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:49.040]  I love how I always have to wait
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:49.880]  and I don't get to break stuff,
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:52.040]  even though I know it a week ago.
[1:22:52.040 --> 1:22:53.080]  I mean, as of a week ago,
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:55.400]  Trump is gonna pardon the president.
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:58.040]  But I mean, Trump is gonna pardon Stone.
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:22:59.640]  It just makes my head want to explode.
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:01.120]  I just cannot handle this anymore.
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:02.600]  It's unbelievable.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:05.960]  And they act like the conviction of Stone
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:07.240]  validates Russiagate.
[1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:09.320]  There's no Russiagate there.
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:11.600]  And the left knows that you're the stinkers
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:12.760]  that hate the country.
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:15.000]  Can you imagine the left actually ran this nation?
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.040]  They're never gonna run it.
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.400]  You're being used as the scum to overthrow the country.
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.560]  And then you're gonna be put on lockdown, dumbasses.
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:21.920]  Yeah, how long did CHOP last?
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:23.000]  Two weeks, three weeks?
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.840]  That's about how long their reign would last.
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:26.680]  Maybe less.
[1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:27.520]  They're just there.
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:28.920]  It's in the IMF documents.
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:30.360]  They're there to destroy confidence
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:32.040]  that the global is coming in by everything up
[1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:33.520]  and everybody's poor permanently.
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:35.360]  Hey, everybody wants to be poor permanently
[1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:36.640]  and have little leftist spies
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:38.200]  that come inspect your house weekly?
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.120]  Get ready.
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:42.000]  You're gonna have, like Tony Montana says in Scarface,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.560]  a chavano on every corner telling you
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:46.200]  what to do, how to sleep.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:47.040]  You understand?
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:48.880]  You're gonna be a total slave.
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:53.680]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:58.360]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:02.960]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:05.800]  I feel fine.
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:08.200]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:10.480]  and I don't feel fine.
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:13.480]  This entire takeover has been battle planned,
[1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:16.800]  blueprinted, war gained, field marshaled
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:18.560]  by the psychological war chiefs
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.440]  at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:23.520]  This is the post-human takeover.
[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:28.000]  The new skits tighter when you comply, not looser.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.160]  Now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:34.320]  because those are fake,
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:36.320]  where they count people that died of something else.
[1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:38.440]  But it's all about how many cases there are
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:41.920]  and now they're saying most of the population will get it
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:44.400]  and then no one can go outside ever again.
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:46.520]  It's totally insane.
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:47.640]  It's a fraud.
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:48.880]  It's all a lie.
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:55.200]  The July 4th mega sale ends on July 12th.

[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.720]  I wanna thank you all for your support of the Info War

[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:45.480]  God bless.
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:52.200]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.800]  to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:58.240]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress,
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.920]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients,
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.280]  amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:06.240]  That's why Info War's life created
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:09.120]  the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula,
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:11.760]  the new platinum standard of advanced multi vitamin

[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:17.480]  a unique delivery system to maximize the effects

[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:52.120]  available at infowarstore.com.
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:08.520]  One last breath, the forewind blows,
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:10.480]  better range your ears.
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:12.960]  It's the sound of hooves not yet your door.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:19.520]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:21.120]  Well, so does he.
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:26.120]  Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:30.000]  All right, folks, we are here with Savannah Hernandez
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.680]  and Owen Shroyer.
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:33.760]  All the cameras aimed in close on me.
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  The most boring thing to watch.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:37.880]  And we're talking about how real this is.
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:41.080]  The whole world history is about coos and countercoos
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:43.080]  and empires being overthrown and republics
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:45.400]  being overthrown and wars.
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:46.640]  And you look at what's happening,
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:50.000]  it's all being run against us for real.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.760]  Because Americans have had so much freedom
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.240]  and been so soft for so long.
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.000]  We are literally watching the Supreme Court
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.880]  line up against the president, the Pentagon signal
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.200]  against the president.
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:04.400]  Because these people are all hedging their bets.
[1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:07.600]  And if it looks like Trump loses, even if it's fraudulent,
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:10.560]  they're going to hang him out to dry.
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:11.600]  Because they want to be there.
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:16.080]  When the country gets carved up, they want money.
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:20.480]  And so countries like this don't die
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:22.360]  over long periods of time.
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:25.000]  They get sick over long periods of time and rot,
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.360]  and then they die.
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:28.320]  You go off a cliff and there's a sudden collapse,
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:30.720]  and you get sacked, and you get ruined.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.520]  After all the barbarians wander off,
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:34.680]  and an outside empire comes in and takes over.
[1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:38.200]  This is the end of the country, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:39.480]  You have to understand that.
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:41.080]  The globalists will shut off.
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:43.400]  The central cities shut down the highways,
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:45.800]  and they'll wait a year or two, like they did with the Russians,
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:48.080]  until you starve to death, until you accept
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:51.480]  the central control of the globalist communists.
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.840]  And you're going to have ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:56.800]  train people in your house every week.
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:59.000]  You're going to have your families put into apartment
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:00.280]  buildings with other families.
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.240]  They're going to watch everything you do.
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.280]  This is the dream of these globalists.
[1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:09.200]  And so you need to understand, they want to break you.
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:13.440]  They think you're weak, and they're coming for you.
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:17.000]  Savannah Hernandez, more comments on the situation.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.120]  No, Alex, I've only been following politics
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:20.720]  for the past two years, but everything
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:23.320]  that you've talked about has come true.
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:24.760]  And you've been ahead of the time.
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:26.600]  You've been ahead of the curve time and time again.
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:28.680]  And I just hope that people listen to you,
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:30.960]  and they put out the message that you're getting across.
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:33.200]  Because like we've talked about, they've
[1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:35.800]  been attacking President Trump since before he's even
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:38.200]  been in office, and they've been laying down the groundwork.
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:40.000]  And we're seeing it time and time again.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.960]  And 2020 isn't going to get any calmer.
[1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.600]  Everyone keeps waiting for it to calm down,
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:47.280]  and it's not going to calm down because up in November,
[1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:48.760]  we have this election.
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:51.000]  And no matter what the outcome is,
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:54.120]  it's going to be a fight either way.
[1:29:54.120 --> 1:29:56.760]  Because the people running the attack never get in trouble.
[1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:59.240]  The people up on top of the foreign banks, the Chai Coms,
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:29:59.880]  they never pay.
[1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:01.840]  But Trump's starting to actually make them pay.
[1:30:01.840 --> 1:30:04.480]  I mean, pulling out of the WHO, shutting down China.
[1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:06.000]  I mean, Trump's swinging for the fences.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:06.960]  He's fighting hard.
[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:08.600]  I mean, if this was a Godzilla movie,
[1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:11.360]  Godzilla's like just threw Megalon into the ocean.
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:13.080]  I mean, he's fighting.
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.520]  Yeah, the problem is, if they install Biden,
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:18.440]  or he would just be a placeholder for whoever
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:19.560]  they bring in after that.
[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:20.960]  Oh, that's a Chinese dictatorship.
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.520]  They'll just, he said in a video two years ago
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:25.640]  that we need to be under Chinese rule.
[1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:28.360]  They'll literally put us right back in the WHO.
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:30.040]  They'll sign us right back in the TPP.
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:32.320]  They'll sign us right back in the Paris Climate Accord.
[1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:34.760]  So I mean, look, Trump needs to deal a death blow
[1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:35.440]  to the deep state.
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:37.880]  He needs to deal a death blow to the globalists.
[1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:40.200]  And that's arresting their heads in the West.
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:43.080]  I mean, that's just the most peaceful way to do this,
[1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:45.440]  in my view, because like you said,
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:48.520]  if we have a massive victory, which I would expect for Trump,
[1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:50.160]  maybe not as massive if we'd hope,
[1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:53.680]  but I think the real polls and the just turnout for rallies
[1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:56.040]  indicate anything, not the fake TV polls.
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:30:57.720]  It's that, yeah, Trump is still ahead
[1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.000]  and now the left is going after their own.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.040]  I mean, there's protests calling for governors
[1:31:02.040 --> 1:31:04.520]  and mayors to resign and all these left-run cities.
[1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:05.760]  They're Democrats.
[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:07.000]  They're all Democrats.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:10.920]  There's rallies outside of Democrat mansions all across.
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:11.760]  That's right.
[1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:13.040]  They want to bring the whole country down
[1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:14.360]  because they're going down
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:16.760]  and they want to then reorganize it in a Marshall plan.
[1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:20.280]  And by the way, when I talk about Biden openly saying
[1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:21.440]  we need to be run by China,
[1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:22.880]  they found the article with the video,
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:23.960]  put it back on screen.
[1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:25.640]  I know this sounds insane.
[1:31:25.640 --> 1:31:26.920]  I know it sounds crazy.
[1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:29.280]  This is what a takeover looks like.
[1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:32.080]  Flashback, Biden calls for communist Chinese influence
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:35.440]  in quote all levels of government classrooms
[1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:36.400]  and boardrooms.
[1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:39.520]  That was back under Obama during the ongoing takeover.
[1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:40.920]  They had sold us out.
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:43.360]  But in the last minute, the people of the Republic
[1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:45.800]  elected Trump and stuck our foot in the door.
[1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:47.000]  And that's why the Washington Post
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:48.560]  is telling the military,
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:52.320]  if you stand with Trump when we try to steal the election
[1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:55.240]  and he can test it, we're going to arrest you.
[1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:58.160]  And the military is like, well, we'll fight this.
[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:01.040]  The top brass are scum.
[1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:04.040]  So remember that, and just this last point,
[1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.440]  it's three big brokerage firms,
[1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:12.240]  the big mutual funds and five banks, okay?
[1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:15.480]  All Trump has to do is actually
[1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:16.640]  get control of the Justice Department.
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:17.760]  They have all the dirt.
[1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:20.120]  All you do is arrest those people right now.
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:22.040]  The whole thing will roll over just like that.
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.320]  You just gotta arrest, I mean, you arrest a hundred people.
[1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:26.840]  It's over.
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:27.960]  The president knows who they are.
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:28.840]  I'll give them a damn list.
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:29.800]  Go ahead, sorry.
[1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:33.120]  Well, and the other thing that I think we're looking at too
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:35.520]  for 2020, okay, if Trump does win
[1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:37.280]  and they give him the victory
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:39.320]  instead of faking that Joe Biden won,
[1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:40.560]  what are you gonna have?
[1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.800]  You're gonna have so much looting and rioting
[1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:44.400]  and burning and destruction on the streets
[1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:47.440]  just like after we saw when Trump won the first time
[1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:49.520]  in DC during the inauguration,
[1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:50.920]  they'll just do it election night.
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:52.040]  And they'll just do it the next night
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:53.480]  and the next night and the next night.
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:55.360]  And so then there'll be all this chaos
[1:32:55.360 --> 1:32:57.280]  and then the media can swoop in and say,
[1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:00.560]  oh wait, we've done a recount, Biden actually won
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:03.080]  and there'll be so much chaos and crap on the streets.
[1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:05.480]  They can actually roll the president out of the White House
[1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:07.880]  with the corrupted military heads that they have.
[1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:09.120]  That's why they're so desperate
[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:10.680]  to keep Flynn on the sidelines
[1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:13.080]  with this corrupt judge now refusing to drop the case.
[1:33:13.080 --> 1:33:17.000]  Exactly, Trump just has the 100 globalists arrested
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  and they've got all the files on all of them.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.120]  The whole thing will roll over.
[1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.400]  The stock market will double and it's over.
[1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:24.200]  America already dominates the planet.
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:25.400]  It's us with the chai comms.
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:26.360]  It's gotta stop.
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:27.520]  Oh, you free this country.
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:29.800]  It's a joke, the amount of prosperity
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:30.880]  that this country could have.
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.160]  I mean, the next day, you free Americans
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:36.840]  from this mental enslavement,
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:39.800]  you free Americans from this victimhood mentality.
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:42.280]  I mean, we're under a damn cult, Savannah.
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:43.440]  I completely agree, Alex.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:47.040]  And going out and being outside and facing these people
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:48.840]  has really woken me up personally to this
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:49.920]  and that's why I'm very passionate about this.
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.040]  We're gonna play some of that next segment.
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:54.480]  Because we have completely seen the dismantling
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:57.520]  of the nuclear family, the indoctrination
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:33:59.920]  of our youth, of college students,
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:02.320]  the abolishment of the police and the defunding of this,
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:04.320]  the dismantling of the system
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:05.600]  that Ilhan Omar just called for,
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:07.320]  someone in our very own Congress.
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:08.680]  So we've seen this time and time again
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.440]  that just so many people are trying to destroy America
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:12.600]  from within.
[1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:15.400]  And I mean, it's been a crazy thing to see, Alex,
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:17.760]  and these are wild times to be living in.
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:19.840]  And by the way, you're a good example of how M4s runs.
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:21.480]  We might have the former top lawyer
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:23.480]  that wrote the U.S. and global bioweapons law.
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:25.680]  We might have the former multi-star general
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:27.120]  and we might have a member of Congress on.
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:30.000]  But we hired you to, I guess, do video editing,
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  write up some of the logs of the show,
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.840]  do some basic stuff like that, work on production.
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:37.840]  But I said, hey, you ought to get on air
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:39.920]  and then now you've gone out in the field,
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.760]  you've not been radicalized by Alex Jones,
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:43.280]  you've not been told what to think or do,
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:45.880]  you've actually been here and seen it for yourself.
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:46.720]  Exactly.
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:49.120]  And again, it comes down to just me wanting to go express
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:50.080]  my first amendment, right?
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:54.200]  And I challenge anybody, any American to go and do this,
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:56.120]  just so they can experience for themselves
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:58.000]  just how far we've come as a country
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.160]  where you can't even go express your own first amendment
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:02.160]  right on the streets of America
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:03.920]  without being violently attacked.
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:06.720]  We have groups, we have BLM, we have Antifa
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:07.920]  that think they run these streets.
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:10.120]  We have communist organizations and artists
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:12.320]  that are infiltrating our country
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:14.640]  that are taking over the Democratic mayors and governors
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:17.560]  that have all been exposed with all of this COVID nonsense,
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:21.520]  with all of this lockdown, with being pro BLM protests
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:25.920]  and anti-lockdown protests, it's so hypocritical
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:28.000]  and people are really starting to wake up now.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.880]  The average person who was not involved in politics
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:32.920]  is now realizing how corrupt everything is
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:35.680]  and how much our government has been infiltrated
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:36.520]  by these-
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:39.000]  Oh, all my wife's friends aren't super liberals,
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:39.840]  but they're liberals.
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:42.320]  They all hate the New World Order now, hate the lockdown.
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:43.920]  They're telling me about George Soros.
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:46.240]  I run into random women and men who don't know who I am.
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:48.760]  They're asking me if I know about the pedophile rings.
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:50.720]  I mean, the globalists have screwed the pooch.
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:53.400]  So I get it, oh, and you're in the middle of this all day,
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:54.840]  like I am, so you get pissed.
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:56.200]  You gotta understand that-
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:00.800]  No, no, let me tell you, they've really screwed themselves.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:01.800]  Let me kind of clarify,
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:04.840]  because I'm gonna respond to what Savannah said with my,
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:06.240]  if you wanna say pessimism or whatever.
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:08.240]  It's not pessimism, it's that there's this whole-
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.360]  This is too damn dangerous to let this go any further.
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.080]  And there's this whole notion that people have
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:15.160]  that someone else is gonna fight the fight for them
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:16.960]  or someone else is gonna take care of the problem.
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:17.800]  And someone else-
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:19.400]  No, you have to do it, man.
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:20.480]  You have to do it.
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:21.840]  And again, that's not anti-Trump.
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:23.040]  Trump is our Michael Jordan.
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:26.760]  If Jordan misses 32 shots, he's still taking the last shot.
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:27.800]  He's still the best player.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:28.640]  That's Trump.
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.760]  So he's gonna have the ball in his hand at the end of the game.
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:32.600]  But if you're not there to set the screen,
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:34.400]  if you're not there to pass him the ball,
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:36.360]  if you're not there on the floor,
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:37.920]  then he's a man on his own.
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:38.760]  They're gonna-
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:40.200]  Exactly, quit thinking that Trump,
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:42.400]  Michael Jordan can win the basketball game.
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:43.880]  He can't do it alone.
[1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:45.160]  People have to get active.
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.120]  They need to realize you're in the fight for this country.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:48.040]  You listening to this.
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:48.880]  Right back.
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:53.240]  I am cutting this breaking announcement on July 9th.
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.600]  By Monday, we will have to end
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.360]  the biggest sale yet of the year.
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:59.920]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:02.560]  This is July 4th, sale, the tail end of it,
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:05.280]  and all of the high quality products that were sold out
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:07.600]  have been back in stock and were available again.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.640]  But some of these are in limited numbers.
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:10.480]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.200]  not just Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points,
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.600]  but we have DNA Force Plus back in stock, 50% off.
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:17.720]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and K.

[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:31.880]  Now, back in stock with double Patriot points
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:32.680]  and free shipping.
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:35.040]  All of these, storeable food available again,
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:36.000]  ships three to four weeks.

[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:48.800]  and thank you all for your support.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.880]  The bad news is, Western governments
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:53.440]  have totally let multinational big tech
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:55.760]  bring in Communist Chinese style
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:59.120]  total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:01.320]  The good news is, they had to do that
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:04.520]  to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:08.640]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for,
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:11.600]  because the truth is powerful and we'll defeat them
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:12.880]  and we'll smash them.
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:15.200]  And the good news is, there's still sites like,
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:20.200]  band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:22.440]  Paul Watson sites, summit.news,
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:23.760]  and a lot of other great sites
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:25.400]  that are getting massive traffic.
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.320]  Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king,
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:34.320]  that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:36.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality,
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:39.400]  a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:42.640]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:44.840]  and standing up to it and speaking out against it,
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:45.840]  we'll defeat it.
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:48.480]  So take action or be slaves.
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  The sners are saying what I was privately saying
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:54.920]  to the crew last night.
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:57.280]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:38:58.640]  in info wars history,
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:00.960]  but one of the biggest stories period.
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:05.920]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:10.080]  have created a system where anyone that has the sore throat
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:13.280]  or a runny nose or who has been in contact
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:17.200]  with someone COVID-19 is then added into the database
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:20.600]  as having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19.
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:22.480]  It's in the NIH documents.
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:23.400]  It's at the state level.
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:24.480]  We confirmed it in Texas.
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:25.400]  We're not confirming.
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.360]  It's in other states.
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.040]  This is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:32.720]  that died on shot wounds and stuff in the COVID column
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:34.600]  and the false positive tests.
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:35.440]  That's all huge.
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:40.160]  This is beyond that mega criminal activity.
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:42.520]  And we've got these different county commission videos
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.160]  where they're just freaking out over it,
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:46.000]  saying what in the world is this?
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.920]  The full video is posted at band.video.
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:49.640]  Get it out and expose the hoax.
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:54.880]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:59.240]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:04.080]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:08.840]  to date, super male vitality, specifically designed
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.360]  to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:16.080]  to create superior vitality in males.
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.120]  Now look, this unique formula
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:21.160]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:24.440]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:27.280]  and no unwanted additives.
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:28.120]  Yes.
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:30.040]  We're talking about ancient wisdom
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:32.840]  combined with modern technology.
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:36.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.720]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:40.840]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:42.680]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:45.320]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:41:01.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:21.320]  This is a few weeks ago when Savannah got attacked.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:24.320]  She peacefully held up a sign saying police lives matter
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:26.320]  in the name of a black police officer who was killed.
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:28.320]  We'll play the latest attack coming up.
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:31.320]  He's stressing to me.
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.320]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:38.320]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:40.320]  I need you to stop.
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  Look at me, look at me.
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.320]  We can't have.
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.320]  Can't have the, can't not do this.
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:50.320]  I'm trying to stop.
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:42:03.700]  That happened a few weeks ago, and people on radio that can't see it got millions of
[1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:05.680]  views on Twitter and everywhere.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.140]  She hits you, you elbow her, she runs over and starts crying to one of the six foot five
[1:42:10.140 --> 1:42:11.140]  trainees.
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:15.640]  Yeah, you know, they want to hit you and they want to be violent, but when you push back,
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:16.880]  they don't know how to handle it.
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:20.280]  You look extremely shocked and my favorite part is right here where she just like bows
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.640]  her head down because she's so upset and she cried for five minutes after that, after
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:28.880]  that shoulder check because, and again, that was me defending myself after being attacked
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:30.800]  by this woman for over an hour.
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:31.800]  Well, they're larking.
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.280]  They think they're playing Fortnite.
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:34.280]  This isn't Fortnite.
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:35.280]  Exactly.
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:39.880]  And again, too, like these people, that's the thing, Alex, they want, they want a war.
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:45.440]  So they say they want to take over, they want to, to have total control.
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:50.400]  But when push comes to shove and they attack you and you fight back, they don't know how
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:51.400]  to handle it.
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:55.400]  And the first people they call are the same ones they're calling to defund right now.
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:56.720]  And here's how the illusion works.
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:00.400]  I'm going to go and take a look before we play your next video.
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:04.400]  All these big corporations capitulate to the most ridiculous stuff like, oh, we'll stop
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:09.800]  having chess games and saying, white knight takes black Rook or whatever.
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:12.920]  They're saying all of this to create a gaslighting event.
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.640]  They admit it, so all the big corporations say, oh, we're going to play at the start
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:21.280]  of the NFL, the black national anthem and all this to divide the country.
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:22.280]  People say this is crazy.
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.280]  Yeah.
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:24.280]  It's on purpose.
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:25.280]  It's the big money.
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:26.280]  It's the foreign countries.
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:27.800]  This is attack on the nation.
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:32.840]  And it's so obvious, but people see the peer pressure and they think, if I just bow again,
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:37.800]  again, again, like the Chick-fil-A owner is now disgraced himself and says, now you need
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:40.200]  to get down and polish black people's shoes.
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:43.080]  As if the idea that you're white, you're bad.
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:44.080]  That's racism.
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:47.200]  Imagine if somebody said blacks should get down and polish somebody's shoes.
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:48.200]  It's insane.
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:49.200]  Owen?
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:52.880]  Well, I haven't had a Chick-fil-A sandwich since I probably won't.
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:56.800]  Same thing goes for this other local restaurant that makes me wear a mask when I'm standing
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:43:57.800]  outside.
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:43:58.800]  Okay.
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:43:59.800]  I'm never, like you said, like I'm never shopping here again.
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.240]  If you want to kill your business that way, then so be it.
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:04.040]  That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:10.040]  But you know, when it comes to these protesters out on the streets, you know, it's weird because
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:15.360]  you can say there's enemies of freedom, but that's not to me the correct psychological
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:18.960]  approach because I don't sit here and see them as my enemy.
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:20.760]  I don't see them as an enemy of freedom.
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:24.320]  I think if you ask them, they want to be free too, just like anybody else.
[1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:28.600]  But what they've become unwittingly is obstacles of freedom.
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.880]  They have become obstacles of freedom.
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:36.840]  And as soon as Americans in mass are willing to fight for their freedom, like you said,
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:38.240]  Alex, it's a trap.
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:39.800]  You're now an obstacle.
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:41.600]  You're going to get run over.
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:45.080]  Use the cars running these people over in the streets as a physical example.
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:46.840]  Now, and Alex, we were talking off air.
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:52.120]  The problem is they've got the whole left wing activists in control of all the justice.
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:56.680]  So, you know, 10,000 people can be surrounding your vehicle, threatening to kill you, smashing
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:58.040]  the windows and everything.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:00.680]  And if you plow, if you plow through it, you're the bad guy.
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:01.680]  That's right.
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:02.680]  They got the corporations.
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:03.680]  They got the judges.
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:04.680]  They got the media.
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:07.480]  Now, all over the place, Black Lives Matter can beat people up, kill them.
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:10.840]  But if somebody fights back now, they're being charged everywhere.
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:15.120]  And the judges are proud of it because they're all a bunch of scum that were put in power
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:18.680]  because the system picked them because they were followers.
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:20.680]  This is ruled by followers.
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.480]  There are three instances right now.
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:27.600]  Someone painted over a Black Lives Matter in the street facing hate crime charges.
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:32.400]  Somebody painted white lives matter in the street facing hate crime charges.
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.280]  Somebody, this is the craziest thing.
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.720]  Somebody drove over, they put a pride flag on the road.
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:39.240]  Somebody literally just drove over it.
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:41.000]  They're investigating it for a hate crime.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.640]  And they said that they'd burn out on it.
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:45.360]  You can look, it's not even a burnout, it's a tiny black mark.
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:49.840]  Imagine you write something on the street and then, but I know it's on Twitter, it shows
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:52.000]  the cops celebrating it, standing on it.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.520]  And so now they're saying, oh, you disrespect it is that way.
[1:45:54.520 --> 1:45:58.360]  You know, they were out there worshiping the LGBTP system.
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:01.160]  I mean, Alex, let's be honest.
[1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:02.160]  That's no burnout.
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:04.760]  You know, you know what a burnout looks like.
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:05.760]  That's not a burnout.
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:10.520]  But I hope somebody burns out on it because it's in your face thing that they continue
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:12.720]  to push everywhere.
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:17.960]  So but that's the point is, oh, you drove over and left a mark on a pride flag.
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:18.960]  We're investigating you for hate crimes.
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.440]  Let's go back to that Twitter account.
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:21.440]  Look at this.
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:26.360]  They say investigators would like to speak with the driver responsible for defacing a
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:32.520]  recently installed pride crosswalk at 16th Street and it goes on now if you scroll down,
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:36.560]  people go, hey, wait a minute, you're standing on the symbol of royalty and power.
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:41.640]  This is nothing but the globalist party, the Democratic Party saying we own you, we run
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:42.640]  you.
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:45.480]  They're painting Black Lives Matter on the street officially in front of Trump Tower
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:47.360]  as if Trump's done something wrong.
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:50.360]  Again, this is just all about their virtue signaling Savannah.
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:54.160]  Alex, and I don't know if you saw this story as well, but somebody had hacked into one
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:58.680]  of the like digital traffic signs on the side and they put All Lives Matter, they're investigating
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:46:59.680]  that as well.
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:04.160]  And it's ridiculous because again, I'm so tired that Black Lives Matter, which again
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:09.840]  is a Marxist organization is allowed to paint their slogan across our cities all across
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:10.840]  America.
[1:47:10.840 --> 1:47:18.920]  And also it's okay for you to burn the American flag, but if you stand on a rainbow crosswalk
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:24.440]  that's a hate crime, it's ridiculous and we need to take back our streets, okay?
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:28.320]  Because again, and I always say this, Black Lives Matter and Antifa think they own the
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:29.320]  streets.
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:32.960]  You guys just talked about how they also own all these justices and everyone else.
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.320]  We need to start breaking the narrative that everyone's going to bow down to this because
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:37.880]  right now that's what it looks like.
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.880]  Conservatives are not standing up for their first time in their life.
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:40.880]  That's right.
[1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:41.880]  They think bowing makes it go away.
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:42.880]  Exactly.
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.880]  So that's why we've reached this point.
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.920]  These people got charged that nobody, you know, stands up for America anymore.
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:55.000]  And again, too, Alex, that's why I wanted to go out as well and stand up because I knew
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.440]  I was going to get attacked.
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:01.360]  And that's the point I wanted to make too, is that why in America in 2020 can a minority
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:07.200]  woman, female not stand peacefully with the sign without being attacked by a mob of crazy
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  Antifa leftists.
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:10.000]  By the way, it was mainly white dudes.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  That was hard.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:12.920]  It's always white people.
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:16.080]  It's always white people, Alex, or Hispanic people.
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.400]  Like honestly, too, with these Black Lives Matter protests, it's like white people and
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:20.400]  Hispanic people.
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:24.400]  Like it's usually the black people that will come and talk with me, but they're not attacking
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:25.400]  me.
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:26.400]  And it's ridiculous.
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:30.720]  We've gone so far as a country and I'm so done with this white dude.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:33.760]  He's like a foot and a half taller than you and he's bumping you with his elbow.
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:34.760]  Yep.
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:35.760]  He's lucky.
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:36.760]  I wanted to knock him upside the head.
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  I want to be clear.
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:38.760]  I was told not to.
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:39.760]  No, I understand.
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  I understand.
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:41.760]  No, you were scared of him.
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:42.760]  I'm joking.
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:45.840]  I know this for radio listeners, but this is you in front of the police station trying
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.800]  to say Black Lives Matter and with the name of the police officer captain that was brutally
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  murdered, who was black.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:52.800]  Here it is.
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:53.800]  Let's roll the audio.
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:49:01.800]  And you try to get away from him, too, you're not.
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:04.920]  And remember, Alex, I planned this rally because I went to the other one and they attacked
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  me because they said I was at there.
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:08.800]  So I planned to score myself outside of them.
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:09.800]  And then they show up.
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:10.800]  Yes.
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  And then look what happens.
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:12.800]  I was surrounded.
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:18.800]  I should have said that right up front that you planned the rally.
[1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:21.800]  Police lives matter if you folks showed up.
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:31.800]  I guess I need to be part of this.
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  We should announce like a week ahead, you have like a thousand people out there.
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:39.280]  Alex, these people do not own these streets anymore and that's why I wanted to come sign
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:40.560]  up because of my first video.
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:41.840]  I did not fight back.
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:45.160]  I sat there and I kept letting that girl attack me, but this time no.
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:48.400]  And that's why I wanted to stand on this street corner and say that I have a right to stand
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:49.400]  here.
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:50.400]  I have a right to be here.
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:52.120]  These people do not own APD.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:53.800]  They do not own these city streets.
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:55.120]  They don't own City Hall.
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:56.560]  They don't own America.
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.600]  They don't own this country.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:49:59.600]  We do.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  Americans do.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:01.600]  So stand up.
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:03.480]  Get off your ass and get off of Twitter.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:08.320]  You know what is interesting about this event though, Alex and I think Savannah and the
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:11.360]  other people that were there, some of the crew members would agree, Savannah was kind
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.840]  of hinting at this.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:16.280]  The black people that showed up that were just genuinely there because they're against
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:20.520]  police brutality or oppression or whatever and you know, are kind of open minded.
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:22.440]  I had some legitimate conversations with some of them.
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.640]  In fact, one of them has agreed to come on the war room next week, but it's these white
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:29.040]  Antifa people who are clearly trained.
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:30.520]  Oh, they're trained communists.
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:31.520]  Clearly.
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:32.680]  And here's how you can identify them.
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:34.800]  They all wear helmets.
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:36.280]  They all wear these damn helmets.
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:37.760]  And in fact, I went back and I reviewed.
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:41.440]  They wear black helmets and black masks because they don't be able to know they're white.
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:44.400]  And I think that I really think that these are these are college professors.
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:45.400]  Oh, they are.
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:46.400]  These are college professors.
[1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:50.720]  These are these are UT student teachers, assistants and college professors.
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:51.720]  That's why they are.
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:52.880]  We find every time they get arrested, they are.
[1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:55.200]  And so that's what and then.
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.400]  So it's like they ruin the actual black lives matter, whether or not you agree with it or
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:01.400]  not.
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:03.200]  Because it's all for us.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:04.200]  They're in control.
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:05.200]  Yeah.
[1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:07.600]  It's these crazy, you know, it is these crazy ass white people.
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:08.600]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:09.600]  We're going to go to break.
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  Well, they're left.
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:11.600]  This has been brainwashed.
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:12.600]  They're told they're about to rule.
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:13.600]  This is their political takeover.
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:14.600]  And they know damn what they're doing.
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:17.600]  We're going to break 50 more minutes with these guys at Dan Lyman's back in studio with
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:18.600]  big breaking news.
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:20.800]  A lot of other big stuff breaking to hear today.
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:25.720]  Please don't forget, statewide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:29.440]  Right now the fourth of July special has to end by Sunday and a lot of these items won't
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:32.360]  be back in for a while because the supply chain is breaking down.
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:39.160]  So get your X2, get your X3, your vitamin mineral fusion, get your winter sun now.
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:43.040]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I
[1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:45.720]  was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:52.240]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese walking
[1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:56.680]  down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me and here I am parked a truck with the
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:52:02.160]  windows up and the woman stops and points at me so they stop and they wait while I'm
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:07.000]  inside my truck, truck started and they sit there and stretch and she keeps pointing and
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:12.960]  they put their hands out like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:14.760]  inside my car.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:18.560]  And so then I just sat there so they acted angry and walked past me.
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:24.160]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:28.680]  This is mental illness, people are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:31.560]  This is all cold programming, this is all about submitting.
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:35.800]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing, it's all a giant fraud.
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:39.960]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:46.440]  I must end this special, our extended July 4 special by Monday the 12th.
[1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:48.960]  That is our drop dead date.
[1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:53.200]  It absolutely has to happen because a lot of these products that have been sold out,
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:57.880]  we can only get limited supplies of them because the supply chain is breaking down.
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:53:03.080]  Inner sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K sold out for months back in stock 50% off.
[1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:08.560]  Ultra 12 high quality B12 taking over the tongue sold out for months back in stock 50% off.
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:12.440]  Bodies are ultimate turmeric formula, super strong turmeric concentration sold out for
[1:53:12.440 --> 1:53:17.600]  months back in stock, limited amount, 50% off, double patriot points, free shipping.
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:23.600]  It's the same thing with vitamin mineral fusion, survival shield X3 and so much more.
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:25.320]  And it funds the information war.
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:28.080]  The globalists want you sick and weak and dumbed down.
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:30.880]  They don't want you to know what God has given us all through Mother Nature.
[1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:32.280]  These products are powerful.
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:34.360]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them and loved them.
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:35.360]  Many of you haven't.
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:50.040]  The sale ends just a few days, so take action now and get free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:52.000]  It's all meant to be insane.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:56.840]  Everything the globalist does is about to make us shut down and just give in to them.
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:59.040]  Look at some of these headlines.
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:06.280]  Supreme Court nearly half of Oklahoma is given to an Indian reservation for a pedophile.
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:09.280]  Yes, you can't make that up.
[1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:13.280]  Gasoline Maxwell made to wear paper clothes due to suicide risk.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:14.280]  Privacy alert.
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:17.040]  Your iPhone is quietly tracking everything you do everywhere you go.
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:19.880]  That's Fox News telling us that.
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:24.040]  Oh, and then there's a Wall Street Journal article by the same people telling us that
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:27.000]  everything we do psychologically is being watched by the phone.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:28.680]  It's all coming out.
[1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:32.440]  Everything we talked about before, they didn't want people to resist then.
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:35.560]  They didn't want opinions formed against it before it was rolled out, but now they're
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  rolling it out.
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:41.320]  And now they're telling us pedophilia is good, world government's good, dying is good, having
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:43.400]  no rights is good.
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:45.200]  And everything has COVID right behind it.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:47.760]  So, oh, you can't have a protest because of COVID.
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:49.920]  Oh, you can't organize a group of people.
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:51.600]  You can't go to church because of COVID.
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:55.120]  Now you're going to be arrested or fine if you dare violate.
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.320]  So, you know, just, just accept it.
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:54:58.320]  Just accept it.
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:00.480]  By the way, we have this video, right?
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:02.040]  I meant to play at the start of the show.
[1:55:02.040 --> 1:55:08.080]  DeBlasio says BLM protesters can continue while canceling all other large events and
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:10.800]  use the same thing they all use, apples and oranges.
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:14.560]  So your church is an essential, but the BLM can continue.
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:15.800]  So everything else is shut down.
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:19.400]  But Democrats, they're saying we rule the streets, don't leave your house, but we rule
[1:55:19.400 --> 1:55:20.400]  the streets.
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:24.040]  And when we march, it fights COVID, literally two plus two equals 500.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:29.440]  Part of me almost wants them in a kind of diabolical war way to just shut everything
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.960]  down nationwide, just so conservatives can free up time to fight, fight back.
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:38.920]  Just so we could have a 10,000 rally strong in 50 cities, just like they have for George
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:39.920]  Floyd.
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:41.280]  Who, by the way, I mean, we barely even covered this.
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:42.440]  I mentioned it yesterday.
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:44.040]  The transcripts came out from George Floyd.
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:46.520]  He was already couldn't breathe and was asking to lay him on the ground.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:53.160]  He was foaming at the mouth, smashing his head against the cop vehicle on the inside,
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:54.680]  ranting and raving in the backseat.
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:59.400]  Like you said, then started coming down from his drug trip, excited to ask them to take
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:01.600]  him out of the vehicle and put them on the ground.
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:04.160]  Again, I don't, I don't, I'm not, I'm not glad George Floyd died.
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:05.160]  You know what?
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:06.160]  Maybe that cop does deserve some punishment.
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:07.160]  You can review it and decide.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:10.160]  I don't live in Minneapolis, but it's another Democrat city.
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:13.520]  They knew each other and all of this is the excuse for what they've done.
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:15.280]  It has nothing to do with black people.
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:18.000]  It's about bringing the country down, sinking the ship.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.320]  And they haven't stopped riding since they haven't stopped and they're, oh, they get
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:23.320]  carte blanche.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:28.400]  But oh, if you want to go out and even drive your car over a gay pride thing that's been
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:31.400]  painted on the road, well, we're going to investigate you for a hate crime.
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:33.920]  We're going to go watch the cameras and we're going to contact you and you're going to get
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:34.920]  in trouble.
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:36.160]  So this is the new world.
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.160]  This is the cult.
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:41.240]  Imagine if Scientologists painted their flag on the ground and you drove over it.
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:42.240]  They come after you.
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:43.960]  They don't arrest them all.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:44.960]  So what do we do?
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:45.960]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:47.320]  It's like, so I kind of want them to shut everything down.
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:50.840]  And then finally, maybe Trump supporters and conservatives, 10,000 strong per city will
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:51.840]  get out in the streets.
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:58.120]  It's like, if we all went out to Austin and 10,000 of us painted over the Austin black
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:00.360]  matters or whatever it is, what are they going to do?
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:01.360]  Arrest all of us.
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:05.040]  But you know, if one or two people did it, they'd say it was a hate crime.
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:09.520]  If one or two people did it, but if 10,000 people did it, what are they going to do?
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.800]  All I know is, is that this is pure crap because they claim Black Lives Matter.
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:17.760]  When the group doing it literally is founded to kill black people and their mission statement
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:19.160]  is no nuclear family.
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:20.160]  That'll kill everybody.
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:24.120]  And you know, Alex, I actually brought up that point to one of the BLM protesters the
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:25.840]  other night and he had no idea.
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.440]  I was like, he was like, well, who said that?
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:32.240]  And I said, the founders of Black Lives Matter, they, they're literally talking about dismantling
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:34.960]  the nuclear family, their pro-abortion.
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:37.200]  And their main mission is black trans men.
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:39.000]  That's black men getting their balls caught off.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.880]  The people who stand up for Black Lives Matter have no idea.
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:42.880]  They have no idea.
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:43.880]  I represent black people.
[1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:46.520]  I'm here to chop your balls off.
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:51.000]  And that's why when I was talking to them and I said, hey, here's what we should do.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:57.120]  End the war on drugs, release all nonviolent criminals tomorrow, and, and probably lower
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:59.000]  the drinking age, raise speed limits.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:02.360]  You need to cut interactions between citizens and police down.
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:04.400]  And they were kind of like, huh, that's a good solution.
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:07.720]  And have police target more white collar crime in the establishment.
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:13.600]  But no one ever suggests that nobody let's sterilize black boys.
[1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:14.960]  And then we really like blacks.
[1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:15.960]  Well, you know what?
[1:58:15.960 --> 1:58:18.440]  What that guy said over there was actually really accurate.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:19.440]  And I agree.
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:23.240]  But he's white and black people so much I want to abort them.
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:25.560]  And if they made it out of mama, cut their balls off.
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:29.240]  The Southern Poverty Law Center told me not to listen to that.
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:40.320]  Chop their balls, chop their balls, chop their balls, chop their balls, chop their balls.

[1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:24.600]  I
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:25.760]  completely agree, Alex.
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.960]  We've seen that in the exact, I mean, everything that's been going on for the past couple of
[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:33.960]  months and how they've weaponized the black community, used their own emotions against
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:34.960]  them.
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.200]  Now we're seeing all these rioting in the street, we're seeing more death in the black
[2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:43.320]  community as a response to all of this, and it's very sad to see.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:46.920]  So I wish people would really wake up to what's actually going on and how they're being used
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:52.680]  as pawns in society today to further push political agendas and further push these just
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:53.680]  bad ideas.
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:55.520]  We're mainly white people eating it till now.
[2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:59.320]  Now we have footage coming into New York of the church with black dudes going in threatened
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:00.320]  to beat everybody up.
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:03.680]  I mean, folks, you don't want to be lured into doing that.
[2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:04.680]  Exactly.
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:09.120]  And I think at the beginning of all of this, I just saw somebody say that Black Lives Matter
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:12.440]  is great at marketing because their organization looks like, you know, it's just about Black
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:13.440]  Lives Matter.
[2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:17.200]  But then again, if you really look into the organization as a whole, you research what
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:18.560]  they actually stand for.
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.120]  It's opposite of what the real black community actually stands for, because I've gone and
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:26.520]  I've talked to so many people that have been a part of this community, and they're like,
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:27.720]  what about the nuclear family?
[2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:31.880]  Like we all know that children that are raised in a one-parent household have higher rates
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:32.880]  of going on drugs.
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:36.520]  How did they get these black guys to go to a multi-racial church and threaten to kick
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:38.880]  people's asses and yell at people's little kids?
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:41.640]  I mean, I was surprised these guys did not get their asses beat bad.
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:42.640]  You know what?
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:45.160]  The answer to that is, Alex, it's very simple, and this happens all the time.
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:48.920]  It's the same reason why the Latino girls always attack Savannah.
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:54.680]  It's the same reason why some gay cross-dresser threatened to kill and rape Ashley St. Clair.
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:55.680]  It's the same reason.
[2:01:55.680 --> 2:01:57.240]  These people are jealous.
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:01.120]  They're jealous that that black family walked in there with a strong father figure, a strong
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:04.840]  mother figure, a son that dresses well and knows how to play a musical instrument and
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:05.840]  has a future.
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:06.840]  They're jealous.
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:07.840]  Well, that's it.
[2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:09.480]  If you looked at them whether they're black or white, they all look like rat-like mental
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.480]  patients.
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:14.040]  Like if I was going to cast for a movie about a mental patient, that would be them.
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:18.800]  Alex, not to be mean, but the people on the streets, they are the people who are obese,
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:23.400]  who don't take showers, who just, their overall quality of life does not look good, and you
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:24.400]  can see it reflected.
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:26.560]  And they're the type of people that just keep buying lottery tickets.
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:30.560]  They think, finally, the media's on my side, if I go do this, I'll be a hero.
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:31.560]  No.
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:32.560]  You're an idiot.
[2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:33.560]  Exactly.
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:34.560]  They think they're making a change.
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:36.960]  They think they're leading this revolution when, in reality, they're doing nothing.
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:40.400]  They can't even stand up for themselves, which is why they have to come mob one person
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:43.240]  in a group of 10 because they can't stand individually.
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:44.920]  They don't even know what they stand for.
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:45.920]  That's right.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:46.920]  All right.
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:47.920]  Now, here we go.
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:48.920]  Here's a video.
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:49.920]  It's up on infowords.com.
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:53.880]  It says BLM protest can continue while canceling all other large events.
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:58.560]  So literally, party members of the Democratic Party, they run it, they get the money.
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:03.560]  Our party is allowed to be on the streets, but Christian groups, conservative groups,
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:10.480]  libertarian groups, no one else, Jewish groups, I will arrest you because BLM is important.
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:11.480]  You're not.
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:12.480]  He's saying you are not essential.
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:14.960]  And he says, oh, we got a few religious leaders that agree with me.
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:18.040]  To have one religious leader agrees, all of you have no rights.
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:19.680]  Here it is.
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:25.200]  Outdoor concerts and it means things like parades, things that here in the city can mean not
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:29.200]  just thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.
[2:03:29.200 --> 2:03:30.960]  It's just not time for that now.
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:31.960]  What about protests?
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:35.400]  If people want to march down Fifth Avenue, are they going to be allowed to do so?
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:38.480]  Well, this is always an area of real sensitivity.
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:43.280]  If you're just talking about health, we would always say, hey, folks, stay home if you can.
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:47.720]  But we understand at this moment in history, people are talking about the need for historic
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:48.720]  changes.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:54.280]  I mean, today in New York City, recognizing the power and the meaning of the message Black
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:59.400]  Lives Matter, which we did in front of Trump Tower today, this is a historic moment of change.
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:05.240]  We have to respect that, but also say to people, the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:09.760]  parades, the fairs, we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:13.240]  And by the way, so they'll decide in the future, too, who can rally, who can demonstrate.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:16.560]  So if you want to have a Catholic parade, or you want to have a Protestant parade, or
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:20.360]  you want to have a parade for the military, that's not allowed, because that doesn't matter.
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:21.560]  That speech doesn't matter.
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:27.040]  This speech of the Democrats and Soros and Marxism and no nuclear family, it's so important.
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:28.040]  It does, Savannah.
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:29.040]  Exactly.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:32.880]  And, you know, they always try to say to, well, we can't impede on their first amendment
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:33.880]  right to protest.
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:37.080]  Well, what about our right to religion, our freedom to religion?
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.680]  How is that any different?
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:41.960]  So it's ridiculous that they're picking and choosing what canon cannot be done in the
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:42.960]  United States.
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:43.960]  It has a name.
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:44.960]  It's called Total Discrimination.
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  Exactly.
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:46.960]  Exactly.
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:47.960]  Owen.
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:51.160]  I just can't imagine the type of blackmail that de Blasio has on him with his top staffer
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:57.160]  that had all the child porn terabytes of child pornography, child rape, snuff films.
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:58.160]  We know about Wiener's laptop.
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:05:01.760]  By the way, I talked about that staffer on here before saying that guy looks like a pedophile.
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:04.920]  You know, all the stuff that was on Wiener's laptop, he was running out of New York.
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.680]  So does Wiener look like a pedophile?
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:12.120]  All the stuff that was in the safe at the Epstein Manor in New York.
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:14.200]  Of course, you've got the Nix of them sex cult.
[2:05:14.200 --> 2:05:16.200]  You've got Cuomo, the mass murderer.
[2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:18.400]  I mean, they're doing all this in public.
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:19.800]  They're doing all this right in front of your face.
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:23.040]  And you've got Cuomo with his, you know, both his nipples pierced on TV and his brother
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:24.040]  hit and run.
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:25.240]  These are sick criminals.
[2:05:25.240 --> 2:05:27.700]  And just think about the real dirt.
[2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:31.800]  Think about the real crimes these people are engaging in behind closed doors, that they're
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:35.240]  so bold that they're going to come out here and be so clearly.
[2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:39.600]  If you look at Wiener, that's the guy they have with the laptop with Hillary chopping
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:42.480]  up kids and stuff.
[2:05:42.480 --> 2:05:46.440]  And so, you know, part of it is Wiener agrees, though.
[2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:49.520]  He says, you know, you criticize him, use her to be arrested.
[2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:50.520]  He's God.
[2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:51.520]  And you know what?
[2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:56.880]  I think too that, and maybe this is the ultimate, you know, he's the special protege of Chuckie
[2:05:56.880 --> 2:05:57.880]  Schumer.
[2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:58.880]  What?
[2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:01.920]  No, Wiener was actually found by him, put in and run by him.
[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:05.680]  There's a Schumer was blackmailed years ago because he married a transsexual, but that's
[2:06:05.680 --> 2:06:07.400]  that's a separate story.
[2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:11.520]  I really think that the New York cops and the New York FBI that are good people but
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:15.480]  are actually going through the process of this, it's time to just release it.
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:16.480]  It's time to release.
[2:06:16.480 --> 2:06:17.480]  That's right.
[2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:18.800]  No more, no more wait around.
[2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:19.800]  The gloves are off.
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:21.200]  They broke all the rules.
[2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:22.200]  Just burn them.
[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:23.200]  Burn, burn, burn.
[2:06:23.200 --> 2:06:24.200]  We made a step.
[2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:25.200]  We're totally attacking.
[2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:26.200]  Burn, attack.
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:27.200]  Catch it.
[2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:28.200]  Yeah.
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:31.200]  Whether America can handle it or not, there's only one way to find out.
[2:06:31.200 --> 2:06:32.760]  Let's just, let's just get it going here.
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:33.760]  It's time.
[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:36.280]  It's time for people to know what, I mean, Trump knows about it.
[2:06:36.280 --> 2:06:39.680]  Trump jokes about how Hillary Clinton kidnaps all these children from Haiti and puts them
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:40.680]  into sex camps.
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:41.680]  They all know it.
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:43.000]  The AP came out.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:45.680]  The woman that got caught doing it runs Amber Alert.
[2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:46.680]  Laura Sillsby.
[2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:47.680]  Literally.
[2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:48.680]  She changed her name.
[2:06:48.680 --> 2:06:50.560]  Look at this.
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:53.200]  Fox employees has come here to stop building police vehicles.
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:55.320]  She had to build stuff.
[2:06:55.320 --> 2:06:56.320]  You got to get the permission.
[2:06:56.320 --> 2:06:59.720]  New Yorker's time petition to topple slave owner Washington statue, but not Muhammad who
[2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:04.560]  said slavery was good video vice president and Bob Lee says country stars because white
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:10.960]  people didn't teach them economics continuing Don Lemon batches Jesus says he was not good.
[2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:11.960]  Not perfect.
[2:07:11.960 --> 2:07:18.000]  Chicago Black Lives Matter mural painted over with all lives matter.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:21.120]  Bill de Blasio I'll start to paint Black Lives Matter on street in front of Trump Tower.
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:24.000]  So he leads demonstrations, but you can't have yours.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.360]  He literally says mine is valuable.
[2:07:26.360 --> 2:07:27.360]  Yours is not.
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:28.360]  And they have a name for that.
[2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:29.360]  Tyrant.
[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:30.360]  Like a pedophile.
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:31.360]  No social.
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:32.360]  This thing.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:33.360]  But you know what?
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:34.360]  Here's the.
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:35.360]  Here's the.
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:36.360]  Are they a Democrat?
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:37.360]  Give her like might be a redneck if you do this.
[2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:38.360]  Might be a.
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:39.360]  Might be a pedophile.
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:40.360]  You're a Democrat.
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:41.360]  Sorry.
[2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:42.360]  Go ahead.
[2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:43.360]  I just hope that people in New York realize how bad it is.
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:44.360]  And I know they do.
[2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  They I don't live in New York.
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:46.360]  I do.
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  I used to like going to visit New York.
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:49.160]  I don't know if New York City if I will anymore.
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:50.160]  No, it was.
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:51.160]  It was bad.
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:52.160]  Until Julianne got in.
[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:53.160]  He did clean it up.
[2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:54.160]  People.
[2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:58.600]  I mean, New York is falling apart at the seams trash everywhere.
[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:02.000]  Giant rotting carcass just all murders.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  I mean, literally people.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  I'm not even kidding.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.680]  People just walk around downtown and they walk by dead bodies bleeding out in the street
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:07.680]  from.
[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:09.440]  Middle patients are just running around.
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:10.440]  And but what is it?
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:11.440]  DeBlasio doing?
[2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:13.240]  Oh, he's painting a Black Lives Matter mural.
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:15.000]  Oh, that's going to save a life.
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:16.320]  That's going to save New York.
[2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:17.320]  Yeah.
[2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:18.320]  It's just the.
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:19.320]  Oh, yeah.
[2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:21.680]  Saying Black Lives Matter cares about black people.
[2:08:21.680 --> 2:08:22.680]  At least Sharpton.
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:26.160]  That's like saying that, uh, you know, Mother Teresa was a whore or something.
[2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:27.160]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:30.040]  Let's say this, everybody's just freaked out right now.
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:32.360]  This is actually a lot of this is a blessing.
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:36.640]  When it floods in New York or Boston or old cities like that or Chicago, you don't see
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:40.360]  a lot of rats until it floods and there's big storm coming.
[2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:43.640]  And when it floods, there's like rats everywhere.
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:46.960]  And that's what's happened is the Liberty Movement waking up the world.
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:48.920]  Populism is like a flood.
[2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:52.240]  And you're just seeing the rats that were already right there behind the walls coming
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:53.240]  out.
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:54.480]  So then our name is closing comments.
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:55.960]  You guys are got the war room coming up today.
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:08:56.960]  Don't you?
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:08:57.960]  Yeah.
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:08:58.960]  I got a special thing.
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:01.520]  Harrison will be hosting in studio, but I'll be, uh, let's just say I'll be on the site
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:02.520]  somewhere.
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:05.640]  And we never got to your city council, uh, yes.
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:08.080]  And if you guys want to roll this is about a two minute video.
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:11.040]  But basically, uh, and we provided all the documentation.
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:12.440]  The mask mandate is false.
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:13.520]  The shutdown is false.
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:14.760]  The cases are false.
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:16.560]  And I told the whole city council this they don't care.
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:17.560]  They just want to oppress us.
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  Let's try.
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:19.560]  Okay.
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:20.560]  We're going to play that when we come back.
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:21.560]  They'll be gone.
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:24.720]  But we'll have Dan Lyman with huge breaking news in the studio with us and it's Dan coming
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:25.720]  back on your show.
[2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:28.320]  Yeah, he'll, I believe he'll be on, like I said, I'm not in studio today.
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:29.320]  Harrison is.
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:30.320]  I'm going to be on site.
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:31.320]  I got a little surprise today.
[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:32.320]  I think you'll like.
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  All right.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:34.320]  Stay with us.
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:35.320]  Thanks, Savannah.
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:36.320]  We'll be right back.
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:37.320]  Thank you.
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:40.320]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:46.760]  shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:52.680]  master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:57.400]  large groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[2:09:57.400 --> 2:10:02.160]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:08.040]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:11.920]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you want it
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:12.920]  to.
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:16.680]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up.
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:21.240]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:22.240]  documents.
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:26.720]  The next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:29.840]  system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:33.640]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:35.760]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:40.760]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:43.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:46.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:49.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.760]  Where did it come from?
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:53.280]  In fourstore.com.
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:11:00.560]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:05.560]  So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa Pure water filtration
[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:06.560]  system.

[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:14.920]  great tasting water.
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.360]  Hmmm.
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:17.360]  Mmmmmm.
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:18.860]  Yummy in my tummy.
[2:11:18.860 --> 2:11:24.860]  Bring the purest, most refreshing water to your home by ordering the Alexa Pure Water
[2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:28.860]  filtration system today from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:11:32.860 --> 2:11:34.860]  Other systems just don't compare.
[2:11:34.860 --> 2:11:41.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:48.860 --> 2:11:53.860]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[2:11:53.860 --> 2:11:55.860]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:11:55.860 --> 2:12:01.860]  What about Owen Shroyer?
[2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:05.860]  When I call your name, don't forget to unmute.
[2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:07.860]  Owen Shroyer.
[2:12:07.860 --> 2:12:09.860]  Go ahead, you have two minutes.
[2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:13.860]  I hope you all are having fun playing Tyrants up here.
[2:12:13.860 --> 2:12:19.860]  The district guard that this city council has for eight persons is obvious and concerning.
[2:12:19.860 --> 2:12:25.860]  And this one of the authoritarian Mr. Astott and his totalitarian rhetoric is quite frankly offensive.
[2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:31.860]  But this mask mandate, which is not legal, first we're told by the serving general, not to wear masks.
[2:12:31.860 --> 2:12:33.860]  We're told by talking not to wear masks.
[2:12:33.860 --> 2:12:35.860]  We're told by the CDC not to wear masks.
[2:12:35.860 --> 2:12:36.860]  They even had this on their website.
[2:12:36.860 --> 2:12:37.860]  What happened to that?
[2:12:37.860 --> 2:12:39.860]  The mask does not even stop COVID.
[2:12:39.860 --> 2:12:41.860]  That's science.
[2:12:41.860 --> 2:12:43.860]  So why are you telling us to wear it?
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:47.860]  The box is that the masks come and say it does not stop COVID.
[2:12:47.860 --> 2:12:48.860]  Why are you telling us this?
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:52.860]  In fact, the mask has negative health effects.
[2:12:52.860 --> 2:12:54.860]  Bacteria grows on the mask.
[2:12:54.860 --> 2:12:59.860]  You breathe in toxic levels of carbon dioxide when you wear the mask.
[2:12:59.860 --> 2:13:03.860]  For the sake of time, I'll spare you the detail, but you can find this.
[2:13:03.860 --> 2:13:04.860]  It's out there.
[2:13:04.860 --> 2:13:05.860]  It's very well known.
[2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:09.860]  Now, first, when we had to sit down a month ago and stay home, what were we told?
[2:13:09.860 --> 2:13:11.860]  Oh, this is a deadly virus.
[2:13:11.860 --> 2:13:12.860]  We need to stay home.
[2:13:12.860 --> 2:13:18.860]  Now, we now know that it's less deadly by the numbers than the seasonal flu.
[2:13:18.860 --> 2:13:23.860]  And how is that earlier saying that we just ignore the mask?
[2:13:23.860 --> 2:13:24.860]  The mask doesn't matter.
[2:13:24.860 --> 2:13:26.860]  What is this, 1984?
[2:13:26.860 --> 2:13:28.860]  No, the mask does matter.
[2:13:28.860 --> 2:13:29.860]  This is not that deadly.
[2:13:29.860 --> 2:13:30.860]  The numbers are wrong.
[2:13:30.860 --> 2:13:32.860]  This is as bad as the seasonal flu.
[2:13:32.860 --> 2:13:36.860]  So everything we're talking about should be null and void right now.
[2:13:36.860 --> 2:13:41.860]  Should we be shutting down and treating life this way for the seasonal flu every year?
[2:13:41.860 --> 2:13:44.860]  Should we have been living wrong the whole time?
[2:13:44.860 --> 2:13:45.860]  Is this the new normal?
[2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:49.860]  And this whole thing about cases getting up, well, why are cases up?
[2:13:49.860 --> 2:13:51.860]  Because everyone's getting tested.
[2:13:51.860 --> 2:13:52.860]  This is common sense.
[2:13:52.860 --> 2:13:55.860]  You can test everyone in the city for herpes.
[2:13:55.860 --> 2:13:58.860]  And herpes cases will be going up as well.
[2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:02.860]  Would you have a national shutdown until people stop kissing and going out?
[2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:05.860]  And by the way, the tests are not even 100% accurate.
[2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:07.860]  That is also known.
[2:14:07.860 --> 2:14:12.860]  So who knows what the real reality are?
[2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:14.860]  Thank you very much, Mr. Shroyer.
[2:14:14.860 --> 2:14:17.860]  Why do the politicians all over the world love this big tech?
[2:14:17.860 --> 2:14:23.860]  Because you see the city council, but now Owen's not there at the meeting.
[2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:24.860]  Again, it's further dehumanization.
[2:14:24.860 --> 2:14:27.860]  But here's the CDC's own website.
[2:14:27.860 --> 2:14:32.860]  COVID-19 is no longer a epidemic.
[2:14:32.860 --> 2:14:35.860]  Because the death numbers statistically are not high enough for that.
[2:14:35.860 --> 2:14:40.860]  But everybody's testing positive because they've ramped up the testing massively.
[2:14:40.860 --> 2:14:43.860]  And that's why they're calling it the numbers are up, not the death.
[2:14:43.860 --> 2:14:47.860]  But as soon as the winter or the fall starts, you will get some real pneumonia,
[2:14:47.860 --> 2:14:49.860]  some real flu deaths, and they can put those in a column,
[2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:51.860]  and they'll use that to totally shut things down again.
[2:14:51.860 --> 2:14:53.860]  This is truly a psychological takeover.
[2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:56.860]  Dan Lyman is joining us here visiting from Switzerland,
[2:14:56.860 --> 2:14:59.860]  reporter for InfoWars via EuropeWars.com.
[2:14:59.860 --> 2:15:01.860]  Had a great interview yesterday.
[2:15:01.860 --> 2:15:04.860]  I wanted to spend time in this shorter segment of the time we have left,
[2:15:04.860 --> 2:15:08.860]  just in general, about your view of the world and the election,
[2:15:08.860 --> 2:15:12.860]  and just all the crazy communists running around and where all this is going.
[2:15:12.860 --> 2:15:16.860]  Yeah, it's amazing to watch it unfolding across the United States.
[2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:20.860]  Then also it's catching fire, so to speak, in Europe as well.
[2:15:20.860 --> 2:15:25.860]  And then also, of course, in Australia, it's just amazing the way that western civilization,
[2:15:25.860 --> 2:15:27.860]  the direction is headed in at this point.
[2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:30.860]  So I think things will, of course, they will only increase in intensity
[2:15:30.860 --> 2:15:32.860]  as we get closer to the election.
[2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:37.860]  And frankly, if Trump wins, I think they will continue to increase past that,
[2:15:37.860 --> 2:15:42.860]  and I shudder to think what would happen if Biden wins based on the program
[2:15:42.860 --> 2:15:45.860]  and the platform that he's putting out more and more increasingly
[2:15:45.860 --> 2:15:49.860]  and the people that are behind him, and how our patriots are going to react to that at that point.
[2:15:49.860 --> 2:15:52.860]  And I can say, Dan, is there a war on western civilization?
[2:15:52.860 --> 2:15:57.860]  Every UN, every globalist organization says they want to get rid of the western civilization,
[2:15:57.860 --> 2:16:01.860]  the nuclear family, that's just a human thing, and just everything that's good.
[2:16:01.860 --> 2:16:06.860]  It's an alien, evil agenda from studying history's roots.
[2:16:06.860 --> 2:16:08.860]  Where does it come from?
[2:16:08.860 --> 2:16:13.860]  As Owen and I were saying yesterday, at its root, of course, this is a spiritual battle.
[2:16:13.860 --> 2:16:16.860]  And I think a lot of people are starting to figure that out now
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:18.860]  because we're starting to see just how evil a lot of these people are.
[2:16:18.860 --> 2:16:21.860]  You watch these videos of Savannah and Owen getting...
[2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:23.860]  We're not cherry picking. I mean, they're almost all evil.
[2:16:23.860 --> 2:16:25.860]  Absolutely. And you can find them over and over.
[2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:28.860]  And you were touching on earlier the video of the people going into the church
[2:16:28.860 --> 2:16:31.860]  that are now being attacked by Black Lives Matter activists.
[2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:35.860]  So this is a spiritual battle that has manifested itself in the political and cultural war
[2:16:35.860 --> 2:16:37.860]  that we're seeing unfolding right now.
[2:16:37.860 --> 2:16:40.860]  Because when God goes out of the world, what comes in?
[2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:42.860]  Satanic behavior.
[2:16:42.860 --> 2:16:44.860]  And look at these people. Look how they're walking.
[2:16:44.860 --> 2:16:46.860]  The Black Lives Matter people, whether they be black or white,
[2:16:46.860 --> 2:16:50.860]  they literally walk like goblins or something.
[2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:53.860]  Yeah, as you always say, the light has gone out in their eyes.
[2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:57.860]  And you can see it. And you know, Owen and I were talking about this earlier yesterday as well.
[2:16:57.860 --> 2:17:04.860]  Increasingly, people are being identified that you're basically a dissident
[2:17:04.860 --> 2:17:09.860]  or a thought criminal by your behavior or your actions that you're not taking.
[2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:13.860]  So as time has gone on, you know, you've gone from being able to wear the MAGA hat
[2:17:13.860 --> 2:17:16.860]  to not because you're going to be attacked or an Info Wars t-shirt.
[2:17:16.860 --> 2:17:20.860]  You might be worried about that. So you stopped identifying yourself as a dissident
[2:17:20.860 --> 2:17:22.860]  or a patriot or a conservative.
[2:17:22.860 --> 2:17:25.860]  And now you can't just say, hey, all police aren't bad.
[2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:28.860]  Others are saying Ford can't sell vehicles to the police.
[2:17:28.860 --> 2:17:30.860]  What is a dominance over everything?
[2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:34.860]  Absolutely. And now, and you hear these stories now increasingly like the other day
[2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:36.860]  when they did on Instagram, everyone put up the black squares.
[2:17:36.860 --> 2:17:41.860]  You had a lot of stories coming out of people who were being pressured by their fellow students
[2:17:41.860 --> 2:17:45.860]  or colleagues that if they didn't put up the square, then they were getting harassed.
[2:17:45.860 --> 2:17:47.860]  So you can't even opt out of this.
[2:17:47.860 --> 2:17:50.860]  Oh, they're talking about kicking them out of high school, kicking them out of their job.
[2:17:50.860 --> 2:17:54.860]  Police officers, mothers are getting fired in Atlanta.
[2:17:54.860 --> 2:17:59.860]  I mean, I know a retired SWAT team officer, a nice guy from California.
[2:17:59.860 --> 2:18:01.860]  I'm trying to get him on the show about this.
[2:18:01.860 --> 2:18:05.860]  He does some security for us and he was a trainer at CrossFit here in Austin.
[2:18:05.860 --> 2:18:08.860]  And they said, oh, you were a police officer. You're fired.
[2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:12.860]  So just being, I mean, this is insanity, but the very same ribs will call the police.
[2:18:12.860 --> 2:18:16.860]  It's like a crazy virtue signal like, look, I did something.
[2:18:16.860 --> 2:18:19.860]  Right. And then as soon as something bad happens to them, they're calling the police
[2:18:19.860 --> 2:18:23.860]  or as soon as there's a skid mark on a rainbow crossing that the police are getting involved.
[2:18:23.860 --> 2:18:27.860]  So they really like the police when the police are doing their bidding, but they don't.
[2:18:27.860 --> 2:18:29.860]  Well, exactly. They won't control the police.
[2:18:29.860 --> 2:18:32.860]  So they're just crushing the police right now to make them roll over to their demands.
[2:18:32.860 --> 2:18:33.860]  Right. Absolutely.
[2:18:33.860 --> 2:18:34.860]  This is terrorism.
[2:18:34.860 --> 2:18:40.860]  Absolutely it is. It's terrorism on our society, on our civilization, and it's endless.
[2:18:40.860 --> 2:18:42.860]  It's like every day there's something new.
[2:18:42.860 --> 2:18:45.860]  You know, everyone thought it was crazy when Minneapolis said they were going to defund
[2:18:45.860 --> 2:18:48.860]  or, you know, basically dismantle their police department.
[2:18:48.860 --> 2:18:52.860]  And now it's being rolled out in basically every Democrat-controlled major city across America.
[2:18:52.860 --> 2:18:55.860]  And they're taking the police budget and putting it into SJW Army.
[2:18:55.860 --> 2:18:57.860]  So you're not getting rid of the police.
[2:18:57.860 --> 2:19:02.860]  You're getting a new special fourth branch of emergency EMS all over the country.
[2:19:02.860 --> 2:19:03.860]  Right. Exactly.
[2:19:03.860 --> 2:19:06.860]  And they are arrogant, crazy SJWs with guns.
[2:19:06.860 --> 2:19:07.860]  Definitely.
[2:19:07.860 --> 2:19:09.860]  That's not going to go well.
[2:19:09.860 --> 2:19:13.860]  And as we touched on yesterday, they're already building these civilian forces.
[2:19:13.860 --> 2:19:18.860]  In Spain, for instance, they have over 3,000 civilians there that are patrolling the beaches now,
[2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:19.860]  as we were saying yesterday.
[2:19:19.860 --> 2:19:22.860]  So we see they are building their own SJW.
[2:19:22.860 --> 2:19:23.860]  Well, this is a UN global formula.
[2:19:23.860 --> 2:19:27.860]  I mean, I've watched the UN hearings with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch five years ago,
[2:19:27.860 --> 2:19:31.860]  where they said we're going to have the domestic security force to deal with emergencies.
[2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:32.860]  It's going to deal with outbreaks.
[2:19:32.860 --> 2:19:35.860]  It's going to deal with influxes of migrants because the influxes are coming.
[2:19:35.860 --> 2:19:39.860]  There's going to be migrants everywhere because they're organizing them and bringing them here.
[2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:46.860]  Right. And they're going to be all protected by the attorneys at the ACLU and these SPLC attack dogs.
[2:19:46.860 --> 2:19:50.860]  Anyone who speaks out against this is going to be under attack for sure.
[2:19:50.860 --> 2:19:51.860]  It's so evil.
[2:19:51.860 --> 2:19:54.860]  It's hard to even just comprehend it.
[2:19:54.860 --> 2:19:55.860]  It really is.
[2:19:55.860 --> 2:19:56.860]  Every day is crazy.
[2:19:56.860 --> 2:19:58.860]  Crazier than the last.
[2:19:58.860 --> 2:20:02.860]  And of course, Don Lemon with his double speak, he said, no, it doesn't matter if it's mass shootings,
[2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:05.860]  the black on blacks 100 times, 1000 times the cops, we don't care.
[2:20:05.860 --> 2:20:08.860]  And we know that he knows better because Tucker's been pulling those clips.
[2:20:08.860 --> 2:20:12.860]  Everyone's been pulling them up from 2013, 2014, what Don Lemon was saying back then.
[2:20:12.860 --> 2:20:13.860]  We know he knows better.
[2:20:13.860 --> 2:20:16.860]  Here's the question with Don Lemon and this arrogant look in his eyes.
[2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:17.860]  Evil, evil.
[2:20:17.860 --> 2:20:18.860]  And all these folks.
[2:20:18.860 --> 2:20:20.860]  I mean, you're already on your knees.
[2:20:20.860 --> 2:20:21.860]  You're on your belly.
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:22.860]  How far are you going to get down to the New World Order?
[2:20:22.860 --> 2:20:24.860]  All these police departments bowing down.
[2:20:24.860 --> 2:20:27.860]  You really think when the globals take over, you're still getting your pension fund?
[2:20:27.860 --> 2:20:28.860]  You're idiots.
[2:20:28.860 --> 2:20:30.860]  And you have destroyed yourself along with us.
[2:20:30.860 --> 2:20:32.860]  It's time to stop bowing and stop groveling.
[2:20:34.860 --> 2:20:36.860]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:37.860]  You're on the air.
[2:20:37.860 --> 2:20:38.860]  Thanks for holding.
[2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:39.860]  I'm sure cancer.
[2:20:39.860 --> 2:20:40.860]  Thank you.
[2:20:40.860 --> 2:20:43.860]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[2:20:43.860 --> 2:20:46.860]  And it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[2:20:46.860 --> 2:20:48.860]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:49.860]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut.
[2:20:49.860 --> 2:20:51.860]  And I just want to plug in.
[2:20:51.860 --> 2:20:56.860]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[2:20:56.860 --> 2:20:59.860]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[2:20:59.860 --> 2:21:02.860]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[2:21:02.860 --> 2:21:07.860]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla.
[2:21:07.860 --> 2:21:10.860]  I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar.
[2:21:10.860 --> 2:21:12.860]  And I just want to thank you for that, man.
[2:21:12.860 --> 2:21:15.860]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term,
[2:21:15.860 --> 2:21:17.860]  high quality energy powder there is.
[2:21:17.860 --> 2:21:19.860]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[2:21:19.860 --> 2:21:22.860]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues.
[2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:25.860]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:29.860]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[2:21:29.860 --> 2:21:31.860]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[2:21:31.860 --> 2:21:32.860]  So that means a lot to me.
[2:21:32.860 --> 2:21:33.860]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:34.860]  We love you.
[2:21:34.860 --> 2:21:37.860]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one best seller.
[2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:43.860]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price
[2:21:43.860 --> 2:21:48.860]  because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[2:21:48.860 --> 2:21:51.860]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[2:21:51.860 --> 2:21:53.860]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:55.860]  They're getting great responses.
[2:21:55.860 --> 2:22:00.860]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does
[2:22:00.860 --> 2:22:02.860]  taken under the tongue where it's more absorbable.
[2:22:02.860 --> 2:22:06.860]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA,
[2:22:06.860 --> 2:22:10.860]  help the body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells,
[2:22:10.860 --> 2:22:13.860]  essential for proper nervous system function and so much more.
[2:22:13.860 --> 2:22:16.860]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything
[2:22:16.860 --> 2:22:21.860]  if you don't have the basics already in your body like vitamin B12.
[2:22:21.860 --> 2:22:24.860]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white,
[2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:26.860]  whether you live in Japan or the United States,
[2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:29.860]  Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.

[2:23:36.860 --> 2:23:39.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:50.860 --> 2:23:52.860]  Welcome to the year 2020.
[2:23:52.860 --> 2:23:58.860]  American Flags on the 4th of July are burned in every town in the city.
[2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:01.860]  And it's allowed under the First Amendment.
[2:24:01.860 --> 2:24:05.860]  But if you try to raise your flag and walk down the street,
[2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:07.860]  you'll get hit in the head with a brick.
[2:24:07.860 --> 2:24:09.860]  You don't have your free speech.
[2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:13.860]  And the police are so cowed, so trained to bow.
[2:24:13.860 --> 2:24:18.860]  The advantage of punches you in the face and you fight back, you'll go to jail.
[2:24:18.860 --> 2:24:21.860]  And these idiots actually think they're going to get ahead in life
[2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:23.860]  because they've had that appeasing for so long.
[2:24:23.860 --> 2:24:25.860]  They've had this appeasing, appeasing, appeasing, appeasing.
[2:24:25.860 --> 2:24:27.860]  But now we're going over the edge of the cliff.
[2:24:27.860 --> 2:24:32.860]  This is the moment where one more step of appeasement leads to destruction of the Republic.
[2:24:32.860 --> 2:24:36.860]  All right, I've got something really strong and powerful I'm going to hit with.
[2:24:36.860 --> 2:24:40.860]  Dan Lyman here of EuropeWars.com, because Europe's ahead of us a lot.
[2:24:40.860 --> 2:24:42.860]  You know, the fires and the death and the killing and the looting.
[2:24:42.860 --> 2:24:46.860]  And when he's been here two years ago in studio from EuropeWars.com,
[2:24:46.860 --> 2:24:49.860]  he said, I think in a couple of years it'll be in America this bad.
[2:24:49.860 --> 2:24:52.860]  Now we've reached what Europe has.
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:24:57.860]  Brought to you by the same UN, the same George Soros, the very same operation on record.
[2:24:57.860 --> 2:24:59.860]  We'll talk about it in a moment.
[2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:02.860]  We're not brought to you by George Soros, we're brought to you by you.
[2:25:02.860 --> 2:25:04.860]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:25:04.860 --> 2:25:10.860]  This is your last chance this weekend to get free shipping and double patriot points.
[2:25:10.860 --> 2:25:12.860]  Probably until Christmas.
[2:25:12.860 --> 2:25:16.860]  So probably the next time we have free shipping and double patriot points, that's a big deal.
[2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:19.860]  And then we also have out of mineral fusion back in stock,
[2:25:19.860 --> 2:25:23.860]  Vaso Beach, DNA Force, Winter Sun Plus, Ultra 12 bodies,
[2:25:23.860 --> 2:25:29.860]  and a lot of other great items that have been sold out back in stock at 50 to 60% off.
[2:25:29.860 --> 2:25:32.860]  And quite frankly, I've been so busy covering news and fighting the globalists.
[2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:37.860]  I've got to go over and look at our inventory and what we've got to even have a new sale
[2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:41.860]  because everybody's habituated to only buy stuff when we have a sale.
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:43.860]  And that's kept us on air, that's great.
[2:25:43.860 --> 2:25:51.860]  What happens when a third of the items, and I was in a meeting last two mornings on this for hours?
[2:25:51.860 --> 2:25:54.860]  Because I don't want to spend my time on getting product and marketing and funding ourselves.
[2:25:54.860 --> 2:25:57.860]  I want to stand on the air, promote the truth and fight back.
[2:25:57.860 --> 2:26:01.860]  But it's okay, revolutionaries always have to fund themselves when you're up against the mega banks
[2:26:01.860 --> 2:26:05.860]  and the media and foreign governments and the leftists and the universities.
[2:26:05.860 --> 2:26:08.860]  We're the underdog, America's the underdog, Trump's the underdog.
[2:26:08.860 --> 2:26:10.860]  Oh, they're the resistance, no, we're the resistance.
[2:26:10.860 --> 2:26:12.860]  The whole world's getting up against us, but it's okay.
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:16.860]  We're going to win again thanks to God and take an action and just so God bless you all.
[2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:21.860]  But this morning I sat there with horror because Tim finally got me a list of it,
[2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:23.860]  and I'm not putting him down, he's been busy.
[2:26:23.860 --> 2:26:29.860]  But nine items we used to be able to get, we just can't get because the proprietary patented items
[2:26:29.860 --> 2:26:33.860]  aren't being manufactured anymore because a lot of companies have shut down.
[2:26:33.860 --> 2:26:35.860]  And our business wasn't enough to keep them open.
[2:26:35.860 --> 2:26:37.860]  These are big national suppliers.
[2:26:37.860 --> 2:26:41.860]  We get good, made in America, high quality stuff, none of it comes from China.
[2:26:41.860 --> 2:26:43.860]  It's all source tested.
[2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:46.860]  And so if you can't get it anymore, we don't replace it with some crap.
[2:26:46.860 --> 2:26:49.860]  And under law too, you've got to reformulate if you change anything.
[2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:53.860]  So that's why I'll say plus if we ever reformulate, we always reformulate to make it better.
[2:26:53.860 --> 2:26:56.860]  But if you reformulate to make it not as good, it still has to be changed.
[2:26:56.860 --> 2:26:59.860]  And so I'm sitting here with horror watching the supply chain break down.
[2:26:59.860 --> 2:27:04.860]  You go to the grocery store and a lot of the items you used to like to get are out,
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:10.860]  or there's some new brand you never saw that's crappy because the old brands out of business folks
[2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:13.860]  and during this thing, it's like, oh, we're not out of business.
[2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:14.860]  We've been bought.
[2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:16.860]  And I go look at Berkshire Hathaway at Soros.
[2:27:16.860 --> 2:27:21.860]  So many companies we used to use have been bought by a consortium with Bill Gates,
[2:27:21.860 --> 2:27:23.860]  a consortium of the Royal Family of England.
[2:27:23.860 --> 2:27:25.860]  I mean, you go research.
[2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:29.860]  Well, oh, we don't want to make this supplement anymore because I'm smart.
[2:27:29.860 --> 2:27:30.860]  I've got like eight big manufacturers.
[2:27:30.860 --> 2:27:35.860]  We're down to like five now because a couple of times, like Lemrix Essentials,
[2:27:35.860 --> 2:27:37.860]  they said, oh, we got bought by a big company.
[2:27:37.860 --> 2:27:38.860]  They don't want to make your stuff anymore.
[2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:39.860]  They don't like you.
[2:27:39.860 --> 2:27:41.860]  So they say, go out and build your own company.
[2:27:41.860 --> 2:27:42.860]  Go out and make your own thing.
[2:27:42.860 --> 2:27:43.860]  That's where it is now.
[2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:44.860]  And I'm not a victim.
[2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:45.860]  I'm not complaining.
[2:27:45.860 --> 2:27:52.860]  I'm telling you, I'm involved at a corporate supply side level right down to marketing and delivery.
[2:27:52.860 --> 2:27:53.860]  The whole chain.
[2:27:53.860 --> 2:27:54.860]  We have to run it all.
[2:27:54.860 --> 2:27:56.860]  That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[2:27:56.860 --> 2:27:59.860]  And so I've gotten to see basically every level.
[2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:00.860]  Okay.
[2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:04.860]  Washington, Hollywood, marketing, corporate stuff.
[2:28:04.860 --> 2:28:06.860]  You name it.
[2:28:06.860 --> 2:28:08.860]  I've just, it's like cat's eye.
[2:28:08.860 --> 2:28:09.860]  I've just been, you know, that movie.
[2:28:09.860 --> 2:28:11.860]  I've seen a lot of wild stuff.
[2:28:11.860 --> 2:28:12.860]  Just God's put me there.
[2:28:12.860 --> 2:28:13.860]  Part of my training, I guess.
[2:28:13.860 --> 2:28:16.860]  And I'm telling you, we're already in a depression worldwide.
[2:28:16.860 --> 2:28:17.860]  They keep things locked down.
[2:28:17.860 --> 2:28:19.860]  It's going to shut down almost everything.
[2:28:19.860 --> 2:28:22.860]  And then the supply chain breaks down and then it's super bad.
[2:28:22.860 --> 2:28:25.860]  It took decades and decades to build us this level.
[2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:28.860]  So you better get your storeable foods while you still can.
[2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:31.860]  You better get your supplements while you still can because I'm telling you,
[2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:33.860]  it's just going to get crazier from here on out.
[2:28:33.860 --> 2:28:37.860]  We're going to make it through this, but it's going to take some major preparation and focus.
[2:28:37.860 --> 2:28:40.860]  And it's going to take keeping them full wars on the air.
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:41.860]  So thank you all for your support.
[2:28:41.860 --> 2:28:43.860]  But I would take action now and I would get storeable food.
[2:28:43.860 --> 2:28:45.860]  It's got three or four weeks for delivery during this quote.
[2:28:45.860 --> 2:28:47.860]  Well, it's going to get a lot worse, I believe.
[2:28:47.860 --> 2:28:48.860]  So take action now.
[2:28:48.860 --> 2:28:50.860]  And it helps us fund people like Dan Lyman do a great job,
[2:28:50.860 --> 2:28:53.860]  write reports with his crew every day in Europe.
[2:28:53.860 --> 2:28:54.860]  All right.
[2:28:54.860 --> 2:28:55.860]  And this is a shorter segment.
[2:28:55.860 --> 2:28:56.860]  I did a long plug.
[2:28:56.860 --> 2:28:57.860]  Sorry.
[2:28:57.860 --> 2:28:58.860]  We got you 15 minutes to the next hour.
[2:28:58.860 --> 2:29:02.860]  Dr. Nick Beckett takes over before I get into the censorship,
[2:29:02.860 --> 2:29:05.860]  you and takeover and the latest developments that are so huge with Facebook.
[2:29:05.860 --> 2:29:06.860]  Next segment.
[2:29:06.860 --> 2:29:08.860]  What are some of the other things on your radar?
[2:29:08.860 --> 2:29:10.860]  Well, a couple of things that are on my radar.
[2:29:10.860 --> 2:29:12.860]  First, I'm just going to touch on here.
[2:29:12.860 --> 2:29:13.860]  We'll go to Europe.
[2:29:13.860 --> 2:29:18.860]  And what I'm noticing, I think it goes along with the fact that these,
[2:29:18.860 --> 2:29:24.860]  actually all these new mask rules that are coming in place here in Austin and Michigan and Colorado,
[2:29:24.860 --> 2:29:26.860]  where they're getting even more aggressive with that.
[2:29:26.860 --> 2:29:32.860]  What I'm seeing is that California, you know, the expression is as California goes, so goes the nation.
[2:29:32.860 --> 2:29:41.860]  And I'm seeing that kind of, it seems like all other states and cities and municipalities are starting to kind of conform to the precedent that California has set.
[2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:51.860]  And I think we're also seeing that in Europe as well, where you have France and Spain really set the most draconian orders in terms of masks and lockdowns and all that.
[2:29:51.860 --> 2:29:56.860]  And there were other countries that kind of, they weren't prepared to go that far down the rabbit hole.
[2:29:56.860 --> 2:30:00.860]  Sweden did the lowest and they had the lowest level, same thing with where you live.
[2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:01.860]  Right.
[2:30:01.860 --> 2:30:02.860]  Exactly.
[2:30:02.860 --> 2:30:10.860]  And you've seen the amount of pressure that has been put on Sweden to conform to that and to, you know, they've been demonized as the place that we're always going to be the worst and then the death rate to be the worst.
[2:30:10.860 --> 2:30:11.860]  And obviously that's not what happened.
[2:30:11.860 --> 2:30:17.860]  But one of the things that I'm seeing that's interesting is, for instance, in Switzerland, we never had a mask mandate.
[2:30:17.860 --> 2:30:19.860]  So you could come and go as you please if you wanted to wear one.
[2:30:19.860 --> 2:30:24.860]  There were plenty of people that did, of course, but you never had to, even into going to grocery stores.
[2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:29.860]  The only thing that they mandated was when you were to get a haircut in this salon.
[2:30:29.860 --> 2:30:36.860]  But now on Monday, this past Monday, they just introduced that you're going to have to wear one now on all public transportation.
[2:30:36.860 --> 2:30:40.860]  You're also going to have to wear it on all flights, which is all brand new.
[2:30:40.860 --> 2:30:46.860]  So Switzerland kind of held out for a while and I get the sense that the pressure has been on for them to start imposing mask mandates.
[2:30:46.860 --> 2:30:51.860]  And now what we're seeing is in also in Denmark where they actually were even more liberal about the whole thing.
[2:30:51.860 --> 2:30:56.860]  They even reduce the social distancing from two meters down to one.
[2:30:56.860 --> 2:30:59.860]  So it kind of makes you think, where did they come up with these numbers?
[2:30:59.860 --> 2:31:00.860]  It's all BS.
[2:31:00.860 --> 2:31:01.860]  It's all BS.
[2:31:01.860 --> 2:31:08.860]  However, they also never mandated masks and now they're starting to actually impose some mask suggestions now.
[2:31:08.860 --> 2:31:11.860]  And of course, we can see where that slippery slope leads, of course.
[2:31:11.860 --> 2:31:14.860]  It's all you and Ron and it's never going to end if we submit.
[2:31:14.860 --> 2:31:15.860]  It only gets tighter.
[2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:17.860]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[2:31:17.860 --> 2:31:22.860]  And then another along those same lines, in terms of the gaslighting and the propaganda that's trying,
[2:31:22.860 --> 2:31:27.860]  we're using to convince us that Black Lives Matter protests help slow the spread of coronavirus.
[2:31:27.860 --> 2:31:33.860]  Another one is today that they've come out with a new study from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden,
[2:31:33.860 --> 2:31:38.860]  saying that isolation made the Swedish elderly feel better, not worse.
[2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:43.860]  So they're claiming now that people's mental health that were kind of been isolated either.
[2:31:43.860 --> 2:31:47.860]  And 26 million Black Lives Matter marchers helped knock down COVID-19.
[2:31:47.860 --> 2:31:48.860]  Right, exactly.
[2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:49.860]  And two plus two equals one.
[2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:53.860]  Right, and war is peace and slavery is freedom.
[2:31:53.860 --> 2:31:58.860]  So, yeah, they're putting out now studies now saying that older folks benefited from being in isolation,
[2:31:58.860 --> 2:32:02.860]  that they're happy, they're not worrying about their finances, that they're not worried about getting ill.
[2:32:02.860 --> 2:32:04.860]  I think we know that that's certainly not the case.
[2:32:04.860 --> 2:32:07.860]  Unbelievable next level line.
[2:32:07.860 --> 2:32:09.860]  It never ends, never ends.
[2:32:09.860 --> 2:32:14.860]  Well, Austin quietly passed a resolution that we're staying locked down until December 31st.
[2:32:14.860 --> 2:32:18.860]  That's just hidden in the article about $2,000 fines for not wearing a mask.
[2:32:18.860 --> 2:32:19.860]  Unbelievable.
[2:32:19.860 --> 2:32:24.860]  And in Michigan, the governor there just today announced that they're doing $500 fines for masks and that's statewide.
[2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:26.860]  So if you don't abide by the mask law.
[2:32:26.860 --> 2:32:32.860]  And this is the crazy woman that again ordered people that did have the flu, did have COVID, did have pneumonia into nursing homes.
[2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:39.860]  And we have videos of like 18 year old mental patients beating up white people because they're white and blood splattering everywhere.
[2:32:39.860 --> 2:32:41.860]  And then giving them COVID and everything else.
[2:32:41.860 --> 2:32:42.860]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:32:42.860 --> 2:32:43.860]  The scam runs deep.
[2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:48.860]  And also her husband was caught trying to get his boat in the water early before everyone else.
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:50.860]  It doesn't matter. I'm the governor husband.
[2:32:50.860 --> 2:32:51.860]  Exactly. Exactly.
[2:32:51.860 --> 2:32:53.860]  And then they managed to get away with that as well.
[2:32:53.860 --> 2:32:56.860]  So what was great is the people at the boat dock said, we don't want your boat.
[2:32:56.860 --> 2:32:57.860]  Come get your boat when public with it.
[2:32:57.860 --> 2:33:00.860]  And they blew him out of the water because this is what needs to happen.
[2:33:00.860 --> 2:33:04.860]  We need to stop getting service to leftist and a globalist and anything else.
[2:33:04.860 --> 2:33:07.860]  Like you see Abbott at a restaurant.
[2:33:07.860 --> 2:33:08.860]  You own it.
[2:33:08.860 --> 2:33:10.860]  Say get your ass and get the hell out of here.
[2:33:10.860 --> 2:33:13.860]  Go get on your knees in the world order.
[2:33:13.860 --> 2:33:14.860]  Anybody.
[2:33:14.860 --> 2:33:15.860]  We don't shop with leftists.
[2:33:15.860 --> 2:33:16.860]  We don't support them.
[2:33:16.860 --> 2:33:17.860]  They want to take our bank accounts.
[2:33:17.860 --> 2:33:18.860]  They want to suppress us.
[2:33:18.860 --> 2:33:19.860]  They want to dominate us.
[2:33:19.860 --> 2:33:20.860]  Then they want war.
[2:33:20.860 --> 2:33:21.860]  They're going to get it.
[2:33:21.860 --> 2:33:23.860]  Ostracize them out of your lives.
[2:33:23.860 --> 2:33:26.860]  Let them know they can burn in hell.
[2:33:26.860 --> 2:33:41.860]  We're going to come back and tell you what the enemy's up to.
[2:33:56.860 --> 2:34:06.860]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:10.860]  The Electropure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the
[2:34:10.860 --> 2:34:13.860]  Implewars cruise every day for the purest water possible.
[2:34:13.860 --> 2:34:17.860]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy and delicious drinking water.
[2:34:17.860 --> 2:34:20.860]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water.
[2:34:20.860 --> 2:34:24.860]  The Electropure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:28.860]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:54.860]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Electropure Pro.
[2:34:54.860 --> 2:35:01.860]  The Electropure Pro is the same water filter that Alex and the Implewars cruise every day
[2:35:01.860 --> 2:35:04.860]  for the purest water possible.
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:09.860]  The Electropure Pro is the same water filter that Alex and the Implewars cruise every day
[2:35:09.860 --> 2:35:11.860]  for the purest water possible.
[2:35:11.860 --> 2:35:33.860]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Electropure Pro.
[2:35:33.860 --> 2:35:49.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[2:35:49.860 --> 2:35:54.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:35:54.860 --> 2:36:04.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:14.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:36:14.860 --> 2:36:34.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:37:02.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:28.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:44.860]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[2:37:58.860 --> 2:38:09.860]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[2:38:09.860 --> 2:38:13.860]  I've been studying the United Nations who set it up and how it operates for a long time
[2:38:13.860 --> 2:38:15.860]  and a lot of you have as well.
[2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:19.860]  And they tried to launch plans back in the 60s to disarm the military and the police
[2:38:19.860 --> 2:38:22.860]  and then only have a UN force around the world.
[2:38:22.860 --> 2:38:28.860]  And a lot of people ended up in the government quietly having to be gotten rid of
[2:38:28.860 --> 2:38:31.860]  to stop that at that point.
[2:38:31.860 --> 2:38:36.860]  And you go to the CIA website and look up State Department of Random 7277.
[2:38:36.860 --> 2:38:39.860]  You type in State Department of Random 7277.
[2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:42.860]  You'll notice it'll pop up on Wikipedia in places like that
[2:38:42.860 --> 2:38:53.860]  and you can actually go to the CIA has got a flyer from 1963 about FBI agents
[2:38:53.860 --> 2:38:57.860]  and CIA operatives that were creating a newsletter called On Target
[2:38:57.860 --> 2:39:01.860]  about a list of people in the government that they were planning to kill
[2:39:01.860 --> 2:39:03.860]  if they continue to go along with the plan.
[2:39:03.860 --> 2:39:10.860]  So the government knows all about this ongoing battle and this ongoing fight
[2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:13.860]  and we would have already been under this a long time ago
[2:39:13.860 --> 2:39:18.860]  if there hadn't been a quiet hot war inside the federal government
[2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:21.860]  and people got killed on both sides just so you know.
[2:39:21.860 --> 2:39:23.860]  Just so you know.
[2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:28.860]  And I'll tell you Texas led the operations against it.
[2:39:28.860 --> 2:39:32.860]  And I grew up hearing about this and I'll just leave it at that.
[2:39:32.860 --> 2:39:35.860]  Just little things here, little things there about what went on.
[2:39:35.860 --> 2:39:37.860]  Now let's talk about this right now.
[2:39:37.860 --> 2:39:39.860]  Let's look at this fella right here.
[2:39:39.860 --> 2:39:42.860]  This is Jonathan Greenblatt.
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:48.860]  And he worked directly as special counsel to President Barack Obama.
[2:39:48.860 --> 2:39:58.860]  So when you look at this guy, you're looking at President Barack H. Obama.
[2:39:58.860 --> 2:40:03.860]  Now Mr. Greenblatt heads up the Anti-Defamation League
[2:40:03.860 --> 2:40:05.860]  and anyone that doesn't want to turn their guns in,
[2:40:05.860 --> 2:40:06.860]  anyone that doesn't want open borders,
[2:40:06.860 --> 2:40:09.860]  anybody that doesn't want to give in to run their lives, they're in anti-Semite.
[2:40:09.860 --> 2:40:11.860]  Trump's anti-Semite.
[2:40:11.860 --> 2:40:14.860]  Now the truth is we know that Jews are a diverse group of views and ideas
[2:40:14.860 --> 2:40:16.860]  and I'm not against Israel, I'm not against Jews.
[2:40:16.860 --> 2:40:20.860]  I'm not going to be sucked in to being in this whole thing, okay?
[2:40:20.860 --> 2:40:24.860]  The point is that Greenblatt comes out and says I'm anti-Semitic
[2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:26.860]  because I even exist, okay?
[2:40:26.860 --> 2:40:28.860]  Now let's talk about this.
[2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:31.860]  Can ADL stop the hate by embracing Al Sharpton?
[2:40:31.860 --> 2:40:32.860]  Big articles are out.
[2:40:32.860 --> 2:40:36.860]  Al Sharpton's a guy that actually has attacked Jews and said Jews are bad.
[2:40:36.860 --> 2:40:38.860]  But he's good, you see.
[2:40:38.860 --> 2:40:40.860]  Radical Islam's good.
[2:40:40.860 --> 2:40:42.860]  I mean, the ADL now is not even really pro-Israel
[2:40:42.860 --> 2:40:44.860]  because they understand this is about globalism.
[2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:46.860]  Continue.
[2:40:46.860 --> 2:40:51.860]  ADL CEO under fire from departing with Al Sharpton is pushing for Facebook boycott.
[2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:55.860]  Can the ADL stop the hate by embracing Al Sharpton?
[2:40:55.860 --> 2:40:59.860]  Facebook's own civil rights auditors say the policy decisions are a tremendous setback
[2:40:59.860 --> 2:41:02.860]  and recommend they follow the ADL's directives.
[2:41:02.860 --> 2:41:07.860]  The ADL says they want their trainers to not just train Facebook censors
[2:41:07.860 --> 2:41:08.860]  but be in charge.
[2:41:08.860 --> 2:41:12.860]  Letter to the New York Times regarding Alex Jones' removal from social media.
[2:41:12.860 --> 2:41:16.860]  He goes on to say I am anti-Semite because I said gay groups
[2:41:16.860 --> 2:41:20.860]  and some leftist Jewish groups did obviously dress up at different events.
[2:41:20.860 --> 2:41:23.860]  Some of the white supremacists aren't left as posing as that.
[2:41:23.860 --> 2:41:25.860]  We catch them all the time.
[2:41:25.860 --> 2:41:27.860]  The left does Jesse Smollett stuff.
[2:41:27.860 --> 2:41:30.860]  I mean, that's what Barat does.
[2:41:30.860 --> 2:41:35.860]  Sasha Barat Cohen goes around and poses as an anti-Jewish guy and gets people to join in.
[2:41:35.860 --> 2:41:39.860]  I mean, he's saying this doesn't exist so I should be taken off the Internet.
[2:41:39.860 --> 2:41:42.860]  He calls for me in the New York Times to be censored two years ago
[2:41:42.860 --> 2:41:45.860]  and said it was a good thing because I lied.
[2:41:45.860 --> 2:41:46.860]  I mean, I didn't lie.
[2:41:46.860 --> 2:41:49.860]  That's what Sasha Barat Cohen did, your keynote address poses all the time
[2:41:49.860 --> 2:41:52.860]  as an anti-Semite to set people up.
[2:41:52.860 --> 2:41:55.860]  I mean, even though I was lying, I have a right to free speech.
[2:41:55.860 --> 2:42:00.860]  But it's you, Mr. Greenblatt that's doing this.
[2:42:00.860 --> 2:42:03.860]  ADL statement on Facebook position to remove Lewis Farrakhan, Alex Jones,
[2:42:03.860 --> 2:42:05.860]  and other bigots from platform.
[2:42:05.860 --> 2:42:11.860]  There's this college threatens to revoke students admission after viral pro-Trump TikTok video.
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:14.860]  She just said, I love Trump and I don't care what you say.
[2:42:14.860 --> 2:42:15.860]  He's a great president.
[2:42:15.860 --> 2:42:19.860]  They're now saying they're going to take away her high school diploma as she goes to college.
[2:42:19.860 --> 2:42:22.860]  The road to human rights in Iran, are we there yet?
[2:42:22.860 --> 2:42:32.860]  Here's Jonathan Greenblatt's wife, a refugee from Iranian tyranny,
[2:42:32.860 --> 2:42:35.860]  and she writes articles with an image of her with red tape over her mouth
[2:42:35.860 --> 2:42:37.860]  how the regime doesn't let you have speech and censors.
[2:42:37.860 --> 2:42:40.860]  So his wife runs around as a human rights activist,
[2:42:40.860 --> 2:42:44.860]  and gets all this money through groups to try to have regime change in Iran,
[2:42:44.860 --> 2:42:50.860]  which I'm all for, but then by day and by night her husband is just as bad as the regime.
[2:42:50.860 --> 2:42:53.860]  Just pointing that out.
[2:42:53.860 --> 2:42:55.860]  Now, I want to get Dan Lyman's take on this.
[2:42:55.860 --> 2:42:59.860]  I'm going to get into the serious documents in the next hour of the UN replacement plan,
[2:42:59.860 --> 2:43:02.860]  a super racist plan against white people,
[2:43:02.860 --> 2:43:05.860]  and how this operation is going to work and how it's run by the UN,
[2:43:05.860 --> 2:43:08.860]  and how the ADL says if you talk about it, they will quote,
[2:43:08.860 --> 2:43:13.860]  purge you, though I'm going to show you the official UN documents from their website word for word.
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:16.860]  Dan Lyman of yourreports.com, you have any comments on this?
[2:43:16.860 --> 2:43:19.860]  Well, I think this is the kind of stuff that we can look forward to in a Biden presidency
[2:43:19.860 --> 2:43:23.860]  given that they're going to have all these kinds of people just re-embedded in the administration there.
[2:43:23.860 --> 2:43:27.860]  And what I think is amazing is that these people, they will blanket,
[2:43:27.860 --> 2:43:30.860]  attack an entire group of people just for being white.
[2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:36.860]  But if you attack a single individual for having poor policy or being flat out evil,
[2:43:36.860 --> 2:43:39.860]  we, you know, most recently we saw, we can't even talk poorly about Tammy Duckworth
[2:43:39.860 --> 2:43:41.860]  because she lost her legs, unfortunately.
[2:43:41.860 --> 2:43:45.860]  So I mean, they will find any, any reason why we can't.
[2:43:45.860 --> 2:43:49.860]  We're saying this man on America that whites are evil and we can't respond back.
[2:43:49.860 --> 2:43:51.860]  Right. We can't even attack an individual.
[2:43:51.860 --> 2:43:53.860]  She's a racist pig.
[2:43:53.860 --> 2:43:55.860]  But they can attack an entire group of people.
[2:43:55.860 --> 2:43:57.860]  The truth is they're a bunch of racists, okay?
[2:43:57.860 --> 2:43:59.860]  So I don't think the ADL represents Jews.
[2:43:59.860 --> 2:44:00.860]  There are a lot of good Jews.
[2:44:00.860 --> 2:44:02.860]  I've had Jews help me out with things.
[2:44:02.860 --> 2:44:06.860]  I mean, a Band-Aught video was designed by a guy from Israel,
[2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:08.860]  a great guy who didn't like us being censored, helped us build it.
[2:44:08.860 --> 2:44:10.860]  And then it was like, here it's done, have it.
[2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:12.860]  I mean, there's so many examples.
[2:44:12.860 --> 2:44:16.860]  I'm gonna have the ADL trick me into hating Jews because they make money off that.
[2:44:16.860 --> 2:44:20.860]  Yeah. And that's, they're, they're sewing division across the board
[2:44:20.860 --> 2:44:23.860]  between everyone for every, you know, little infraction or, you know,
[2:44:23.860 --> 2:44:25.860]  anything we said 10 years ago or whatever.
[2:44:25.860 --> 2:44:28.860]  So sewing division within groups, between groups.
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:31.860]  And, and I think that's obviously the end game is just have everybody fighting
[2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:33.860]  with each other while they make their moves.
[2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:38.860]  Exactly. He's a hired contractor to just come in and create Total Division.
[2:44:38.860 --> 2:44:41.860]  That's what it seems like.
[2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:44.860]  Let's continue here. Let me give people a little preview of what's coming up.
[2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:51.860]  Macron, enabler of the Carnegie plan, 200 million Africans will live in Europe
[2:44:51.860 --> 2:44:55.860]  after 30 years of migration.
[2:44:55.860 --> 2:44:59.860]  Melania Trump statue in Slovenia torn down.
[2:44:59.860 --> 2:45:02.860]  President Macron vows to flood Europe with millions of African migrants.
[2:45:02.860 --> 2:45:06.860]  He says 150 million just for France alone.
[2:45:06.860 --> 2:45:11.860]  U.N. plan to flood America with 600 million migrants in fours.com.
[2:45:11.860 --> 2:45:16.860]  Direct links to the U.N. website where they officially say that's the policy
[2:45:16.860 --> 2:45:19.860]  but you've already seen implemented dims official proposed giving entire
[2:45:19.860 --> 2:45:21.860]  world's migrant asylum in the U.S.
[2:45:21.860 --> 2:45:24.860]  That is the latest article that came out yesterday.
[2:45:24.860 --> 2:45:31.860]  And we actually show you the Democratic Party now saying that that is actually
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:38.860]  their policy that their policy in the new platform with Joe Biden has
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:42.860]  has adopted the idea of no borders, no walls and to bring unlimited quote
[2:45:42.860 --> 2:45:45.860]  migrants in at the U.N.'s in charge of it.
[2:45:45.860 --> 2:45:48.860]  And they tell us that it's inevitable that it has to happen.
[2:45:48.860 --> 2:45:49.860]  There's no stopping it.
[2:45:49.860 --> 2:45:52.860]  But these are the same people that tell us we can actually change the climate
[2:45:52.860 --> 2:45:55.860]  of the planet if we give up this and give up that.
[2:45:55.860 --> 2:46:00.860]  So they say we can actually we can fight God essentially fight God's creation
[2:46:00.860 --> 2:46:04.860]  but at the same time we can't even defend our borders from humans who are very
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:07.860]  you know you can prevent them from crossing borders if you really want to
[2:46:07.860 --> 2:46:10.860]  as they've proven throughout this the whole coronavirus thing they've actually
[2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:13.860]  managed to seal down a lot of the borders pretty well.
[2:46:13.860 --> 2:46:17.860]  But they tell us that it's inevitable that hundreds of millions of people
[2:46:17.860 --> 2:46:19.860]  from the third world are going to flood into our countries in a very short
[2:46:19.860 --> 2:46:22.860]  period of time and there's just nothing that they can do about it.
[2:46:22.860 --> 2:46:27.860]  So and this is official and this is happening and then when it's in the
[2:46:27.860 --> 2:46:31.860]  official U.N. website they look at us and tell us we're crazy it doesn't exist
[2:46:31.860 --> 2:46:35.860]  when it's an official plan happening we can look out our window and see.
[2:46:35.860 --> 2:46:38.860]  And they're telling the migrants whites are inherently bad.
[2:46:38.860 --> 2:46:41.860]  So whites are being beaten up and attacked by people from all the world
[2:46:41.860 --> 2:46:43.860]  is that multi-thousand percentage points.
[2:46:43.860 --> 2:46:46.860]  And weaponizing a lot of these people who do come in and then
[2:46:46.860 --> 2:46:48.860]  rise up through the ranks of power.
[2:46:48.860 --> 2:46:52.860]  Ilhan Omar is one great example but you have people like that in Sweden as well.
[2:46:52.860 --> 2:46:56.860]  You have a very similar character in Sweden who was a migrant refugee
[2:46:56.860 --> 2:46:59.860]  from another from an African country who is basically there now saying
[2:46:59.860 --> 2:47:02.860]  leading this charge the Black Lives Matter movement there saying that
[2:47:02.860 --> 2:47:05.860]  Sweden is a bastion of whiteness and needs to be torn down.
[2:47:05.860 --> 2:47:08.860]  Yeah so exactly now they're saying the country side is too wide in England
[2:47:08.860 --> 2:47:11.860]  we've got to force people out there and take their homes.
[2:47:11.860 --> 2:47:15.860]  And saying the existence of white is evil and it needs to be purged
[2:47:15.860 --> 2:47:19.860]  and then the ADL is up there saying we're going to purge anybody and put them
[2:47:19.860 --> 2:47:24.860]  in prison if they say there's a plan to bring in 600 million people and force
[2:47:24.860 --> 2:47:26.860]  whites to just die.
[2:47:26.860 --> 2:47:30.860]  I mean it's genocide, it's actual hitlerian activity.
[2:47:30.860 --> 2:47:33.860]  The only thing I see hitlerian right now is the United Nations
[2:47:33.860 --> 2:47:36.860]  and this replacement migration plan.
[2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:39.860]  And if people want to see, if they want to look at a glimpse into the future
[2:47:39.860 --> 2:47:42.860]  just look at what has gone down in South Africa in the past couple of decades
[2:47:42.860 --> 2:47:46.860]  and the way that people are being dispossessed of their land simply for being white
[2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:50.860]  and the attacks that are carried out on them are unbelievably heinous.
[2:47:50.860 --> 2:47:53.860]  Some of the worst things I've ever seen or read and that's simply just for being white.
[2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:57.860]  So people need to look at that, take a good hard look, examine it
[2:47:57.860 --> 2:47:59.860]  and see that this is already coming.
[2:47:59.860 --> 2:48:02.860]  And realize the ADL stands for Adolf Defense League.
[2:48:02.860 --> 2:48:08.860]  Because they're just taking that as of hitler racially and turning it all the way around
[2:48:08.860 --> 2:48:10.860]  but then the ADL will direct it all.
[2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:12.860]  I mean that's literally what the ADL is saying.
[2:48:12.860 --> 2:48:15.860]  It's the closest thing to hitler I've ever seen.
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:20.860]  We will purge you, we will imprison you for your speech, we are in command, we rule you now.
[2:48:20.860 --> 2:48:24.860]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning
[2:48:24.860 --> 2:48:26.860]  and I wasn't even close to downtown
[2:48:26.860 --> 2:48:29.860]  but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[2:48:29.860 --> 2:48:35.860]  When I came back out I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese,
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:38.860]  walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me
[2:48:38.860 --> 2:48:41.860]  and here I am parked a truck with the windows up
[2:48:41.860 --> 2:48:45.860]  and the woman stops and points at me so they stop and they wait
[2:48:45.860 --> 2:48:47.860]  while I'm inside my truck, truck started
[2:48:47.860 --> 2:48:50.860]  and they sit there and stretch, she keeps pointing
[2:48:50.860 --> 2:48:55.860]  and they put their hands out like they're waiting for me to go
[2:48:55.860 --> 2:48:58.860]  because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car
[2:48:58.860 --> 2:49:02.860]  and so then I just sat there so they acted angry and walked past me.
[2:49:02.860 --> 2:49:05.860]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone
[2:49:05.860 --> 2:49:07.860]  but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[2:49:07.860 --> 2:49:12.860]  This has been almost people are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[2:49:12.860 --> 2:49:15.860]  This is all cult programming, this is all about submitting.
[2:49:15.860 --> 2:49:18.860]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[2:49:18.860 --> 2:49:19.860]  It's all a giant fraud.
[2:49:19.860 --> 2:49:22.860]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[2:49:23.860 --> 2:49:27.860]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency
[2:49:27.860 --> 2:49:30.860]  and back to being prepared and the way to start, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:49:30.860 --> 2:49:33.860]  is having friends and family with a bug out plan
[2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:35.860]  if there is a total collapse and water filtration
[2:49:35.860 --> 2:49:37.860]  and food to last you at least a few months
[2:49:37.860 --> 2:49:40.860]  and the food we have is very high quality.
[2:49:40.860 --> 2:49:43.860]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[2:49:43.860 --> 2:49:45.860]  They have wide selection, special diets, you name it.
[2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:47.860]  It's the best price you're going to find
[2:49:47.860 --> 2:49:51.860]  but you need to get the orders in now in the lull before the storm.
[2:49:51.860 --> 2:49:53.860]  I told you lockdown 2 was coming.
[2:49:53.860 --> 2:49:55.860]  The new world order is making it smooth.
[2:49:55.860 --> 2:49:58.860]  Whether Trump loses or wins, things are just going to get more crazy
[2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:02.860]  and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[2:50:02.860 --> 2:50:04.860]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury,
[2:50:04.860 --> 2:50:08.860]  something you know is the ace in the hole for you and your family in the future
[2:50:08.860 --> 2:50:10.860]  and the little bit of profit that comes in
[2:50:10.860 --> 2:50:13.860]  funds the Info War to continue to warn the people.
[2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:15.860]  So you're also funding Info Wars,
[2:50:15.860 --> 2:50:18.860]  the most powerful, Paul Revere organization in the world
[2:50:18.860 --> 2:50:41.860]  and it's powered by you.
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:52.860] .com has separate content from Info Wars, Eurocentric mainly
[2:50:52.860 --> 2:50:53.860]  but it ties into what's happening here.
[2:50:53.860 --> 2:50:56.860]  It's all the same globalist theater of attack
[2:50:56.860 --> 2:51:01.860]  but the left uses guilt and uses victimology
[2:51:01.860 --> 2:51:05.860]  where they're allowed to attack, they're allowed to take your rights,
[2:51:05.860 --> 2:51:07.860]  they're allowed to come after you and bully you
[2:51:07.860 --> 2:51:10.860]  and if you even raise your hand in defense, you're a Nazi
[2:51:10.860 --> 2:51:13.860]  and then George Soros is the grand Puba funding and all
[2:51:13.860 --> 2:51:16.860]  and he literally collaborated with the Nazis and bragged about it
[2:51:16.860 --> 2:51:21.860]  and it's just totally sick and bizarre
[2:51:21.860 --> 2:51:25.860]  but you understand the mathematical equation of deception
[2:51:25.860 --> 2:51:28.860]  this is what big corporations want is to divide us all against each other
[2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:31.860]  and so those of us that are actually trying to unify people together
[2:51:31.860 --> 2:51:35.860]  around the Americana, free market, Christian ethos
[2:51:35.860 --> 2:51:38.860]  we are under attack because we're running a parallel system
[2:51:38.860 --> 2:51:41.860]  that is better than this and the authoritarians don't like it
[2:51:41.860 --> 2:51:44.860]  and so they know it's a fraud, they know we're not Nazis
[2:51:44.860 --> 2:51:48.860]  and they're using Nazi tactics of cutting off bank accounts
[2:51:48.860 --> 2:51:52.860]  look at Laura Loomer, she's pro-Israel, Jewish lady, pro-freedom
[2:51:52.860 --> 2:51:56.860]  she's had all the Airbnbs in Uber and PayPal
[2:51:56.860 --> 2:52:00.860]  and all of them blacklist her and gang up on her to show her
[2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:04.860]  but that's the most Nazi-like behavior in the ADL
[2:52:04.860 --> 2:52:08.860]  I mean that's Hitler behavior and now they want to put us in jail
[2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:11.860]  I mean why, my grandfather's both in World War II
[2:52:11.860 --> 2:52:15.860]  why do you want to put me in jail, why does Jonathan Greenblatt want to put me in jail
[2:52:15.860 --> 2:52:17.860]  because he's a monster
[2:52:17.860 --> 2:52:21.860]  the ADL attacking a fellow Jewish woman, it really is incredible
[2:52:21.860 --> 2:52:25.860]  and you know what you're saying about the way that they really just hammer anyone who speaks out against it
[2:52:25.860 --> 2:52:28.860]  I get a lot of people ask me, why are the Swedes allowing us to happen to their country
[2:52:28.860 --> 2:52:31.860]  why are the Germans allowing us to happen to their country
[2:52:31.860 --> 2:52:34.860]  because anyone who speaks out against it at all, especially in Germany
[2:52:34.860 --> 2:52:36.860]  the propaganda is non-stop
[2:52:36.860 --> 2:52:40.860]  if you've been stabbed and a black dude did it, you say a black dude stabbed me or arrested
[2:52:40.860 --> 2:52:44.860]  right and in Germany the propaganda is non-stop
[2:52:44.860 --> 2:52:46.860]  from the mainstream media and from the government
[2:52:46.860 --> 2:52:52.860]  and that's because they never got out from under the occupation during the reconstruction of the Marshall plant
[2:52:52.860 --> 2:52:56.860]  that's not America that runs it, it's the Ford Foundation Carnegie Endowment
[2:52:56.860 --> 2:52:59.860]  and there is no free speech there
[2:52:59.860 --> 2:53:03.860]  and that's one of the reasons why it is happening there almost unchecked
[2:53:03.860 --> 2:53:05.860]  because no one's even allowed to talk about it
[2:53:05.860 --> 2:53:09.860]  so that's why I recommend everyone here in the United States, we have a lot of issues facing us here
[2:53:09.860 --> 2:53:13.860]  between coronavirus, between migration, between this culture war
[2:53:13.860 --> 2:53:16.860]  you still have the right to speak up
[2:53:16.860 --> 2:53:20.860]  and if people don't exercise that right, it's going to die and it is dying
[2:53:20.860 --> 2:53:22.860]  so people really do need to speak up right now
[2:53:22.860 --> 2:53:25.860]  everyone needs to be speaking up en masse
[2:53:25.860 --> 2:53:29.860]  because that's the only recourse that we have right now before the next phase
[2:53:29.860 --> 2:53:32.860]  and it's not going to be pretty if people don't speak up soon
[2:53:32.860 --> 2:53:38.860]  it's very simple, the powers that be the Southern Proper Law Center, the ADL, the NAACP, they're all the same program
[2:53:38.860 --> 2:53:42.860]  they're casting America as Hitler and their Captain America
[2:53:42.860 --> 2:53:46.860]  and I see leftist, hit a woman in the head with a club just because she's going in a Trump event
[2:53:46.860 --> 2:53:48.860]  and they go, she's a Nazi
[2:53:48.860 --> 2:53:51.860]  it's an excuse for them to act bad and do bad things
[2:53:51.860 --> 2:53:54.860]  just like Hitler said, because you're a Jew I could do something to you
[2:53:54.860 --> 2:53:57.860]  well I refuse to stick to the level of Hitler ADL, but you've done it
[2:53:57.860 --> 2:54:00.860]  Dehumanizing everyone and at this point we've lost our excuse
[2:54:00.860 --> 2:54:02.860]  They're literally Hitler-like
[2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:06.860]  I mean, Jonathan Greenblatt is the closest thing to Hitler I've ever seen
[2:54:06.860 --> 2:54:08.860]  it's unbelievable
[2:54:10.860 --> 2:54:12.860]  can you believe these people?
[2:54:12.860 --> 2:54:14.860]  the nerve, man
[2:54:14.860 --> 2:54:17.860]  Sasha Barrett Cohen says we're going to arrest you
[2:54:17.860 --> 2:54:21.860]  and then he lies about what I said when he's talking about having me arrested
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:24.860]  the Ernie Lelder Zion crap
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:29.860]  and notice that's what he pushes so that when Jews get persecuted
[2:54:29.860 --> 2:54:32.860]  because of what he's pushing, then he'll be their savior
[2:54:32.860 --> 2:54:33.860]  very simple
[2:54:33.860 --> 2:54:36.860]  and we're not allowed to even defend ourselves when they slander
[2:54:36.860 --> 2:54:38.860]  and say that we say things that we didn't
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:41.860]  you're not even allowed to correct the record
[2:54:41.860 --> 2:54:45.860]  why do Americans, because we defeated Hitler and protected the ADL
[2:54:45.860 --> 2:54:49.860]  like Abe Foxman, why does Abe Foxman hate America so much?
[2:54:51.860 --> 2:54:53.860]  why?
[2:54:53.860 --> 2:54:55.860]  I don't have the answer, I wish I knew
[2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:57.860]  what did I do to him?
[2:54:57.860 --> 2:55:00.860]  they've been calling me a Nazi for 25 years for no reason
[2:55:00.860 --> 2:55:03.860]  because they want me to hate them, they want me to attack them
[2:55:03.860 --> 2:55:05.860]  they want me to attack Jews and I'm not going to do it
[2:55:05.860 --> 2:55:08.860]  but I will attack you, I will expose your ass
[2:55:08.860 --> 2:55:11.860]  and I'm sure they'll just torture me more, you know
[2:55:11.860 --> 2:55:14.860]  it's all funny, just the smugness of these lawyers
[2:55:14.860 --> 2:55:18.860]  sitting up there in judgment of us like they're God
[2:55:18.860 --> 2:55:20.860]  well, the people are waking up
[2:55:20.860 --> 2:55:24.860]  there's no Facebook's now run by Jonathan Greenblatt and Obama
[2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:27.860]  I mean, when you see this, this is just Obama
[2:55:27.860 --> 2:55:30.860]  an Islamic extremist hiding behind a Jew
[2:55:58.860 --> 2:56:02.860]  allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals
[2:56:02.860 --> 2:56:05.860]  from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface
[2:56:05.860 --> 2:56:08.860]  into the ultimate spray formula
[2:56:08.860 --> 2:56:10.860]  iodine is an essential mineral
[2:56:10.860 --> 2:56:13.860]  that helps support thyroid health
[2:56:13.860 --> 2:56:15.860]  healthy metabolism
[2:56:15.860 --> 2:56:17.860]  and healthy cognitive function
[2:56:17.860 --> 2:56:20.860]  get the new survival shield X2 spray
[2:56:20.860 --> 2:56:22.860]  for 33% off intro pricing
[2:56:22.860 --> 2:56:25.860]  at infowarstore.com
[2:56:25.860 --> 2:56:28.860]  that's survival shield X2 spray
[2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:56.860]  at infowarstore.com
[2:56:59.860 --> 2:57:01.860]  they're the ones having the ADL now
[2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:04.860]  literally put on symposiums and backing radical Islam
[2:57:04.860 --> 2:57:07.860]  I mean, the ADL's been bought out by radical Islam
[2:57:07.860 --> 2:57:09.860]  and the globalist
[2:57:09.860 --> 2:57:11.860]  they're the ones
[2:57:11.860 --> 2:57:14.860]  Obama and the globalists that have the Washington Post saying
[2:57:14.860 --> 2:57:16.860]  Trump could lose and not leave
[2:57:16.860 --> 2:57:19.860]  but cabinet members who try to help him face prison
[2:57:19.860 --> 2:57:21.860]  and I've got the CFR saying
[2:57:21.860 --> 2:57:23.860]  they may remove him before or during the election
[2:57:23.860 --> 2:57:25.860]  so if Trump challenges the results
[2:57:25.860 --> 2:57:27.860]  Democrats say they already are
[2:57:27.860 --> 2:57:29.860]  if he challenges them
[2:57:29.860 --> 2:57:31.860]  they say that the Pentagon will arrest him
[2:57:31.860 --> 2:57:33.860]  or they will arrest them
[2:57:33.860 --> 2:57:36.860]  so now again, it's not just the ADL saying
[2:57:36.860 --> 2:57:38.860]  take Alex Jones off the air
[2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:40.860]  Zuckerberg do what we say or will arrest you
[2:57:40.860 --> 2:57:42.860]  will purge you using Nazi stuff
[2:57:42.860 --> 2:57:44.860]  Nazi, I mean why would you purge me?
[2:57:44.860 --> 2:57:46.860]  purge me, wow, that's wonderful
[2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:48.860]  you're so nice, let me do what you say
[2:57:48.860 --> 2:57:50.860]  now they're telling the brass
[2:57:50.860 --> 2:57:52.860]  now the Washington Post
[2:57:52.860 --> 2:57:54.860]  I guess that Jeff Bezos is saying
[2:57:54.860 --> 2:57:56.860]  so they're all in lockstep
[2:57:56.860 --> 2:57:58.860]  gearing up for this, what do we do?
[2:57:58.860 --> 2:58:00.860]  it's going to get ugly
[2:58:00.860 --> 2:58:03.860]  it got so ugly at the 2016 election
[2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:06.860]  and we've had four more years of just pure insanity since then
[2:58:06.860 --> 2:58:09.860]  so for 2020 it's going to be just crazy
[2:58:09.860 --> 2:58:11.860]  but I think one of the things that the Trump administration
[2:58:11.860 --> 2:58:13.860]  should really be focused on
[2:58:13.860 --> 2:58:15.860]  and it doesn't seem like they are no matter how much they talk about it
[2:58:15.860 --> 2:58:18.860]  is that they're not focusing on tech censorship
[2:58:18.860 --> 2:58:21.860]  and they're allowing so many of their supporters to be silenced
[2:58:21.860 --> 2:58:24.860]  and basically de-platform, de-persons
[2:58:24.860 --> 2:58:26.860]  and all these people are going to be gone
[2:58:26.860 --> 2:58:28.860]  if Trump loses it's his fault
[2:58:28.860 --> 2:58:30.860]  yeah, there's going to be no one there
[2:58:30.860 --> 2:58:32.860]  to expose the truth
[2:58:32.860 --> 2:58:36.860]  to fight on behalf of a fair election
[2:58:36.860 --> 2:58:38.860]  which I think was really, really critical
[2:58:38.860 --> 2:58:40.860]  for the 2016 election is
[2:58:40.860 --> 2:58:42.860]  there were still enough voices out there
[2:58:42.860 --> 2:58:44.860]  exposing fraud
[2:58:44.860 --> 2:58:46.860]  rallying around, getting good information out there
[2:58:46.860 --> 2:58:48.860]  and trying to expose it
[2:58:48.860 --> 2:58:50.860]  that they were going to try to steal the election
[2:58:50.860 --> 2:58:52.860]  and that might not work this time
[2:58:52.860 --> 2:58:55.860]  but there are so many people now that have been wiped off the internet essentially
[2:58:55.860 --> 2:58:56.860]  well that's right
[2:58:56.860 --> 2:58:58.860]  and I know Trump cares about his supporters
[2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:00.860]  I know he cares about censorship
[2:59:00.860 --> 2:59:02.860]  they stymie him, they lie to him
[2:59:02.860 --> 2:59:04.860]  they say it's not going on
[2:59:04.860 --> 2:59:06.860]  he tells the Justice Department go in there and do something
[2:59:06.860 --> 2:59:08.860]  they spin their wheels with investigations
[2:59:08.860 --> 2:59:10.860]  and so he's sitting there, he calls them in
[2:59:10.860 --> 2:59:12.860]  he meets with them, he says stop
[2:59:12.860 --> 2:59:14.860]  they don't stop, they don't respect him, they're belligerent
[2:59:14.860 --> 2:59:17.860]  and so now we sit there and get mad at Trump
[2:59:17.860 --> 2:59:19.860]  you know, he should have, the real power he had
[2:59:19.860 --> 2:59:21.860]  is what callers said years ago
[2:59:21.860 --> 2:59:23.860]  he should have moved to Parlor
[2:59:23.860 --> 2:59:25.860]  he should have started his own Twitter
[2:59:25.860 --> 2:59:27.860]  they would have backed off right at that point
[2:59:27.860 --> 2:59:29.860]  but now with 115 days left
[2:59:29.860 --> 2:59:31.860]  he's doing more speeches, more rallies
[2:59:31.860 --> 2:59:33.860]  he's killing himself but almost no one carries it
[2:59:33.860 --> 2:59:35.860]  and before they carried it because it got high ratings
[2:59:35.860 --> 2:59:37.860]  but now
[2:59:37.860 --> 2:59:39.860]  they're sacrificing ratings because they can
[2:59:39.860 --> 2:59:41.860]  block it online, they didn't want online to get the coverage
[2:59:41.860 --> 2:59:43.860]  so now we try to stream
[2:59:43.860 --> 2:59:45.860]  and we know people that you know do
[2:59:45.860 --> 2:59:47.860]  and we have folks that work behind the scenes all the way with that
[2:59:47.860 --> 2:59:49.860]  we've got a few tentacles out there nobody knows about
[2:59:49.860 --> 2:59:51.860]  and we know other broadcasting groups
[2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:53.860]  you know like right side, there's dozens of them
[2:59:53.860 --> 2:59:56.860]  that now Trump's speeches for six months are blocked
[2:59:56.860 --> 2:59:58.860]  they don't let him get out
[2:59:58.860 --> 3:00:00.860]  so they don't show much of his speeches on TV
[3:00:00.860 --> 3:00:02.860]  they don't show much of his speeches
[3:00:02.860 --> 3:00:04.860]  online and Trump allowed himself
[3:00:04.860 --> 3:00:06.860]  to be cut off from a supply line
[3:00:06.860 --> 3:00:08.860]  communication
[3:00:08.860 --> 3:00:10.860]  and they're finding ways, he can't even hold his rallies
[3:00:10.860 --> 3:00:12.860]  at this point or he can't effectively hold them
[3:00:12.860 --> 3:00:14.860]  oh it's his fault there's COVID
[3:00:14.860 --> 3:00:16.860]  but the Democrat rallies are good
[3:00:16.860 --> 3:00:19.860]  right and they've just canceled tomorrow's New Hampshire rally as well
[3:00:19.860 --> 3:00:21.860]  if I'm not mistaken, due to weather
[3:00:21.860 --> 3:00:24.860]  but you know there's going to be something coming up every time now at this point
[3:00:24.860 --> 3:00:26.860]  well he's being sabotaged, let me tell you the way they harass me
[3:00:26.860 --> 3:00:28.860]  they harassed thousands of people
[3:00:28.860 --> 3:00:30.860]  seen as in the upper support of Trump
[3:00:30.860 --> 3:00:33.860]  they are buying off and harassing everybody
[3:00:33.860 --> 3:00:35.860]  and it's just down to a handful of people
[3:00:35.860 --> 3:00:37.860]  and they know Tucker Carlson can't be bought
[3:00:37.860 --> 3:00:39.860]  and that's why they, you know there was already talk of him being a VP
[3:00:39.860 --> 3:00:41.860]  or something like that
[3:00:41.860 --> 3:00:43.860]  that's why they had David Duke come out and endorse him to discredit that
[3:00:43.860 --> 3:00:45.860]  but it's very sophisticated
[3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:47.860]  it is definitely
[3:00:47.860 --> 3:00:49.860]  and the Trump administration and the campaign
[3:00:49.860 --> 3:00:51.860]  need to get more sophisticated as well
[3:00:51.860 --> 3:00:54.860]  they need to really clean house there at the campaign
[3:00:54.860 --> 3:00:56.860]  because it's not gaining much traction
[3:00:56.860 --> 3:00:59.860]  especially with people who are looking for some hope now
[3:00:59.860 --> 3:01:01.860]  in these crazy times
[3:01:01.860 --> 3:01:03.860]  well Jared Kushner's being sidelined
[3:01:03.860 --> 3:01:05.860]  and so is Brad Parsgales and all the rest of them
[3:01:05.860 --> 3:01:07.860]  I don't know people who know Brad Parsgales
[3:01:07.860 --> 3:01:09.860]  he actually believes he got Trump elected
[3:01:09.860 --> 3:01:11.860]  he actually thinks that
[3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:13.860]  he thinks that they run Google ads they're going to win
[3:01:13.860 --> 3:01:15.860]  which is just not the case
[3:01:15.860 --> 3:01:17.860]  because all these platforms are purging Trump
[3:01:17.860 --> 3:01:19.860]  Trump ads so I mean
[3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:21.860]  thinking that you can rely on big tech
[3:01:21.860 --> 3:01:23.860]  to run ads and get the word out about the campaign
[3:01:23.860 --> 3:01:25.860]  it's just not going to work it's not going to work at all
[3:01:25.860 --> 3:01:27.860]  Trump needs a big splash
[3:01:27.860 --> 3:01:29.860]  he needs to pull something really really big
[3:01:29.860 --> 3:01:31.860]  I mean look Brad Parsgales
[3:01:31.860 --> 3:01:33.860]  should not be buying two or three houses
[3:01:33.860 --> 3:01:35.860]  and four or five Lamborghinis
[3:01:35.860 --> 3:01:37.860]  and I know people would know and they have parties with him
[3:01:37.860 --> 3:01:39.860]  he screws off a lot
[3:01:39.860 --> 3:01:41.860]  he should not be screwing off any
[3:01:41.860 --> 3:01:43.860]  people
[3:01:43.860 --> 3:01:45.860]  I mean and they're all literally Parsgales
[3:01:45.860 --> 3:01:47.860]  I'll be able to know him again
[3:01:47.860 --> 3:01:49.860]  he's like oh we'll have a Trump dynasty for 100 years
[3:01:49.860 --> 3:01:51.860]  oh we're going to win delusional delusional
[3:01:51.860 --> 3:01:53.860]  they're all in their little bubble
[3:01:55.860 --> 3:01:57.860]  I'm not just trying to attack Parsgales or any of these people
[3:01:57.860 --> 3:01:59.860]  but they're all just delusional
[3:01:59.860 --> 3:02:01.860]  they're rolling over you know
[3:02:01.860 --> 3:02:03.860]  yeah I think they've gotten comfortable too
[3:02:03.860 --> 3:02:05.860]  they've been around for a few years now
[3:02:05.860 --> 3:02:07.860]  the administration's been in place for almost four years
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:09.860]  there's complacency there's not that same hunger
[3:02:09.860 --> 3:02:11.860]  you know when they knew they were up against all the odds
[3:02:11.860 --> 3:02:13.860]  and they are still up against all the odds
[3:02:13.860 --> 3:02:15.860]  but there's complacency and that's created rot
[3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:17.860]  and then Trump will figure out
[3:02:17.860 --> 3:02:19.860]  they stole it he'll see the evidence
[3:02:19.860 --> 3:02:21.860]  and the whole media is going to turn against him
[3:02:21.860 --> 3:02:23.860]  and they're going to say he's insane removing
[3:02:23.860 --> 3:02:25.860]  and they've got the Pentagon
[3:02:25.860 --> 3:02:27.860]  they've all signaled the top generals
[3:02:27.860 --> 3:02:29.860]  have all signaled they're going to throw them under the bus
[3:02:29.860 --> 3:02:31.860]  now I know with some of the higher up people
[3:02:31.860 --> 3:02:33.860]  on the kind of the super deep state
[3:02:33.860 --> 3:02:35.860]  that's even below the deep state
[3:02:35.860 --> 3:02:37.860]  that they say that's not going to be allowed to happen
[3:02:37.860 --> 3:02:39.860]  and they're going to go with what the actual vote is
[3:02:39.860 --> 3:02:41.860]  so this could really be some fireworks
[3:02:41.860 --> 3:02:43.860]  definitely and it's going to get
[3:02:43.860 --> 3:02:45.860]  it's going to be so complicated with corona
[3:02:45.860 --> 3:02:47.860]  they're going to be flashing more and more
[3:02:47.860 --> 3:02:49.860]  you know increase in cases
[3:02:49.860 --> 3:02:51.860]  and they're going to really mess with the voting that way
[3:02:51.860 --> 3:02:53.860]  and so I think there's
[3:02:53.860 --> 3:02:55.860]  they're going to really be messing with the selection with every
[3:02:55.860 --> 3:02:57.860]  they're going to be throwing everything they have at it
[3:02:57.860 --> 3:02:59.860]  and people should be totally aware of that and be prepared
[3:02:59.860 --> 3:03:01.860]  well the super deep state is the American people
[3:03:01.860 --> 3:03:03.860]  and at the end of the day
[3:03:03.860 --> 3:03:05.860]  where the rubber meets the road
[3:03:05.860 --> 3:03:07.860]  television has killed our people
[3:03:07.860 --> 3:03:09.860]  everybody black white old younger
[3:03:09.860 --> 3:03:11.860]  sits there and watches TV all day
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:13.860]  you got to get out of it and they want you even less
[3:03:13.860 --> 3:03:15.860]  in your house
[3:03:15.860 --> 3:03:17.860]  they want you in your house while the leftists are all running around
[3:03:17.860 --> 3:03:19.860]  like cockroaches on the street
[3:03:19.860 --> 3:03:21.860]  that means do the opposite of what they tell you
[3:03:21.860 --> 3:03:23.860]  absolutely
[3:03:23.860 --> 3:03:25.860]  if the news tells you one thing
[3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:27.860]  think the opposite do the opposite
[3:03:27.860 --> 3:03:29.860]  do your own research too
[3:03:29.860 --> 3:03:31.860]  I was actually going to bring this up really quick because
[3:03:31.860 --> 3:03:33.860]  it really pertains to what's going on here in Texas
[3:03:33.860 --> 3:03:35.860]  and what's going on
[3:03:35.860 --> 3:03:37.860]  with the supposed explosion in cases
[3:03:37.860 --> 3:03:39.860]  of coronavirus
[3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:41.860]  so it's the border states
[3:03:41.860 --> 3:03:43.860]  we have Texas, Arizona, they're saying they have an explosion
[3:03:43.860 --> 3:03:45.860]  in cases there and of course that's bringing in
[3:03:45.860 --> 3:03:47.860]  the new mandates, the new mask laws, the new fines
[3:03:47.860 --> 3:03:49.860]  well one of the things that they're not reporting
[3:03:49.860 --> 3:03:51.860]  and I've been tracking this, I run another website
[3:03:51.860 --> 3:03:53.860]  that where we're tracking only immigration related news
[3:03:53.860 --> 3:03:55.860]  at borderhawk.news
[3:03:55.860 --> 3:03:57.860]  and so we've been tracking this for a couple weeks now
[3:03:57.860 --> 3:03:59.860]  and the info is starting to come in
[3:03:59.860 --> 3:04:01.860]  more conclusively and
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:03.860]  shockingly even CNN reported on this recently
[3:04:03.860 --> 3:04:05.860]  is that we have people coming across
[3:04:05.860 --> 3:04:07.860]  the border from Mexico
[3:04:07.860 --> 3:04:09.860]  in droves just to receive coronavirus
[3:04:09.860 --> 3:04:11.860]  treatment and a lot of them are showing up at the border
[3:04:11.860 --> 3:04:13.860]  and they're calling 911
[3:04:13.860 --> 3:04:15.860]  and they're getting brought into US medical facilities
[3:04:15.860 --> 3:04:17.860]  so that is overloading the border facilities
[3:04:17.860 --> 3:04:19.860]  and then also there are nurses
[3:04:19.860 --> 3:04:21.860]  and doctors who are saying that they're actually being
[3:04:21.860 --> 3:04:23.860]  airlifted from the border
[3:04:23.860 --> 3:04:25.860]  regions inland
[3:04:25.860 --> 3:04:27.860]  deeper into the states to other facilities
[3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:29.860]  deeper into the states so you have to do it
[3:04:29.860 --> 3:04:31.860]  because CNN has to admit that's true
[3:04:31.860 --> 3:04:33.860]  and they won't tell anybody, hey there's inhalable
[3:04:33.860 --> 3:04:35.860]  steroids that have 100% knockout rate
[3:04:35.860 --> 3:04:37.860]  because it's all pre-programmed at the hospitals
[3:04:37.860 --> 3:04:39.860]  you've got to put a tube down their throat
[3:04:39.860 --> 3:04:41.860]  so these poor Mexicans think they're coming here to get treatment
[3:04:41.860 --> 3:04:43.860]  you're about to get your ass killed
[3:04:43.860 --> 3:04:45.860]  and they're really
[3:04:45.860 --> 3:04:47.860]  abusing the system as well because it's probably not
[3:04:47.860 --> 3:04:49.860]  costing them anything, it's only costing them
[3:04:49.860 --> 3:04:51.860]  but notice that's why nothing's for free
[3:04:51.860 --> 3:04:53.860]  they're going right into a spider trap about to get killed
[3:04:53.860 --> 3:04:55.860]  that hospital is going to get $52,000
[3:04:55.860 --> 3:04:57.860]  of Corona money
[3:04:57.860 --> 3:04:59.860]  to treat them
[3:04:59.860 --> 3:05:01.860]  which leads you to believe the hospitals are
[3:05:01.860 --> 3:05:03.860]  probably perfectly fine with accepting
[3:05:03.860 --> 3:05:05.860]  as many people as one. That's why we got an ambulance
[3:05:05.860 --> 3:05:07.860]  for you sweetheart because we're going to
[3:05:07.860 --> 3:05:09.860]  put a tube down your throat, kill you and take that taxpayer
[3:05:09.860 --> 3:05:11.860]  money. Yeah and I think
[3:05:11.860 --> 3:05:13.860]  a lot of people would be shocked by the fact that you can
[3:05:13.860 --> 3:05:15.860]  come across the US border call 911
[3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:17.860]  and be brought into a medical facility and that's also
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:19.860]  happening in the UK they're coming across
[3:05:19.860 --> 3:05:21.860]  the English Channel and as soon as they reach
[3:05:21.860 --> 3:05:23.860]  UK waters they're actually calling the UK
[3:05:23.860 --> 3:05:25.860]  emergency line and they're getting picked up that way
[3:05:25.860 --> 3:05:27.860]  so our system is being totally
[3:05:27.860 --> 3:05:29.860]  overwhelmed, total cloward and piven
[3:05:29.860 --> 3:05:31.860]  style and it's just
[3:05:31.860 --> 3:05:33.860]  that's the plan, Europewars.com
[3:05:33.860 --> 3:05:35.860]  and tell folks about your new great site. Yeah
[3:05:35.860 --> 3:05:37.860]  borderhawk.news, I know people

[3:05:43.860 --> 3:05:45.860]  specifically immigration related
[3:05:45.860 --> 3:05:47.860]  stories and globalism
[3:05:47.860 --> 3:05:49.860]  nationalism and just mixing it all into one place

[3:08:27.860 --> 3:08:29.860]  don't compare
[3:08:31.860 --> 3:08:33.860]  you're listening to the
[3:08:33.860 --> 3:08:35.860]  Alex Jones show
[3:08:41.860 --> 3:08:43.860]  yeah here's our new single
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:08:45.860]  record from highwayman 2 album
[3:08:45.860 --> 3:08:49.860]  Silver Stallion
[3:09:01.860 --> 3:09:03.860]  all right I'm about to punch out of here
[3:09:03.860 --> 3:09:05.860]  and get to work on some other things
[3:09:05.860 --> 3:09:07.860]  I'll be listening to Dr. Nick Beckett while I eat my lunch
[3:09:07.860 --> 3:09:09.860]  and people always like Dr. Nick Beckett
[3:09:09.860 --> 3:09:11.860]  I remember listening to him on Art Bell
[3:09:11.860 --> 3:09:13.860]  26 27 years ago he was the most popular guest
[3:09:13.860 --> 3:09:15.860]  on then but lately people said boy
[3:09:15.860 --> 3:09:17.860]  he's really been on fire so I don't want to cut into that
[3:09:17.860 --> 3:09:19.860]  but I do have a question for him here in a moment
[3:09:19.860 --> 3:09:21.860]  but first off we're able to stay on air
[3:09:21.860 --> 3:09:23.860]  against all the Soros
[3:09:23.860 --> 3:09:25.860]  and DNC funded
[3:09:25.860 --> 3:09:27.860]  and Bloomberg funded and all the rest of it
[3:09:27.860 --> 3:09:29.860]  Hillary Clinton funded lawsuits
[3:09:29.860 --> 3:09:31.860]  we're able to go through all this and have reporters
[3:09:31.860 --> 3:09:33.860]  all over the United States and Europe
[3:09:33.860 --> 3:09:35.860]  and just really kick butt and write so many big stories

[3:09:53.860 --> 3:09:55.860]  they've been sold out for a while

[3:10:15.860 --> 3:10:17.860]  earthpulse.com

[3:10:19.860 --> 3:10:21.860]  with the books and films of Dr. Nick Begich and the Writings
[3:10:21.860 --> 3:10:23.860]  we also carry some of his books and films
[3:10:23.860 --> 3:10:25.860]  and then foldwarestore.com as well so be sure and get those
[3:10:25.860 --> 3:10:27.860]  okay doc here's my question
[3:10:27.860 --> 3:10:29.860]  and I know you got your own stuff to get into I'll be listening
[3:10:29.860 --> 3:10:31.860]  how do you handle the Southern Primary Law Center
[3:10:31.860 --> 3:10:33.860]  and ADL
[3:10:33.860 --> 3:10:35.860]  when
[3:10:35.860 --> 3:10:37.860]  they constantly want to make things racial
[3:10:37.860 --> 3:10:39.860]  just like the left when that's not
[3:10:39.860 --> 3:10:41.860]  what I'm trying to do
[3:10:41.860 --> 3:10:43.860]  and when they constantly try to attack
[3:10:43.860 --> 3:10:45.860]  and literally say we're going to arrest you
[3:10:45.860 --> 3:10:47.860]  if you disagree with us
[3:10:47.860 --> 3:10:49.860]  we're going to purge you and then they
[3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:51.860]  and then they defame you
[3:10:51.860 --> 3:10:53.860]  and they're the closest thing I could find
[3:10:53.860 --> 3:10:55.860]  the
[3:10:55.860 --> 3:10:57.860]  the NAACP now does stuff like this
[3:10:57.860 --> 3:10:59.860]  the left has gone psychotic
[3:10:59.860 --> 3:11:01.860]  where do you think this is going and what are the controllers behind the scenes doing
[3:11:01.860 --> 3:11:03.860]  and how do you respond to them
[3:11:03.860 --> 3:11:05.860]  well you know I think it's all about
[3:11:05.860 --> 3:11:07.860]  controlling speech
[3:11:07.860 --> 3:11:09.860]  I mean ultimately that's what's going on here
[3:11:09.860 --> 3:11:11.860]  and even the most
[3:11:11.860 --> 3:11:13.860]  repugnant speech
[3:11:13.860 --> 3:11:15.860]  I think is entitled to an airing
[3:11:15.860 --> 3:11:17.860]  because it's really simple in the 21st century
[3:11:17.860 --> 3:11:19.860]  to change shadows
[3:11:19.860 --> 3:11:21.860]  you know there's exceptions like yelling
[3:11:21.860 --> 3:11:23.860]  fire in a movie theater which are obvious
[3:11:23.860 --> 3:11:25.860]  but short of that
[3:11:25.860 --> 3:11:27.860]  the right to not be offended
[3:11:27.860 --> 3:11:29.860]  is not a right
[3:11:29.860 --> 3:11:31.860]  in fact I would suggest the opposite
[3:11:31.860 --> 3:11:33.860]  you're going to live in a democratic republic like ours
[3:11:33.860 --> 3:11:35.860]  where
[3:11:35.860 --> 3:11:37.860]  speech is allowed
[3:11:37.860 --> 3:11:39.860]  then offending others is kind of
[3:11:39.860 --> 3:11:41.860]  going to go with the program
[3:11:41.860 --> 3:11:43.860]  because it's unavoidable
[3:11:43.860 --> 3:11:45.860]  so how do we counter this incredible un-Americanism
[3:11:45.860 --> 3:11:47.860]  that's all you in run
[3:11:47.860 --> 3:11:49.860]  how do we counter people saying we control what you can say
[3:11:49.860 --> 3:11:51.860]  with their finger in our face
[3:11:51.860 --> 3:11:53.860]  it's so dangerous
[3:11:53.860 --> 3:11:55.860]  you know when I look at it fundamentally
[3:11:55.860 --> 3:11:57.860]  I mean we're on such an edge
[3:11:57.860 --> 3:11:59.860]  because you really don't have a freedom of the press
[3:11:59.860 --> 3:12:01.860]  which is the fundamental
[3:12:01.860 --> 3:12:03.860]  of the speech issue that we're talking about
[3:12:03.860 --> 3:12:05.860]  because the alternative
[3:12:05.860 --> 3:12:07.860]  press is more reliable quite frankly
[3:12:07.860 --> 3:12:09.860]  and we see things
[3:12:09.860 --> 3:12:11.860]  way before it's advanced
[3:12:11.860 --> 3:12:13.860]  if ever advanced in the mainstream
[3:12:13.860 --> 3:12:15.860]  and I think when you
[3:12:15.860 --> 3:12:17.860]  look at it it's about controlling
[3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:19.860]  the general thought
[3:12:19.860 --> 3:12:21.860]  and emotions of the population
[3:12:21.860 --> 3:12:23.860]  and directing us in very specific
[3:12:23.860 --> 3:12:25.860]  ways and all the media
[3:12:25.860 --> 3:12:27.860]  is being used to this it's not just about
[3:12:27.860 --> 3:12:29.860]  silencing those that have something else to say
[3:12:29.860 --> 3:12:31.860]  it's also using those
[3:12:31.860 --> 3:12:33.860]  that play the game
[3:12:33.860 --> 3:12:35.860]  even more so to manipulate the general public
[3:12:35.860 --> 3:12:37.860]  into this kind of herd
[3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:39.860]  mentality
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:41.860]  what do we just call out the whole elephant in the room
[3:12:41.860 --> 3:12:43.860]  and point out that that's the in-game
[3:12:43.860 --> 3:12:45.860]  and don't even debate each little point they make
[3:12:45.860 --> 3:12:47.860]  to shut us up
[3:12:47.860 --> 3:12:49.860]  transcend that and expose the whole system of what their in-game is
[3:12:49.860 --> 3:12:51.860]  I think that's important
[3:12:51.860 --> 3:12:53.860]  but I also think at some level
[3:12:53.860 --> 3:12:55.860]  and this is where listeners can come into the game
[3:12:55.860 --> 3:12:57.860]  because the best
[3:12:57.860 --> 3:12:59.860]  free speech lawsuit that could get
[3:12:59.860 --> 3:13:01.860]  to the Supreme Court
[3:13:01.860 --> 3:13:03.860]  is info wars and what's happened here
[3:13:03.860 --> 3:13:05.860]  because this is the beginning of it not the
[3:13:05.860 --> 3:13:07.860]  end of it and you know
[3:13:07.860 --> 3:13:09.860]  that's something that people need to get behind
[3:13:09.860 --> 3:13:11.860]  get behind this network because at some
[3:13:11.860 --> 3:13:13.860]  point this has to be challenged
[3:13:13.860 --> 3:13:15.860]  because the
[3:13:15.860 --> 3:13:17.860]  oligarchs of the information
[3:13:17.860 --> 3:13:19.860]  age are not in Russia
[3:13:19.860 --> 3:13:21.860]  and are not in China they're in the west
[3:13:21.860 --> 3:13:23.860]  and they're controlling the flow
[3:13:23.860 --> 3:13:25.860]  of data and that flow of data
[3:13:25.860 --> 3:13:27.860]  determines outcomes on every
[3:13:27.860 --> 3:13:29.860]  single level
[3:13:29.860 --> 3:13:31.860]  social, political, cultural,
[3:13:31.860 --> 3:13:33.860]  religious, every single level
[3:13:33.860 --> 3:13:35.860]  you cannot control
[3:13:35.860 --> 3:13:37.860]  the global dialogue without
[3:13:37.860 --> 3:13:39.860]  snuffing out the essence
[3:13:39.860 --> 3:13:41.860]  of free speech and humanities
[3:13:41.860 --> 3:13:43.860]  essence because this is fundamental
[3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:45.860]  to who we are it has to do with
[3:13:45.860 --> 3:13:47.860]  choice it has to do with
[3:13:47.860 --> 3:13:49.860]  interaction with each other the dynamic
[3:13:49.860 --> 3:13:51.860]  of working against
[3:13:51.860 --> 3:13:53.860]  each other a bit in order to refine
[3:13:53.860 --> 3:13:55.860]  what we're about
[3:13:55.860 --> 3:13:57.860]  and we can do that respectfully
[3:13:57.860 --> 3:13:59.860]  and doc you're totally right I'm going to let you get on to what you're doing
[3:13:59.860 --> 3:14:01.860]  I apologize for taking some of the time
[3:14:01.860 --> 3:14:03.860]  but I want to put up this map for a second
[3:14:03.860 --> 3:14:05.860]  of the Associated Press
[3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:07.860]  at the very top of this pyramid
[3:14:07.860 --> 3:14:09.860]  this is something that left us put out a few years ago
[3:14:09.860 --> 3:14:11.860]  look info wars is the most unreliable
[3:14:11.860 --> 3:14:13.860]  with gateway pun of it
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:15.860]  AP is the most reliable
[3:14:15.860 --> 3:14:17.860]  I mean and CNN is very reliable
[3:14:17.860 --> 3:14:19.860]  I mean what a joke
[3:14:19.860 --> 3:14:21.860]  go ahead and take over
[3:14:21.860 --> 3:14:23.860]  and you know all of this
[3:14:23.860 --> 3:14:25.860]  suggesting that the modern media
[3:14:25.860 --> 3:14:27.860]  is reliable about anything
[3:14:27.860 --> 3:14:29.860]  is laughable
[3:14:29.860 --> 3:14:31.860]  it is not even responsible
[3:14:31.860 --> 3:14:33.860]  as a media outlet because
[3:14:33.860 --> 3:14:35.860]  freedom of the press fundamentally
[3:14:35.860 --> 3:14:37.860]  has been altered in terms of
[3:14:37.860 --> 3:14:39.860]  its depth of meaning and we've lost
[3:14:39.860 --> 3:14:41.860]  that depth of meaning in the cartoon
[3:14:41.860 --> 3:14:43.860]  news of
[3:14:43.860 --> 3:14:45.860]  what we see on CNN and
[3:14:45.860 --> 3:14:47.860]  the big networks because
[3:14:47.860 --> 3:14:49.860]  what they've done is reduced
[3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:51.860]  to an editorial profiling
[3:14:51.860 --> 3:14:53.860]  of everything to herd people
[3:14:53.860 --> 3:14:55.860]  news in the fundamentals
[3:14:55.860 --> 3:14:57.860]  of freedom of the press
[3:14:57.860 --> 3:14:59.860]  why was it so important
[3:14:59.860 --> 3:15:01.860]  why was it in the first
[3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:03.860]  10 you know
[3:15:03.860 --> 3:15:05.860]  within our framework
[3:15:05.860 --> 3:15:07.860]  within our
[3:15:07.860 --> 3:15:09.860]  framework constitutionally
[3:15:09.860 --> 3:15:11.860]  why was the press so important
[3:15:11.860 --> 3:15:13.860]  it's because an informed electorate
[3:15:13.860 --> 3:15:15.860]  that's you, me, everyone
[3:15:15.860 --> 3:15:17.860]  that forms the basis
[3:15:17.860 --> 3:15:19.860]  of this democratic republic
[3:15:19.860 --> 3:15:21.860]  individual sovereignty
[3:15:21.860 --> 3:15:23.860]  individual people and from
[3:15:23.860 --> 3:15:25.860]  that brings the authority
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:27.860]  of government to govern
[3:15:27.860 --> 3:15:29.860]  not in some other obscure way
[3:15:29.860 --> 3:15:31.860]  and the reason that we have
[3:15:31.860 --> 3:15:33.860]  a republic and elected representatives
[3:15:33.860 --> 3:15:35.860]  is to avoid exactly what
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:37.860]  we see the left doing right now
[3:15:37.860 --> 3:15:39.860]  mob rule
[3:15:39.860 --> 3:15:41.860]  mob rule doesn't work
[3:15:41.860 --> 3:15:43.860]  it's a failure
[3:15:43.860 --> 3:15:45.860]  it's a failure within the republic
[3:15:45.860 --> 3:15:47.860]  it's only
[3:15:47.860 --> 3:15:49.860]  required if it fails
[3:15:49.860 --> 3:15:51.860]  if the democracy fails
[3:15:51.860 --> 3:15:53.860]  and it's not yet failed
[3:15:53.860 --> 3:15:55.860]  we still have free elections
[3:15:55.860 --> 3:15:57.860]  we still have a process
[3:15:57.860 --> 3:15:59.860]  but we need to do some things
[3:15:59.860 --> 3:16:01.860]  to protect it right now
[3:16:01.860 --> 3:16:03.860]  we should never have an electronic voting system
[3:16:03.860 --> 3:16:05.860]  you know I want to say this real loud
[3:16:05.860 --> 3:16:07.860]  some things should never be put
[3:16:07.860 --> 3:16:09.860]  electronic the fundamentals
[3:16:09.860 --> 3:16:11.860]  of elections should be paper balance
[3:16:11.860 --> 3:16:13.860]  the fundamentals of free speech
[3:16:13.860 --> 3:16:15.860]  we should be allowed
[3:16:15.860 --> 3:16:17.860]  to say what we believe in
[3:16:17.860 --> 3:16:19.860]  freely and access the internet
[3:16:19.860 --> 3:16:21.860]  and all of the modern platforms
[3:16:21.860 --> 3:16:23.860]  and anyone who believes they have the authority
[3:16:23.860 --> 3:16:25.860]  to regulate speech
[3:16:25.860 --> 3:16:27.860]  is dead wrong
[3:16:27.860 --> 3:16:29.860]  I don't care who they are
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:31.860]  I don't care
[3:16:31.860 --> 3:16:33.860]  who they are if they want to be the gatekeepers
[3:16:33.860 --> 3:16:35.860]  of speech
[3:16:35.860 --> 3:16:37.860]  they're on the slippery slope to hell
[3:16:37.860 --> 3:16:39.860]  because speech cannot
[3:16:39.860 --> 3:16:41.860]  be regulated in this way
[3:16:41.860 --> 3:16:43.860]  this is fundamentally
[3:16:43.860 --> 3:16:45.860]  the trap
[3:16:45.860 --> 3:16:47.860]  first control the media
[3:16:47.860 --> 3:16:49.860]  by allowing it to all consolidate
[3:16:49.860 --> 3:16:51.860]  we ought to break it up again
[3:16:51.860 --> 3:16:53.860]  we got to break it all up again
[3:16:53.860 --> 3:16:55.860]  but want to look at it this time
[3:16:55.860 --> 3:16:57.860]  when you break up these big networks
[3:16:57.860 --> 3:16:59.860]  usually the people that don't even make more money
[3:16:59.860 --> 3:17:01.860]  and have even more power
[3:17:01.860 --> 3:17:03.860]  so you need to look at how this happens
[3:17:03.860 --> 3:17:05.860]  to disassemble what is blocked
[3:17:05.860 --> 3:17:07.860]  this republic's free speech
[3:17:07.860 --> 3:17:09.860]  because that violation
[3:17:09.860 --> 3:17:11.860]  of human rights violation
[3:17:11.860 --> 3:17:13.860]  in every jurisdiction in the country
[3:17:13.860 --> 3:17:15.860]  file a human rights complaint
[3:17:15.860 --> 3:17:17.860]  with the Human Rights Commission
[3:17:17.860 --> 3:17:19.860]  in your jurisdiction
[3:17:19.860 --> 3:17:21.860]  and challenge the silence of our speech
