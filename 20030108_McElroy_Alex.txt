[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation. We're going to have open phones this hour.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  I know we've got folks patiently holding and come up in about 22 minutes.
[00:21.000 --> 00:29.000]  We're going to be joined by a bar owner where the police just come in in Virginia now and arrest most of the people in the bar, even if they haven't been drinking.
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  This is the new system where we're all criminals, as the criminals take control of the society and basically put us in reservations.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  Plantations is what the cities have been turned into for the new world order.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  In the last segment I was reading about trial for 11 Miami offices accused of planting guns and cover-ups.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  There's also been convictions for police drug dealing.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  I'll tell you that elements of the APD control narcotics and prostitution here in the city of Austin.
[00:58.000 --> 01:07.000]  That's been in the news in the back of the paper once or twice, but it's not as important as how to mow your yard or how to report on your neighbor for watering on the wrong day, but you know how it is.
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  The government loves you.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  And we're joined by Bess McElroy, who helped nominate the new civilian review board.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  We'll see what happens with that review board or what type of powers this review board has.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  First off, Bess, tell us about yourself.
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  I am the immediate past president of PULSE, P-U-L-S-E, which stands for People United to Lead the Struggle for Equality.
[01:31.000 --> 01:40.000]  This is a grassroots civil rights organization here in Miami, Florida, and we address concerns of the citizens.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  And because there were so many shootings, as well as other misconduct by police officers,
[01:47.000 --> 01:58.000]  and these police officers were not being, in our opinion, in the citizens' opinion, were not being held accountable for their actions, we felt something needed to be done.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  There were a lot of questionable shootings.
[02:01.000 --> 02:16.000]  For example, there was a shooting of a man, some 122 times, the man allegedly was selling drugs from his home, and when the cops went there, there was no drugs found.
[02:17.000 --> 02:28.000]  The cops said that the man pushed something out of the window, and when the window was investigated, there was no way that he could push anything out of the window because the window did not open.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  It only had a little tiny hole in it.
[02:31.000 --> 02:44.000]  Also, there have been cases, I guess you could use Texas as an example, in Austin and Houston, where it's the wrong house and they shoot somebody 12 times in the back, and then they get caught planting a gun when the person didn't even own a gun.
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  Or they kill a couple of their own SWAT team people and then try to blame it on a guy who didn't even own a gun, and then later the cops admit, okay, we killed our own officers, we tried to frame him.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  I mean, not only do they shoot their own officers shoot innocent people, then after they've killed you, they demonize you by planting a gun on you.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  In fact, police have gone public now, this is a fact, according to these police officers, that they have been planting guns on those they've been killing.
[03:07.000 --> 03:23.000]  Yes, we suspected that, and after talking with several people within those ranks, you know, police officers fear for their lives, which is why they don't come forth publicly in most cases and give information,
[03:23.000 --> 03:33.000]  but I have talked to enough of them to gather enough information to feed to the U.S. Attorney, and that's what we mostly did.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  We got information and we fed it to the U.S. Attorney and kept pushing him and pushing him.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Well, here you are, a woman in Florida, who's got more courage than these other so-called good cops, and I'm tired of the cowardice.
[03:46.000 --> 03:56.000]  I'm tired of women and children and men in our communities having to go out and do all the work when so many so-called good officers stand by and let this stuff happen.
[03:56.000 --> 04:08.000]  Yes, that's exactly what was happening here in Miami. You know, the whole department really had become corrupt because I believe in guilt by omission and omission.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  If you know it's happening and you don't come forth and say something about it, then you too are guilty as far as I'm concerned.
[04:14.000 --> 04:23.000]  It's called being compromised. That's the first thing corrupt detectives will do is try to get you to take some drugs or stolen jewelry to get you compromised.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  Then they can trust you and move you into the next level.
[04:28.000 --> 04:38.000]  Now, I want to point out something here to you. If you research the Constitution and civil rights and God-given rights, the term Civilian Review Board,
[04:38.000 --> 04:48.000]  since when are police and our elected officials the military, and that means we're under military law, which is how they're getting the Patriot Act through and all this,
[04:48.000 --> 05:04.000]  I would ask, I would try to get the name change to Citizen Review Board instead of Civilian Review Board, because last time I checked, the public officials are servants, not military occupation leaders.
[05:04.000 --> 05:18.000]  Well, we kicked the name around quite a bit in what name we would come up with. We had several names, and Citizen was one of them, and we ended up with the Civilian Review Panel,
[05:18.000 --> 05:24.000]  which is to be made up of ordinary citizens within the city of Miami.
[05:24.000 --> 05:36.000]  What I'm saying is, you know, inside an occupied city, say in occupied Germany or Japan, they would have Citizen Review Boards about soldiers raping and killing, and it was called Civilian Review Boards,
[05:36.000 --> 05:46.000]  and this has been suggested by government. Oh, we'll call it Civilian Review Board, and nice people like yourself picked that up. I would investigate that term and what that means.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  You probably heard about how they want to get rid of Posse Comitatus and put troops on the streets. That's been in the news. Have you heard about that?
[05:52.000 --> 06:02.000]  Well, believe me, this is getting you ready for that. Then you'll be overseeing what the military does. They've been involved with their aircraft for a while in the war on drugs, the war on their competition,
[06:02.000 --> 06:14.000]  but now they're getting ready for it just for general crimes. I'd watch out, because down the road, it means big trouble, because under military rule, you don't have any rights.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  So, in this particular case, with the planting of the guns and the drugs, what happened?
[06:20.000 --> 06:32.000]  Well, they're getting ready now to go to trial. They're in the process now of going to trial for all of that. They're right now selecting the jury,
[06:32.000 --> 06:43.000]  and then after they get the jury seated, then they're going to go into the actual trial. But as far as anything happening, nothing has happened so far.
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.000]  Well, we have officers, and the evidence clearly shows, and the paper comes right out with it, what are the officers, the two that blew the whistle on the other 11,
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  what are they allegedly, what are they saying allegedly happened?
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  The ones that blew the whistle?
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  Yes.
[06:59.000 --> 07:07.000]  Well, you know, they gave their story, they're going to be testifying for the government. They're going to be witnesses for the government.
[07:07.000 --> 07:19.000]  And, I mean, I've got some detail here in the article, but they're saying that in cases of multiple shootings of unarmed folks, they would plant guns. Can you give us any more detail on that?
[07:19.000 --> 07:31.000]  No, not really, because that's basically, you know, that's basically what we know, what we've been told, that in many of these instances where they have shot people,
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  for whatever reason they shot them, then they go back and plant these rubbers to cover up for themselves, certainly they were not in fear of their lives.
[07:41.000 --> 07:50.000]  Did they shoot the wrong person? I mean, just for a while it began to seem like just open target practice here in Miami. We just shoot people.
[07:50.000 --> 07:59.000]  And, of course, when you shoot, you shoot the kills. There have been innocent, I mean, there have been many innocent people who have gotten shot, who had no weapons.
[07:59.000 --> 08:13.000]  They also like to spray nearby houses, and with hundreds of rounds in some of the cases in Miami and around the country, I know that they then use the statistics of people shot to death as part of their statistics of the, you know, people that have been killed by guns.
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  It's just amazing, and a lot of cops kill their own officers. Have you had any of that in Miami? Because we've got a lot of that here in Austin.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  No, no, I'm not aware of any of that. I'm not aware of not even one instance where a cop's got another cop.
[08:27.000 --> 08:41.000]  It happens on a lot of SWAT team raids. In the last year, Lubbock, Austin, Houston, Fort Worth, it's been happening in every city, really.
[08:41.000 --> 08:54.000]  Yes, well, I'm not aware of that, but I will say this, that, you know, it's rather ironic now that we've got the civilian investigative panel about to be seated.
[08:54.000 --> 09:03.000]  Since we've passed and gotten this into, gotten this panel established, we haven't had these shootings.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  So it's a testament to what getting involved, having courage, blowing the whistle, standing up, what it can do.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  Exactly, because now we haven't had any.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  Does your organization have a website?
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  No, we don't have a website.
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  How long has your organization been working to finally put the spotlight on these shootings?
[09:28.000 --> 09:39.000]  Well, now, the organization came into being back in the early 80s, 1981, following a riot that was following what we referred to as the McDuffett riot,
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  where an insurance guy was shot and killed by police officers, and it created a riot.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  So this organization came into being as a result of that.
[09:51.000 --> 10:03.000]  And as far as the new oversight board, we began to work on that in May of last year in putting that board together.
[10:03.000 --> 10:13.000]  Attempts had been made previously back in the early 90s to put in such a board, but we weren't able to get it into being.
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  Well, I think it's a natural response to riot when somebody who's unarmed gets shot 120-something times in the back.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  In one of the cases here in the paper.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Yeah, there was one guy who was shot 120- one man in his home was shot 122 times.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  And back in L.A., they shot one guy so many times, like 500 times, his body disintegrated, it was like jello.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  I don't mean to get too descriptive, but did you hear about the street teams, the special anti-gang teams in L.A.?
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  I think we lost her.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  Oh, I'm here.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  Oh, great. Must have been somebody calling you.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  That ran the cocaine, that ran the heroin, that ran the prostitution, and gave each other awards for shooting innocent people.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  Did you hear about that?
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  I hear about so many, I probably did, but I just can't point it right this moment.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  Well, this shows premeditation to a level where there are criminal gangs giving each other awards for killing people.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  You said this is in L.A.?
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  Yes.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  They give each other awards for killing somebody?
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  Yeah, that was three years ago, and by the way, they just dropped all the indictments.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  They admit it happened, they admit they did all this, but they just went ahead and dropped all the charges after everybody forgot about it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  I guess that's kind of the tactic, drag out these investigations until no one gets charged.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  Yes, that's another thing, too, it just drags out forever and then you don't hear about it anymore.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  Bess McElroy, thank you so much for joining us, and thank you for your courage, ma'am.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  Thank you.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  God bless.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  All right, I'm going to come back, I'm going to take some calls, then I'm going to hit some other news from around the world,
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  and we've got another guest coming on where you go into a bar, haven't even drunk a beer yet, and they arrest you.
