[00:00.000 --> 00:29.400]  Alright, next segment, I am going to reveal the most important person in the world.
[00:29.400 --> 00:39.640]  I am going to reveal the most important person in the world and the reason that is important
[00:39.640 --> 00:46.060]  is if you understand that information you will then understand everything else.
[00:46.060 --> 00:55.400]  This is a Rosetta Stone, this is a skeleton key, this is the understanding of everything
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.200]  if you can understand this and I know you will understand it but if you can get your
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.080]  friends, your family, your neighbors, perfect strangers to understand it then we will truly
[01:04.080 --> 01:06.320]  be in a different world.
[01:06.320 --> 01:12.160]  Now this most important person in the world does not know they are the most important
[01:12.160 --> 01:22.440]  person in the world and that is why we are going to reveal why this person is the most
[01:22.440 --> 01:28.240]  important person in the world because as soon as the most important important important
[01:28.240 --> 01:37.640]  person in the world understands that then we will truly be able to turn the tide against
[01:37.640 --> 01:41.160]  the new world order.
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.080]  Now Novak Djokovic is not the most important person in the world but he is right up there
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.960]  at the top and the spirit of what he is doing is the essence of what we are about to cover
[01:51.960 --> 01:56.240]  because there is a little twist to who this most important person in the world is but
[01:56.240 --> 02:00.080]  here is Paul Joseph Watson talking about what is happening in the land of tyranny formally
[02:00.080 --> 02:13.400]  known as the land down under.
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.920]  So we played this tape for you last time, we were surprised by it, we prefaced it by
[02:17.920 --> 02:21.400]  saying every conservative appreciates Ted Cruz because he is one of the smartest and
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.080]  most articulate people in the Congress and he is conservative but he referred publicly
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.600]  to what happened on January 6th as what a violent terror attack, here it is.
[02:32.600 --> 02:38.880]  We are approaching a solemn anniversary this week and it is an anniversary of a violent
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.920]  terrorist attack on the capital where we saw the men and women of law enforcement demonstrate
[02:44.920 --> 02:52.240]  incredible courage, incredible bravery, risk their lives to defend the men and women who
[02:52.240 --> 02:55.000]  serve in this capital.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.600]  Senator Cruz was game enough to come on tonight, we appreciate that, he joins us now.
[02:58.600 --> 03:00.760]  Senator thanks so much for coming on.
[03:00.760 --> 03:04.040]  So I guess what I mean there are a lot of dumb people in the Congress, you are not one
[03:04.040 --> 03:11.360]  of them, think you are smarter than I am and you never use words carelessly and yet you
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.920]  called this a terror attack when by no definition was it a terror attack, that is a lie, you
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.960]  told that lie on purpose and I am wondering why you did.
[03:20.960 --> 03:25.040]  Well Tucker thank you for having me on, when you aired your episode last night I sent you
[03:25.040 --> 03:30.040]  a text shortly thereafter and said, you know, can we try this again next segment with the
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.760]  joke of it saying, it was sloppy and it was frankly dumb, I don't buy that, whoa, I don't
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.400]  buy that, look I have known you a long time before you went to the Senate, you are a Supreme
[03:39.400 --> 03:44.000]  Court contender, you take words as seriously as any man who has ever served in the Senate
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  and every word, you repeated that phrase, I do not believe that you use that accidentally
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.480]  and just don't.
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.160]  So Tucker as a result of my sloppy phrasing it has caused a lot of people to misunderstand
[03:55.160 --> 04:01.040]  what I meant, let me tell you what I meant to say, what I was referring to are the limited
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.960]  number of people who engaged in violent attacks against police officers, I think you and I
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.720]  both agree that if you assault a police officer you should go to jail, that's who I was talking
[04:11.720 --> 04:16.440]  about and the reason the phrasing was sloppy is I have talked dozens if not hundreds of
[04:16.440 --> 04:22.320]  times, I've drawn a distinction, I wasn't saying that thousands of peaceful protestors
[04:22.320 --> 04:28.440]  supporting Donald Trump are somehow terrorists, I wasn't saying the millions of patriots across
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.280]  the country supporting President Trump are terrorists and that's what a lot of people
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.280]  have misunderstood that.
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.960]  Wait a second, but hold on, what you just said doesn't make sense, so if somebody assaults
[04:37.960 --> 04:41.880]  a cop he should be charged and go to jail, I couldn't agree more, we've said that for
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.440]  years, but that person is still not a terrorist, how many people have been charged with terrorism
[04:47.440 --> 04:53.920]  on January 6th, why do you use that word, you're playing into the other side's characterization
[04:53.920 --> 04:59.400]  that as Joe Kent just explained allows them to define an entire population as foreign
[04:59.400 --> 05:00.400]  combatants.
[05:00.400 --> 05:06.720]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.480]  the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year all at the same time making
[05:11.480 --> 05:16.240]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[05:16.240 --> 05:21.080]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.080]  in stock.
[05:22.080 --> 05:27.080]  Winter sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3, take it under the tongue for higher absorption
[05:27.080 --> 05:32.200]  is back in stock, despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[05:32.200 --> 05:37.680]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal iodine,
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.920]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[05:41.920 --> 05:45.440]  activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[05:45.440 --> 05:50.800]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen,
[05:50.800 --> 05:57.040]  give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com
[05:57.040 --> 06:04.040]  50% off for a limited time, thanks for keeping us on the air.
[06:27.040 --> 06:45.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, January 7th of the year, it's 2022, and we're going
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.640]  to be here today for the next four hours ahead of the war room that comes on with Owen Schroyer
[06:50.640 --> 06:53.600]  at 3pm central.
[06:53.600 --> 07:00.160]  And there's nothing more frustrating than knowing we have the answers and the key to
[07:00.160 --> 07:05.040]  defeating this evil takeover and stopping at deadness tracks.
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.120]  But instead, I just can't get people conscious, I can't get people focused, I can't get the
[07:10.120 --> 07:14.600]  message punched out enough to actually finally finish these people.
[07:14.600 --> 07:20.200]  And so that means we're going to go into a very long, hellish nightmare, and most people
[07:20.200 --> 07:24.360]  listening and watching will be dead in 10 years, that's Klaus Schwab's promise.
[07:24.360 --> 07:29.560]  He's sworn to kill you and your family, he's put his people in over 100 nations, and they're
[07:29.560 --> 07:33.400]  running their global lockdown shutdowns right now, preparing you for the real bio weapon
[07:33.400 --> 07:38.280]  they're going to release, cyber lockdown, cyber shutdowns, collapse of the third world
[07:38.280 --> 07:44.320]  completely, being totally overrun, war on the streets, electricity going off for years,
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.040]  just absolute death and destruction is guaranteed.
[07:49.040 --> 07:54.160]  And I talk to everybody who is a patriot basically in the establishment, they all agree that's
[07:54.160 --> 07:56.960]  the plan, that's what's going down.
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.080]  We are the tip of the spear here covering this on air and discussing it.
[08:01.080 --> 08:10.360]  And so I'm very frustrated, I'm very angry because I have this weight on my shoulders
[08:10.360 --> 08:14.080]  and I know I'm right, and I know it's going down, and I have all their own admissions
[08:14.080 --> 08:20.120]  and documents, and I can't get people out of their trances, everybody's in their comfort
[08:20.120 --> 08:27.200]  zone, and so the enemy's going to win, because they're going to incrementally collapse society
[08:27.200 --> 08:30.280]  while posing as the saviors the whole time.
[08:30.280 --> 08:38.960]  So I'm going to deliver the most important information ever, that if people actually
[08:38.960 --> 08:42.560]  grasp it and get it and understand it, we're going to be able to turn society around and
[08:42.560 --> 08:44.240]  beat this.
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.680]  But all this other incredible news I've got in front of me and it's all very important
[08:48.680 --> 08:57.700]  is a byproduct of the disease that is the New World Order.
[08:57.700 --> 09:02.040]  And so that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:02.040 --> 09:07.240]  I've got to go to rebroadcast for a while, and this is not a stunt I pull, it's not,
[09:07.240 --> 09:10.240]  I may not be able to do the show anymore because I just can't come in here and do it anymore.
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.120]  I hate it, I can't stand it, and I'm sick of just window dressing, talking about all
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.720]  the stuff that's going on, and the general public just doesn't even care that we're
[09:18.720 --> 09:19.720]  all falling apart.
[09:19.720 --> 09:23.520]  I mean, you know, they think it's funny that Klaus Wabbs up, they're murdering everyone.
[09:23.520 --> 09:27.840]  So see, I don't want to just say a bunch of nasty stuff, and I'm going to try my best
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.840]  here, but it's getting hard.
[09:31.840 --> 09:39.760]  So we got a lot of really good reports here, and I'm going to try to relaunch the show
[09:39.760 --> 09:41.920]  later in the hour, but I can't do it right now.
[09:41.920 --> 09:46.600]  So let's just go ahead, I tried to come back on, I just can't do it, guys.
[09:46.600 --> 09:53.040]  It's, let's say Greg Reese's report from yesterday, that was a really, really important
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.760]  report about the nanotech they put in the shots, and what it's doing, and that's just
[09:56.760 --> 10:02.400]  the tip of the iceberg to admit government documents, they're adding protein prions to
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.080]  it as well, and they're giving basically people mad cow disease.
[10:06.080 --> 10:09.200]  So and that's just what does to your brain, not to mention your heart and your whole body.
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.120]  So I mean, I've got stacks of news here of little kids dying after the shots of heart
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.360]  attacks and brain lesions, and it's all cute, and it's all funny, and it's all ha ha ha,
[10:20.360 --> 10:21.520]  you know, on and on and on.
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.880]  So we're going to play Greg Reese's report, and I'm going to go walk around the parking
[10:25.880 --> 10:29.280]  lot and see if I can settle down, and that's that.
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.320]  So we'll be back, I guess, after this break, and I'm going to try to relaunch the show
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.000]  here today, infowars.com and newswars.com will still be there, hopefully, I don't know
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.480]  how much longer, and it just doesn't matter.
[10:42.480 --> 10:44.160]  I guess you've all just got to die.
[10:44.160 --> 10:46.920]  I mean, really, you don't, they're going to murder you, then you deserve it.
[10:46.920 --> 10:49.760]  All of you deserve to die because you don't care, and Claas Schwab's going to kill your
[10:49.760 --> 10:52.960]  ass, so get ready to die, okay?
[10:52.960 --> 10:54.840]  And they're going to kill the kids so we deserve to die, okay?
[10:54.840 --> 10:55.840]  That's basically it.
[10:55.840 --> 10:56.840]  So enjoy yourselves, everybody.
[10:56.840 --> 10:57.840]  Here's the clip.
[10:57.840 --> 11:08.360]  Ricardo Delgado has a master's in biostatistics.
[11:08.360 --> 11:14.400]  His postgraduate studies included microbiology, epidemiology, and immunology.
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.760]  He is the founder of the fifth column.
[11:16.760 --> 11:23.080]  Delgado has published videos of electron microscopy taken at the University of Almeria in Spain
[11:23.080 --> 11:30.800]  of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, showing what can best be described as self-organizing nanostructures.
[11:30.800 --> 11:37.920]  The videos show that as the Pfizer mRNA vaccine evaporates, nanosize structures begin to form
[11:37.920 --> 11:44.240]  multiple structures that appear to be the same things, things that look like microchips
[11:44.240 --> 11:46.840]  and electronic circuitry.
[11:46.840 --> 11:53.040]  Pfizer has reportedly made 33 different batches, which have all been cataloged in a database,
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.560]  some dangerous and others seemingly innocuous.
[11:56.560 --> 12:02.200]  So these things maybe aren't in every vial, but the FDA has said that they need 75 years
[12:02.200 --> 12:05.920]  to tell us all the details, so maybe they are.
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.240]  At a World Economic Forum 2018 conference, the chief executive officer of Pfizer expressed
[12:12.240 --> 12:18.160]  excitement for invasive nanotech, referring to the recent FDA approval of a tablet with
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.320]  a sensor that can notify medical authorities of compliance.
[12:22.320 --> 12:30.000]  It is basically a biological chip that it is in the tablet, and once you take the tablet
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.200]  and dissolve it into your stomach, it sends a signal, but you took the tablet.
[12:34.200 --> 12:38.440]  So imagine the applications of that compliance.
[12:38.440 --> 12:45.040]  Later that year, a nanotransistor chip is unveiled that replaces silicone with air.
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.080]  Just this week, a COVID implantable microchip developer claimed, we will be chipped whether
[12:50.080 --> 12:52.320]  we like it or not.
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.720]  There has been much talk about graphene oxide and nanotech in the vaccines, which the media
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.640]  vehemently claims is not true.
[13:00.640 --> 13:06.240]  But how would they know, and why would anyone trust a word that they say about any of this?
[13:06.240 --> 13:11.000]  If there are nanocircuits being created within the bodies of the vaccinated, this would explain
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.160]  the videos we've seen of IP addresses coming from the jabbed.
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.440]  A newly activated network of nanocircuits, unique to each individual.
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.560]  One of the leading experts of nanotechnology, Charles Lieber, has written patents describing
[13:26.560 --> 13:33.160]  a technology that has the potential to self-assemble into tiny computer systems capable of controlling
[13:33.160 --> 13:39.200]  human neurology, which is exactly what Delgado's electron microscopy of the Pfizer jab appears
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.600]  to be.
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.360]  Charles Lieber was just convicted on numerous crimes for working with the Communist Chinese
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.480]  in Wuhan, where Pfizer ran a research and development facility.
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.280]  Elon Musk expects to be implanting his neural link into human beings this year, and claims
[13:56.280 --> 14:01.160]  that they could put you fully into virtual reality, as if this is somehow important for
[14:01.160 --> 14:02.440]  humanity.
[14:02.440 --> 14:04.400]  For humanity, it isn't.
[14:04.400 --> 14:07.640]  But for the transhumanist, it's a necessity.
[14:07.640 --> 14:13.120]  And if you listen to the psychopaths orchestrating all of this, transhumanism is officially their
[14:13.120 --> 14:14.800]  stated goal.
[14:14.800 --> 14:17.680]  And they won't need Elon's implantable chip.
[14:17.680 --> 14:23.240]  With injectable nanosized circuitry in the human brain and nervous system, non-intrusive
[14:23.240 --> 14:26.680]  wearable tech will do the job just fine.
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.120]  And this is rapidly being developed by Welcome Leap, a privately run umbrella corporation
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.720]  connecting DARPA, Silicon Valley, and the military, who has tripled their network in less than
[14:37.720 --> 14:44.040]  a year, boasting success for the deadly mRNA vaccines, and pushing to accelerate new ones
[14:44.040 --> 14:49.600]  designed to correct every so-called flaw of the human psyche that stands in the way of
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.400]  productivity to an authoritarian state run by artificial intelligence that monitors and
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.920]  controls their neurological functions 24-7.
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.600]  This is exactly what they say they want by the year 2030.
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.480]  So either the vaccines are a way of interfacing the new transhuman with AI technology, or
[15:09.480 --> 15:16.280]  they're lying, and it's all about depopulation, which is what the latest data is showing.
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.120]  Natural news recently estimated billions of deaths if it isn't stopped in the next
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.120]  year.
[15:22.120 --> 15:29.000]  It obviously isn't about public health, and whether it's about depopulation or transhumanism,
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.520]  it is a threat to all of humanity.
[15:31.520 --> 15:36.600]  We could ponder until the end about why anyone would want to do this.
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.000]  But the real question is why are we letting them?
[15:41.000 --> 16:09.720]  Looking for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.

[17:23.280 --> 17:27.320]  to help get the nutrients into your tissues, into your cells.
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.640]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out in the next week or so, we are
[17:30.640 --> 17:36.280]  going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.

[17:41.720 --> 17:46.120]  to run this for a week, and then we are going to be selling out of this product, hopefully
[17:46.120 --> 17:49.920]  more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller, and it's something
[17:49.920 --> 17:52.400]  everybody needs for their immune system and their body.

[17:59.280 --> 18:04.840]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[18:04.840 --> 18:07.240]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[18:07.240 --> 18:10.720]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your
[18:10.720 --> 18:16.440]  house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.440]  facilities.
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.200]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[18:22.200 --> 18:26.200]  quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[18:26.200 --> 18:28.000]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.200]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[18:32.200 --> 18:36.500]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military

[19:12.280 --> 19:13.280]  They know you're angry.
[19:13.280 --> 19:18.160]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool

[20:01.320 --> 20:27.800]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:31.320 --> 20:43.840]  It's Friday, January 7th, 2022 and the globalist occupied government is preparing to stage
[20:43.840 --> 20:48.040]  massive terror attacks against the American people that will be blamed on the American
[20:48.040 --> 20:49.040]  people.
[20:49.040 --> 20:57.520]  So they have a pretext to establish public martial law and then mass purges and the relocation
[20:57.520 --> 21:05.200]  of up to 50 million Americans into reeducation camps, the stated goal of the Democratic Party
[21:05.200 --> 21:13.400]  and their clowered and piven weathermen operatives is to kill 25 million of us in those camps
[21:13.400 --> 21:17.680]  and those are 1970s numbers that came out in federal court and it's the same people
[21:17.680 --> 21:20.320]  running things today.
[21:20.320 --> 21:23.840]  Everything is about human extermination, everything is about body counts, everything
[21:23.840 --> 21:27.840]  is about turning the power off, everything is about destroying supply chains because
[21:27.840 --> 21:32.400]  you see supply chains are great and complex society is great until it breaks down and
[21:32.400 --> 21:39.000]  they're using the fact that we're in a complex interconnected society to sabotage it, to
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  be able to wreck civilization and consolidate control for themselves.
[21:43.000 --> 21:49.120]  They are environmentalist, death cult, terrorist.
[21:49.120 --> 21:54.520]  And so who is the most important person in the world?
[21:54.520 --> 22:01.680]  Start of the show, I told you I'd come back and do it.
[22:01.680 --> 22:08.480]  But then I got too angry and didn't and you see here's the problem that it's harder and
[22:08.480 --> 22:16.080]  harder for me to do the show, I'm 47 and my knowledge base is very advanced now.
[22:16.080 --> 22:21.080]  So everything I look at, everything I read, everything I see, I have a deep multifaceted
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.640]  multi-dimensional understanding of it and at a certain level that becomes painful.
[22:25.640 --> 22:29.720]  I know those of you tune in, you care as well and you're under this great burden, I just
[22:29.720 --> 22:35.080]  pray to God every day to give me peace and help me transcend this because it's that
[22:35.080 --> 22:40.880]  Bible verse we showed yesterday about, with the beginning of knowledge comes great sorrow
[22:40.880 --> 22:46.960]  and with great knowledge comes great sorrow, to paraphrase, there's several Bible verses
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.960]  but it's absolutely true, it's very childlike for the public that looks at everything one
[22:51.960 --> 22:56.280]  dimensionally and takes it at its face.
[22:56.280 --> 23:01.480]  But when you have evil leaders that are manipulating people through one-dimensional thinking, they
[23:01.480 --> 23:04.040]  can lead them to total destruction and they are.
[23:04.040 --> 23:09.240]  So we must force ourselves to always be on and always be focused and always be aware
[23:09.240 --> 23:13.560]  and with that the brain becomes more and more advanced, more and more cutting edge, more
[23:13.560 --> 23:16.280]  and more incredible.
[23:16.280 --> 23:21.720]  But if you're a good person with a brain operating like that and most evil people can't do it,
[23:21.720 --> 23:29.520]  most good people can, it becomes extremely painful for with much wisdom comes much sorrow
[23:29.520 --> 23:32.200]  than more knowledge, the more the grief.
[23:32.200 --> 23:37.280]  Ecclesiastes 1.18, guys give me the King James version of that, read a little different,
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.160]  thank you.
[23:39.160 --> 23:44.840]  And so I'm not up here bitching as a victim, it's the opposite, I've never been more alive,
[23:44.840 --> 23:58.040]  I've never felt more fulfilled, but it is a agony and a frustration and I know you're
[23:58.040 --> 24:01.280]  feeling it as well.
[24:01.280 --> 24:08.040]  But it's the opposite of emptiness and sometimes it feels really good to be awake and to know
[24:08.040 --> 24:18.360]  God but to be with God but in the world is torture and that's why we just got to pray
[24:18.360 --> 24:28.560]  to God to give us the peace and to give us the understanding that we can't do it ourselves
[24:28.560 --> 24:32.720]  and it's up to God, it's up to us to do the right thing, to have courage, to speak out,
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.960]  to say no to evil and then God's going to carry us the rest of the way.
[24:35.960 --> 24:43.040]  And when I'm saying that to you, I'm not preaching at you, I'm preaching at me because I was
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.400]  praying really hard last night when I went to sleep that I won't be a jerk, that I won't
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.480]  be angry, that I won't be upset and that the enemy can't get to me and that I just carry
[24:50.480 --> 24:56.280]  out my mission and the middle of the night I really had Holy Spirit come on me and a
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.280]  real connection and I felt empowered and cleansed and good and then of course I wake
[25:01.280 --> 25:04.440]  up in the morning and I come in here and I look at the enemy's operations and all the
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.080]  kids they're killing and it just makes me feel like a guilty son of a bitch that we
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.880]  can't stop these people and then I don't want to just sit up here and play music and have
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.640]  guests on and talk about the world and you know, oh look at the left at this, oh and
[25:18.640 --> 25:23.260]  the left at that, look how dumb Biden is when all of that's done to make you think it's
[25:23.260 --> 25:29.000]  Biden doing it when he's just a dead puppet, a dangling dead crawdad they hang out there
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.560]  in for everybody to make us think that's who's doing it and Kamala Harris, I mean they put
[25:33.560 --> 25:38.280]  them up there because they're jokes to demoralize America and to make us actually think that's
[25:38.280 --> 25:41.680]  what our country is when it's not.
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.400]  Our country is a hard working people all across this nation that love their children and hold
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.000]  them in the night and have that connection to God and want to do good things and have
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.280]  little gardens in their backyards and cook meals for old folks and just love sunsets
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.760]  and just want to be good people and that's who we're standing up for here.
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.360]  I apologize to everybody that I get so mad, it's not an act, none of this is an act, believe
[26:05.360 --> 26:13.240]  me I wish it was and I'm unable to be an actor, that's why their biggest lie is that
[26:13.240 --> 26:20.880]  Jones says he's a performance artist, Jones says he is an actor and everything he says
[26:20.880 --> 26:24.520]  is fake, where's the video of that, where's my written word, I never said that, that's
[26:24.520 --> 26:25.520]  a lie.
[26:25.520 --> 26:32.920]  They always say, oh Tucker Carlson says in court he's fake, never said that, they use
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.640]  that same lie over and over again against real people to say we don't mean what we say,
[26:37.640 --> 26:43.600]  well if I didn't mean when I said how come it all came true, no I meant every damn thing
[26:43.600 --> 26:50.320]  I said and when I engaged in satire I said, satire alert, I'm going to do my own Jonathan
[26:50.320 --> 26:56.200]  Swift modest proposal here about if society really collapses within 15 days the average
[26:56.200 --> 26:59.640]  person turns into a cannibal, so I might have to think about hauling my neighbors up
[26:59.640 --> 27:06.240]  in idiom and I said at the start of the segment it was a 10 minute segment, segment four,
[27:06.240 --> 27:09.840]  at the start of the segment at the end of the segment I said this is satire and they
[27:09.840 --> 27:17.120]  ran with it and said Jones is going to murder his neighbors, that's them lying not me.
[27:17.120 --> 27:23.000]  So I've got this whole thing basically spring loaded I want to say when we come back that
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.360]  I grasp in my mind and then if I don't just keep that moment of understanding and all
[27:28.360 --> 27:32.040]  those points I want to make because I'm not writing this down, I'm not reading a teleprompter,
[27:32.040 --> 27:38.320]  it all just dissipates like gas into the ether and then I don't say the key thing that if
[27:38.320 --> 27:44.920]  I say it just right and explain the thought perfectly or almost perfectly then the public
[27:44.920 --> 27:50.600]  will grasp it and also absorb it and understand a blueprint for victory which we need and
[27:50.600 --> 27:54.680]  there's nothing more frustrating than knowing you've got the blueprint for victory, you've
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.960]  proven you can do it, God's given you the directive and you can't get it done because
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.640]  you are weak and I'm talking about myself.
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.000]  So my frustration here is not with the audience, the crew, my frustration is with the globalist
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.160]  killing everybody and running around enjoying it, they love it, see it hurts us, they like
[28:14.160 --> 28:20.040]  it, they have fun doing all this, oh they just love it, they just love it and I have
[28:20.040 --> 28:24.240]  to control myself and not go after them with rage because we're not doing this for them,
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.920]  they don't deserve our hatred, we're doing it for the children who we love but I tell
[28:30.920 --> 28:33.840]  you the globalists are going to get it.
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.760]  Now when we come back I'm going to tell you who the most important person in the world
[28:39.760 --> 28:47.760]  is and this is truth and if you grasp this and if you know this you will have victory.
[28:47.760 --> 28:53.080]  Infowars.com, the front line of the human rebellion against AI evil, the front line
[28:53.080 --> 29:00.640]  of the human rebellion against Satan.
[29:00.640 --> 29:05.520]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[29:05.520 --> 29:10.520]  the globalists are doing right now, this is their big offensive, this is their takeover
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.640]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.680]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[29:18.680 --> 29:23.720]  in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.440]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[29:28.440 --> 29:31.880]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[29:31.880 --> 29:36.320]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarsstore.com

[29:56.200 --> 30:00.080]  we fail is if you don't take action.
[30:00.080 --> 30:05.960]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6th, 2022 and that means there
[30:05.960 --> 30:11.200]  are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling product, Vitamin

[30:29.320 --> 30:33.640]  keep it on sale for another seven days.
[30:33.640 --> 30:38.520]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.

[30:42.840 --> 30:47.480]  on air and the world would be a much worse position right now than it's in.

[31:34.440 --> 31:36.760]  for another seven days.
[31:36.760 --> 31:42.160]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022, we're going
[31:42.160 --> 31:46.600]  to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product, hopefully
[31:46.600 --> 31:50.640]  more comes in in the next month or so because it's a best seller and it's something everybody
[31:50.640 --> 31:55.200]  needs for their immune system and their body, get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion now and support
[31:55.200 --> 31:58.840]  the InfoWare, a 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[31:58.840 --> 32:03.760]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[32:03.760 --> 32:04.760]  Hello, Alex.
[32:04.760 --> 32:05.760]  Yes, Malcolm.
[32:05.760 --> 32:09.320]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.320]  line.
[32:10.320 --> 32:14.480]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[32:14.480 --> 32:20.800]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[32:20.800 --> 32:21.800]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[32:21.800 --> 32:27.920]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[32:27.920 --> 32:32.840]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't
[32:32.840 --> 32:33.840]  as strong.
[32:33.840 --> 32:37.680]  This is like a very fine wine, in fact, each batch is different.
[32:37.680 --> 32:39.600]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[32:39.600 --> 32:43.160]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[32:43.160 --> 32:45.720]  It's just how it is, it's how it works.
[32:45.720 --> 32:50.400]  So it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the
[32:50.400 --> 33:01.800]  Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[33:01.800 --> 33:13.160]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.160 --> 33:19.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:19.560 --> 33:20.560]  the Infowar.
[33:20.560 --> 33:34.840]  So who is the most important person in the world today?
[33:34.840 --> 33:39.760]  And if you understand that point, it is a Rosetta Stone, it is a skeleton key, it is
[33:39.760 --> 33:45.680]  a window into the wider universe and the multiverse and an understanding of our true destiny and
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.880]  where we're going.
[33:47.880 --> 33:48.880]  Who is it?
[33:48.880 --> 33:51.720]  Is it Jeff Bezos?
[33:51.720 --> 33:52.920]  Is it Elon Musk?
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.600]  Is it the Queen of England?
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.720]  Is it Brad Pitt?
[33:58.720 --> 34:01.480]  Is it Donald Trump?
[34:01.480 --> 34:03.960]  Is it Vladimir Putin?
[34:03.960 --> 34:06.720]  Is it Xi Jinping?
[34:06.720 --> 34:12.240]  Is it the current Pope?
[34:12.240 --> 34:16.560]  Who is it?
[34:16.560 --> 34:20.960]  Is it Novak Djokovic?
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.600]  Who is it?
[34:24.600 --> 34:33.720]  Who is saying the most truth in the most understandable way that transcends left and right and actually
[34:33.720 --> 34:42.040]  speaks to people in a human message on this planet?
[34:42.040 --> 34:48.440]  And if you know the answer to that, you know the answer to the rest of the story.
[34:48.440 --> 34:55.560]  Is someone important because they have $200 billion of inflated garbage?
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.680]  Is someone important because they were the president of the United States like President
[34:59.680 --> 35:00.680]  Trump?
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.420]  Is someone important because they've been in a lot of big movies and are handsome like
[35:05.420 --> 35:09.080]  Brad Pitt?
[35:09.080 --> 35:15.400]  Is somebody the most important because the way you define who the most important person
[35:15.400 --> 35:17.760]  is says who you are.
[35:17.760 --> 35:26.880]  There's a big study out that the more celebrity obsessed you are, the lower your IQ and the
[35:26.880 --> 35:33.080]  less money you make.
[35:33.080 --> 35:43.520]  And the more you believe in the system, the more you go along with its propaganda, the
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.440]  more diseased and dumbed down and poor you are.
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.320]  And when you go in the poor areas, they're all wearing a mask, aren't they?
[35:51.320 --> 35:52.320]  Their kids are all wearing masks.
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.760]  They're all taking all the shots, they're doing whatever they need to with the system.
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.360]  They believe to comply so they can be part of it because all the cool Hollywood people
[36:00.360 --> 36:07.120]  that get paid to lie to them told them so.
[36:07.120 --> 36:09.920]  What are they missing?
[36:09.920 --> 36:11.720]  What's wrong with them?
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.440]  Because you see, the establishment wants you to be alone.
[36:16.440 --> 36:19.120]  The establishment wants you to be dumb.
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.720]  The establishment wants you to be diseased and die because they see you as a piece of
[36:23.720 --> 36:30.440]  garbage because they see themselves subconsciously as garbage.
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.400]  And they believe once they get rid of you and your ugly hovel and your ugly face and
[36:35.400 --> 36:41.080]  your ugly kids in their view that they'll finally be free because you won't be around.
[36:41.080 --> 36:43.720]  That's their real view.
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.160]  And just because you got the general mass of people dumbed down, not aware of standing
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.480]  up for themselves, doesn't mean you have a right to kill them just because you're some
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.360]  imbred occultic globalist that knows the basics of the third dimension.
[36:56.360 --> 37:01.080]  So that makes you a god because you're willing to crap all over other sentient creatures
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.360]  and keep them in the dark.
[37:03.360 --> 37:13.040]  That makes you less than a man, certainly not a god.
[37:13.040 --> 37:19.920]  So I ask you again, who is the greatest living person in the world?
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.440]  Who has the greatest potential to empower humanity?
[37:24.440 --> 37:27.480]  Because I'm telling you, I don't care if somebody's a movie star.
[37:27.480 --> 37:29.800]  I don't care if somebody plays football.
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.400]  Even if they're a good person, I detest it so much now I don't even want to talk to them.
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.920]  I don't care what you did in the corrupt system.
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.400]  I care how much you care about humanity, how much you want to empower people, how much
[37:44.400 --> 37:48.320]  you're a populist, how much you believe in the species made in the image of God.
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.440]  That's my benchmark, that's what I go off of, that's my pole star, that's my north star,
[37:54.440 --> 38:02.520]  that is my spirit, that is my anchor, that is my will, that is my place, that is my vision,
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.920]  that is my destiny, that is what God wants us to do.
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.280]  So I ask you again, it isn't just oh who's the most famous, who's the richest, that's
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.760]  not the winners.
[38:16.760 --> 38:22.880]  Who does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul, nothing.
[38:22.880 --> 38:32.040]  Who in the most loving, real, focused, Christ-like way balanced, because I'm not Christ-like
[38:32.040 --> 38:33.040]  at times.
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.280]  You could say who's the most effective human for humans right now, and that'd be Joe Rogan
[38:39.280 --> 38:45.680]  or Alex Jones for a pro-human future, Tucker Carlson, a close third.
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.560]  But that's not who's the most effective for humans at this time, who's, who's the most
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.720]  important human in the world?
[38:54.720 --> 39:03.560]  Because that human's going to be a model for us, because that person is us, and we are
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.360]  that person, and once we realize that, we have the keys to destiny.
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.880]  And so this has to be done, this has to be said on air, because I've seen it, I've known
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.960]  it, I've felt it, I've understood it, and now I've continued to witness it, but I'm
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.000]  going to first tell you about this person.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.040]  This person does not want to be president of the United States.
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.720]  This person cannot stand Hollywood.
[39:25.720 --> 39:29.600]  This person cannot stand New York rich people.
[39:29.600 --> 39:31.820]  They cannot stand Hollywood rich people.
[39:31.820 --> 39:34.240]  They cannot stand the establishment.
[39:34.240 --> 39:36.560]  They don't want to hang around with the system.
[39:36.560 --> 39:38.720]  They don't want to be embraced by the system.
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.640]  They are disgusted by the system.
[39:41.640 --> 39:44.600]  They are abhorrent of it.
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.600]  And that's why the system when they attack them says, oh, they're a blue blood, oh, they're
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.360]  part of the system, oh, oh, look, they're establishment.
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.360]  Well, whoever said we wouldn't get somebody out of the establishment, out of the aristocracy
[39:58.360 --> 40:01.080]  to turn things around.
[40:01.080 --> 40:06.760]  Because it's out of that understanding that the aristocracy actually cares about the people.
[40:06.760 --> 40:10.840]  The aristocrats are supposed to build the civilization up, because they know they run
[40:10.840 --> 40:14.600]  it, and they know that that is an evidence of their safety and their security and their
[40:14.600 --> 40:15.840]  care about humanity.
[40:15.840 --> 40:18.560]  That's what an aristocrat does.
[40:18.560 --> 40:20.240]  We don't have an aristocratic class now.
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.160]  We got a bunch of crazy, out of control sharks that think leaving nothing for anybody else,
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.520]  but evil and deception and division and fentanyl is manly.
[40:31.520 --> 40:36.640]  And no, it's not manly to drive around your super yacht while all the major cities of
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.480]  the world collapse into death and destruction, thinking while you're out there with your
[40:40.480 --> 40:46.760]  supermodel life being fed frogois that you are safe from what you've been a part of,
[40:46.760 --> 40:50.360]  you are a fool, Jeff Bezos.
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.920]  At least Elon Musk, for all of his dalliances with the establishment, knows he wants a
[40:56.920 --> 40:57.920]  pro-human future.
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.680]  He says, we got to go off world now.
[41:01.680 --> 41:09.440]  And no, it's not, Elon Musk is not the most important person in the world, though he can
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.360]  become the most important person in the world, just like that.
[41:14.360 --> 41:18.640]  He can become the most potent person in the world, just like that, and he understands
[41:18.640 --> 41:20.560]  that and is now moving towards that.
[41:20.560 --> 41:27.640]  And as we all move towards that, that center of pro-human gravity, we then learn the secret
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.600]  that I will tell you when we come back in the final segment of this hour and I reveal
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.360]  who the most important person in the world is, but I want you to understand something.
[41:38.360 --> 41:45.440]  This isn't hype, this isn't exaggeration, this isn't BS, this isn't any of that.
[41:45.440 --> 41:53.480]  We must recognize from amongst our people who is the best at promoting humanity, who
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.920]  is the best at being balanced, who is the best at being loving, who is the best at
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.240]  being truthful, who is the best at being level headed, who is more Christ-like.
[42:04.240 --> 42:10.880]  And that's not Alex Jones.
[42:10.880 --> 42:17.520]  So when we come back, I'll tell you who the most important person in the world is, and
[42:17.520 --> 42:24.560]  I want you to understand it, and I want it to sink in, and I want it to burn into yourselves,
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.960]  and I want you to then ask yourself, is this true to God?
[42:27.960 --> 42:29.800]  Is this true to the Holy Spirit?
[42:29.800 --> 42:34.200]  And if you're dialed into the same thing I am, you'll get the answer back that absolutely
[42:34.200 --> 42:35.200]  quickly.
[42:35.200 --> 42:42.680]  And the example of people like this is the example for all of us into the future to turn
[42:42.680 --> 42:43.680]  the tide.
[42:43.680 --> 42:47.560]  They're selling us a spirit of evil and lies and fraud and deception.
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.200]  We are promoting a spirit of truth and justice and life and love and beauty and celebration
[42:53.200 --> 42:54.760]  and excitement and discovery.
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.880]  Let me ride back, stay with us.
[42:59.880 --> 43:05.640]  September's 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.400]  the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[43:10.400 --> 43:15.160]  yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[43:15.160 --> 43:20.000]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  in stock.
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.040]  Winter sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3, taking under the tongue for higher absorption
[43:26.040 --> 43:27.640]  is back in stock.
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.120]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.600]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal iodine,
[43:36.600 --> 43:40.800]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[43:40.800 --> 43:44.360]  activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.760]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:49.760 --> 43:55.400]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com,
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.640]  50% off for a limited time, thanks for keeping us on the air.
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.800]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.120]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[44:09.120 --> 44:10.120]  didn't stand up.
[44:10.120 --> 44:12.760]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[44:12.760 --> 44:14.320]  stand up.
[44:14.320 --> 44:17.760]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.040]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people
[44:21.040 --> 44:24.760]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government, you can never
[44:24.760 --> 44:26.720]  buy or sell again.
[44:26.720 --> 44:31.800]  Well that's being brought here and all over the world, the guys with COVID vaccine passports,
[44:31.800 --> 44:32.800]  they even admit it.
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.400]  Now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[44:35.400 --> 44:38.800]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[44:38.800 --> 44:39.800]  you can do.
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.640]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[44:41.640 --> 44:44.240]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.400]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[44:48.400 --> 44:51.360]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[44:51.360 --> 44:52.360]  nightmare as well.
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.520]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved
[44:56.520 --> 45:00.040]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.760]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[45:04.760 --> 45:05.760]  enslavement.
[45:05.760 --> 45:11.040]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.520]  a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.440]  our industrial society.
[45:18.440 --> 45:19.440]  And now they've done it.
[45:19.440 --> 45:24.640]  How did I know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their
[45:24.640 --> 45:27.000]  own reports and internal meetings were leaked?
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.120]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.600]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were at knee planting launch this
[45:36.600 --> 45:37.600]  great reset.
[45:37.600 --> 45:39.320]  Well, we're now living in it.
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.880]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, known as the tyrannical
[45:43.880 --> 45:44.880]  corporate world government.
[45:44.880 --> 45:51.080]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally more
[45:51.080 --> 45:57.080]  and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[45:57.080 --> 45:58.560]  This is what Info Wars is fighting.
[45:58.560 --> 45:59.840]  We're fighting for the future.
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.600]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[46:04.600 --> 46:09.920]  And that means there are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.840]  product, vitamin, mineral fusion at 50% off.
[46:14.840 --> 46:18.640]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino acids.
[46:18.640 --> 46:23.160]  It is a game changer for your immune system and every other function in your body and
[46:23.160 --> 46:24.560]  it's a must have.
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.040]  That's why despite the fact that it's selling out and current sales rates, we're going
[46:29.040 --> 46:33.440]  to keep it on sale for another seven days.
[46:33.440 --> 46:38.440]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[46:38.440 --> 46:41.840]  I want to thank you all for shopping with Info Wars.
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.680]  Without you, we would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position
[46:45.680 --> 46:47.320]  right now than it's in.
[46:47.320 --> 46:51.800]  Thanks to you supporting Info Wars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth
[46:51.800 --> 46:54.560]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[46:54.560 --> 46:57.840]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the
[46:57.840 --> 47:02.160]  same time at infowarsstore.com.
[47:02.160 --> 47:19.920]  Creating a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.920 --> 47:27.360]  Welcome back to this January 7th live Friday broadcast of the year 2022.
[47:27.360 --> 47:33.040]  So I've thought long and hard about this and I know I'm right and you'll know I'm right
[47:33.040 --> 47:34.040]  as well.
[47:34.040 --> 47:36.600]  Who is the most important person in the world?
[47:36.600 --> 47:38.360]  It's not Donald Trump.
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.120]  It's not the fake Pope.
[47:41.120 --> 47:43.400]  It's not anybody in Hollywood.
[47:43.400 --> 47:50.960]  It's certainly not the poor little reanimated corpse Joe Biden or his fake vice president
[47:50.960 --> 47:53.200]  Kamala Harris.
[47:53.200 --> 47:57.240]  It's not Vladimir Putin because Vladimir Putin has Russia, the largest land mass on
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.960]  the world and he has a lot of good people and he's trying to build a Christian future
[48:01.960 --> 48:10.600]  and he's going against the globalist but he's not in America.
[48:10.600 --> 48:13.400]  What the establishment calls the new Atlantis.
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.600]  He's not right in the middle of the globalist empire because they've conquered America,
[48:18.600 --> 48:21.480]  the globalists have seized America, the globalists have occupied America.
[48:21.480 --> 48:27.840]  If we could take the country back peacefully without the revolution they're trying to artificially
[48:27.840 --> 48:33.080]  trigger around January 6th, then we could really have a future of peace and justice.
[48:33.080 --> 48:38.720]  We could have a real shot at that with Russia and with China and with Asia and the Middle
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.640]  East and Africa and Latin America and I know the individual that I'm going to say is the
[48:44.640 --> 48:48.560]  most important person in the world has that same idea and has that same thought and wants
[48:48.560 --> 48:49.560]  that.
[48:49.560 --> 48:54.720]  And when I recognize this individual, it's not to put them up on a pedestal but it's
[48:54.720 --> 49:02.840]  to recognize who's done the best clean, professional, level-headed job despite all the attacks
[49:02.840 --> 49:06.400]  and what I know they've gone through behind the scenes that other people don't know about.
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.800]  It was something they didn't tell me I know about, some of them they didn't tell me to
[49:10.800 --> 49:15.520]  understand that that's a benchmark.
[49:15.520 --> 49:22.080]  That's like the previous football championship number or golf score or bowling score or dart
[49:22.080 --> 49:24.280]  score but those things don't matter.
[49:24.280 --> 49:30.360]  This is the best political score so far as a statesman of doing the right thing and telling
[49:30.360 --> 49:36.360]  the truth because at every front without it being Republican or even Democrat they expose
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.560]  the corrupt establishment playing both sides and how the corrupt establishment on both
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.880]  sides is deindustrializing and shutting down and selling off the infrastructure, making
[49:46.880 --> 49:54.320]  the public dependent and shipping in the fentanyl and the drugs and telling you you don't have
[49:54.320 --> 49:59.680]  individual rights as a black man or a white woman or an Asian woman or a Hispanic man
[49:59.680 --> 50:03.920]  or a white man, you're in a group and only your group has value and we all know that
[50:03.920 --> 50:09.200]  we've all talked about that too but the point is they do it the best and they do it continually
[50:09.200 --> 50:15.480]  and they do it steadfastly and they do the best job of it and so they reject the power
[50:15.480 --> 50:16.480]  structure.
[50:16.480 --> 50:19.880]  They don't want to be president when the Republicans approach them to run for president.
[50:19.880 --> 50:22.200]  They don't want to be in D.C. or New York.
[50:22.200 --> 50:25.480]  They don't want to be in Los Angeles and that's all of us.
[50:25.480 --> 50:30.200]  That's you listening in Texas or Florida or you know even Northern California or South
[50:30.200 --> 50:35.720]  Dakota or New Mexico or you're like hey that's me, yeah exactly we're about to get to the
[50:35.720 --> 50:38.720]  key here.
[50:38.720 --> 50:41.400]  So who is the most important person in the world?
[50:41.400 --> 50:45.080]  Well the most important thing in the world is the people.
[50:45.080 --> 50:49.540]  That's where we get the world populism, the people, a politics of the people, what's common
[50:49.540 --> 50:55.360]  sense, what's works, what's equitable, what's fair, what makes sense, God's law, common
[50:55.360 --> 50:59.040]  law, the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, those are all just examples
[50:59.040 --> 51:02.400]  of that, just manifestations of people's will.
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.280]  So who's the greatest populist of them all?
[51:05.280 --> 51:11.240]  In America and as an example around the world, who's listened to in Japan and in South Africa
[51:11.240 --> 51:14.240]  and in Mexico and in Canada and in the United States?
[51:14.240 --> 51:21.800]  Who all over the world, when I talk off record to world leaders in South America like Brazil
[51:21.800 --> 51:27.360]  or in Eastern Europe, who do they talk about and who's unifying them to have a pro-human
[51:27.360 --> 51:31.360]  future against the great reset in the New World Order?
[51:31.360 --> 51:34.160]  Well you know who it is, it's Tucker Carlson ladies and gentlemen.
[51:34.160 --> 51:41.600]  Tucker Carlson is the most important person in the world because he understands the people
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.800]  are the most important people in the world and he's trying to be a champion of the people
[51:46.800 --> 51:52.440]  and he recognizes you and your children and your life are the most important people in
[51:52.440 --> 51:55.120]  the world.
[51:55.120 --> 52:05.040]  So yes, the tennis player locked up in a FEMA camp in Australia because he hasn't been injected.
[52:05.040 --> 52:10.880]  He's Djokovic, the most important person in the world and Marjorie Taylor Greene coming
[52:10.880 --> 52:15.680]  out saying January 6th was a false flag yesterday, she's the most important person in the world
[52:15.680 --> 52:19.240]  and Tucker Carlson, he's the most important person in the world and Joe Rogan is the most
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.960]  important person in the world and the dog catcher down the street that loves liberty
[52:22.960 --> 52:26.640]  and tells the truth and stands up for what's right and that single mom taking care of three
[52:26.640 --> 52:30.240]  children because her husband committed suicide or died in a car wreck or whatever it is she's
[52:30.240 --> 52:35.560]  the most important person in the world because humanity is the most important thing in the
[52:35.560 --> 52:42.320]  world ladies and gentlemen and they've been devaluing it and attacking it and Tucker Carlson
[52:42.320 --> 52:49.520]  does the best job out of everybody promoting populism in a pro-human future and he understands
[52:49.520 --> 52:54.960]  something that the Republican establishment doesn't get and the reason we keep losing.
[52:54.960 --> 52:58.960]  They're scared of Hollywood, they're scared of big tech, they're scared of the New York
[52:58.960 --> 53:02.920]  media, they're scared of the New York Times, they're scared of CNN because they came out
[53:02.920 --> 53:08.040]  of that system and that's the world they live in and they're 75, 80 years old on average
[53:08.040 --> 53:14.160]  and just don't know just like Candace Owen said about Trump and the dangerous vaccines
[53:14.160 --> 53:20.680]  and the mandates of why he didn't know it's true he's a dinosaur, sure he believed in
[53:20.680 --> 53:30.720]  American populism but he didn't go all the way but Tucker Carlson does so here we are
[53:30.720 --> 53:38.760]  ladies and gentlemen at the crossroads and somebody like Tucker Carlson knows that Ted
[53:38.760 --> 53:46.680]  Cruz got a talking point from Garland and from the establishment and that they are preparing
[53:46.680 --> 53:51.400]  to claim that the American people are about to stage terror attacks and try to assassinate
[53:51.400 --> 53:54.200]  Biden, I told you that months ago it's in the news today and they're going to try to
[53:54.200 --> 54:00.840]  sew us up and bring in martial law and the lawyer, the Bush minion, Ted Cruz who poses
[54:00.840 --> 54:05.400]  as a patriot all these years who is a wolf in sheep's clothing, Tucker Carlson believes
[54:05.400 --> 54:14.080]  and he's got better sources than I believe him has to be cut out and destroyed and like
[54:14.080 --> 54:19.240]  a populist general, Tucker Carlson just tore his guts out.
[54:19.240 --> 54:23.120]  Now will he finally roll over Ted Cruz and stop secretly serving the establishment and
[54:23.120 --> 54:27.520]  come over to our team and win or is he a Benedict Arnold forever, I don't know, I'm not an enemy
[54:27.520 --> 54:32.960]  of Ted Cruz, I hope he'll stop acting like this and doing this but he's missing something,
[54:32.960 --> 54:40.720]  yeah he's intellectually smart but he's spiritually dumb and Tucker Carlson's not and that's what
[54:40.720 --> 54:46.040]  Tucker Carlson knew to go right at him and say oh you're so intelligent you picked this
[54:46.040 --> 54:50.560]  term because Tucker Carlson knows the terror attacks are coming, Tucker Carlson knows the
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.300]  state civil war is coming, Tucker Carlson knows the big events coming and the end of
[54:54.300 --> 54:59.760]  America and he's trying to stop it and making an issue in front of all the other conservatives
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.840]  and all the Christians and all the Fox News Republicans and saying stop putting up with
[55:05.840 --> 55:13.800]  Mitch McConnell and with Ted Cruz and with Rand Paul, he's come out against the vaccine,
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.320]  it doesn't work, it's dangerous, it's poison and Josh Holly and all of them because they
[55:18.320 --> 55:26.060]  all fear the liberal media, they all fear the George Soros system when they better start
[55:26.060 --> 55:30.520]  cheering us and that's the instinct Tucker Carlson's got.
[55:30.520 --> 55:34.600]  At the top of his game, I know off record, not from him and others, almost paid nothing
[55:34.600 --> 55:38.920]  to get actual free will and to have his own voice on Fox.
[55:38.920 --> 55:44.560]  The number one guy on TV in the U.S. and all over the world and that's an example of somebody
[55:44.560 --> 55:48.880]  getting it and wanting to side with the people and not wanting to side with the establishment
[55:48.880 --> 55:53.000]  and not wanting to live in D.C. or New York and have your ass kissed all day by a bunch
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.720]  of fake people that want to spend time with his wife and children in Maine and Florida
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.640]  and hunt in the woods and hang out with regular people and be good and decent because it feels
[56:02.640 --> 56:04.920]  good to Tucker Carlson to be normal.
[56:04.920 --> 56:08.520]  It feels good to Tucker Carlson to actually be with the people, not tell you how much
[56:08.520 --> 56:12.080]  he loves you because you're poor, how much he loves you because you're black, because
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.400]  he loves you because you're human and he loves you because you're an American and he wants
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.960]  to empower you and he wants to see you succeed.
[56:17.960 --> 56:24.400]  Now when he sees Ted Cruz waddle in and put out the talking point, knowing the big revolution
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.480]  is coming, knowing the terror attacks coming, knowing the big move against the American
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.640]  people is coming and letting them know, I'm going to side with you that the American people
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.040]  are terrorists when this all goes down.
[56:38.040 --> 56:44.600]  Ted Cruz is who you don't want to be, Tucker Carlson is who you want to be.
[56:44.600 --> 56:53.400]  But yeah, if this was a golf analogy, I play through all the time and get shots where I'd
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.600]  get the ball in the hole with only two hits and I don't really play golf, I'm not being
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.480]  technical here, the eagle.
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.600]  But Tucker Carlson with the stuff he does, does holes in one and that's what matters.
[57:06.600 --> 57:11.360]  I may get more eagles than Carlson does, but he gets more holes in ones and that's what
[57:11.360 --> 57:16.040]  this is all about, is calling it out, showing the weakness, showing the power of the people,
[57:16.040 --> 57:21.000]  making Ted Cruz grovel, making him show he's a fraud, making him say, oh, I'm not smart,
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.560]  I'm stupid, which everyone knows is it true.
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.800]  Yeah, you are stupid, Ted Cruz, you're spiritually dumb.
[57:27.800 --> 57:31.360]  You need to get on your knees, Ted Cruz, I think you still have good in you.
[57:31.360 --> 57:36.200]  You tried to fight for Trump on January 6th, you tried to have the real vote.
[57:36.200 --> 57:37.520]  I don't think you're an evil person.
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.200]  I think you're on the edge like, like Saul of Tarsus who became Paul, but Ted Cruz, you
[57:42.200 --> 57:45.920]  need to pray to the Holy Spirit to cleanse you and to make you a populist and to stop
[57:45.920 --> 57:50.480]  playing double deals and then you'll be like Tucker Carlson.
[57:50.480 --> 57:52.680]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[57:52.680 --> 57:57.960]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to

[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:11.920]  Now what listeners understand something, media matters and Newsweek and CNN are going to
[1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:16.200]  pick up what I said and did in the last hour.
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:24.320]  They're going to say, Alex Jones, I can see the headlines, blows Tucker Carlson, something
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:25.320]  like that.
[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:28.520]  They're probably already out there, I mean I know how they operate.
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:29.520]  That's not what I did.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:35.640]  I celebrated humanity and I celebrated breaking with the establishment and saying we don't
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:40.280]  want to be part of Hollywood, we don't want to be part of the day, we want to come out
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:45.000]  of this and say no to it and out of all the other Republican talk show hosts, I haven't
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.320]  seen the clip yet, I would have done it too.
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:51.960]  Call out Ted Cruz because that's exactly how it would have said it.
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.080]  You're a lawyer, you're a really good lawyer, you're a smart guy, you're a wordsmith, you
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.920]  agree that this was a terrorist attack because by doing that you invoke this national security
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:08.320]  memorandum for the coming civil war and all the talking points of the Democrats running
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:14.000]  in 2022 against the American people saying all Republicans and people at school board
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.360]  meetings are terrorists and you Ted Cruz did that and Tucker Carlson saw you for what
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:21.360]  you did.
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:24.840]  There's Neil, Tucker Carlson knows about the false flags, he knows about January 6th,
[1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:29.080]  he knows about the planned terror attacks, he's dialed in, he doesn't need Alex Jones
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.200]  to tell him how the cow ate the cabbage.
[1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:34.760]  He saw Alex Jones for all those years that thought that guy's really evil and horrible
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:39.680]  to think such things and then once he put the glasses on he went oh my god this is exactly
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:49.920]  what's going on, he doesn't need me anymore and that's what my job is, is not to tell
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:53.960]  you what to see but to go hey you want to change your perspective a little, come over
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:58.000]  here and look at it at this angle, you can be up against the door you can't see anything,
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.560]  I'm going hey the keyhole's about two inches down, why don't you look in that little hole
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:09.240]  right there, oh you went and looked in the hole, you took the red pill, you put on the
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:16.240]  glasses and there ain't no going back to Kansas after you've done that.
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:26.480]  So Tucker Carlson as the archetype is the perfect example of the most important person
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:32.720]  in the world and again that's an archetype of all of us deciding we're important.
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:36.640]  Not in an arrogant, haughty Hollywood way, the opposite like I'm important, I gotta stand
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:40.400]  up for my community, I'm important, I gotta stand up against defunding the police, I'm
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:44.120]  important, I gotta stand up with you know not let the global see value of the dollar,
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.960]  I'm important, I gotta secure our border, I gotta speak out against it, I'm important,
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:54.880]  I've got a job to do because other people won't do it, I've gotta decide that I'm gonna
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:59.560]  care about civilization because you already cared about civilization but you weren't realizing
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:05.120]  that you have to get involved that freedom isn't free and that's where Tucker Carlson
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:14.040]  as an archetype comes in as the most important person in the world because we are all the
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:19.000]  most important people to our children and to our neighbors and to our job and to our
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.240]  lives and none of us are perfect but when we try to be better and we try to tell the
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:27.320]  truth and we try to work hard and we try to stand up that's the spirit we're supposed
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:32.800]  to have anyways instead of the dead spirit of the lazy TV heads we all know them that
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:38.200]  don't want to do anything and they see any work they've got to do for anybody else it's
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:47.360]  horrible and oh my god mind as well just get rid of it screw everybody we all know that
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:54.000]  feeling but we screw ourselves and our children and our future in that process and so this
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.880]  has been a very important last 30 minutes on the most important person in the world
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:05.240]  the most important person revealed in the world are people that don't want to kiss up
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:10.760]  to CNN and kiss up to the New York Times and kiss up to MSNBC and that facade but the
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:16.520]  Toto's little dog that goes and pulls the curtain back in the Wizard of Oz and reveals
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:20.840]  that it's all just a big fraud it's all a scam and that's what I've called Operation
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:26.800]  Toto as Tucker Carlson inspires people and as you inspire people and as Joe Rogan inspires
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:33.320]  people and as we encourage them and we synergistically build up our massive resistance and our will
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:40.840]  through populism to say we do not comply we do not submit we're done with your new
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:48.040]  world order show Tucker Carlson out of all of us today is the most important person in
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:53.560]  the world but it can be you tomorrow are you next year are you in a hundred years the point
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:05:01.840]  is it's all up to you everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the
[1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:07.520]  build up for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive this
[1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:11.720]  is their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:15.880]  revealed themselves now their world government their permanent martial law their medical
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:21.520]  tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using
[1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:25.760]  their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:29.800]  the truth so listen Paul Revere's when you spread the word about the broadcast when you

[1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:41.960]  1980s riding dirt bike walking with a cassette tape in it making those jumps and when you're
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:07:05.480]  waiting for the next attack as we charge into certain death thank you so much for joining
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:13.960]  us on this live January 7th Friday transmission I'm your host Alex Jones show in the last
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:23.840]  hour I crowned which is a sarcastic term Tucker Carlson with the title of most important person
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:28.320]  of the world because the truth is these aren't titles of nobility handed down to people that
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:32.920]  didn't deserve what they did this is more a torch of liberty that we are recognizing
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:38.520]  Tucker Carlson with is when the best job exposing the anti-human globalist agenda and trying
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:44.840]  to rally people on a non-partisan basis to come together for a pro-human future which
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:55.640]  is antithetical to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and the New World Order
[1:07:55.640 --> 1:08:01.640]  and so that's where we are ladies and gentlemen and that's the question I am asking all of
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:07.800]  you right now we need to celebrate the patriots we need to celebrate the people that tell the
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:12.320]  truth we need to promote the populace that are pro-human not the people that tell you
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:16.320]  they're fighting racism all day not the people that tell you they're fighting for your whatever
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.760]  gay marriage all day those are all red herrings but people that are promoting a pro-human
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:29.680]  future period for everybody anybody that talks about groups is attacking humanity anybody
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:35.520]  that talks about humanity as a whole and believing in ourselves and coming together is the good
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:44.120]  guys and so it's important to recognize the people that have told the truth that have
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:47.800]  stood against the enemy and who have been successful so that we can emulate what they've
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:09:00.200]  done because necessity is the mother of invention all right I just spent a lot of time on that
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:09.400]  and I wanted to get a tech CEO on right when their platform was exploding they just got
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:15.440]  launched I don't go eight months ago or so and so the CEO or the head of founder of getter
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:22.920]  is going to be joining us to talk about a whole flotilla of issues coming up next segment
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:32.920]  but all of that said all of that said what is the news and information that really gets
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:39.940]  me pissed off and really gets me upset and it's this type of news supreme court weighs
[1:09:39.940 --> 1:09:44.760]  vaccine rules affecting more than 80 million people that companies a hundred and up must
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:49.720]  take an experimental shot to have their job when the shot doesn't even work on top of
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:56.600]  it and it violates the Nuremberg code on its face they better come out and repudiated a
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:01.480]  trillion percent and say it's Nazi Germany if they just half-ass shoot it down they're
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.440]  an enemy but if they come out and declare it's constitutional it's a declaration of
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.680]  war against humanity because it's not just the print supreme court saying we're going
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:16.440]  to abort unborn babies you know for we ever look at them and love them and kiss them but
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:23.240]  we're going to kill people after they're born speaking of abortion at 13 we're now aborting
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:31.680]  13 year olds tragic double vax 13 year old dies from unexplained cardiac arrest experimental
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:37.920]  mRNA technology could soon result in a massive wave of youth illness and death parents must
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:43.880]  be made aware of how the dangerous adverse reactions are except I love Kelly McBree is
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:48.800]  a great writer but these are not adverse reactions these these are the main reason you're given
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:55.480]  it it's it's just a cover saying your protection from covid it doesn't this is the drug acting
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:02.240]  as it's supposed to mission complete healthy 13 year old in sports getter than a doornail
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:08.240]  dying every day little children according to social media posts from a family and the
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:13.560]  obituary page with 13 year old boy from New Jersey suddenly died from a heart attack on
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:20.880]  January 4th 2022 just seven months after his second covid shot that's why they don't count
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:25.040]  the deaths the first 14 days is what most of them happen but some people the heart is swollen
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:29.640]  they don't know it they just keep going through life they fall over dead they did have microcarditis
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:36.680]  cause of the death a June 6 2021 Facebook post the child's mother Jennifer O'Drain shows
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:43.960]  him giving a thumbs up from a doctor's office along with the caption second shot done so
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:58.240]  you did what they told you just like happened to Ernest Romero's son at 13 fast forward
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.880]  less than seven months and Jennifer's husband Trent wrote the now deleted Facebook post
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:08.120]  his Facebook tells you're not allowed to talk about your death you don't talk dear family
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:13.360]  and friends our son Jack and explain cardiac arrest on New Year's Eve shortly after the
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:18.520]  ball dropped while playing with his friends he's on life support at Children's Hospital
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:25.120]  in Philadelphia the father continued he fought for another four days Jennifer and I have
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:32.200]  been on his side holding his hand and praying for healing and hope the outpouring of support
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:38.240]  has truly been what is keeping us going I love you all please pray for him just days
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:44.720]  later Jack tragically passed away his obituary reads Jack will always be remembered for his
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:50.960]  big heart love of learning and loyalty to family and friends he was extremely bright
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:56.520]  he attended Voorhees Middle School and was a part of the science Olympian organization
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:02.160]  Jack enjoyed playing the saxophone and practice in the New Jersey School of Music in Medford
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:07.120]  he loved the outdoors and hiking and camping and fishing were some of his favorite activities
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:13.120]  chacked love game nights playing monopoly rummy 500 or watching a good movie but most
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:20.400]  of the time he was spent with his family and friends that he treasured the most and we've
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:26.040]  got the New England Medical Journal study that male 16 and 29 years of age have an increased
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:31.000]  risk of developing heart problems and they admitted an oh a 40% increase in death in
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:40.280]  ages 18 to 64 now in major insurance company actuaries you see Jack was a good sweet person
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:44.800]  and his parents were nice too and they thought everybody was like them but see Klaus Schwab
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:50.200]  doesn't want Jack around Klaus Schwab wants to kill the first world so then no one will
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:54.840]  protect the third world when he kills all of them and your son was a casualty in that
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:01.800]  war Jack Thomas O'Drain I asked the O'Drains do you have the courage to admit who murdered
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:08.320]  your son born July 29 2008 do you have the courage to now use his death to save the
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:13.600]  children or will you like so many others engage in Stockholm syndrome and let his death be
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:19.760]  for nothing I asked you now to join the populace pro human movement I asked you now to learn
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:24.880]  about who killed your son Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab along with Peter Dazek and Anthony
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:30.640]  Fauci I asked you to face the evil as I have done and force your will against the enemy
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:35.960]  so that your son did not die for vain I asked you to commit to this fight to save countless
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:43.000]  children from the same fate as your wonderful son has now lived through I asked you to break
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.640]  the trance of the new world order and I've got stacks of other news of other children
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:57.280]  dying as well healthy athletic four more soccer players this week died and others from the
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:07.920]  shots they pulled the swine flu vaccine for less than 20 deaths in the 1970s there's reports
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:15.840]  one out of a hundred Harvard estimates and they estimate over 20,000 deaths and over
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:22.240]  a million adverse reactions and that's just the beginning it's the same numbers around
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:28.840]  the world and I know for you the family of this poor man that's dead his destiny has
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:35.640]  been stolen from him killed by the satanic pharaoh Bill Gates I know it's hard for you
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:41.000]  to admit this truth but your son would have died in vain if you don't now research this
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:48.560]  information and become a spokesperson for the truth don't let your son's casualty be

[1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:59.840]  we want to promote independent groups out there they're like the old internet doesn't
[1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:03.880]  mean you can post porn or call for murdering people like the old internet five years ago
[1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:07.680]  but pro free speech i think in most ways i mean they'll they let us up there and most
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:11.920]  people i know i've seen some criticism like well it doesn't let you know the kkk on there
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:16.680]  or whatever look whatever the point is is that is that it's a lot freer than twitter
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:21.720]  and it works really well we're using a lot and so i appreciate him coming on he's at
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:29.120]  jason miller in dc at g e t t r dot com getter dot com we've got so much to talk about the
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:32.640]  next few segments with you jason i'm gonna go over your whole bio you're a well-known
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:37.480]  guy everybody's gonna recognize who you are but i'm really excited to see getter exploded
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:43.120]  because it just started what eight nine months ago right yeah even less than that i would
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:46.920]  say it was more like six months ago it was right at fourth of july where we asked people
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:51.200]  to declare their independence from big tech but you know alex we've had a million people
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.040]  join the platform this last week with your good friend joe rogan getting on board we're
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:59.600]  up over four million but i want to say a special thank you to you to the info wars community
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.120]  to the folks who are obviously your fans and your listeners and viewers because without
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:08.200]  folks like yourself at the beginning of this we wouldn't even have gotten to the point where
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:12.400]  we get a doctor malone where we get a joe rogan so your participation and you're standing
[1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:17.600]  up for free speech is very greatly appreciated well i appreciate you brother but i'm very
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:21.960]  excited about getter and exactly joe rogan's talking about his show he's pushing it that's
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:26.360]  how you get a chain reaction and alternative to twitter we've seen jack dorsi leave twitter
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:31.680]  and say he actually wants free speech and a web 3.0 and i think getter is right at the
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:37.560]  front lines of that yeah in the reality is you know this alex i mean if you're not the
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:41.680]  number one target for canceling in america or the entire world i don't know who would
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:45.560]  beat you maybe maybe tommy robinson might give you a run for your money but the fact
[1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:50.840]  is is the mainstream media and big tech do not want any contrarian opinions out there
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.760]  and i i i do think that at the bottom of his heart that dorsi and suckerberg and some
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:59.760]  of the other folks maybe when they started their platforms they had this this vision
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.320]  of of free speech but now it's just all about world forming and saying we're going to program
[1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:08.960]  your mind to believe what we want it's like the the matrix of resurrections movie where
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:13.000]  here's the the destiny that we get for you you have to go with it and we just march like
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.160]  sheep and no one stands up and speaks to themselves anymore or hardly anyone and that's why we
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:22.880]  got to have a community where people can do that well that's the technocracy and and
[1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:26.360]  look i i really like president trump i agree with ninety five percent of what he's done
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:30.320]  obviously i really think he won the election and and anybody that tries to say we should
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:33.640]  challenge that gets demonized and attacked but that's alright as americans democrats
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:36.880]  obviously have done that the last three or four elections in a row going back to your
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:44.520]  two thousand but trump has not so far been able to launch any really good tech and i
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:50.760]  wish he would and your guys side's getting big it works well uh and i really like it
[1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:56.800]  so that's exciting so i don't get into any inside baseball but uh why isn't trump promoting
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:03.280]  getter how do we get him over there yeah so two parts of that answer alex and i'll just
[1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:08.040]  be very blunt and upfront with you even before i formally launched getter i was in negotiations
[1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:12.080]  with president trump to try to bring him to the platform and obviously he has a big name
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:16.360]  everyone knows that president trump is ratings gold everything he touches uh turns into something
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:22.400]  that's uh fantastic and exciting i put a big big offering from when i say big like you
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:27.160]  can go buy sports franchise big somebody else came along and made an even bigger offer and
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:31.800]  that's the thing with president trump is he very much as the dealmaker in chief here is
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:35.880]  the thing though alex is that i'm still trying to get him on our platform in fact i spoke
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:40.280]  to him a couple weeks ago reminded him that i have at real donald trump held for him i
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:43.560]  don't know when his platform is going to be ready i know they've listed with the apple
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:48.440]  store to say toward the end of february we'll see it is very hard to launch a social media
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:52.400]  platform i'll tell you that from first hand experience i hope and i'm still optimistic
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.560]  we're going to get president trump on getter uh as well as his own platform because we
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:01.240]  have such a big community not just in the us but around the world and i don't think president
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:06.880]  trump should have to be sidelined for months and months we're ready to go right now well
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:12.160]  that's what it comes down to so so so getter is there today uh let's talk about some of
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:16.960]  that for listeners and viewers that don't know about it yeah absolutely so really our
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:21.160]  kind of our value proposition is the fact that we're the free speech platform where
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:26.040]  nobody is going to get cancelled or sent to digital jail or de-platformed or algorithmed
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:30.320]  simply for speaking your political opinion and you really hit the nail in the head up
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.320]  front where we do not allow pornography we do not allow isis we'd unlike uh twitter we
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.000]  do not allow the taliban where the ayatollah or the political director for hamas but people
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:44.920]  want to come on and express their political opinions then they can't there has to be a
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:50.200]  real digital townscore not this this nonsense bs uh where dorsey and zuckerberg and those
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:54.560]  guys say as long as you don't mention climate change as long as you don't mention election
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:59.920]  fraud or you don't mention uh these tyrannical vax mandates then you can have free speech
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:05.560]  that that's not that's not how free speech works but as long as you're able to essentially
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:10.920]  control yourself and not threaten illegal activity uh or go into the racial and religious
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:15.200]  epithets that you have a welcome place here and i'd say the one thing that's also different
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:19.200]  with us alex is we have one core mission at the beginning of the day at the end of the
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.760]  day is that are we supporting free speech in opposing cancel culture and if you believe
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.000]  in those two things i don't care if you're a republican or democrat if you think both
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:31.080]  parties are a bunch of losers whatever your mindset is and we want you on the platform
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:35.880]  if you agree with those two things well i mean i understand how it works with the whole
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:43.160]  infrastructure i mean if you've got something out there like gab and then one guy uses it
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:49.320]  to go shoot up a synagogue which was terrible they then blame gab and so we've got to allow
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:54.280]  free speech but at the same time you've got to have your rules and things in place or
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:58.040]  they're going to misrepresent what people try to do i mean imagine what it's like when
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:02.440]  you try to launch an independent free speech outlet i know from behind the scenes a lot
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:07.800]  of other grips organizations the attacks are insane the left comes in and stages a bunch
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:13.160]  of false flags and that's why it's so hard look at what happened to parlor and all the
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.480]  things they did to shut them down i mean i mean just thank god you guys have been able
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:22.400]  to operate you know and i think you bring up a really smart point here with parlor because
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.280]  when a lot of people don't realize exactly why parlor was the platform and it wasn't
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:32.880]  so much that the parlor was inviting bad actors but they were relying on community policing
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:36.320]  at that stage in their development to handle everything well here's the problem as you
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.960]  just pointed out it's not even just the domestic crazies that come on the platform think about
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:46.560]  the ccp think about the communist chinese think about isis think about our think about the the
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:51.840]  bots in st petersburg when you're a free speech platform you come under attack from somebody
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:57.360]  different aspects so for us we get attacked by say isis might go and try to launch things
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:02.320]  but then the same time the left-wing media doesn't attack you for being attacked and
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:06.640]  they just don't want anyone to compete with big tech and so what we think and by the way
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:10.240]  i gotta tell you even though i know sometimes the folks at gab might not have the nicest
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:14.320]  things to say about me i like the fact that there's gab i like the fact there's parlor
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:19.200]  i like the fact that president trump is gonna come out the platform what this does is it's
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:24.560]  this isn't about like us fighting on one side it's about taking power away from silicon valley
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:28.800]  no one voted for zuckerberg no one voted for dorsi why are we letting them control all the chips
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.080]  jason miller i totally agree and nobody's gonna be perfect in the process of challenging big
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:39.120]  deck all these foreign governments all these trolls and and get to liberty on a bed of
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:44.640]  feathers as thomas everson said you guys are doing a great job and are breaking out as maybe the
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:49.840]  only group to make it past all these centers and controllers and that's why we're betting on getter
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:29:01.520]  stay with us we'll be right back everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:07.440]  the build-up for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive this is
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:11.840]  their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.160]  themselves now their world government their permanent martial law their medical tyranny
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:21.760]  is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.120]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth so listen paul

[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:11.040]  the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:16.240]  organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:19.600]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.360]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:26.640]  government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for
[1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:30.720]  what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:34.720]  for about 50 percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:40.480]  find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm
[1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:47.840]  gonna tell you a little story um we had like that okay you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:52.720]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us don't want
[1:31:52.720 --> 1:32:03.120]  to share that's fine i am a worldly person meaning i like going to ball games i like going to
[1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:08.960]  concerts i like going to play golf i like going out to dinner i like the metropolitan life i i
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:15.280]  like everything that comes with this but see i have the survival instinct that is to get the hell
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:20.720]  out of democrat run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change
[1:32:20.720 --> 1:32:25.760]  course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get a
[1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:29.840]  piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live
[1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:34.400]  off the land that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:39.840]  majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out
[1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:43.920]  of anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:49.920]  internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at
[1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:55.040]  least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at
[1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:05.440]  info wars store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:28.480]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and we are back live ladies and
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:36.160]  gentlemen broadcasting worldwide with jason miller former head communications strategist for president
[1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:45.760]  trump and he is the ceo of getter g e t t r dot com that has exploded since they launched on july
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:56.000]  fourth of 2021 just about seven months ago and he's here with us now and i know that we've got
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.040]  four or five accounts on there i think about a half million people you know all together and
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:04.880]  we get a great response from him and as soon as joe roger promoted last week we saw an even
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:11.120]  bigger response and that's great because we just need a utility as the internet was first set up
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:17.280]  to talk to each other and then they can put ads on it and make money but no oh no first it's
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:21.120]  since they're alex jones and then it's since they're this and now it's take trump off twitter
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:27.280]  and that's i don't want to get into a trump bashing fest here because i really like trump and
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:32.160]  he's doing a great job getting great republicans others elected but i noticed with parlor they
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.920]  offered him a deal but he wanted to be able to kick his critics off it's like it's like trump
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:43.040]  you know sued bill mar calling him for calling him an orangutan and i mean it's it's funny why
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.280]  not laugh at it we love trump but it seems like sometimes he doesn't get that i hope
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:51.440]  his big multi-million dollar thing actually launches but i'll believe it when i see it
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:56.400]  and i hope he gets smart and comes over to get her because you guys i know have really opened the
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:02.400]  door for him yeah absolutely and just in the same way that i think you're an important voice alex
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:07.040]  and info wars community in fact that matters we can give president trump a voice right now and
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:12.000]  obviously the press releases get a certain degree of pickup but we're reaching four million people
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.560]  all over the world you know one of the cool things about this is you know the us is only about 40
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:21.280]  45 percent of the getter user base we have the president of brazil that's on the platform we just
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.440]  had the biggest pro wrestler in france joined yesterday now which i immediately volunteer with
[1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:29.200]  the guys in our team to go and fight him in the steel cage match maybe the winner can take
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:32.560]  maybe the winner can take you on alex i don't know you got the tank so you're going to win at
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:37.760]  the end of the day but it's it's a really cool thing we're you know i think that twitter and
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.480]  facebook have really made people more divisive by going and kicking people off look at dr malone
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:46.560]  look at they did a marjorie taylor green all this does is make people more upset and more
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.040]  frustrated why because we're telling the truth because we're calling them out on their bs and on
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:56.640]  their lives if we can't have this open discussion i mean let's talk about dr fouchie for a moment
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:01.760]  dr fouchie hasn't just been wrong on things he's actually lying to us and i think that's one of
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:06.960]  the things that doesn't get enough attention is dr fouchie knew at the beginning that one jab
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:12.320]  would not go and protect people permanently but now the fact that one mask two masks the entire
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:18.080]  box of masks are ineffective even scott got leave and fake new cnn have said that to be the case
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:23.680]  they're still writing herd on this this mask concept and so there has to be some place where
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:28.400]  people can have an open and honest discussion about some of the the lies that come from people
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:34.320]  in our government absolutely so let me ask you this jason where do you see this fight because
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:40.160]  you're right in the heart of the attempt by the establishment to put up a burlin wall or an electronic
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:45.680]  iron curtain so that nationalist patriots christians conservatives as free speech people
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:50.240]  liberals that are anti-war now they're getting banned i mean this is incredible corporate
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:55.840]  censorship you're right at the heart of that where is congress saying no i mean even senator
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:37:01.200]  paul gets censored when he gives a speech about an israeli study that natural immunity is way
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.080]  better than the shot and then he gets censored why don't we get what a clear and present danger
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:12.080]  this is that big tax become well to be blunt with you i think it's going to get worse before it gets
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:15.920]  better i think where we're going right now as a society is really pushing people into two different
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:21.840]  societies uh if not just if you're vaccinated you've had one two three four boosters then you
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.160]  can go to a restaurant then you can go to a gym then your kids can go to school i mean sooner
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:30.240]  it'll be the point where can kids even go to preschool unless they've had one two or three
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:35.280]  four jobs and but just the fact we're creating two different societies you look at uh new york
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:40.960]  city right now you cannot show up to work in new york city unless you show a vax card now think about
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:45.600]  people who actually have to work hourly who can't do a zoom call from their basement my dad was a
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:49.760]  welder if he didn't show up for a day of work he wouldn't get a paycheck simple as that a lot of
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:53.280]  people actually got there and make things for a living who wouldn't get paychecks unless they
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:57.200]  actually show up and work for an hour so i think it's pushing it apart i do think when republicans
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:02.080]  take back the house in the senate they'll be able to do some things at least stymie biden and some
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:05.920]  of his mandates and and what some of the federal government's doing but we still have this whole
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:11.120]  next year that we're gonna have to really hold on to the uh the mass really closely here because
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:16.080]  it's this is gonna be a tough year well you're absolutely right when i ask how bad's the censorship
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:20.720]  gonna get and why does the congress take action they've moved on to in the blue cities and all
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:27.360]  over europe out of this whole un corporate power grab the great reset to say you can't have a job
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:31.200]  you can't leave your house in australia unless you've had the shot you can't go to your work
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:38.640]  that's siege that's war that's not see germany level stuff and the left's doing it's not about
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:44.320]  vaccines it's not about the stopping covet it's about making you have an id to live your life
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.440]  and travel they don't want ids where folks crossing the border illegally but they want them for us to
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:54.480]  be able to travel down the road or go in a store i mean this is just classic tyranny
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:00.960]  yeah you make a great point nobody with that with the southern border now being wide open
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:05.040]  the way that biden's gone and changed all the trump policies that no one's there trying to test
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:10.320]  uh folks for covet is they're coming in um but sure as heck they're allowed to to walk right into
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:14.560]  the country so now it's not just that i think it's just the way that particularly the biden
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:18.640]  administration has their priorities all upside down and you know i used to think prior to biden
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:22.560]  coming in that maybe it's just there'd be a lot of the left-wing radicals that would kind of be in
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:28.000]  charge of that white house now i think it's almost worse i think nobody's in charge and you see biden
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.800]  they summon that fake white house that's across the alleyway in the eeob the old executive office
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:37.040]  building i guess that's so we can go back to the white house and just nap and not have to do his
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:42.320]  job but everything it seems to be basically the weekend at bernie's has now been transplanted to
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:47.600]  1600 pennsylvania and that really has me a concern when you think of china you think of russia uh it's
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:51.360]  just a i think a matter of one not if that becomes a lot more serious because they don't take biden
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:56.480]  seriously jason everybody knows you we've seen you all over tv even the last six years and heard
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:02.000]  the great things you have to say i've got to hear about getter but looking at trump
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.200]  obviously he's got to know bill o'rally's not a big draw i know from behind the scenes
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:10.640]  their event they had to give the tickets away with them trump would have fooled and sold tickets
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:14.640]  people don't like bill o'rally i'm not trying to attack bill o'rally i'm just he's really like last
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:20.400]  century's news and then trump needs to get more i think on the ball about attacking censorship
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:25.920]  and more on the ball back with the presidential stuff and i just don't because i want him strong
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:30.160]  i want him powerful i want him to run again i want him to get a bunch of republicans elected
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:33.760]  and i just don't know who's advising him right now because it seemed like i'm not kissing your
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:39.600]  ass it's true then it when it was steven bannon and steven miller and jason miller and others
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:45.040]  advising trump that he was a hardcore populace and i just i i mean maybe he's not communicating
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:49.120]  because he's cut off maybe i don't see what he's really saying but uh my listeners have got some
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:54.960]  real concerns so here's one of the things and and i'll tell you some i don't want to go too
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.560]  much into my conversations with president trump but i i think that you're onto something the
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:04.320]  fact that the populism the fact that his superpower so to speak his uh superman routine has always
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:09.440]  been able to bypass traditional media to say i don't have to go and sit down with fake news cnn or
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:14.240]  ms dnc i can go and talk to people directly on social media or i could come on uh you know some
[1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:20.320]  programmer or streaming programmer uh go on talk radio that's always been his power what his base
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:25.280]  is most fired up about right now for these mandates and that's really priorities one two and three
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:30.000]  we see not because we see not just the mandates creating two societies but we know they're not
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.200]  going to stop with this that's the whole thing this is all about government control what people
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:39.280]  don't realize if we don't stop these mandates now they're going to go to try to control every
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:43.760]  aspect of our lives so i think that's a winner and i've told the president that and quite frankly
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:48.480]  i think also taking on the ccp i think is also a big deal not just the fact that they sent us
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:52.240]  covid they're the fact that continue to lie manipulate everything on the trading side of
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:56.720]  things because we see with their aggression in the south china sea hey guys a lot of times
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:00.160]  we're majoring in the miners or some of the dumb stuff with cancel culture and things like that we
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:04.560]  worry about in the u.s meanwhile communist china is looking for a big expansion and we better stand
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:08.880]  up to him that's where i think if president trump was hitting on that i think his numbers are right
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:12.480]  now they're already a point or two better than when he left office i think they'd be even higher
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:17.520]  i totally agree and jason i was being nice not going to the mandates and bringing up some of the
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  other issues but yeah number one my listeners are really upset that he's not attacking the mandates
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:26.880]  more he's starting to do that and that's great i want to come back and talk about that something
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:32.080]  i want to get into getter in the final segment with you because it's easy everybody should go
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:36.640]  there everybody should join here especially folks that are still on twitter or facebook or instagram
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:40.560]  these other things you're going to be taken down ahead of them in terms folks i told trump you're
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:44.320]  going to be taken down after the election when they steal it they did it he didn't listen it's
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:52.080]  going to happen you need to leave now and get your old base to go with you but who wants to listen
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:43:00.480]  now it shows he's never right stay with us i am recording this announcement on the afternoon

[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.840]  of today half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:13.520]  injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:18.640]  of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 of the population hooked up to an
[1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:24.480]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:29.760]  spell we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:35.840]  is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:41.680]  awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:46.720]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years worth of

[1:45:54.080 --> 1:46:01.600]  at info or store.com I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:07.440]  I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:12.720]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:18.800]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:23.680]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.000]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.920]  truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:35.520]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.000]  high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices

[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:17.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:32.160]  all right big third hour with huge exclusive news breaking huge article out of the hubbingan post
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:37.680]  trying to shut down info wars we'll tell you about that but also blaming myself and russia
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:43.680]  limbaugh for the gn6 attack but i want to give jason miller of this long 10 minute segment we have
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:49.520]  left the floor because during the break we tell me a lot of powerful stuff about what they've seen
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:54.480]  what they've seen coming how trump was the test case and just how serious this fight is i mean
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:00.080]  this is a real authoritarian move by big tech and their corporate cohorts and that's why sites
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  like getter.com info wars.com particularly getter because it's like twitter it works great are so
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:11.120]  important for us to exit this now because they've got a lot more censorship coming here in the next
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:17.120]  300 days ahead of the midterm so please please break it down for us yeah so i think president
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:20.240]  trump was right when he said that if they're willing to kick him off they're going to kick
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:24.960]  everybody off and i don't think enough folks really took that to heart i mean that was where i knew
[1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:29.040]  that the the impetus was there they had to go and create some other platform and the reason how i
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:33.280]  came on board with getter is i was sitting there with dan scabino and president trump and i was
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:37.600]  seeing all these people bring these platforms in front of him i saw the getter technology and i said
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:41.680]  this is great because here's what we're always told alex is that whether we're populist or
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:46.160]  conservatives or the center right or people don't care about the politics at all but they just want
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:50.640]  to have freedom of speech or still yeah you can go build something on your own this could be inferior
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:54.800]  technology it's going to look like crap so when i when i saw the getter technology i said you know
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:59.920]  what this is good if not better than anything that silicon valley has so let's go and build it up here
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:03.680]  but as i started working basically this last spring to go and get everything put together
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:08.720]  the thing that i realized this isn't just a us problem this is something that's global in fact
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:13.600]  last month i was in strasbourg in france and actually went into the eu i went into the belly
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:17.360]  of the beast i thought for sure that some of these some of the guards are going to grab me
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:22.800]  and take me down to the the digital free speech gulag down in the basement but we actually had
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:28.880]  40 or 50 members of the european parliament all populist from i think nine or ten different
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:34.720]  countries the all were there and gave a fiery speech we have it online about about free speech
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:38.160]  about how we all need to come together and stand up if you're from spain you should be proud of
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:42.000]  you're from spain if you're from germany be proud of you're from germany you don't need to go and
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:47.120]  seed all your sovereignty to these other uh to these you know things like the eu or the un or any of
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:51.600]  this but the fact is that it's actually folks who are in the center in the center right they're
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:55.920]  doing more to bring people together and anything else but this is not a uniquely american problem
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:02.080]  big tech alex has already made that decision they want anyone who disagrees with them out this is
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:06.320]  about them a new world vision how they want to frame whether it be your education what they
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:11.120]  want to teach critical race theory all this nonsense the cancel culture the wokeness and by
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:15.840]  the way if you think that they're done with trying to cancel everybody out i mean look i
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:20.800]  assume who i know uh who's a prominent broadcaster on the lbc and the uk just got kicked off earlier
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:25.200]  today we're going to hopefully bring them on together but they are trying to cancel anybody
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:30.960]  who doesn't conform so this is the time right now before you've been kicked off another platform
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:34.080]  come get on board getter one of the cool things we have and now sometimes i hear from people
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:39.040]  well i have a lot of intellectual property i have my content means videos that are up on
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:43.520]  twitter we allow you to import all of your tweets into your getter timeline soon we're
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:47.280]  going to have that for a couple of the other platforms and so you can bring everything
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:51.600]  over and everybody at getter gets treated the same that's a big difference so just because
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.240]  you have one ideology uh you made the point one of the earlier segments that you got to have people
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:01.280]  who can disagree with you trust me i have people come on getter every day and tell me on number one
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:05.520]  but in a very new york way like a middle finger a lot of times i'll repost it and say hillary is
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:10.640]  this you or hunter i found your burner account but if you if you can't have if you can't laugh
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:14.880]  off a little bit of stuff if you can't take any criticism then it's never going to be a free
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:19.520]  speech thing so look it probably you know might be a little bit more the the negative speech
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:23.200]  sometimes i don't want but you know what uh when you're in first place everyone shoots out your from
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:30.240]  behind well absolutely and look i know nobody's going to be perfect we tried to launch a social
[1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:35.280]  network six seven years ago it was a disaster the trolls the attacks and they took down our
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:39.920]  internet service providers by filing complaints the very people that posted the stuff so the job
[1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:48.560]  you're doing is like uh hercules trying to clean out the agn stables and so and so you know overall
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:55.440]  we see you guys on a scale of one to ten ten being a wall wall west as like an eight and i couldn't
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:52:00.000]  run something like you're running and have it at a five the way stuff works so we're glad to be there
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.800]  you haven't censored us you haven't since a lot of other folks trump should come over there uh and
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:10.560]  we should just build it up and make it the new twitter make it bigger than twitter and also
[1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:16.000]  not give in to some of the fake conservative voices they're like hey let's shut down the left
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.360]  us let's censor the liberals no we're not like them and that makes it more fun to have those
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:26.240]  dingbats on there to actually look at i don't want to just go see a regurgitation of the same
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:31.600]  ideas i'm not a control freak left us and i just like the experience i have over at getter i've
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:35.200]  been on it for a couple months to know about it back when you launched it you know hoped it would
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:39.040]  go big quite frankly because it was associated with trump i thought well that won't go anywhere
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:44.240]  because you know but you did it you did a great job your team did a great job and uh we just salute
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:48.080]  you and the five minutes we've got left jason thanks for all the time what else do you want to
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:52.080]  add to our listeners other than go join getter right now how do they do it how do they download
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:58.800]  the app or what do they do absolutely uh if you're on uh apple then go to the apple play store type
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:04.240]  in getter g e t t r i have the uh the name of the company not so subtly behind me uh on the board
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:09.520]  so you can see it there uh if you're on android go to the google play store getter g e t t r or
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:13.920]  you want to do getter.com we've already done the jailbreak with your phone and then have that freedom
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:18.240]  then go to getter.com you can do it i want to let you know just a couple things we have coming up
[1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:22.880]  because i'm not satisfied with just having something that's competitor to twitter and facebook to me
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:27.040]  that's not enough next month we're going to launch our own competitor we're going to call it vision
[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:31.920]  which will be a short video format it competes with instagram reels but then also with tiktok
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:36.480]  because we know that the short video concept is that's really what drives a lot of engagement on
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:40.560]  social media but alex here's the big thing coming up in the middle of the year we're going to launch
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:46.480]  getter pay which yes will be a payment platform an online payment platform similar to an apple pay
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:50.400]  or an alley pay but there are a million of those that's not so much the unique thing what ours is
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  going to be different because we're going to have a two coin ecosystem so we're going to bring crypto
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:58.800]  and blockchain to everybody so they can see all the wonders with it and we'll have our own online
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:03.520]  marketplace but unlike facebook it won't be all chinese scammers so we've uh we'll have something
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:07.040]  it's a little bit more secure so we're going to we're going to do some really cool things so that
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.440]  the first ever social media platform that competes not only with twitter and facebook competes with
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:16.720]  instagram and tiktok but we're going to go and compete with everyone from american express to visa
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.440]  to even going and being out there in the crypto space and so there are a lot of cool things coming
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.120]  to this platform we're just glad you're on for the ride we hope everyone else comes and gives us a
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:32.560]  chance also well this is true renaissance they say that the mother of invention is necessity
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:38.160]  necessity some other of invention and what you're doing and i i mean i i'd heard this from inside
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:43.120]  baseball and i'm glad you're announcing it here today we're honored is that you guys are launching
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.320]  this this is what everybody should be striving for is to create not a conservative ecosystem
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:53.280]  not even an american ecosystem though i'm a christian i'm a conservative american but the real
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:58.960]  ecosystem is freedom and we need to build an ecosystem and a infrastructure of freedom that
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:03.600]  is exclusive to everybody that doesn't call for violence or porn or terrorism and have a good
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:08.640]  clean nice place for folks to debate and discuss things and that's what you guys are doing over
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:13.440]  together so so we totally salute you and are on board and just love the whole thing but it's
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:17.760]  got to feel good too to be on the very cutting edge of the new renaissance because because we
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:23.200]  need banking we need credit cards we need insurance we need instant messaging we need private messaging
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:29.440]  we we need what you're doing and as populist as christians as conservatives as nationalists as
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:34.160]  whoever we are the left doesn't like we are literally being put in gulags you know matt
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:40.960]  drudz predicted digital gulags 15 years ago hell i'm not even in a gulag i mean i'm shut off everything
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:45.360]  except our own infrastructure at info wars dot com that listeners help keep us on here and also
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:50.240]  know how expensive it is i haven't actually bought this on air or off air but having to build our own
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:53.600]  infrastructure is very expensive i don't think people understand that when you're trying to build
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:59.600]  something independent from big tech they're not helping you out are they no but i think that where
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:04.320]  we come with actually having a moderation platform like you said where we prevent things like porn
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.200]  prevent things like the violent threats i think that actually makes it a little bit tougher for
[1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:14.080]  people to not do business with us because we have real terms of service we actually enforce it and
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.680]  we make it in an inviting place you know one of the cool things also you and you type out
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:22.160]  the kind of the fun things with this job because it is fine i don't sleep much by doing a lot of
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:27.440]  fun even the logo back behind me that with having the torch above the tee what that torch really
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:32.240]  is about bringing democracy and freedom to places where they don't have it what i hope what my dream
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:36.880]  of this is not just i'm going to be able to go and create this cool platform that people can come
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:42.320]  and join i want to go and take down the ccp i want to go and actually that bring democracy and freedom
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:46.320]  in places where we don't have it that's why i still think that fundamentally social media can be a
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:51.040]  force for good i just think the guys in silicon valley the billionaires uh you know they might
[1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:56.240]  have their beachfront mansions and they might have the uh the super models and have lost complete
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:01.120]  touch with the rest of society i still think it could be a force for good and if i can accomplish
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:05.600]  that one thing then i think i'll help make a difference jason miller that's perfectly said
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:09.520]  you can do five more minutes with us want to come back and talk more about getter but we're back
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:15.680]  where we were 250 years ago with king george the third and and hollywood and big tech on the left
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.240]  and the republican establishment are the those establishment individuals that think they're
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:24.720]  invincible and think as they got the super model in the palace and the god that they can suppress
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:28.320]  us and dominate us but like all of their tyrants in the past they're going to learn that's not
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:32.960]  the case whether it's silicon valley or gg ping and i knew that getter was also involved
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:37.120]  promoting freedom worldwide let's talk about that for five minutes when we come back in two minutes
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:46.400]  with jason miller of getter dot com follow him on getter at jason miller in dc stay with us
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:58.320]  for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive this is their takeover and
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:02.240]  this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:07.200]  now their world government their permanent martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.400]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:17.600]  to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth so listen paul reveres when

[2:00:20.240 --> 2:00:32.240]  we got supreme court news on them with the lockdowns and forced inoculations coming up in
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:37.760]  the segment what sotomayor is saying and so much more but i want to go back to jason miller the
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:43.920]  former advisor top advisor and communications to trump who helped get him elected and so much more
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:51.120]  since there he has launched seven months ago back in july fourth of last year getter.com and
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:57.920]  all i hear is the bs in the news about sites like oh he's got some chinese coders over there
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:02.960]  so they must be chi-com operatives i went looked into months ago they're actually fighting the ccp
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:07.600]  and battling and i'll tell you a story and i don't brag like some leftist about how much minorities
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:13.600]  love me i don't see him as minorities i see him as hard-working smart people i can't go in a major
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:18.400]  chinese food restaurant in austin without my food getting bought at two or three places i go because
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:23.040]  they're like fall on gong i don't know who's over at getter but the people at the epic times the rest
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:28.480]  of it are amazing people just like russians that fled soviet system like some of the best americans
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:32.960]  or cubans that fled fidel are some of the best and so from what i heard through the great line is
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:37.520]  there are a lot of great chinese dissidents and and true freedom fighters just like they have at
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:42.720]  epic times over at getter and i just want to say not trying to scalpy from you but any of those
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:47.200]  chinese americans that hate tyranny you want to put in with us we want you you're awesome you people
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:52.960]  to get things done you i would love to see people that fled chinese evil chinese communist evil
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:58.320]  overpower big tech here and then overpower gcp i would love that so tell us about a little bit
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:05.840]  of the engine of getter and why it upsets people so much yeah absolutely and so a lot of the folks
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:10.560]  who are on the team we do have a number of folks who are originally from china who have escaped from
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.000]  the ccp's grasp and quite frankly if they went back to china they'd be killed or their families would
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:20.800]  be killed because they've spoken out against the ccp and i think that's one things a lot of folks
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:26.960]  don't realize is that the ccp itself is a very small percentage of china and but they have this
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:32.320]  that control and what they do is we saw the average chinese one i learned hate it they hate it
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:38.720]  absolutely and so when we always talk about opposing the ccp and taking them down because
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  there are a lot of freedom fighting people in china a lot of people have escaped from china and are
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:47.840]  now trying to get the message out that hey us and other countries better wake up otherwise the ccp
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.080]  is going to be eating your lunch with their expansion plans because nobody wants to live
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:58.160]  in this authoritarian dictatorship style they completely ban religion they ban free speech
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:02.480]  all of these things it's just terrible and you look at the Uyghurs who are enslavement
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:06.480]  they look at tibet what they have done that's how we got i'll give you an example
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:10.720]  enos canter freedom he plays for the boston selts he's a center for them played for the
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:15.040]  blazers last season now he's back with the selts and he joined the platform i couldn't tell you
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:19.360]  what his domestic politics are i'm guessing he's probably maybe a democrat or more left-leaning
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:25.120]  but he is standing up to lebron james he's standing up to nike he's standing up to she and the ccp
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:29.680]  we have all these great freedom fighters who've come on the platform who are making their voices
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:34.560]  heard that to me that's what's so great is that we have someone enos canter he's from turkey
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:38.880]  he's now an american citizen he loves his country so much he wants to be a citizen he is now hoping
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:44.240]  to stand up and fight the ccp and everyone who wants to essentially enslave us to the ccp so

[2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:07.520]  this is a leftist establishment corporate power grab now now before i get into that there's a
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:11.120]  lot of stuff coming in a lot of breaking news a lot of stuff i want to hit coming up at the bottom
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:17.360]  of the hour i got to talk about something i got to talk about our biggest problem in full wars
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:25.120]  and and and who the main problem is and it's me it's alex jones um i know a lot of ways to reach
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:29.520]  more people i know a lot of ways to get more information out and i know what i've got to do
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:37.280]  to win i mean i i'm on a path that if i follow it we will win and yesterday i plugged 30 seconds in
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:43.440]  four hours today i've not plugged during the main show people said well you got all these ads
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:47.600]  everybody knows people don't tune into the ads you got 10 percent of the audience you have there
[2:07:47.600 --> 2:07:54.320]  you that's why other talk shows plug every break coming out of break going into break every segment
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:58.240]  and i understand they got to make money hey this insurance company hey this tire company hey this
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:02.000]  podcast company hey this gun company because you got to get that money to run the satellites the
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.720]  infrastructure because we're not big tech we don't have the billions of people we have to have all
[2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:15.760]  the stuff ourselves that they have it cost us more than 10 million dollars a year just for bandwidth
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:23.120]  and i'm not bitching i love all the new people we're getting on bandot videos contributors i mean
[2:08:23.120 --> 2:08:28.560]  with huge followings and just like all the time like we got 10 new members today and like this one's
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:33.120]  got 10 000 views and this one's got 20 000 views and this one's got 100 000 views this one got a
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:38.800]  million i'm like how many views we get a day we're got 10 million views today alex and your bill's
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:46.240]  gonna be 20 000 you know so i'm trying to build an infrastructure that's independent that's pro
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:52.480]  freedom for everybody as long as you don't commit crimes we believe in that that's what we're trying
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:56.960]  to build that's what we behind the scenes have been building we have our own radio and tv satellite
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:03.680]  up links our own encoders our own everything and they are so upset that if it's like oxygen to a fire
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:10.880]  that if the liberty movement ever understands how important money is and funds their own credit card
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:16.560]  processing and their own social media and their own gun companies and their own travel companies
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:24.560]  and their own airlines we have every race color and creed in the western world have the money as
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:28.640]  as a middle class that the elite's trying to get rid of as their competition because it's your choice
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:33.840]  to fund other companies and do other things they don't want you to have money they want you dependent
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:41.120]  they want you under their control and so they're so scared because they got our phones tapped and
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:45.040]  our enemy you know our enemies are tracking what we're doing and they know what's going on over here
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:50.800]  and what's going over there and things i'm not ready to say on air yet but there are a lot of
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:55.520]  pissed off people in the media and a lot of pissed off people in government corporations that are
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:10:04.080]  building incredible stuff right now and we're part of it major bank processing major new networks
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:15.280]  major new studios and it's all almost done and we're just a small part of it but they're going
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:20.880]  to try to blow all that up on the ground it's like in the movie dune the new one that came out
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:26.480]  that's so good uh when the harkens attack the the the main base and they're asleep the enemies turn
[2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:30.800]  the shields off by the time they get out they're dropping the bombs on the ships boom boom boom
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:34.320]  well guess what we already launched some of our ships they're already in orbit you didn't get them
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:39.920]  all even if you blow us up it's too late so i mean this is a war ladies and gentlemen
[2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:49.840]  this is a war this is so real this is so insane and it's so transparent to know the attacks
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:55.280]  and know what they're going to do because it's so formulaic someone talk about that right now
[2:10:55.280 --> 2:11:03.920]  now but i haven't plugged in two days properly and if we sell a hundred and fifty thousand
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:08.160]  dollars or two hundred thousand dollars worth of product and then make fifty sixty thousand
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:12.800]  dollars to pay for everything a day we're able to operate with all these crew and all these
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:18.240]  employees you'll see like establishment leftist sites need ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:27.600]  million a year vice had billions a year and they went under funded by hbo billions and so we've never
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:32.080]  hidden how much money we bring in i've told you on air yeah last year we sold thirty something million
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:38.160]  dollars worth of food and we made less than ten million doesn't matter it went into what we're
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:45.840]  doing i told you i sold my house to fund the money into this my bigger house i have a smaller house
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:50.480]  i never liked the big house i got as an investment so i'm not i'm not a leftist that's ashamed of
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:55.840]  money i'm not a leftist that's ashamed of wealth hell if you made it and you did it and it's great
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:59.280]  you make a better invention everybody buys it you got a freaking spaceship that's great
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:03.360]  but my mission is not to just have a bunch of money that's way down the line of my hierarchy
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:08.880]  and needs my mission is to build an infrastructure to resist the new world order and take them on
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:14.720]  and they know that so they've taken credit card processors and sponsors and bank accounts and
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:21.200]  harassed us and used lawsuits against us to get discovery to then use that as the infrastructure
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:26.560]  a targeting points to try to shut us down and there was a protective order just like a month
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.920]  ago in the default judgments against alex jones to give our financials over and i said to the
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  lawyers i said this will be in the hubbing and post within a month and it was even picked the group
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:41.440]  i know who they do it with and it happened and it doesn't even hurt us it's exactly what i told you
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:48.960]  that we bring in 50 million dollars a year on average and that we need 30 million to operate
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:54.640]  at least and because we bring in the 50 the left even says to us they go well you got 100 million
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.040]  dollars here oh you mean 100 million and gross sales in a couple years that's not money they
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:04.000]  will that's money they don't even understand that or they think you don't understand that so
[2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:09.040]  i'm going to cover this because it's bigger than alex jones it's all just their attack
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:15.920]  big tech has its trillions and spies on you and sells your data and censors you oh but they're good
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:22.000]  big tech with their jumbo jets and you know google has more than 20 people worth over 50
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:28.320]  million dollars you know oh that's okay and jeff buoys those with 200 million and and all that's
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:39.600]  all right look at this the left alex jones info or store made they think you're so stupid you mean
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:47.280]  the word is grossed 165 million over three years that's a little exaggerated but pretty much accurate
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:55.120]  and they go on to say jones has 165 million dollars he can pay it to the sandy hook families
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:59.600]  and they go on and say jones made it off them really you hear me talk about these people
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:05.040]  eight years ago five years ago hardly ever no the idea of that is preposterous but they say
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:12.880]  he's got 160 plus million dollars he needs to pay it like you're a low-grade moron who thinks that
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:17.680]  okay i sold 30 something million dollars of food and kept 10 million of it and then paid to run
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:22.480]  an infrastructure and bought all these ads all over the internet to promote freedom the average
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:27.360]  business person goes that's ridiculous but that's the social envy of the ultra rich billionaire
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:33.360]  big tech titans thinking the public doesn't know about business but a conservative christian broadcast
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:37.600]  has people that run businesses and they know if your business brings in a million dollars
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:44.560]  you're lucky if you get 10 000 so my listeners i know off of this because no weapon formed against
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:48.960]  this will prosper and i haven't even plugged the last two days this reminds me in the name of this
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:53.600]  i'm plugging every segment and we're gonna actually raise the money we need to stay on air and launch
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:59.360]  all these operations like i shouldn't even have sold my house i should have just gone and and and
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:05.360]  raised money from you but i want it all in here but the idea that oh jones look he's got gold look
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:13.040]  at him he's like a rapper he's got gold like scrooge mcduck and duck tails diving into gold
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:20.160]  he says he needs money but he doesn't he's got plenty of money oh to the sandy hook families
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:29.040]  he made it all off them lie upon bs upon garbage and you sit there and you read this stuff and it
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:36.480]  just shows where they're coming from and what they're doing and that's the great part about it is
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:44.400]  there isn't any money and that's why they're so pissed because they're never gonna get anything
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:50.000]  it all goes into the operation and the employees and the bandwidth
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:54.240]  we'll be right back stay with us
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:04.400]  i am recording this announcement on the afternoon of january 6 2022 and that means there are only

[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:08.320]  till they've got their world idea and that's exactly what the covid passports are all about
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:14.320]  and clout swab and the u n and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:20.160]  they've gotten you with that system then they're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:25.280]  what you do and publicly they're saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:30.400]  can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing
[2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:36.000]  they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it this is the
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:41.840]  holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:46.560]  no finally folks are starting to wake up joe rogan tucker carlson others who leave the charts
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:51.760]  along with info wars but it's not enough every individual has to not comply we have to talk
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:56.400]  about bringing the globalists to justice you see they need the fear of god put in them legally
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:04.640]  and lawfully in late august info wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:11.040]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:16.640]  and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen storable food has always been something
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:20.800]  that's important to have it's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taking care of right

[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:11.040]  where the other patricks can get on the line alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:17.840]  oan shroyer supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:23.680]  supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:29.760]  been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.880]  quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:38.800]  is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:42.720]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:48.960]  so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:20:03.040]  Royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:20:03.040 --> 2:20:13.120]  order it's alex jones
[2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:20.560]  all right welcome back this story is a lot bigger than alex jones this affects how any christian
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:26.000]  any conservative any nationalist any patriot any veteran in this country or in europe that matters
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:31.120]  being targeted by the globalists to be purged bankrupted and shut down i've been very honest
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:36.000]  with the listeners here on the show i've said we bring in over 50 million dollars a year and
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:41.840]  we try not to mark stuff up too much so we need 30 million dollars and 95 percent of our funding
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.880]  doesn't come from sponsors they harass those away it comes from you buying product and
[2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:54.480]  take storeable food i mean we make 30 percent or so on that a water filter 25 percent when it's
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:21:01.600]  discounted less uh an air filter 15 20 percent when it's discounted 30 percent when it's not so
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:06.560]  yeah we've sold millions and millions of dollars worth of air filters last year millions of dollars
[2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:12.880]  of water filters and we made on average like 20 percent on and they're good high quality highest
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:18.560]  rated but it cost them like a hundred bucks to make them at the factory and they sell them to us
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:25.760]  for 150 and we sell them for 200 i mean that's how this works so yeah i sold i don't know how the
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:29.040]  numbers are from me five million dollars where the water filters last year was the number i saw a
[2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:38.240]  few weeks ago and we made a million bucks on that which then goes back to run this operation which
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:43.760]  we had to build our own infrastructure i mean we're so close to getting shut down and they have a
[2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:50.400]  huge huffington post article that we knew was coming i sat there to the little lawyers i said okay i
[2:21:50.400 --> 2:21:53.200]  use protective order on this i said i'm not really worried about it i'm gonna explain to
[2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:57.920]  my listeners it'll be in the walk it'll be in the huffington post within a month and of course i
[2:21:57.920 --> 2:22:03.520]  even knew the publication because that's where they put it out in and that's where it is i mean i
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:08.320]  just it's so weird to be around adults and they're like children mentally and i'm being honest about
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:12.960]  i'll tell lawyers their face like how many times i'll tell you exactly what they're gonna do and
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:17.920]  they don't care well the judge says you know we got to give them all your financials because you
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:22.720]  know you're defaulted because because we gave them everything but they say oh you don't get a jury
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:28.160]  trial for whether you're guilty or not we just decide how much money you have and so the huffington
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:33.760]  post makes graphics where the top of my head blows off and money shoots out oh like hunter biden for
[2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:39.600]  his million dollar paintings a piece that the chinese government buys so i've told you this
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:43.840]  was coming and and they just think you're morons and i i know you're not because you actually
[2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:50.720]  own gas stations and restaurants and auto parts stores and farms and you know oh you sold your
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:56.400]  crop for two million dollars and your property taxes eight hundred thousand and your workers are
[2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:01.680]  four hundred thousand and your seeds cost a couple hundred thousand and your chemical oh god you made
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:14.640]  fifty thousand dollars so i pledged this because here's i was gonna take off next week i'm not
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:19.760]  taking off now and i'm not coming in here and i'm not whining quite frankly we were three million
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:24.480]  dollars in the hole and i was able to spend every dime from our home sale to pay for that off which
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:29.200]  is fine but actually i want to put that new projects i'm coming in here now because we're
[2:23:29.200 --> 2:23:33.920]  raising three million dollars next week in the name of defeating this and i'm not going to be a
[2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:38.000]  bitch anymore and i'm not going to complain and whine and i want to appreciate our enemy line about
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:42.400]  us and just and doing this to us and leaking this stuff because we knew it was coming and i'm not
[2:23:42.400 --> 2:23:48.720]  going to back down to these people you've got my commitment seriously yeah you get tired you get
[2:23:48.720 --> 2:23:54.160]  exhausted you feel sorry for yourself to get stabbed in the back betrayed again good that's why i'm
[2:23:54.160 --> 2:24:01.360]  here for the children i'm standing up for them but i mean here's an example my ex-wife files an
[2:24:01.360 --> 2:24:07.040]  emergency injunction hearing yesterday because my current wife who's in drug rehab right now and i love
[2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:11.920]  her um got but from the system without me even knowing on some psychotropic that mixed together
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:16.400]  she went out of her mind and got arrested and so she goes and files an emergency injunction because
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:21.520]  my 19 year olds moved out and my you know uh a younger children live with me and into her from
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:27.520]  her and she wants them and then it gets sent out over twitter the private you know zoom meeting and
[2:24:27.520 --> 2:24:33.360]  put out everywhere and they show me with my hand in my face and they go jones just lost a hearing
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:45.200]  today but i didn't lose the hearing i won the hearing my children are with me but it doesn't
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:51.600]  matter the left got me in an hour's of listening to it when i head like this just sitting there like
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:56.880]  half asleep i'm sitting there asleep they go oh look jones is covering his face jones is losing
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:02.320]  you know who's losing our children you know who's losing is our sovereignty you know who's losing
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:06.560]  the buying power of our dollar i'm under attack because i'm standing up against these criminals
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:13.360]  the globalist but that's and by the way i'm not going to show you the video they put out on twitter
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:16.640]  that they weren't supposed to release that's sealed because it deals with children in family
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:23.360]  court but that's how the democratic party operates and that's what they do in a hearing that i won
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:34.400]  on everything 36 requests and they the court agreed with us and i wasn't going to talk about
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:40.080]  my own private life but that's the left showing an image of me on zoom just sitting there half asleep
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:45.840]  going my god how long does this go on and again the deception of the left the deception of twitter
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:50.240]  the way they manipulate the way they lie so i had people call me last night because twitter put
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:54.000]  at the top of twitter had millions of views this photo we're not going to show it because it's
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:26:00.720]  violence court order and are you doing all right sorry to hear you lost your kids didn't happen
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:08.800]  but the left doesn't care it's a simulation to them in the dopamine alex jones just lost his
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:17.200]  children they said oh they also said over twitter alex jones beat his children and his wife that's
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:24.400]  why his children got taken and they showed the image and again that's what they do to america
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:28.480]  that's what they do to you when they have pedophile story time and a convicted pedophile comes into
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:32.880]  the school and your five-year-old gets set in their lap in an evil ritual they just gaslight you
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:39.200]  and say so what it's good it's nice you know biological men can compete women's sports oh

[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:03.760]  so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i
[2:32:03.760 --> 2:32:09.120]  had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard doctor group
[2:32:09.120 --> 2:32:13.680]  on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1
[2:32:13.680 --> 2:32:17.760]  and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had you know
[2:32:17.760 --> 2:32:22.080]  with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man in two
[2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:28.400]  weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think
[2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:33.840]  again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:38.400]  health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely
[2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:42.880]  amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:47.280]  just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:52.000]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:56.720]  health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:05.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:16.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:22.160]  so they've been platformed us taking our bank accounts our credit cards over and over again
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:28.320]  and then the left makes a joke about it when we say hey fundus support us we need to help us stay on
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:35.040]  there always cynical as they commit their crimes against humanity and and here's the hubby in post
[2:33:35.040 --> 2:33:39.440]  article dealing with this i'm not going to read the whole thing and it's just riddle the disinformation
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:48.720]  lies but also lying by omission alex jones info war store made 165 million made no made is what you
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:56.400]  keep grossed 165 million over three years record show and then they use years ago our big years
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:02.240]  that i've told you we had bigger years previously now they've not been as big for years conspiracy
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:09.040]  theorist and disinformation peddler oh yes i said they'd use a vaccine hysteria to take over alex
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:13.200]  jones has told his supporters that the only thing keeping us meeting empire float is their
[2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:19.520]  financial backing uh by buying stuff at the store which is totally true as much begging as i do we
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:24.480]  can barely pay the bills jones told a caller on thursday during a segment i was ready to show
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:29.280]  prompting promoting the info or store that yeah that's an ad from years ago i'm not going to stop
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:34.720]  growth and let them push us backwards i need your help frank i need your help so they said i said
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:40.000]  that on thursday on the show okay no that's from five years ago but it doesn't matter it just it
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:46.080]  just they can't even tell the truth when they try despite his pleas for money info or store where
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:53.920]  jones sells an amalgamation of dietary supplements and survival gear made 165 million in sales from
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:35:00.320]  september 2015 to the end of 2018 according to court filings related to a lawsuit jones
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:06.240]  recently lost i lost it because the judge says i don't get a jury trial the the democrat judge
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.560]  just both of them said in connecticut and here related to a lawsuit jones recently lost yeah
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.000]  without without a trial because we're in the new america about 2012 sandy hook school massacre
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:23.200]  that i barely even ever talked about the records obtained by the hubbin and post yeah yeah right
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:28.080]  give the clearest picture to date of the financial situation of the info or his website
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:35.920]  and jones himself the records also provide a window into how vast and powerful jones reaches
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.720]  and may provide clues into how he funds his political activities which he got to shut down
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:48.320]  right because you're the good guys right silent speech including his participation in the u.s
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:54.240]  capital attack of january six oh the terrorists they're fighting hubbin and post is publishing
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:02.000]  the full financial records of the store isn't that nice you get sued in local county court give
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.960]  them everything they say you gave them nothing so you're defaulted and then your full records are
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:15.680]  put on the internet because you gave them nothing what are our financial records have to do with
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:20.800]  what i said about sandy hook questioning it like i questioned bubba smollett and the iraq war wmd
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:25.360]  and everything else and so did the internet what does that have to do with it absolutely nothing
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:28.880]  my lawyers are like we've never seen anybody demand all the financial records

[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:36.400]  and i said my lawyers already know i told me bringing a 50-something million a year and
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.120]  barely you know pay the bills most of that's cost

[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:56.800]  alright they're not firing now they know what i told them but but the point is is that is that
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:37:00.560]  that's where this is that that's how they're like well that's a protective warrior they're not gonna
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:06.160]  do that they don't care america's a doormat the bill of rights the first amendment the second the 10

[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:27.360]  donate to us or buy products from us because they feel sorry for us this is because they want to
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:33.680]  silence us so we can't warn people and expose what they're doing and it's all aimed at attacking
[2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:38.480]  our main funding mechanism to get rid of that this is i haven't been working behind the scenes
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:44.000]  and set up backups and we knew this was all coming but the point is is that's why i've been busier
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:49.840]  than a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest and putting a lot of money and time and energy
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:54.960]  into building new infrastructures because they're not just taking me down before the midterms baby

[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:03.680]  witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what the globalists are doing
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:08.800]  right now this is their big offensive this is their takeover and this is the point that they're at
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:12.880]  their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves now their world government their
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:18.400]  permanent martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:24.080]  exposed but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:28.560]  people telling the truth so listen paul reveres when you spread the word about the broadcast when
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:32.560]  you pray for the broadcast you're the tip of the sphere and when you buy products at info war
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:36.960]  store dot com you keep us on air plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months

[2:43:53.040 --> 2:44:00.960]  only way we fail is if you don't take action the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:06.320]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:11.360]  and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:18.400]  and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:25.680]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:32.000]  would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:39.280]  their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they
[2:44:39.280 --> 2:44:44.320]  know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:48.560]  that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:54.400]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world

[2:47:52.160 --> 2:48:00.160]  and they say in the same article one paragraph above the next jones never gave him any documents
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:03.840]  that's why he was defaulted that's why we have all his bank accounts now published it having to
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:08.960]  post like like how dumb you got to be like he gave us no documents here they all are
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:17.440]  but that's how they operate that's how they do it millions of dollars a quarter just to pay for

[2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:45.040]  35 million years tyrannosaurus rex but it was not a tyrannosaurus rex that's the same left that
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:52.000]  five years ago when they said that the trump sons don jr and eric had killed a
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:50:01.920]  endangered triceratops and the media thought it was real yeah went around for hours on the
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:08.480]  mainstream news that triceratops has not worked walk the earth in a long long time you can debate
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:14.160]  how long but we got some fun coming up at the start of the next hour but i mean i'm just gonna go
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:20.480]  back to this i'm gonna be i really want all the democrats and globalists and you know the
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:23.440]  pedophiles that run the democratic party and all the rest of them know something right now
[2:50:24.160 --> 2:50:30.480]  i was sitting there when i got married on january 6 five years ago when my new wife was pregnant
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:36.480]  with our wonderful daughter that's four and a half now and i looked at her and i said i want to be
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:41.920]  out of info wars in five years and i want to move on because it obsesses me it's all i do and i it's
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:46.480]  killing me and i said i want to hand the baton on to others and god has really touched my heart
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:51.680]  that there's gonna be other leaders and just people that are gonna stand up and wake up my
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:56.800]  wife looked at me sitting there in the big island at the four seasons which i wouldn't have gone to
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:02.480]  when it bill gates owned it was beautiful and she said who who who do you think will fill your shoes
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:09.760]  and i said joe rogan i said joe rogan is is is going to be the guy and she's like joe rogan
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:14.960]  you know he's like kind of a leftist i said i just know joe i i just i feel that he's going to be
[2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:19.360]  the big leader let me ask her you can ask her i told her this sitting there looking at with
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:24.880]  burning tiki torches eating dinner looking on over the pacific ocean i mean i knew this i knew
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:29.120]  all this it's like you don't get the exact data you just get it and like i've learned it's never
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:36.880]  wrong folks and so i told her i said i said within five years i commit to you that i'm only going
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:40.480]  to be on air one day a week and i might write a book a year or make one film a year but that's
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:46.080]  it because i really want to transition out of this and we're five years later there are fifth
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:54.160]  anniversary yesterday january 6 we got married on january 6 and a few years later four years later
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:52:04.880]  you saw what happened on january 6 and i never break my promises so i don't know but we're winning
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:09.600]  and you the audience that funded issue one you did this i mean tucker carlson's told me that i
[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:15.120]  helped wake him up was instrumental in it i'm not going to say more than that so it's joe rogan on
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:21.840]  record and so have a lot of other people off record balsam our son told me that and others and again
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:27.680]  it's not about credit it's about credit to you but it's more about the holy spirit that the
[2:52:27.680 --> 2:52:31.280]  devil worshipers watching right now laugh at because they know that's the power of the universe
[2:52:31.280 --> 2:52:37.680]  that's the ether that's the trans dimensional carrier wave broadcast they got their 5g we got
[2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:48.240]  the holy spirit the infinity g but i knew all this was going down and i understood it and i tell you
[2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:58.000]  it's a potential here we've reached the end of alec shones and it's not because of democrats
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:01.920]  and corrupt courts and all that i already knew this five years ago and it's not because of something
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:06.240]  you didn't do and it's not because anything and i've got a new mission i'm going to continue on
[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:11.120]  air as long as possible i'm just saying you're the most important person in the world whether
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:16.080]  you're in africa or whether you're in asia or latin america or north america or europe
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:21.360]  wherever you are you are the most important person in the world you are a populist you love god
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:32.320]  you're pro-human and i don't want to say my stories are almost over but everything i did
[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:37.520]  i was following a path very clearly laid out that i didn't understand each step but i knew the
[2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:42.560]  path i was supposed to take and i have a i have a big new mission and it's now forming in my mind
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:50.880]  um and and it's developing but i just want you to know this is the time for you to be hurt this is
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:55.680]  the time for you to stand up this is the time for you to speak out this is the time for you to fight
[2:53:55.680 --> 2:54:00.800]  back because they want to destroy me because i stood up for you they want to destroy me because i'm
[2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:05.360]  not a devil worshipper like them i don't worship the power structure i don't worship war i don't
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:13.120]  worship pedophilia i don't worship corruption i don't worship evil and this is going to be the
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:17.520]  time now where you decide what you're going to do and how you're going to stand up in history
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:23.120]  but i tell you with the great harissa smith and the christie lee and the oan schreuer and all the
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:29.760]  great crew we've got here and and what info wars is we're only going to continue on to the future
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:34.880]  in whatever we do because i don't say it's the end of info wars i say it's the it's the dawn of
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  something new or where we're going into something big where a metamorphosis is happening and i'm
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:45.280]  i'm not quite sure until i go through that psychic wall what it is but i know it's big
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:52.320]  and i know it's a big test and i'm gonna follow it and i'm gonna do it but it takes your word of
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:58.720]  mouth and it takes your prayer and it takes your financial support so next week today
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:02.320]  a month from now three the last time you ever get info wars t-shirt literally i don't just hype
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:06.800]  stuff folks i don't say stuff that i don't actually believe i mean there's a very good chance in the
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.320]  next year we're not here i'd give it well above 50 percent and i'm not trying to curse us i i'm
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:18.640]  telling you it's a god's hands in your hands but when we go off the lights go off that means they're
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:23.600]  coming for you and quite frankly at that level then i can just worry about my family i don't want
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:27.440]  that to happen i want to hold them off as long as i can but folks i can't hold them off much longer
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:33.520]  okay and we've been trying as hard as we can and don't worry though god's gonna judge all the people
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:38.080]  that serve this they're gonna beg as their houses burned down as they starve to death why did they
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:43.040]  do this but we're sad for them we're not gonna have victory over our enemies that destroy themselves
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:50.400]  we're here to protect our children so now like you never have before share every article share
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:55.280]  every video take clips of it download it save it because there'll be a time if we don't turn this
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:56:00.000]  back now we might turn it back god might give us a reprieve like none of them where you don't
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:05.120]  ever hear me again you don't ever see me again but you won't hear anybody or see anybody it'll
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:11.200]  all be the globalist message one channel and if you want your food take this shot do what we say
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:19.360]  the robots are in the streets the combat systems are there this is it this is a post human ai alien
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:29.120]  takeover all of it's none of this world but we got our sponsor satan's got his minions we've got
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:34.480]  our booster they got their system so i'm gonna tell you again ladies and gentlemen i want to
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:39.280]  drive into the future i want to be on air in 10 years and turn the tide defeat the new world order
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:44.400]  and all the rest of it but we can't even continue into next year where there are attacks on our
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:48.880]  finances and everything they do and how they obsess over all day if you don't support those local
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:52.800]  lamb and FM stations and send them a check every month for carrying the show that it's just as
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:57.440]  important as supporting us and if you don't get the water filters the air filters the storeable
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:03.280]  food the books and the films and the t-shirts and the what we sell instead of a big box store
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:10.000]  that tirelessly fights with everything we've got to take these monsters on and to see the desire
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:14.320]  of these people i just want to get away from them i don't but i see them scrambling and attacking
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:20.560]  and clawing at the door not to get to me but to get to the children and i'm just like why am i begging
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:24.720]  for money to fight them why does trump get two billion to start his thing it doesn't even work
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.400]  and all these other sites he won't even join why why does evil have to run around and get away
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:36.320]  with it and why are their servants so pathetic and why don't we let them win so go now to info

[3:00:08.640 --> 3:00:15.520]  coming up in about 10 minutes jason bermas takes over but first i successfully hunted in east texas
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:24.320]  a very endangered animal tyrannosaurus rex that's coming up next segment but seriously folks
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:31.120]  it's the naivete of the system and it's just how crazy it all is and how the left operates now
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:38.640]  where once they green light to attack somebody they do anything absolutely anything and
[3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:45.440]  and it's almost a form of slavery in that i really care about fighting and i really care
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:49.520]  about fighting the new world order but i've been for a long time trying to find a bunch of talk show
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:54.560]  host to start a network and just kind of segue out and i pop in sometimes like brett hume or
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:59.520]  something because man when you're doing something 28 years like every day i mean i don't dislike it
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:05.600]  it's actually it's all i do i'm at home all i'm i can't watch a football game used to love football
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:10.240]  games 20 years ago i'm on ski slopes all i'm thinking about is work i'm in a funeral all
[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:14.960]  i'm just thinking about work i'm at church i'm at the grocery store i can't get out of it i get it
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.040]  i know i know how you feel because you're tuned in here you obviously care too
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:25.120]  and then they mess with you then they try to silence you then they try to censor you then
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:30.000]  they try to shut you up and then it's a fight and i mean you know let's think about a fight with
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:35.120]  anybody that's worth their salt i mean i even know nerds and wimson people because i've seen it happen
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.800]  with thugs where they go up and punch the little nerd the nerd starts beating them living hell out
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:43.200]  i'm gonna fight back hard at least because you know i'm not looking for a fire thing okay you
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.480]  just punched me in the head man i'm about to beat the living hell out of you or die trying
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:53.440]  because once somebody punches you upside the head you're not scared anymore now you're actually
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:58.880]  about to literally break somebody's neck and and and that's where i am with these globalists you see
[3:01:58.880 --> 3:02:04.000]  we've put up with them so long they've gotten away with so much that now the biggest message of the
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:10.720]  day show is they're trying to start a massive giant false flag so i told my four and a half year old
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:16.640]  daughter this morning she keeps asking to go to this particular place i'm leaving a text people
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:20.320]  will go there if i say where i'm going she wants to go to this kind of amusement park thing i'll
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:24.800]  leave it at that in texas she's been asking for a year and i said you know what she got up at six
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:30.000]  a.m was asking for it i said well take you to the thing tomorrow absolutely i'll take you there
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.800]  i'm gonna go home tonight and i'm gonna tell her sorry honey we're not taking you to that
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:40.960]  because she has no future if i don't beat these people and we're gonna come in here with a focused
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.720]  unedited live analysis of the false flag globalist plan for at least two hours and shove that up
[3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:51.680]  the new world order's ass that's what happens when you mess with me that's what happens every
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:56.160]  time you attack that's fine because you know the truth is she doesn't need to go to daddy
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:00.800]  and ride on a ferris wheel and she doesn't need to ride a pony and throw darts with daddy and
[3:03:00.800 --> 3:03:05.920]  get the little thingy oh she could do that in a free country she should but we're under attack
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:10.720]  do you think people in russia during boba rosa with 10 million germans were invading
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:15.840]  killing millions of people do you think the russians thought well i'm gonna take my daughter
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:21.920]  to the local fair and and and you know it's there weren't any local fairs because you're in a war
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:27.360]  but that's the thing they keep the movies and the culture and the ufc and oh come come to our party
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:32.720]  flying on a private jet and i get all that stuff but there's no fun on a private jet flying to the
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:39.680]  miami party or the new york party when it's all going down and i'm not up here on some high
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:46.160]  worst spot oh i get invited all the stuff i'm saying i get it i want to go to ufc with joe rogan
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:53.040]  get invited to that stuff with joe rogan don't go because i can't i got to stay here and fight
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:59.360]  these people because they're freaking devils and then i get to sit here and look at the
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:05.600]  huffington post with me as a gold-headed goblin my head blowing off with all this money oh i don't

[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:29.200]  five million dollars and we're like uh we don't have a hundred and sixty five million dollars

[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:20.800]  here let's look out this cold front blew in that's about 65 yards away got a little
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:24.560]  hollow pieces of metal and also some wood
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:31.760]  i'm gonna try to shoot it try to shoot the wool on the top
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:42.400]  piece of firewood get on we'll go over there look at it in a second
[3:08:46.400 --> 3:08:51.280]  these are really hard to find i didn't know this i guess in the new geographic
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:55.520]  Jurassic Park movie a few years ago they killed t-rexes with what's funny is there's
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:09:04.960]  actually a t-rex out here i'm gonna show you i'm not joking all right that's pretty fun maybe
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:08.880]  a few more of these they're gonna target further out there about 170 yards
[3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:16.000]  that again we were able to shoot five six inch roofings on that was sitting down
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:25.920]  there all right now let's go see the target now i'm going to show you an actual t-rex out
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:31.680]  here this isn't a joke and i'm not playing games so again i was aiming at this piece of firewood
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:37.680]  that i had up on top and it hit basically right where i was aiming i was aiming about right
[3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:46.800]  there it hit right there really lost a lot of damage right there let's see what we were shooting at
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:49.520]  earlier a lot of holes just really fun it blows huge holes normally with other rifles it would
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:54.560]  go in and just come out about twice as large that comes out about five times larger six times
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  larger seven times larger than an ammeter because it's just mushrooms open and dissipates a lot
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:03.840]  of its power the travels at 2,300 feet per second out of the muzzle which is really fast
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:11.040]  for these big old-fashioned cartridges but look at this right here see how it comes in very clean
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:16.880]  very clean holes and then even by the time it goes through it makes a larger hole
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:24.320]  then it blows huge holes on the other side and then it comes out really large on the other side
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:31.440]  now i'm not joking there's a t-rex out here i'm going to take you to it it's only a couple
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:35.360]  hundred yards left like let me get a shot of before you're right now we may have to use
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:37.360]  this rifle on it
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:52.880]  guys i'm not kidding he was shooting right out here he must have just jumped back in the woods
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:59.920]  oh my gosh there he is right there oh my lord this is real as masking be said for COVID-19
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:04.800]  good lord now here's the whole story on this i just got fun got a little back in the 60s but
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:09.360]  i'm here in the first trip here because my mom always likes those dinosaurs they saw inside
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:21.040]  the road those metal dinosaurs but even cooler is a brachiosaur that's bigger than it looks
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:29.840]  from this distance it's about that's about six seven feet tall it's about 15 feet tall see there
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:35.280]  he is the misclear since the brachiosaur all the problems they won't let me shoot and they'll be
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:53.200]  great targets so there you go folks info orbs.com tomorrow's news today

[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:23.440]  out here an old oil well pad
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:27.440]  east texas
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:41.360]  our children's future is burning up right in front of us
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:47.440]  they're literally being fed on by the globalists exercising their power and will over us
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:57.040]  as we fell away from god and now evils fill the vacuum
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:03.440]  all right folks jason bermas takes over the rest of the hour here's a little bit of texas fun
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:10.640]  from info wars.com we'll do in fireside chats very very soon jason bermas tells us what's coming up
[3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:20.640]  well alex it is now one year and one day from the fake insurrection um there is no insurrection
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:27.760]  i was going to show some footage i'm wearing my outfit that i actually wore that day it was like
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:35.200]  maybe uh dav matthew's band concert type of deal i want to go through not only that but
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:42.160]  how the supreme court right now no matter what their decision is really ruling on the right
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:49.520]  for you to be a sovereign human being on this planet and have domain over your own life
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:54.720]  and then on top of that i want to talk about this transhumanist agenda and how hollywood
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:14:02.480]  continues to push it with not only predictive programming but things like don't look up that
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:10.800]  are now giving these chicken little scenarios of asteroid or comet attacks relevance and pushing
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:16.320]  this agenda again that climate change is the new thing that we have to worry about that is the new
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:25.040]  denialism and all of this is happening with a big tech censorship of things that we can no longer
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:32.800]  ignore it's not just kovat it's not just medical misinformation it's things like the epstein case
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:39.360]  you know i came on here last week we had a joke about the uh cocaine scenario i posted the first
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:45.200]  15 minutes of that video of course it got struck down for cyber bullying and harassment i said
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:51.600]  obviously uh alex and i didn't harass each other was nothing there no it was because we had a
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:59.120]  conspiracy theory with an idot an identity identifiable individual in other words you're not
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:03.040]  allowed to talk about the glane maxwell case you're not allowed to talk about the epstein case
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:07.760]  you're not allowed to talk about the intelligence ties you're not allowed to talk about the fact
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:15.600]  that in 2007 they protected a multitude of other co-conspirators and that was not
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:22.480]  whispered about in this trial okay so this is moving extremely quickly they are weaponizing
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:28.640]  the justice department against us invoking things like pearl harbour well i remember reading about
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:35.760]  a new pearl harbour before 9 11 and a little thing called the peanut new american century
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:41.360]  document and if we allow these people to take hold of this quote unquote new american century

[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:14.320]  in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:18.000]  you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:22.160]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government take over
[3:18:22.160 --> 3:18:25.680]  so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the
[3:18:25.680 --> 3:18:30.160]  price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more

[3:20:12.960 --> 3:20:20.240]  here by Jason Burma's here doing the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and let's take a look
[3:20:20.240 --> 3:20:29.120]  what Merrick Garland and the gang want to call domestic terrorism now out of the gates I want
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:36.080]  to say this the mainstream media NBC in particular stole my footage and ran it as an exclusive now
[3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:40.880]  when I called them out on it their lawyer contacted me I put this out there but I'm not mainstream
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:20:48.880]  media I didn't lawyer up we'll just steal Jason's footage now what you're looking at here is me on
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:56.640]  the second level of the Capitol and I do want to reiterate right now as I play these clips and
[3:20:56.640 --> 3:21:02.880]  you know I got about a couple hours of footage from the time that I went there and really left
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:09.120]  the scene which I would again I even where I was there were pockets of people who were unruly
[3:21:09.120 --> 3:21:15.040]  and anybody who committed violence should be treated as such if you trespass you should be
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:22.160]  charged with that but you do not take somebody's due process and constitutional rights away especially
[3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:29.920]  when you can see behind me that the vast majority of these people are completely and totally peaceful
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:38.480]  let me repeat that completely and totally peaceful I have been doing this now for close to 20 years
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:46.240]  I have been in a multitude of situations amongst thousands tens of thousands and even
[3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:53.680]  hundreds of thousands of people for instance I turned 20 years old at Woodstock 99 an event now
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:22:02.880]  that the mainstream media and HBO is calling toxically masculine and really white supremacy
[3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:08.560]  you think I'm joking go watch that documentary on it okay and I got to tell you right now that
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:15.120]  when I was in that situation amongst those people my my my senses were much more heightened just in
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:21.600]  that scenario or when I covered the g8 when I look at these people the vast majority of these
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:27.840]  people are not only nonviolent but non-threatening and as you see in the upper echelons this is
[3:22:27.840 --> 3:22:34.080]  people are starting to gather more and more they still have not even been on the sides I want to
[3:22:34.080 --> 3:22:38.960]  get to the the next video here let's see if it's going to let me do that I hope that it does of
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:45.680]  course it will right here where you can really see this is outside the capital man that they're
[3:22:45.680 --> 3:22:52.080]  really dangerous some dangerous insurrectionism going and this again is from the second level
[3:22:52.080 --> 3:22:57.920]  now now you can see the concentration if you will in that one area where the police are and people
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:03.280]  are trying to ram through and then on the left hand side and anybody again the committed violence
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:10.480]  against police should absolutely be held accountable but another thing about this footage is you'll
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:15.920]  see it swing up you'll see a multitude of police officers also on the third level just standing
[3:23:15.920 --> 3:23:23.120]  around doing absolutely nothing again next to totally and completely nonviolent persons here
[3:23:23.120 --> 3:23:27.840]  we go you'll see that right here look at all the police wow they they seem really threatened
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:35.360]  everybody's really scared oh wait they're not oh wait they're not but this is the big event
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:43.920]  this is the big talking point to take away your freedoms to put you away in a hole take a really
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:50.880]  really good look and then I want to show you this where did the sledgehammer come from now I'm sitting
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:55.760]  here you see the left to me mainstream reporters right by that window another mainstream reporter
[3:23:55.760 --> 3:24:00.720]  they're wearing their masks like good little slaves and when I see that sledgehammer being
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:08.080]  pushed up towards the police I'm very worried obviously who who did that and I believe it's
[3:24:08.080 --> 3:24:11.840]  actually been on Tucker Carlson that a man with a painted face was handing those things up you
[3:24:11.840 --> 3:24:16.880]  could see black balls but when you get to the individuals that are right there what do they do
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:23.360]  they hand it over they don't violently assault anybody with that weapon take a good look the one
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:30.000]  guy tries to take it and then it is given to the police officers this is the type of footage they
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:36.800]  don't want you to see okay but again if you committed violence you should be treated as such
[3:24:36.800 --> 3:24:45.600]  am I shaking there am I worried do I have PTSD from that day the answer is absolutely not and
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:50.800]  again to show you what a farce all of this is what I want you to do is look at just a stack
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:58.560]  of about a hundred backpacks now this is at the ellipse this is before all of those events
[3:24:59.120 --> 3:25:04.400]  and if you don't think that's a hundred backpacks let's just zoom in on it yeah that's about a hundred
[3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:09.200]  you count about maybe ten on the outskirts it might even be a little bit more that's nothing
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:13.840]  they were all over that area and then as you see people walking in the middle they're strewn out
[3:25:14.640 --> 3:25:22.320]  I want to remind everybody that's January 6th and on January 5th you had an anonymous person
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:31.760]  planting pipe bombs all along the Capitol who has never been caught does anybody else remember
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:39.440]  if you see something say something unattended bags and backpacks could be used as terrorist
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:47.440]  bombs right oh no nobody was concerned why not why haven't they found that person
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:56.080]  why are they demonizing us well let me tell you why because that person more than likely is some
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:04.240]  type of an agent provocateur or he would have been caught because we have a mass surveillance state
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:12.160]  especially in DC and they know every single one of his movements and when I talk about signature
[3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:18.560]  reduction and the secret undercover military right now being used against the American people
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:28.000]  60,000 strong we've already gone past posicomitatis they did it through their patriot act and us
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:35.360]  enabling that to grow into homeland or Deutschland security and then the privatized security state
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:43.040]  that was built around that of these assessment centers we had the myac report let me just read
[3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:49.280]  it again in these last couple of minutes again I encourage people to really dig down deep
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:56.720]  see the false identities see the technologies see the DARPA made gloves that look like a hand
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:03.120]  that have anybody's biometric information you want printed upon them and omits human oil
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:10.560]  these are their tools okay this is the military already being used against the American people
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:17.840]  and it turns my stomach by the way Laura Ingram when I tune into your program and I see Mike Pompeo
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:25.440]  talking about press freedoms in China when he and others like Bill Barr couldn't wait to dig
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:31.840]  their teeth into Julian Assange they can speak nothing about press freedoms okay in fact I have
[3:27:31.840 --> 3:27:36.800]  a clip from the South China Morning Post that if we were hooked up right I would play here where you
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:43.440]  had a journalist for three and a half minutes breaking down that situation from a main line
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:49.200]  source again I'm not worshiping China here but I'm not seeing anybody do that here in the United
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:54.640]  States while the largest force the world has ever known is one created by the Pentagon over the past
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:28:03.200]  decade no oversight some 60,000 people now belong to this secret army it is a secret army many working
[3:28:03.200 --> 3:28:08.480]  under mass identity identities an in low profile all part of the broad program called signature
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:13.280]  reduction no documents on it it's an art form the force more than ten times the size of the
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:20.640]  clandestine elements of the CIA carries out domestic and foreign assignments domestic
[3:28:20.640 --> 3:28:27.040]  assignments against you both in military uniforms and under civilian cover in real life and online
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:33.920]  sometimes hiding in private businesses and consultancies some of them probably many of them

[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:33.040]  what they've already instituted and now what they're trying to institute and the next level
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:39.040]  of who the terrorists will be because if you're anti lockdown if you're anti mask and torturing
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:45.840]  children and your anti shielding measure when they come for the quarantines well you'll be a
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:52.240]  domestic terrorist too and there's some scary legislation out there right now on the fifth
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:58.400]  new york actually voted on the quote unquote shielding legislation where they can take a
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:05.280]  healthy person who has tested positive for nothing and poses no threat whatsoever to a
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:11.520]  detention facility indefinitely and they are not the only people putting this on the books
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:17.600]  all right let's take a look at this at a washington state allowing local health officers to use law
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:25.440]  enforcement lovely to force an emergency order of involuntarily detaining a person or group of
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:32.880]  persons right families oh they specifically say families lovely to be isolated in a quarantine
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:40.080]  facility following the refusal of what voluntary compliance voluntary compliance with a request
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:46.480]  for medical examinations testing treatment counseling or even vaccination sounds fair
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:59.120]  no it's total techno fascist tyranny okay and here's the deal they want you on the ubi the
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:06.320]  social credit score they want you in fear and that's why they're planning on rolling out everything
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:11.440]  they possibly can including semantically changing the language we always told you wouldn't be
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:18.160]  fully vaccinated even after three shots after four after five and now it's not fully vaccinated
[3:35:18.160 --> 3:35:25.760]  it's are you up to date is your status up to date we'll just change the terminology meanwhile
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:30.720]  the justice department isn't going to go after real criminals anymore especially in new york
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:37.600]  they're announcing it you've got to be hardcore theft come on simple assaults not really don't
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:43.520]  worry they got to be the most hardcore crimes except when they're financial crimes right and
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:48.960]  you're cheating the state out of money that's why all the sudden venmo paypal and cash app will now
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:55.280]  be reporting again just like all the banks they're forcing to any transactions totaling more than
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:36:04.000]  six hundred dollars to the irs okay they're coming after us on every single level and at the same
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:11.280]  time they're selling us on a future where these people will be the heroes well now i want to
[3:36:11.280 --> 3:36:17.040]  talk about hollywood a bit okay and i want to talk about a show called westworld now westworld
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:27.600]  is really a show about transhumanism in the most simplest of senses it is robots that eventually
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:32.880]  become more and more human like all right at first they have the metal innards and then
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:38.880]  their start they start to be made synthetically and are almost indistinguishable and eventually
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:47.520]  they go beyond their quote-unquote loops or programming and dissentience but that show
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:54.800]  is one of the shows out there that is telling you what they want to happen not even in the first
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:02.880]  two seasons which occasionally take you out of the park via two different timelines really the
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:10.000]  park is the focus and what's going on there and who are the robots and who are not well what i want
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:14.800]  to point out is as soon as they get out of the park in the show this is season three and you
[3:37:14.800 --> 3:37:22.960]  can see the city and dust you can see the robot you can see the imagery as soon as they get out
[3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:30.880]  it's apps okay it's social credit score apps now in this reality you can sometimes get away from
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:36.080]  those apps there's illegal apps on top of the apps that jam the system whether that will be there it's
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:42.080]  all about social credit score it's all about medicating you and take a look at this this aired
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:49.760]  on march 15th 2020 just when the lockdowns were coming so in other words it was filmed many many
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:57.440]  months beforehand and edited in and what you're looking at is the main character of this season
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:02.400]  is called Caleb he's from Breaking Bad that's where he's most popular anyway and you'll notice
[3:38:02.400 --> 3:38:08.800]  the person in the background right here and i believe this is at a job interview is wearing a mask
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:16.240]  now the other thing that's really interesting about this is as the story progresses he's
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:22.080]  talking to his friend somebody who's portrayed as best friend his best friends continually trying
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:31.440]  to push him in a direction of behavior and conformance and getting that social credit score up well
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:39.760]  spoiler alerts we're going to spoil it all for you right here okay what's really going on is that
[3:38:39.760 --> 3:38:47.520]  he has a brain implant okay and his mind has already been altered because of many of his
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:54.960]  ptsd experiences as a mercenary and he actually killed his best friend who was hired via the app
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:39:03.920]  to kill him see that's why it's so great that they want to put brain ships in us for ptsd in real
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:09.760]  time right because this woman again she's overweight she's unhappy she's out there gardening she's
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:15.600]  doing a lot better with a mask on her face and a brain chip and this is just the commercialized
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:25.040]  reality of DARPA and the defense department having this technology for decades let me repeat that
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:31.200]  for decades and when they get outside of the park of course Caleb has the day job and he's working
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:39.760]  with the robots everything is run by ai in this society they're using uh using rockets for small
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:46.960]  time transport much of the vehicles that are being used um look drone like in nature that they're
[3:39:46.960 --> 3:39:55.440]  going around they're all of course self-driving everything is automated okay this is the future
[3:39:56.240 --> 3:40:00.720]  that they're presenting to you and boy they they got that mask thing spot on it's almost
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:12.240]  like when we went over here earth 2100 that was pushed by avc right anthony fouch he's in it
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:20.080]  eric schmitt is in it john padesta really great people james woolsey of the cia van jones the
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:28.560]  10 million dollar bezos man right they're all in it predicting that there's going to be outbreaks
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:35.360]  of viruses predicting that there were going to be wearing masks predicting that there's
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:43.200]  going to be overrun migrant facilities in which of course the military forces end up firing on the
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:50.400]  people and all of its due to climate change right and i can't tell you how many of the posts
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:40:56.960]  that i've seen from friends and family members about this don't look up johnny nonsense i've
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:04.880]  avoided watching and i try not to get absorbed as much as possible in this type of cultural
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:10.800]  phenomena right i catch certain things we'll talk about the matrix in the coming segment
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:16.960]  and how that relates to transhumanism i caught spider-man recently and it was very very obvious
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:23.680]  they took the j jona james and character who's been in the spider-verse forever right and in
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:30.880]  this latest film although he was only in it sparsely right was an absolute parody of alex
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:36.880]  jones and info wars dot com even had the vitamins you know i was uh with a friend of mine and she
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:42.240]  actually without me saying anything kind of nudged me and goes is it just me or does this look like
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:47.760]  info wars now it shows i'm like no it does absolutely and i'll just say this about that
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:56.320]  you know j jona jameson at least in that is not an evil character right he in the spider
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:00.720]  verse he's not evil he's a journalist but he hates spider-man he's constantly getting the
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:05.680]  story wrong right well i promise you folks although alex jones and info wars aren't perfect
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:11.760]  they're not constantly getting the story wrong they're not completely naive to what's going on
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:18.480]  because let me tell you what's going on this is going on the normalization of automation
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:28.640]  all right the fibrillation of humanity the demasculation of men so they won't fight back
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:35.280]  and then the demonization of the women that go out there and stand up for their children it brings
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:40.000]  us all the way back to the justice department brings us all the way back to homeland security
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.960]  and what they're the domestic terrorist so we're going to go over the matrix on the flip side go
[3:42:44.960 --> 3:42:50.720]  to save info wars dot com right now make that donation and keep info wars going
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:42:59.440]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:05.680]  for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive this is their takeover
[3:43:05.680 --> 3:43:09.760]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves
[3:43:09.760 --> 3:43:14.720]  now their world government their permanent martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:19.920]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate power and trillions

[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:18.800]  hey everybody jason bermus here for the fourth and final segment of that fourth hour of the alex
[3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:24.560]  joneshow i want to remind people to support the broadcast go get great tools like covet land and
[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:31.840]  covet land to the mask show people this information and before we shift gears over to the matrix
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:38.960]  and the transhumanist symbiosis message of that film i do want to give a shout out to mom and pop
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:44.720]  media that is not not gaslighting the public rc reader is out here in the quad cities they've
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:55.280]  done some great work on pushing back against this national lie of an insurrection and that we are
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:48:02.960]  indeed domestic terrorists and i think that that is a huge issue as you look around and it is hard
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:08.880]  to imagine that the media and the government man i wish this was playing right of course it isn't
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:17.440]  have gotten away with calling this some kind of danger to our democracy when they are the danger
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:23.200]  when they don't want accountability when they don't want an audit of the vote when instead
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:32.080]  they want corrupt systems such as dye bold that was put in place literally over a decade ago into
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:39.920]  the dominion of today and fractional reserve voting and you're not getting one person one vote
[3:48:40.560 --> 3:48:47.760]  and audit the simplest thing fourth grade math we can't do it in this country we can't do it anymore
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:53.600]  and they want to take it all away they want to take it all away because of what you're looking
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:48:58.480]  at behind me and this is some of the worst violence that actually occurred you're looking at it pretty
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:05.920]  gritty stuff huh not so much i also want to give a shout out to getter as i continue to be censored
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:12.560]  on other platforms i am now on getter alex jones obviously also on getter great info wars accounts
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:17.920]  hey getter why don't you give me a custom rtmp and let me stream live like those big ins over at
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:23.680]  newsmax i promise you i'll have better content almost every day of the week hell every day of
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:29.120]  the week let's be honest and that's not to denigrate newsmax or any of these outlets that are even
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:34.800]  putting out a hint of truth okay but the bottom line is are they stepping up to the plate and
[3:49:34.800 --> 3:49:43.680]  telling you what this is really about this is about the acceptance of biological nanotechnology
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:52.720]  being injected into you on a regular basis without your permission without any efficacy of it being
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:50:00.800]  positive for you by an authoritarian government beholden to a predator class and that predator
[3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:07.040]  and that predator class is pushing transhumanism especially in this new matrix movie now i'm
[3:50:07.040 --> 3:50:12.720]  going to go over what i liked about it really quickly first i thought that the opening of the
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:19.360]  film not the segment with the action and the morpheus and the program and the symbiosis again
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:27.360]  of ai resurrection we'll get there but the introspection of what the matrix series was about
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:32.880]  was probably the strongest point that and uh neil patrick harris essentially acting as
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:41.360]  the human form of the matrix now from the get go they let you know there's going to be a symbiosis
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:47.760]  between the neo character which is the human character and what agent smith the program
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:52.800]  right the big enemy they can't survive without each other and he takes a new incarnation
[3:50:52.800 --> 3:51:02.640]  as neo's boss in this new version of the matrix okay but then later on becomes the hero and fights
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:12.640]  with neo against the matrix that's just one small example again how ai and the transhumanist form
[3:51:12.640 --> 3:51:19.360]  of programs literally literally digital programs is needed by humanity and later on we find out
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:25.280]  that we're not really looking at neil in fact we're not looking at neil or trinity we are looking at
[3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:32.800]  ai replications of them now i want to be very clear about this you know we're not just talking
[3:51:32.800 --> 3:51:41.360]  about clones and this is really glossed over robots created sentient beings with consciousness
[3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:51.840]  that had died in the previous series that's not a real thing okay again that puts the ai above us
[3:51:52.720 --> 3:51:58.640]  i don't believe that we can create sentient consciousness therefore i don't believe that ai
[3:51:58.640 --> 3:52:04.560]  is a tool that could do that for us our sentient consciousness is one of those great mysteries
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:10.560]  of the world that is the best thing about humanity that connects us all okay and again
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:18.560]  they're marginalizing trivializing that later on as neo exit the matrix now in the original
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:23.840]  there are some you know throwbacks to what it looked like with the original right but in this
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:33.120]  one what happens he's cradled like a baby by the good robot that then takes him into zion and in
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:39.360]  zion we learn we can take programs such as the morpheus character in this which is just a program
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:46.720]  and in fact is half smith for some reason again that good evil and it becomes a physical thing
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:55.040]  right and they even make the uh comment in the film that it's not about waking people up anymore
[3:52:55.040 --> 3:53:02.480]  and fighting the robots okay it's about living with the robots and letting ai come in and give
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:13.280]  us strawberries oh we've got strawberries now so really what this was was a push for acceptance
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:19.520]  that we must live together with these type of robots they even get into how the robots fight
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:28.800]  each other over scarcity again trying to humanize them as again as if they have some kind of sentient
[3:53:28.800 --> 3:53:35.840]  thinking they don't they don't that's the big trick and these people at the top want to immerse you
[3:53:36.480 --> 3:53:45.680]  in a false virtual world that you think will be a good thing and any technology can be used to
[3:53:45.680 --> 3:53:55.120]  either empower or enslave but ask yourself over the last 18 months to two years has this isolation
[3:53:55.120 --> 3:54:05.040]  been good for us is tele learning better than in person is a headset and goggles a replacement
[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:12.080]  for hugging your family members no matter how real it feels and as this goes forward what is it about
[3:54:12.720 --> 3:54:19.840]  well they don't want you to believe that you're a man or a woman that's what the non-binary part
[3:54:19.840 --> 3:54:28.080]  of this quote-unquote trans movement is and that you can take any form you want and ai and technology
[3:54:28.080 --> 3:54:35.280]  is going to allow you to do that by taking your consciousness right and then uploading it into
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:45.120]  anything you like and those steps that we're walking towards are much much much closer than the average
[3:54:45.120 --> 3:54:53.360]  person can even imagine we got about three minutes left in this broadcast and i want to
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:55:00.640]  take that time to talk to you guys about info wars dot com and why it continues to be extremely
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:06.960]  important to me i haven't always agreed with some of the positions taken by alex or other hosts or
[3:55:06.960 --> 3:55:12.800]  some of the stories that were covered or not covered but i have always believed in free
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:21.440]  speech on every level and when you look at the track record for the stories that have been broken
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:28.320]  here okay the stories that were little blurbs little newspaper blurs nobody was paying attention
[3:55:28.320 --> 3:55:38.080]  about and amplified by info wars dot com there is no comparison i can tell you right now that
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:48.240]  band dot video and the type of bandwidth that that website alone takes up is financially insurmountable
[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:54.240]  to a guy like myself who's trying to expand in this environment because the more they choke down
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:56:00.240]  on the truth and information the more they push guys like me out at youtube right probably been
[3:56:00.240 --> 3:56:06.400]  almost three years since they got maybe four what was it 2016 or 17 they got rid of jones got to be
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:14.640]  17 maybe four or five at this point the more they do that the more people that are real and genuine
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:18.960]  and trying to change the world well doesn't matter they're going to be successful anyway
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:23.040]  they're going to get that information out there and in fact if you want to see all my stuff
[3:56:23.040 --> 3:56:30.560]  it's over at rockfin dot com slash jason bermus we're 45 000 strong on an alternative platform
[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:36.640]  and all my stuff over there of any significance is of course free of charge just like alex i want
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:40.960]  you to make copies i want you to get covet land hell if you don't want to make a straight donation
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:46.960]  go get 50 copies of covet land and wish people a happy new year you give it to them in that nice
[3:56:46.960 --> 3:56:55.680]  box with the dvd they're going to take a look the bottom line is that the cnn's the msnbc's of the
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:57:02.480]  world the fox news is they're not your friend they're not your friend they don't care about you
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:09.120]  they're reading off a prompter this is prompter free journalism this is journalism that's not
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:17.040]  about left or right it's always about right and wrong all right and we will continue to put
[3:57:17.040 --> 3:57:24.560]  light on the darkness that surround us all the time in this covet 1984 nightmare so go to save
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:31.280]  info wars dot com make that donation info wars store dot com to get all the great supplements
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:38.320]  and especially the dvds and movie products and i want to wish you guys a great 2022 let's continue
[3:57:38.320 --> 3:57:51.040]  to fight with free speech i am recording this announcement on the afternoon of january 6 2022
[3:57:51.040 --> 3:57:56.320]  and that means there are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling product

[3:58:27.920 --> 3:58:32.960]  would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position right now that it's in
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:38.160]  thanks to you supporting info wars we have now become the number one beacon of truth exposing
[3:58:38.160 --> 3:58:42.960]  the great reset and the new world war so support your immune system and support free speech in
[3:58:42.960 --> 3:58:48.240]  the fight for liberty at the same time at m4store.com we've all heard about the pastor and his famous
[3:58:48.240 --> 3:58:53.920]  statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group he
[3:58:53.920 --> 3:58:57.840]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't
[3:58:57.840 --> 3:59:02.880]  part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody
[3:59:02.880 --> 3:59:07.040]  else to stand up well the global social credit score that china is putting in it's banning people
[3:59:07.040 --> 3:59:11.200]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:16.000]  sell again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid
[3:59:16.720 --> 3:59:21.360]  vaccine passports they even admit it now thursday has going to be a carbon tax attached to it
[3:59:21.360 --> 3:59:25.680]  they're going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do
[3:59:25.680 --> 3:59:31.280]  that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left
[3:59:31.280 --> 3:59:35.040]  is having fun right now with all the censorship of tyranny pretending like they're part of the
[3:59:35.040 --> 3:59:39.040]  power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get
[3:59:39.040 --> 3:59:43.200]  back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible
[3:59:43.200 --> 4:00:02.080]  technocracy run by the globalist if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
