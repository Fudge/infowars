[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.800 --> 00:21.280]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21.280 --> 00:24.680]  As you can see, not all BMWs are created equal.
[00:24.680 --> 00:33.760]  We just looked this one up, $42,000 for a glorified go car.
[00:33.760 --> 00:38.960]  That's what SmartGros all about, 250 square foot apartment, charged the same as a 2,000
[00:38.960 --> 00:45.320]  square foot apartment, have built-in regulations and sunnings that you have to pay, so more
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.560]  can be paid taxes and more to the rent controllers.
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.400]  Same thing with Smart Cars, Smart Meters, Control your thermostat, rip you off, scam you.
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.200]  This is what it's all about, getting you to trade out luxury quality for this in austerity
[00:58.200 --> 01:02.120]  with your carbon indulgences to feel good about yourself.
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.720]  This is how the global staff rate, this is what they're doing.
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.360]  We have the Sparts with the video here.
[01:07.360 --> 01:09.440]  Alex Jones here with you.
[01:09.440 --> 01:13.200]  My buddy Pat Riley is driving me in to an important meeting today.
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.800]  We're in an electric car, by the way.
[01:14.800 --> 01:16.360]  We are in an electric car.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.080]  David Knight is going to be hosting.
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.120]  I have conjunctivitis, I think I only have this one more time of my life, I'm not sure
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.120]  I'm going to the doctor.
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.880]  My eye hole this morning is completely swollen, shut up, I open it, excruciating pain.
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.440]  So I need to put some oil silver in it, but I think that was so painful this morning,
[01:34.440 --> 01:36.200]  I didn't even think to do that.
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.200]  But David Knight's hosting the broadcast, there's so much I wanted to cover today, but
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.840]  I'm going to try to come in during lunch or something and break down some of the stuff
[01:44.840 --> 01:45.840]  that's happening.
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.840]  All I know is there's a lot of key information at InfoWars.com.
[01:51.840 --> 02:05.080]  Oh no, oh no, look ladies and gentlemen, a $42,000 starting German go-kart that barely
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.080]  suits anybody, but it's for the earth, so it's okay now.
[02:11.080 --> 02:18.640]  Alex Jeff signing off for InfoWars.com, because remember, Agenda 21 and anything called SMART
[02:18.640 --> 02:25.040]  is a global scam to rip you off and make you pay more by tracking and surveilling you.
[02:25.040 --> 02:29.720]  To learn more, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.000]  Okay and Alex is reporting from the road and he's behind that small car, they're laughing
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.800]  about it, but at least you can drive it.
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.160]  Okay, if they get their way, you're not going to have the ability to have any control over
[02:42.160 --> 02:43.160]  your transportation.
[02:43.160 --> 02:47.640]  That's one of the key things that is concerning and we'll talk briefly today about what's
[02:47.640 --> 02:50.040]  going on here in Austin with Uber now.
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.720]  Alex was having somebody drive him to the doctors there because, you know, and Austin,
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.240]  they've just had Uber shut down operations and Lyft on Monday because they didn't get
[03:00.240 --> 03:01.960]  their way with the Austin City Council.
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.760]  Now, Austin City Council here, just in case you don't know, is really the People's Republic
[03:06.760 --> 03:07.760]  of Austin.
[03:07.760 --> 03:10.320]  These people are unbelievable control freaks.
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.400]  Straight out of California style government, they want to dictate everything down to the
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.040]  bags that we use at the grocery store in Austin, so I don't live there.
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.120]  Nevertheless, when you look at the back and forth between Uber and Lyft, I'm not sure
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.360]  which side would choose there because, frankly, what is happening with Uber, with Lyft, with
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.320]  IBM, with Ford, with Volvo, all of these companies are getting together, they're going to government
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.320]  at the highest level.
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.400]  They're going to try to override these regulations by going up the chain of command as we've
[03:41.400 --> 03:42.400]  now established it.
[03:42.400 --> 03:45.600]  It's not a constitutional chain of command because we do still have the 9th and 10th
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.480]  Amendment, but they are, of course, dead letters to the people in Washington, D.C.
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.440]  And so what they're trying to do is to shut down regulation of them and they want different
[03:56.440 --> 03:58.880]  regulations than we have for taxi drivers.
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.400]  And I'm going to play a little bit of a report that I had back in Washington, D.C. when we're
[04:03.400 --> 04:06.120]  covering the Pope, I talked to a taxi driver there.
[04:06.120 --> 04:11.960]  You won't believe the difference between regulations that the taxi drivers have and the stuff that
[04:11.960 --> 04:16.520]  Uber and Lyft are so upset about that they completely suspended operations.
[04:16.520 --> 04:18.880]  Look, I'm not a regulation guy, okay?
[04:18.880 --> 04:22.920]  I don't like a government like the city of Austin that wants to regulate everything
[04:22.920 --> 04:28.840]  in our lives, but even worse than the regulations is the fact that you've got two tiers of
[04:28.840 --> 04:29.840]  regulations.
[04:29.840 --> 04:33.880]  One for the big guys at the top, another one for everybody else.
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.000]  We're also going to be talking today to Michael Schneider, frequent contributor to infowars.com
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.240]  as well as an HSB whistleblower, John Cruz.
[04:43.240 --> 04:44.240]  So stick with us.
[04:44.240 --> 05:00.640]  We've got a lot of news and some very important interviews.
[05:00.640 --> 05:06.680]  A convicted robber who broke out of prison 48 years ago has finally been caught, reports
[05:06.680 --> 05:08.120]  Fox News.
[05:08.120 --> 05:14.160]  Federal officials caught up with Robert Stackowitz, now 71 years old on Monday in Sherman, Connecticut.
[05:14.160 --> 05:19.280]  Stackowitz is being held in a Connecticut jail and is waiting to be transported to Georgia.
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.960]  He had served two years of a 17-year sentence for robbery at Carroll County Prison Work
[05:24.960 --> 05:28.400]  Camp when he busted out back in 1968.
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.120]  Stackowitz, who escaped from the prison's infirmary, had been living in Sherman since
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.040]  at least July 1990, according to records viewed by the news Times.
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.360]  Sherman is a sparsely populated town and has one independent grocery store and a daycare
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.360]  center.
[05:44.360 --> 05:49.800]  A U.S. Marshals Task Force recently uncovered a possible alias identity for Stackowitz, leading
[05:49.800 --> 05:51.760]  investigators to Sherman.
[05:51.760 --> 06:00.400]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.680]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[06:04.680 --> 06:10.040]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[06:10.040 --> 06:15.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[06:15.000 --> 06:16.600]  at infowarsstore.com.

[06:20.440 --> 06:24.560]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[06:24.560 --> 06:29.800]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.840]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[06:33.840 --> 06:35.640]  the products that you need each month.
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.280]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[06:39.280 --> 06:43.360]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[06:43.360 --> 06:48.660]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.160]  this is a sure win.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.640]  10% off on auto ship.
[06:51.640 --> 06:56.040]  Win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[06:56.040 --> 07:02.080]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.400]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.360]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war.
[07:08.360 --> 07:13.080]  Bring the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[07:13.080 --> 07:19.320]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[07:19.320 --> 07:21.840]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[07:21.840 --> 07:26.240]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.920]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.840]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[07:35.840 --> 07:39.280]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[07:39.280 --> 07:47.280]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[07:47.280 --> 07:50.560]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[07:50.560 --> 07:53.480]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[07:53.480 --> 07:58.360]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com
[07:58.360 --> 07:59.360]  with Anthroplex.
[07:59.360 --> 08:16.960]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[08:16.960 --> 08:24.600]  the Info War.
[08:24.600 --> 08:28.440]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, May 10, 2016.
[08:28.440 --> 08:30.700]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[08:30.700 --> 08:35.640]  We have an interesting article from Breitbart about what happened on Mother's Day weekend
[08:35.640 --> 08:39.080]  in Chicago, that city of love.
[08:39.080 --> 08:44.200]  We had 43 people wounded, nine killed in Chicago gang violence.
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.480]  Now I'm still waiting to see if they're gonna blame this on Donald Trump or maybe his supporters.
[08:50.480 --> 08:54.120]  Or I'm sure it's firearms in the Second Amendment.
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.760]  But never, never will it be blamed on the gangsters themselves, on the thugs who are
[08:58.760 --> 09:01.960]  actually doing this because that's the way this all plays out.
[09:01.960 --> 09:07.080]  You know when we had these Trump rallies and we had the mainstream media and Ted Cruz blaming
[09:07.080 --> 09:12.840]  Donald Trump for the violence at his rallies, we were told and I've heard people on mainstream
[09:12.840 --> 09:18.240]  media who are defending this narrative that these guys were to blame, say, well, you know,
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.640]  he deliberately provoked that by going to Chicago of all places.
[09:22.640 --> 09:28.440]  And even going to the university where Bill Ayers teaches, because you can't have free
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.440]  speech there.
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.160]  And you should expect that if you show up to talk about something that Bill Ayers and
[09:33.160 --> 09:36.720]  his thugs don't agree with, that they're gonna get violent with you, okay?
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.960]  They're gonna block ambulances, they're going to attack people's cars.
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.440]  Because that's just to be expected, just like the lady shouldn't jog through Central Park
[09:45.440 --> 09:49.520]  because she should know that that belongs to the rapists, okay?
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.520]  Here's the deal, okay?
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.000]  We're gonna get in people's faces and we're going to take back our country and we're not
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.200]  going to be intimidated by political correctness.
[09:56.200 --> 09:58.720]  We're not gonna be intimidated by violence.
[09:58.720 --> 10:01.000]  And the people know better than this.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.880]  We've had the former governor of Pennsylvania who's gonna be chairing the Democrat National
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.120]  Committee meeting where they choose the nominee because it's gonna be in Philadelphia, I guess
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.760]  they chose him for that.
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.920]  And he said, we're gonna have a vote and we're going to, we're gonna offer up Bernie Sanders
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.240]  and put his name and nomination, we're gonna have a vote.
[10:22.240 --> 10:27.720]  He's going to lose that vote and then his supporters better behave themselves.
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.040]  Why would he say that?
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.480]  Why would he say that Bernie Sanders supporters need to behave themselves?
[10:33.480 --> 10:38.480]  Because the left themselves really know who is responsible for this.
[10:38.480 --> 10:41.960]  Donald Trump isn't gonna be there, but they know because they're already doing it, Hillary
[10:41.960 --> 10:48.120]  Clinton in some places, they know that these people are acting like thugs.
[10:48.120 --> 10:49.800]  Like radical revolutionaries.
[10:49.800 --> 10:55.400]  They believe that there is, or should be, no restriction on their actions.
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.040]  That's what is behind all of this.
[10:58.040 --> 11:01.840]  Now there's interesting articles up on the dredge report from The Guardian, a couple
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.200]  of links there, the rise of the militias.
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.720]  And I wanted to cover this because of course we've been out to Oregon multiple times and
[11:08.720 --> 11:13.000]  we've talked about the land use issues that are there because it's not only what happened
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.800]  at the Malheur incident, but it was what happened before that.
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.320]  The heavy handed injustice of the federal government coming after that family for arson
[11:22.320 --> 11:24.560]  and it clearly was not arson.
[11:24.560 --> 11:26.480]  And the fact that everybody stood down out there.
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.960]  But there's also been issues on the other side of Oregon with minors, with loggers also.
[11:31.960 --> 11:33.800]  We've seen this all across the area.
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.600]  What's happening now, and The Guardian reports on it, is we now have a political movement
[11:38.600 --> 11:39.840]  that is rising out of this.
[11:39.840 --> 11:43.760]  Because you know what, these people are trying to do this the right way.
[11:43.760 --> 11:50.320]  They stood up to the thugs who were abusing their neighbors in Nevada.
[11:50.320 --> 11:52.200]  People came together and said, you're not going to do that here.
[11:52.200 --> 11:53.960]  You're not going to take the land from us.
[11:53.960 --> 11:56.440]  You're not going to run the last rancher out of here.
[11:56.440 --> 11:57.840]  Who has land rights?
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  And this is what's important.
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.200]  We mentioned this over and over again.
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.760]  People in the cities, people in the suburbs need to understand that they have property
[12:04.760 --> 12:09.340]  rights that are essentially the same as the property rights you have on your home.
[12:09.340 --> 12:13.520]  They have surface rights, they have mineral rights, they have water rights.
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.680]  All these rights can exist on the same piece of land.
[12:17.680 --> 12:22.600]  And the people who are reporting this are deliberately spending this in the urban media,
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.720]  trying to tell people who don't understand what these rights are that have belonged in
[12:25.720 --> 12:32.000]  many cases to these families for 100, 150, 170 years, some of these mining rights.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.440]  You can have all of these rights coexisting on the same piece of land.
[12:36.440 --> 12:39.240]  So these people are not saying, I own this government land.
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.280]  No, they're saying I have land rights here that I've had for a very long time, whether
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.080]  it's grazing or water or mineral or logging rights.
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.120]  These are rights and these are property rights.
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.120]  And we as a people need to stop letting the government run roughshod over our property
[12:58.120 --> 12:59.120]  rights.
[12:59.120 --> 13:00.480]  We need to stand up when they do it to the farmer.
[13:00.480 --> 13:06.620]  We need to stand up when they do it to the inner city person who is a minority and they
[13:06.620 --> 13:10.800]  just seize their car, seize their cash under civil asset forfeiture.
[13:10.800 --> 13:16.360]  Or when they do it to a group of traveling musicians who've just finished raising as
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.000]  a Christian ban, finished raising over $50,000 for orphanages, they pull them over, they
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.680]  find the cash and say, oh, that's got to be drug money.
[13:24.680 --> 13:25.920]  We're going to take that.
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.000]  And we're not going to charge you with anything and you're going to have to sue us in civil
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.240]  court if you've got the money to try to get your money back.
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.760]  That's the way they operate.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.600]  This is put in, by the way, by the Reagan administration.
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.880]  So when we talk about conservative values, I hope those conservative values will, in
[13:44.880 --> 13:51.560]  some day, will include valuing private property, valuing the Bill of Rights.
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.000]  Why don't we include those in conservative values someday, okay?
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.360]  Every time I hear the Republican Party go off on this Reagan worship, it's like, oh,
[14:00.360 --> 14:01.360]  really?
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.360]  Really, you want to talk about private property rights?
[14:02.360 --> 14:03.840]  You want to talk about the Brady Bill?
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.960]  You want to talk about a whole bunch of other things, mandatory minimums, where you have
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.760]  shut down sections, entire sections of the Bill of Rights under Ronald Reagan?
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.200]  Okay, let's talk about maybe not conservatism, let's just talk about liberty, okay?
[14:17.200 --> 14:20.680]  I don't really care about keeping the status quo, but let's talk about what's going on
[14:20.680 --> 14:22.280]  in Oregon, according to The Guardian.
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.680]  It's an interesting story because it's also interesting to look at their perspective.
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.800]  And when I saw this article, one of the people who was reporting on what happened in Idaho
[14:32.800 --> 14:38.800]  at the Malheur occupation, there's a guy named Michael Emery, and he was with the voice
[14:38.800 --> 14:39.800]  of Idaho.
[14:39.800 --> 14:40.800]  We've interviewed him multiple times.
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.480]  He stayed there for a very long time.
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.320]  He was arrested this weekend by the FBI.
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.720]  They say there's a weapons charge.
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.360]  I haven't been able to vet that yet to see if that's a real deal or not.
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.360]  So anybody has any information on that, send that to me at davidkayatinfowars.com because
[14:56.360 --> 14:57.680]  I really want to find out what's going on.
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.160]  Michael Emery, when I talked to him, seemed like a level-headed guy.
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.960]  He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would steal a 50-caliber machine gun from his former
[15:05.960 --> 15:06.960]  employer.
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.280]  That really didn't seem to jive with the person that I talked to.
[15:10.280 --> 15:11.640]  So I would like to know more about that.
[15:11.640 --> 15:13.040]  But let's talk about what's going on here.
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.040]  They say the Patriot movement's surge is due partly to fear and a perceived indifference
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.560]  of political leaders to places that didn't recover from the 2008 crash.
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.560]  So, see, this is the fear of these rednecks that is causing this to rise.
[15:26.560 --> 15:27.560]  No, it's not.
[15:27.560 --> 15:28.760]  No, it's not, Garnian.
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.160]  They have absolutely no understanding of the issues that are involved here.
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.080]  This is a deliberate effort to shut down these economies, to drive people out of these rural
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.800]  areas so they can force everybody into the city, so they can control our movement with
[15:42.800 --> 15:44.880]  these self-driving cars.
[15:44.880 --> 15:46.160]  Okay?
[15:46.160 --> 15:51.000]  This is all about controlling and constricting your movement, confining you into cities,
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.880]  putting people essentially on reservations, shutting down their ability to create goods
[15:55.880 --> 15:59.360]  and services that we need in those areas.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.720]  It is a much bigger issue than that.
[16:00.720 --> 16:03.200]  It is about, fundamentally, about our freedom.
[16:03.200 --> 16:04.280]  It is about the Constitution.
[16:04.280 --> 16:06.880]  But let's look at what they have to say here.
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.760]  They focus on a guy named Joseph Rice who is running in Josephine County for the office
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.440]  of County Commissioner.
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.860]  Since Southwest Oregon, I believe Josephine County is where that mine was, the sugarpine
[16:19.860 --> 16:23.360]  mine that happened before the Malheur standoff.
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.360]  So they say the Patriot leader doesn't present himself as a gun crazed as a crazed gun nut,
[16:29.360 --> 16:31.360]  nor as a blowhard white supremacist.
[16:31.360 --> 16:37.680]  No, of course he doesn't, because that's your stereotypes at the Guardian, at the Southern
[16:37.680 --> 16:40.880]  Poverty Law Center that creates these stereotypes.
[16:40.880 --> 16:43.400]  These are the ridiculous stereotypes that you have created.
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.920]  I've talked to these people over and over again in these areas.
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.760]  They are not crazed gun nuts or white supremacists.
[16:50.760 --> 16:54.880]  That's the label you constantly attach to them, and it is a complete line.
[16:54.880 --> 16:59.080]  Of course, they have to say that because they're talking about an individual.
[16:59.080 --> 17:02.720]  So they can't just broadly tar all these people with that issue.
[17:02.720 --> 17:06.800]  They say, but talk to them long enough, and the Patriot leader returns to what really
[17:06.800 --> 17:09.500]  drives him, land, okay?
[17:09.500 --> 17:13.960]  And that's really property rights, and our respect, and our guarantee of those property
[17:13.960 --> 17:15.320]  rights under the Constitution.
[17:15.320 --> 17:16.320]  You know what?
[17:16.320 --> 17:18.400]  If you don't own property, what are you?
[17:18.400 --> 17:21.920]  You're a slave, you're a serf.
[17:21.920 --> 17:27.920]  Just as Gerald Salinty says, they want everybody to live in this service economy, okay?
[17:27.920 --> 17:30.360]  And what's another name for a service economy?
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.560]  Well, you want to be a servant, you want to be a slave, you want to be a serf.
[17:34.560 --> 17:36.640]  You're not going to make any money doing that, okay?
[17:36.640 --> 17:41.200]  This is hard work that these guys do, and in these areas, these ranchers, miners, loggers,
[17:41.200 --> 17:45.080]  they work really hard, and they deserve every penny they get, and they get paid better than
[17:45.080 --> 17:48.120]  flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, okay?
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.520]  Now, they say that Rice believes the federal government's current role in land management
[17:52.520 --> 17:54.520]  is illegitimate, even tyrannical.
[17:54.520 --> 17:55.520]  No, really?
[17:55.520 --> 17:56.520]  Do you believe that?
[17:56.520 --> 17:59.720]  What have we been reporting on for the last three or four years?
[17:59.720 --> 18:02.720]  Of course, it's illegitimate, and of course, it is tyrannical.
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.320]  We've shown that time, and again, they say it's campaigns well advertised around the
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.680]  country, around the county, and appears well organized as growing experience and organizing
[18:10.680 --> 18:16.280]  Patriot groups and community watch organizations has polished his skills and retail politics.
[18:16.280 --> 18:22.160]  They say people whose ideas about land management broadly aligned with Rice and the now infamous
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.720]  Bundy clan are aiming for elected office in cities, counties, even the state houses.
[18:26.720 --> 18:32.320]  And again, we've said over and over again, we thought that their strategy of taking control
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.520]  of that area there for such a long time saying, we're never going to leave.
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.560]  I mean, they didn't, you know, to do it for so long, we knew it was going to turn out
[18:39.560 --> 18:40.560]  this way.
[18:40.560 --> 18:41.560]  We knew it would spin that way.
[18:41.560 --> 18:45.760]  We thought it was a very bad strategy, but there's nothing that they did that should
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.800]  land any of them in jail.
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.840]  And that especially goes for what happened at the Bundy Ranch.
[18:50.840 --> 18:52.160]  I was there.
[18:52.160 --> 18:53.160]  I know what happened.
[18:53.160 --> 18:54.280]  I know what didn't happen.
[18:54.280 --> 18:58.880]  And I've read the indictment against the Bundy's, and it is a pack of what even indicted a
[18:58.880 --> 19:04.440]  guy from New Hampshire who didn't show up until a couple of days after the fact.
[19:04.440 --> 19:10.240]  And of course, to them, it is a threat to the life of an FBI agent if you have a First
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.740]  Amendment protest accompanied by the legal carrying of firearms under the Second Amendment
[19:15.740 --> 19:17.240]  and under state law.
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.040]  That is considered to be a threat to the life of officers.
[19:21.040 --> 19:22.040]  That's what they're trying to do.
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.800]  They're even saying that Clive and Bundy, if I read the indictment correctly, looks
[19:24.800 --> 19:30.040]  to me like they're saying that he threatened with weapons these officers that were there.
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.840]  And I was there a couple of days before the standoff, a day or so after I never saw him
[19:34.840 --> 19:35.840]  with a weapon.
[19:35.840 --> 19:36.840]  Okay?
[19:36.840 --> 19:39.600]  He was not even at the standoff.
[19:39.600 --> 19:43.880]  And so it is a pack of lie, but they talk about, he probably talks about his connection
[19:43.880 --> 19:49.000]  with oath keepers, a group that asserts that oath taken by soldiers and police is to the
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.680]  Constitution, not the politicians.
[19:50.680 --> 19:52.560]  Of course it is.
[19:52.560 --> 19:54.560]  The oath is to the Constitution.
[19:54.560 --> 19:56.840]  Why would we assert something like that?
[19:56.840 --> 19:57.960]  It's because it's true.
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.640]  We don't have a dictatorship, not yet, but we're getting close.
[20:00.640 --> 20:02.080]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.200]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:06.200 --> 20:10.080]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[20:10.080 --> 20:14.160]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious
[20:14.160 --> 20:15.160]  drought.
[20:15.160 --> 20:18.480]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[20:18.480 --> 20:21.280]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[20:21.280 --> 20:26.800]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[20:26.800 --> 20:28.480]  It's a home freeze dryer.

[20:38.600 --> 20:40.780]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[20:40.780 --> 20:45.600]  You can literally freeze dry anything you eat, even things like ice cream.

[22:04.280 --> 22:09.000]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.480]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:11.480 --> 22:16.160]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[22:16.160 --> 22:23.000]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[23:29.440 --> 23:32.600]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[23:32.600 --> 23:35.800]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[23:35.800 --> 23:38.120]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[23:38.120 --> 23:41.080]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[23:41.080 --> 23:42.080]  His excuse?
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.280]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[23:43.280 --> 23:44.880]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[23:59.120 --> 24:12.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[24:12.480 --> 24:13.480]  I'm David Knight.
[24:13.480 --> 24:19.680]  We're going to be talking later in the show to Michael Snyder, contributor to infowars.com
[24:19.680 --> 24:25.040]  about economic issues, his economic collapse blog, signs of the times, folks.
[24:25.040 --> 24:28.640]  We're also going to be talking in the third hour to John Cruz.
[24:28.640 --> 24:30.960]  Now, he is an HSBC whistleblower.
[24:30.960 --> 24:36.800]  We've talked to other HSBC whistleblowers in the past who talked to Everett Stern.
[24:36.800 --> 24:43.840]  And John Cruz figured prominently in the confirmation hearings of Loretta Lynch.
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.280]  We just saw yesterday had a very emotional press conference to come after the people
[24:49.280 --> 24:53.920]  of North Carolina so that she could manage their bathroom laws, comparing them to Jim
[24:53.920 --> 24:54.920]  Crow laws.
[24:54.920 --> 25:01.440]  But of course, she has absolutely no problem with HSBC and other banks who are laundering
[25:01.440 --> 25:07.280]  billions of dollars who are involved in the forex exchange manipulation, making trillions
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.960]  of dollars a day.
[25:08.960 --> 25:10.720]  And they give them a slap on the wrist.
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.760]  We've been told essentially, as Rolling Stones put it, these guys are too big to jail.
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.160]  That's what the Department of Justice under Eric Holder, and then they doubled down on
[25:20.160 --> 25:21.640]  it under Loretta Lynch.
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.840]  But of course, we cannot allow the people of North Carolina, more importantly, the people
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.360]  whose property it is, the private property owners, the business owners, the churches,
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.520]  we cannot allow them to determine how they're going to do their own bathrooms.
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.440]  No, the federal government has to tell us how to go potty.
[25:38.440 --> 25:43.800]  And if they don't, then they're going to send down the Lynch mob and the gay KKK to
[25:43.800 --> 25:44.800]  take care of it.
[25:44.800 --> 25:49.440]  Now, before I get back to what I was talking about with the Patriot Act and the Patriot
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.120]  Act and the Patriot candidates, these are real patriots, okay?
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.400]  The Patriot Act was just the opposite of patriotism, as we all know.
[25:56.400 --> 26:00.440]  But these are real patriots that are rising up out of the land issues, out of the private
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.680]  property issues, out of the people who do not want to be slaves, who do not want to
[26:05.680 --> 26:12.080]  be driven off their land by the king of Sherwood Forest, also known as the BLM.
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.160]  Before I do, I want to let you know about a new sale that we have.
[26:15.160 --> 26:18.200]  This is on proprio big or king units.
[26:18.200 --> 26:19.200]  These are water filters.
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.160]  And folks, if you're not filtering your water after what you've seen in Flint, Michigan,
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.480]  and right after that, we got a phone call from where we used to live in North Carolina.
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.240]  They still had our phone number on the register there.
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.480]  And they said, if you see some stuff that's real smelly in your water, a lot of color,
[26:36.480 --> 26:37.480]  don't worry about it.
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.480]  It's safe to drink.
[26:40.480 --> 26:41.480]  Maybe it is.
[26:41.480 --> 26:44.600]  But if you really have to worry about maybe is the stuff that you don't see, the stuff
[26:44.600 --> 26:47.400]  you don't smell, like the lead that was in Flint, Michigan.
[26:47.400 --> 26:53.360]  So if you get a proprio big filter or a king unit, these are gravity-fed filters for your
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.320]  family's water, for your protection, for your family's protection, we will give you a choice
[26:57.320 --> 26:58.320]  or a free gift.
[26:58.320 --> 27:01.160]  Now, both of these gifts are about a $70 value.
[27:01.160 --> 27:04.720]  And you can choose from either a proprio fruit-infused water pitcher.
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.160]  Now, this is like a counterpitcher that has a separate container for fruit.
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.640]  So you can put like lemons or oranges in there, and it flavors the water really nice thing
[27:12.640 --> 27:13.640]  that's there.
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.240]  Plus, it filters the water as well.
[27:15.240 --> 27:22.320]  Or you can get a proprio ProMax shower filter that removes and reduces over 200 contaminants
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.280]  from the shower water, including things like heavy metals, fluoride, chlorine.
[27:26.280 --> 27:29.880]  If you're in the city, they're going to be dumping fluoride and chlorine in.
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.760]  That's going to be coming to you in the hot water in the form of a chlorine gas.
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.120]  So you want to try to filter that out of your shower heads.
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.640]  If you live in a rural area, there's going to be pesticides, perhaps pharmaceuticals,
[27:41.640 --> 27:42.640]  maybe odors.
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.560]  So to get rid of all of that at your shower filter, so if you get a big proprio filter
[27:46.560 --> 27:49.400]  or a king unit, you can take a choice of a free gift.
[27:49.400 --> 27:52.640]  Each of those are a $70 value while this sale is going.
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.640]  And of course, we still have our 30% to 40% off all InfoWare select storeable food.
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.120]  I don't know how much longer they're going to be able to run that sale because that
[28:02.120 --> 28:06.280]  is a huge discount that we have off of our food.
[28:06.280 --> 28:14.080]  So I want to get back to what I was talking about with the Patriot candidates in Oregon.
[28:14.080 --> 28:20.240]  As we went to break, the Guardian, I was reading you the clip there saying that Oathkeepers
[28:20.240 --> 28:26.720]  asserts that the oath taken by soldiers and police is to the Constitution, not to politicians.
[28:26.720 --> 28:30.160]  Just an assertion, a baseless assertion by the Oathkeepers.
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.160]  Because you're really signing up when you take the oath, soldiers and police, you are
[28:35.160 --> 28:42.760]  really just going to be the hired minions of whoever is the dictator in chief at a given
[28:42.760 --> 28:43.760]  moment.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.640]  But then they look at what's really driving this, the economic issues that are really
[28:46.640 --> 28:47.640]  driving this.
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.880]  When we talk to people who are in the mining industry, when we talk to people who are in
[28:51.880 --> 29:02.000]  that county there in Southwest Oregon, they have lost 90% of what really drove that economy
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.760]  because it was driven by logging, and the feds came in and just said, no, we're going
[29:05.760 --> 29:06.760]  to stop all logging.
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.080]  But don't worry, we're going to give you 10 years of welfare benefits, the same kind
[29:11.080 --> 29:13.520]  of stuff that we see happening with Hillary Clinton.
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.800]  They have the primary in West Virginia today, and Hillary Clinton, I guess she thought it
[29:17.800 --> 29:21.880]  was a good idea to go there and tell them she was going to shut down their coal mines
[29:21.880 --> 29:23.600]  and take their coal jobs.
[29:23.600 --> 29:24.600]  But vote for me anyway.
[29:24.600 --> 29:29.840]  We're going to destroy your economy, but we'll transition you into some green jobs
[29:29.840 --> 29:34.280]  and we'll put you on the federal reservation, just like they did the Indians, we'll make
[29:34.280 --> 29:40.880]  you dependent on our welfare, we'll take away your ability to run your economy.
[29:40.880 --> 29:42.240]  Remember that and go to the polls today.
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.320]  I think Donald Trump is making a big mistake to tell people not to bother about voting
[29:46.320 --> 29:47.320]  in the primary.
[29:47.320 --> 29:49.520]  He needs to secure this nomination, it's not there yet.
[29:49.520 --> 29:50.520]  Stay with us.
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.520]  We're on the march.
[29:51.520 --> 29:53.520]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.520 --> 30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:07.320]  Nearly one in six young men inside the U.S. are either jobless or incarcerated, reports
[30:07.320 --> 30:08.840]  Breitbart News.
[30:08.840 --> 30:13.840]  According to the Congressional Budget Office, out of 38 million young men in the U.S. in
[30:13.840 --> 30:17.800]  2014, 16% were jobless or incarcerated.
[30:17.800 --> 30:23.600]  The share of young men without a job or in prison has increased substantially since the
[30:23.600 --> 30:27.920]  1980s, when just 11% of young men fit into either category.
[30:27.920 --> 30:33.240]  CBO highlights that the level of joblessness and incarceration varies based on young men's
[30:33.240 --> 30:34.760]  educational attainment.
[30:34.760 --> 30:39.000]  The less they have, the more likely they are to be jobless or incarcerated.
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.640]  Economic, policy, and skillset changes contributed to the large increase of joblessness and
[30:44.640 --> 30:47.720]  incarceration from 1980 to 2014.
[30:47.720 --> 30:53.760]  The increased incarceration rates, CBO added, is not necessarily due to an increase of crime,
[30:53.760 --> 30:55.960]  but again, policy decisions.
[30:55.960 --> 31:00.760]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[31:00.760 --> 31:04.720]  Secret 12, Info Wars Lives, Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[31:04.720 --> 31:10.040]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[31:10.040 --> 31:11.040]  by the body.
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.720]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[31:15.720 --> 31:18.160]  are known to have higher absorption rates.

[31:23.280 --> 31:27.480]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.

[32:57.160 --> 33:24.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.120]  I'm Michael Snyder, frequent contributor to infowarsteam.com, and in the third hour we're
[33:28.120 --> 33:35.480]  going to be joined by John Cruz, a whistleblower about activities at HSBC, money laundering
[33:35.480 --> 33:41.080]  activities of drug cartels, terrorist organizations who gave the evidence to the Justice Department
[33:41.080 --> 33:42.440]  to Loretta Lynch.
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.040]  She didn't acknowledge it until she was questioned about it during confirmation hearings, and
[33:47.040 --> 33:49.280]  then she admitted, no, I didn't do anything with that.
[33:49.280 --> 33:54.800]  And of course, she didn't do anything, even when they convicted HSBC multiple times of
[33:54.800 --> 33:55.800]  money laundering.
[33:55.800 --> 34:02.200]  They gave the Sinaloa cartel, El Chapo, had his own private checkout window where he could
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.680]  come and launder his money with HSBC.
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.880]  And of course, that's another whistleblower from HSBC, we're not going to be interviewing
[34:09.880 --> 34:15.280]  him today, but that's a guy who released a lot of information as to how they helped tax
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.320]  evasion in various countries, and he's now been convicted in absentia of a five-year
[34:20.320 --> 34:24.880]  sentence out of Switzerland for violating their Banking Privacy Act.
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.400]  So I'm kind of ambivalent about what that guy did, but this guy is talking about how
[34:29.400 --> 34:35.960]  HSBC, and we've also had Everett Stern on in the past, talking about how they were convicted
[34:35.960 --> 34:44.200]  multiple times of laundering money for drug cartels, for terrorist organizations.
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.280]  The first time they were given probation, second time they were given a very, very small
[34:48.280 --> 34:50.920]  fine compared to the amount of money that was involved.
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.280]  But I just wanted to mention one final thing about this article, talking about the rise
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.240]  of the militias and Patriot candidates now getting elected in Oregon.
[34:59.240 --> 35:01.560]  And of course, Oregon is a very, very blue state.
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.800]  I think it was a mistake for the Bundys to go there to take a stand, even though in the
[35:04.800 --> 35:10.280]  rural areas, the people understand the city, the county government, for the most part,
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.280]  the sheriffs, with the exception of at least one that I know of that's there in Grant County,
[35:15.280 --> 35:16.280]  he's a good guy.
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.640]  But the rest of them are big government liberals who want to shut this down.
[35:20.640 --> 35:26.580]  They put a lot of pressure on the FBI to bring this to a resolution that resulted in the
[35:26.580 --> 35:30.320]  death of Levoix Finnecombe, the unnecessary death.
[35:30.320 --> 35:35.160]  And of course, the FBI lied about what happened there, and we subsequently saw even the sheriff's
[35:35.160 --> 35:40.920]  county release the evidence, they saw a big hole in the roof, and they said, wait a minute,
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.600]  that's not any caliber that we were shooting.
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.800]  The FBI said they didn't fire any shots, and then we learned that they fired sniper shots,
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.600]  perhaps trying to kill the people who were not shooting at them, who were inside the
[35:52.600 --> 35:57.240]  vehicle, perhaps trying to provoke them to firing back in self-defense and saying they
[35:57.240 --> 35:58.240]  were being the aggressors.
[35:58.240 --> 36:00.160]  Nevertheless, the FBI lied about it.
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.920]  But of course, the federal government is only upset about the fact that the FBI snipers,
[36:04.920 --> 36:08.520]  the hostage rescue team, that's what I love.
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.760]  They have these guys who are nothing but government assassins.
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.240]  We saw what they did to Randy Weaver's wife, and they call them hostage rescuers.
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.600]  Okay, all right, you want to play that kind of semantic games, kind of like the Patriot
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.200]  Act, okay, folks?
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.800]  But when we look at what they did to Southwest Oregon, when they shut down all of the timber
[36:27.800 --> 36:32.840]  industry there, they took the economy down by 90%.
[36:32.840 --> 36:36.200]  They said, don't worry, we'll give you 10 years to adjust, but they say the budgets
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.640]  of sheriff's office, juvenile justice center, the adult jail, the district attorney's office
[36:40.640 --> 36:42.720]  have all been cut by 65%.
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.040]  They can't even afford to pay for the government in that area.
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.640]  And the same thing is happening in John Day, Oregon, where we talked to the logger who
[36:50.640 --> 36:51.640]  was there.
[36:51.640 --> 36:57.200]  He pointed out that as they refused to allow people to make a living to cut down dead timber
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.880]  out of these areas, so that we can build homes and furniture and produce things.
[37:02.880 --> 37:08.840]  By leaving that dead timber there, they create circumstances that they're adding fuel to
[37:08.840 --> 37:09.840]  the fire literally.
[37:09.840 --> 37:13.840]  When they have a natural fire, it turns into a catastrophe, and we've seen this happen
[37:13.840 --> 37:15.400]  over and over again.
[37:15.400 --> 37:16.400]  We've seen it happen in Oregon.
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.280]  We've seen it happen here in Texas, down south before I moved here.
[37:20.280 --> 37:22.760]  It happened down in Bastrop.
[37:22.760 --> 37:28.320]  We've seen that the policies of leaving this dead wood there is guaranteed to burn out
[37:28.320 --> 37:29.320]  the area.
[37:29.320 --> 37:31.120]  But they have burned down the economy literally.
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.000]  And so they said, in 2012, they even had to set free county prisoners.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.800]  They couldn't afford to keep them in the jail.
[37:36.800 --> 37:38.920]  They had to shut down the sheriff's department.
[37:38.920 --> 37:41.040]  And here's a blessing in disguise.
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.560]  What they're starting to do now is they have started creating neighborhood watch programs,
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.720]  and this is the guy who's now running for office there.
[37:47.720 --> 37:49.480]  They've created resident deputies.
[37:49.480 --> 37:51.680]  We've talked about this in the past as well.
[37:51.680 --> 37:53.080]  The Posse.
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.120]  Remember the model that we see in all the westerns, where you've got the sheriff and
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.880]  a couple of permanent deputies who really know what's going on?
[37:58.880 --> 38:05.560]  They become the leaders of the community, Posse Comitatus, the power of the community.
[38:05.560 --> 38:10.800]  When there's a crisis, the people come together, and they work with the professional elected
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.800]  and accountable to the people, law enforcement officer, the sheriff.
[38:14.800 --> 38:18.720]  And so they say they have resident deputies, community members who would take policing
[38:18.720 --> 38:19.720]  into their own hands.
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.680]  The Guardian, with their Southern Poverty Law Center biases, always has to turn this
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.720]  into a situation like, oh, they're vigilantes, okay?
[38:28.720 --> 38:33.880]  Nevertheless, there are some positive signs that are going on out there, and it's interesting
[38:33.880 --> 38:36.760]  to see how the Guardian tries to spend this.
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.200]  Now, there was also an article that was on Drudge yesterday.
[38:39.200 --> 38:40.960]  I thought it was pretty interesting.
[38:40.960 --> 38:46.160]  This was Washington Times reporting on Vanity Fair's take on the Captain America movie, because
[38:46.160 --> 38:54.080]  of course, in Captain America, the people there are being spun as uncontrollable vigilantes.
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.280]  And we know that's not true, because we've seen the other movies, right?
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.800]  But Vanity Fair said, well, this could be a perfect movie, except it's got one big flaw.
[39:03.800 --> 39:10.560]  They didn't leave any kind of homosexual relationship between Captain America and Bucky.
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.400]  Sorry, that was a spoiler.
[39:13.400 --> 39:18.040]  They put this out there and said, the problem is, there's too much heterosexual virility
[39:18.040 --> 39:24.440]  there in that movie, and it's like, wow, wow, that's where we are.
[39:24.440 --> 39:31.120]  We just rented, we had power outages with a storm that came through where we lived about
[39:31.120 --> 39:37.320]  a week and a half ago, and we were out of internet for about eight or nine days, and
[39:37.320 --> 39:40.000]  we normally watch movies through internet.
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.000]  So we wanted to watch something, we went literally to the bottom of the discount barrel ban trying
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.640]  to find something that we could watch one night, and we thought, oh, here's something.
[39:49.640 --> 39:52.080]  We got the Captain America Iron Man movie coming up.
[39:52.080 --> 39:53.080]  We found this movie.
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.360]  There was an animated movie called Iron Man Extremis.
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.200]  And I wondered when that was made, because when you start out the movie, the first thing
[40:01.200 --> 40:08.400]  it shows is Bastrop, Texas, and it's like, wow, that's not far from where we live.
[40:08.400 --> 40:10.040]  And it's like, how about that?
[40:10.040 --> 40:18.120]  And then they go to, the whole storyline is about these terrible anti-government extremists,
[40:18.120 --> 40:23.440]  and they get injected by this drug from a pharmaceutical company that works for the military
[40:23.440 --> 40:25.600]  industrial complex in Austin.
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.760]  And this drug turns this guy into extremists without the T, just in case you don't want
[40:32.760 --> 40:37.680]  to get that too confused, too direct with the Southern Poverty Law Center narrative.
[40:37.680 --> 40:39.080]  So they just take the T off of it.
[40:39.080 --> 40:45.960]  They call him extremists, okay, without the T. This guy, you find out in the story, his
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.280]  whole family had something like the Randy Weaver situation.
[40:50.280 --> 40:51.840]  And what a surprise.
[40:51.840 --> 40:54.040]  This guy doesn't like the government.
[40:54.040 --> 40:59.520]  As a matter of fact, when he becomes this super, we can see superpowers from this drug,
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.080]  he decides he's going to take out some of the people responsible in Washington.
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.320]  And so Iron Man steps into the fore there.
[41:06.320 --> 41:12.880]  When you look at the movies that Marvel is creating, and I really liked the previous
[41:12.880 --> 41:14.080]  one, the Winter Soldier a lot better.
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.720]  I was hoping there would be a political dimension to this one, because the previous one was
[41:18.720 --> 41:21.160]  very politically savvy.
[41:21.160 --> 41:29.440]  Exposed the Nazi rat line that we call Operation Paperclip, where they brought the scientists
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.240]  over, exposed a lot of stuff.
[41:31.240 --> 41:35.480]  I think really made people think about where this whole surveillance state is leading,
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.160]  the power that we are giving the government, this unchecked power that we're giving the
[41:40.160 --> 41:41.640]  government.
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.200]  So I had a lot of hopes for this one that really didn't materialize from a political
[41:46.200 --> 41:47.200]  standpoint.
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.200]  I thought it was still a good action film.
[41:48.200 --> 41:49.760]  I thought it was still a very good film.
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.680]  But when you look at these movies, they're pretty mainstream with where American culture
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.600]  is today, I think.
[41:55.600 --> 41:59.440]  But not the comics, because remember, we've had these Captain America comics coming out
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.000]  in the past, you know, where the Tea Party, they call them the Tea Baggers, and Captain
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.480]  America is fighting the Tea Party.
[42:05.480 --> 42:11.280]  And now we've got Iron Man going after this extremist out of Bastrop, Texas.
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.680]  I mean, they're using the movies, I think, to pull the kids in.
[42:15.680 --> 42:16.680]  The Parrots look at the movies.
[42:16.680 --> 42:17.680]  Oh yeah, those are pretty good movies.
[42:17.680 --> 42:20.280]  I really even liked Captain America, it's a great role model.
[42:20.280 --> 42:25.200]  And then your kids read these comics, and what they're getting is the hard-line propaganda
[42:25.200 --> 42:26.200]  of the left.
[42:26.200 --> 42:28.640]  And here's an article today.
[42:28.640 --> 42:30.160]  This is from Breitbart.
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.320]  The professor urges liberals to treat evangelical Christians like Nazis.
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.160]  He says, hey, we've had a culture war, and we won that culture war.
[42:41.160 --> 42:46.200]  And so you shouldn't treat them with any more deference than we treated the people we defeated
[42:46.200 --> 42:48.200]  in World War II.
[42:48.200 --> 42:51.960]  You should just rub their noses into it like we did Germany and Japan.
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.640]  It's like, well, yeah, the only problem is, is that we really didn't do that in Germany
[42:55.640 --> 42:56.640]  and Japan.
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.120]  But nevertheless, in after World War I, we did rub the Germans' noses in it after World
[43:01.120 --> 43:06.920]  War I, and that created World War II to a large degree, created the forces that did
[43:06.920 --> 43:07.920]  that.
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.360]  But he says, we should offer Christians no quarter, no clemency.
[43:12.360 --> 43:13.360]  Like, wow.
[43:13.360 --> 43:15.800]  Boo, the mantle down.
[43:15.800 --> 43:18.160]  This is a 70-year-old professor, Mark Tushner.
[43:18.160 --> 43:19.240]  He said, they lost.
[43:19.240 --> 43:20.240]  We won.
[43:20.240 --> 43:23.760]  It's time to press the liberal advantage and abandon any defensive positions.
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.480]  He says, they will no longer have any resistance, especially after the death of Supreme Court
[43:28.480 --> 43:29.480]  Justice Antonin Scalia.
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.240]  And when I look at this, I say, well, you know what, he really is kind of right.
[43:35.240 --> 43:39.200]  They really have beat Christians in the culture war.
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.200]  Why is that?
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.200]  Why is that?
[43:41.200 --> 43:42.440]  You know, we look at the back and forth.
[43:42.440 --> 43:48.480]  This happened here in the presidential race, and we see what Glenn Beck and Ted Cruz did.
[43:48.480 --> 43:53.880]  They were basically channeling and taking to, in the next degree, these ideas that began
[43:53.880 --> 43:58.640]  with the Christian Coalition coalescing around Ronald Reagan.
[43:58.640 --> 44:06.520]  The idea that we should trust government to modify society, that government is not a fire
[44:06.520 --> 44:11.000]  that needs to be kept in check, like George Washington said, but that it is a force of
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  social engineering.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.120]  See, the conservatives bought into that social engineering idea as well.
[44:17.120 --> 44:21.320]  And they also, just like this liberal, says, well, it's all revolves around the Supreme
[44:21.320 --> 44:22.320]  Court.
[44:22.320 --> 44:26.400]  And we saw that in Ted Cruz's website where he talked about, he's going to restore the
[44:26.400 --> 44:27.400]  Constitution.
[44:27.400 --> 44:28.400]  How is he going to do it?
[44:28.400 --> 44:30.280]  Well, it's all about the Supreme Court.
[44:30.280 --> 44:36.400]  We need a generation of conservatives who are, we should call them the Andrew Jackson
[44:36.400 --> 44:37.400]  generation.
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.880]  And they should say, well, the Supreme Court has made their ruling.
[44:41.880 --> 44:46.760]  Let's see them enforce it because we have a lot of powers that are divided in our government
[44:46.760 --> 44:47.760]  by design.
[44:47.760 --> 44:48.960]  That's in the Constitution.
[44:48.960 --> 44:54.760]  We have a Ninth and 10th Amendment that underscores that division in the Constitution.
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.800]  Tells us where the real power lies.
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.480]  Tells us that unless they have been specifically granted this power to manipulate our lives,
[45:01.480 --> 45:02.480]  they don't have it.
[45:02.480 --> 45:05.840]  And so we need a Andrew Jackson-like president.
[45:05.840 --> 45:10.280]  We need people at the state level who will stand up like Andrew Jackson and say, you
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.320]  don't have the legitimate authority, just like these patriots in Oregon.
[45:14.320 --> 45:17.560]  You don't have the legitimate authority to do this.
[45:17.560 --> 45:22.560]  And when I look at the fact that we've got these conservative culture warriors, they've
[45:22.560 --> 45:24.480]  lost because they put their trust in government.
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.440]  Isn't that ironic that the conservatives who say they want limited government put so much
[45:28.440 --> 45:34.820]  trust in government to preserve their culture, to preserve the values that we've had?
[45:34.820 --> 45:37.200]  I think we need to take a two-pronged approach.
[45:37.200 --> 45:41.600]  First of all, we need to understand that we need to take the high road politically.
[45:41.600 --> 45:44.840]  We need to say this is about individual liberty.
[45:44.840 --> 45:51.640]  We are going to rigorously enforce the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights.
[45:51.640 --> 45:52.840]  That's what we're going to do politically.
[45:52.840 --> 46:00.200]  And then I think the Christians need to understand that the power doesn't lie in a presidency.
[46:00.200 --> 46:03.960]  The power doesn't lie in the Supreme Court.
[46:03.960 --> 46:07.320]  The power Christians lies in Jesus Christ.
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.280]  And if you're not going to use that power, if you're going to get your army of clergymen
[46:12.280 --> 46:17.000]  to say, we've got to unite against around this messianic politician who's going to solve
[46:17.000 --> 46:22.000]  all of our problems, that's the fundamental problem with what happened with Glenn Beck
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.960]  and with Ted Cruz and Alex Jones was exactly right.
[46:24.960 --> 46:28.040]  They were prancing demons, okay?
[46:28.040 --> 46:34.840]  Leading Christians down a path where they can't win because they have denied the true
[46:34.840 --> 46:37.720]  power to accomplish something.
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.920]  Now I had an article here and I misplaced it here, but there was also, here it is right
[46:41.920 --> 46:48.160]  here, 40,000 non-Muslim migrants harassed in German centers over their religion.
[46:48.160 --> 46:51.320]  That's the religion of peace, the religion of tolerance here, right?
[46:51.320 --> 46:57.000]  40,000 Christians and other non-Muslim refugees, this is an RT story, currently residing in
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.040]  migrant centers in Germany are being discriminated against and harassed by other asylum seekers
[47:02.040 --> 47:08.320]  and even the guards because of their religion, so as a human rights group, 88% said they
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.520]  were harassed by Muslim migrants due to being Christians and they say that 42% of them had
[47:14.520 --> 47:21.440]  were insulted, 37% got physical injuries, 32% even had death threats.
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.960]  They say women who've been rescued from ISIS, slavery in the Syrian city of Raqqa say, quote,
[47:27.960 --> 47:29.480]  they are still unprotected.
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.160]  They even see their tormentors in these camps.
[47:33.160 --> 47:34.160]  How's that?
[47:34.160 --> 47:35.160]  Okay?
[47:35.160 --> 47:38.120]  Because we're not screening the people who come in, we're saying anybody that wants to
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.200]  can come in and look at the way they're being treated.
[47:42.200 --> 47:48.840]  Look at the tolerance, we've got our allies, Saudi Arabia, as well as ISIS executing people
[47:48.840 --> 47:54.840]  because they're homosexuals, throwing them off of the roof, cutting their heads off,
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.320]  seeking the death penalty under Sharia law because they are homosexuals.
[47:58.320 --> 48:04.400]  We covered this last night and yet, what is our government doing about that?
[48:04.400 --> 48:07.720]  Are we creating any sanctions against Saudi Arabia?
[48:07.720 --> 48:09.440]  No, no, we're defending Saudi Arabia.
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.760]  We're saying we're not going to release any evidence that might implicate them in their
[48:14.760 --> 48:17.560]  official conspiracy theory, okay?
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.360]  Because you could have 9-11 families sue them over that.
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.760]  They create a narrative where they've got 19 hijackers on two planes to take down three
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.040]  buildings and then they say, yeah, they're from Saudi Arabia and so forth and so on.
[48:31.040 --> 48:36.880]  And then unfortunately for them, some of the people lower down didn't get the memo, okay,
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.560]  the eye wash that's going on in these organizations where the people at the top know what's going
[48:41.560 --> 48:43.920]  on but the people lower down actually are doing an investigation.
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.200]  They say, well, okay, if they're Saudis, where did they get their help?
[48:47.200 --> 48:48.440]  Where did they get their money here?
[48:48.440 --> 48:49.440]  Okay?
[48:49.440 --> 48:50.440]  And they start exposing that thing.
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.040]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't let that out because these guys are friends, okay?
[48:54.040 --> 48:55.440]  The Saudis are friends.
[48:55.440 --> 48:59.640]  The people who throw homosexuals off of the roofs are friends, the people who cut their
[48:59.640 --> 49:06.320]  heads off are friends, but we can get upset if we've got private bathrooms in North Carolina.
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.880]  We'll say, these are Jim Crow laws.
[49:09.880 --> 49:11.480]  Understand where this all began.
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.280]  And again, here's another example, Christians, of the way this has gone wrong, okay?
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.000]  This all began by a guy named Chad Severance Turner, North Carolina Values Coalition Exposed
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.360]  the fact that he was working with the LGBT Chamber of Commerce role in Charlotte.
[49:27.360 --> 49:32.600]  He was the one who created new bathroom laws that never existed before in Charlotte.
[49:32.600 --> 49:36.720]  This is a guy who is a registered sex offender.
[49:36.720 --> 49:43.280]  He fondled a child in church while the child was sleeping and he is a registered sex offender.
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.440]  And then he comes in and says, hey, I've got a great idea for how we're going to do bathrooms.
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.480]  At which point, the people of North Carolina were justifiably outraged.
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.240]  But instead of saying, no, we're not going to let you, Charlotte, create that law, we're
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.880]  going to override that with a law at the state level that says we're going to have, people
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.000]  are going to be able to exercise their private property rights and they're going to be able
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.040]  to determine how they're going to set up their bathrooms.
[50:08.040 --> 50:13.120]  Instead, North Carolina came back and said, no, we've got a special thing we're going
[50:13.120 --> 50:14.560]  to do here for you.
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.760]  Throw the ball into their court, now the feds came back and said, you guys are a bunch
[50:19.760 --> 50:26.880]  of racists and so now we've got Obama lynch mob coming down and suing them.
[50:26.880 --> 50:28.520]  So this is the way this happens.
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.320]  It could have been stopped by saying we're going to support liberty, but instead they
[50:33.320 --> 50:39.160]  tried to create their new solution and this kind of escalation, this kind of thing, trying
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.760]  to solve everything at the government level is what's causing them to lose the culture
[50:43.760 --> 50:44.760]  wars.
[50:44.760 --> 50:47.520]  Now later on, we're going to have, stay with us, we're going to have not only our guest
[50:47.520 --> 50:50.360]  joining us in the next hour, it's going to be Michael Schneider, but we're also going

[54:12.480 --> 54:13.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:13.480 --> 54:15.840]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[54:15.840 --> 54:19.200]  We're going to have, as I mentioned in the next hour, Michael Snyder is going to be joining
[54:19.200 --> 54:20.200]  us.
[54:20.200 --> 54:22.480]  He's a frequent contributor here to infowars.com.
[54:22.480 --> 54:26.680]  He talks about issues of preparedness, but especially about the economy.
[54:26.680 --> 54:31.760]  He has some very interesting metrics that show an economic slowdown is upon us in case
[54:31.760 --> 54:32.760]  you hadn't noticed.
[54:32.760 --> 54:33.760]  Yeah, it is.
[54:33.760 --> 54:39.960]  We're also going to be joined in the third hour by John Cruz, an HSBC whistleblower.
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.760]  As I mentioned before, his testimony about what was going on at HSBC figured prominently
[54:45.760 --> 54:50.520]  in the confirmation hearings of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, even though she did
[54:50.520 --> 54:52.920]  nothing with that information.
[54:52.920 --> 54:57.360]  It was something that the Republicans questioned her about and pointed out that they did not
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.520]  want to have a continuance of the too big to jail attitude that we had seen from Eric
[55:03.520 --> 55:04.520]  Holder.
[55:04.520 --> 55:07.440]  Nevertheless, she did that and we'll talk about what happened with that and we're going
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.120]  to have him tell you what he saw at HSBC, what was so concerning to him.
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.400]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to let you know about a new sale that we
[55:17.400 --> 55:18.400]  have.
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.520]  I mentioned this earlier in the show.
[55:20.520 --> 55:25.400]  If you get a pro-pure big or a king unit, you'll get your choice as a free gift.
[55:25.400 --> 55:28.520]  These are two choices, each of them about a $70 value.
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.360]  You can either get a pro-pure fruit-infused water pitcher that brings together the natural
[55:33.360 --> 55:38.120]  benefits of fruit-infused water and the health benefits of filtered water all in one pitcher.
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.880]  You just put the whatever you want to add, whether it's cucumbers or oranges or lemons.
[55:43.880 --> 55:48.960]  You can just put it in this container and it will flavor your pure filtered water in
[55:48.960 --> 55:52.960]  that container all in one handy unit there.
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.240]  Or you can get a pro-pure ProMax shower filter that reduces and removes over 200 contaminants
[55:58.240 --> 55:59.400]  from your shower water.
[55:59.400 --> 56:05.360]  Things like fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, odors, get that out of your shower.
[56:05.360 --> 56:09.920]  So you can get one of those two as a free gift if you buy the pro-pure big unit, that's
[56:09.920 --> 56:16.760]  a gravity feed filter that we have that can filter easily for a family, the water that
[56:16.760 --> 56:18.280]  you get out of your tap.
[56:18.280 --> 56:24.120]  Also, we have continued on some of our best-selling InfoWare Select Storeable Foods, the 30 to
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.880]  40% off of the Select Storeable Foods.
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.240]  And again, that is at InfoWareStore.com, huge discount, 30 to 40%.
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.760]  We've been able to extend that to some of our foods there at InfoWare Select Storeable
[56:36.760 --> 56:38.880]  Food.
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.400]  Now some of the news that came out today, of course we've had Paul Ryan, very interesting,
[56:43.400 --> 56:49.920]  this back and forth that went on between him and Donald Trump over the weekend, obviously
[56:49.920 --> 56:56.320]  caught him by surprise that Ted Cruz dropped out, but he wanted to put himself, I believe,
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.040]  when he would come out and he would make this comment, well, I'm not quite there yet.
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.680]  Yeah, he's not quite there yet.
[57:02.680 --> 57:09.040]  I mean, who would think that two days after another massive win by Donald Trump, after
[57:09.040 --> 57:13.680]  both of his competitors dropping out, who would think that if you went on and talked
[57:13.680 --> 57:19.600]  to a major news media organization that they would ask you about Donald Trump, he just
[57:19.600 --> 57:22.040]  really hadn't thought about that enough yet.
[57:22.040 --> 57:25.640]  Need to think a little bit more time to think about that.
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.680]  Now he was trying to put himself out there as the leader of the GOP establishment.
[57:30.680 --> 57:32.400]  Of course, he is their darling.
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.400]  They have put him in as Speaker of the House, and when I listened to all these never Trump
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.280]  people saying, well, I just don't know that Trump is good enough on the issues.
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.280]  I don't know that he's conservative enough, and it's like, please explain to me, please
[57:45.280 --> 57:49.040]  explain to me what is conservative about Paul Ryan.
[57:49.040 --> 57:52.560]  Please, tell me, these were open borders.
[57:52.560 --> 57:55.080]  He rubber stamped everything that Barack Obama wanted to do.
[57:55.080 --> 58:00.680]  They had the climate change accord that was struck in Paris back in December.
[58:00.680 --> 58:03.400]  He had some senators say, well, we're going to have something to say about that.
[58:03.400 --> 58:04.680]  No, they didn't.
[58:04.680 --> 58:08.840]  Within three days, they had fully funded that, they had fully funded Obamacare.
[58:08.840 --> 58:12.000]  They had done absolutely nothing about the border.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.840]  What does Paul Ryan do that is conservative?
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.080]  I'm waiting for somebody to tell me what he does that's conservative.
[58:19.080 --> 58:22.240]  Look, Donald Trump should ask him to step down.
[58:22.240 --> 58:25.800]  He says, hey, if he wants me to leave the chair of the convention post, I'll do it.
[58:25.800 --> 58:26.960]  I'll step down.
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.800]  He not only needs to tell him to step down from the convention post, but he needs to
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.360]  get involved in getting Paul Ryan out of office, just like Sarah Palin was saying.
[58:36.360 --> 58:40.240]  We need to canter him out of office because he's going to be the biggest opposition to
[58:40.240 --> 58:41.240]  Trump.
[58:41.240 --> 58:42.240]  Stay with us.
[58:42.240 --> 58:45.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.240 --> 58:48.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:48.240 --> 58:55.480]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[58:55.480 --> 59:00.360]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[59:00.360 --> 59:03.240]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[59:03.240 --> 59:09.440]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[59:09.440 --> 59:11.960]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[59:11.960 --> 59:16.240]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:16.240 --> 59:21.040]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.960]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[59:25.960 --> 59:29.400]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[59:29.400 --> 59:37.400]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[59:37.400 --> 59:40.720]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:40.720 --> 59:43.600]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[59:43.600 --> 59:48.480]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at inforwarslife.com
[59:48.480 --> 59:52.960]  with Anthroplex.
[59:52.960 --> 01:00:07.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.840]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.840]  Resistance, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.920]  In the next segment, as I mentioned, we're going to be joined by Michael Snyder.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.640]  We're going to talk some economic news.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.880]  But I began talking about Paul Ryan.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.880]  I think we need to start calling him Paul Rhino, as in Republican and name only.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:35.120]  Just add an O to it, and it'll be perfect, because that is what Paul Ryan is truly about.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.400]  As I was mentioning as we went to break, look at the older headlines.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.680]  Paul Ryan betrays America, $1.1 trillion omnibus bill, and again, I said that should be called
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:52.320]  the omnibus bill, because you cannot keep raising the spending that way.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:01:00.160]  Big spender for open borders, for the TPP, for the globalist multinational trade deals.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.040]  Understand that he doesn't stand for a constitution, he doesn't stand for any conservative values.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.560]  This guy is not conservative at all.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.520]  These people are perfectly comfortable with Hillary Clinton because they share her same
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.000]  economic outlook, just as his running mate Mitt Romney shared Barack Obama's idea about
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.480]  how to take over healthcare.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.840]  Romney had already done that in Massachusetts, Romney Care, that he did with Ted Kennedy,
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.520]  and Paul Ryan was his running mate.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.840]  They knew they had Obamacare, whether it was going to be Obamacare or Romney Care, you
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.720]  were still going to have the crony capitalist write the regulations for the insurance business.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.520]  And of course, the Republican Party has never had a plan to get rid of this.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.400]  They never planned on getting rid of it.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.200]  They said, well, we're going to repeal and replace it.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.400]  They never gave you any details.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.080]  Donald Trump has given us a seven point plan.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:56.920]  As I've mentioned, it identifies all the issues, ownership, free market, competition, tax credits,
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.760]  all the things that we need to do to reform this, as well as transparency on cost so that
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.640]  we can make informed decisions of the health savings accounts that we own and can pass
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]  down.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640]  So we have ownership.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.760]  We have an incentive to save.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.880]  We have the ability to save.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.240]  We have competition within the United States.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240]  Imagine that.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.960]  Somebody like Paul Ryan, who supports the TPP and his new challenger has dared him to debate
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960]  the TPP.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:29.400]  I like a lot of the stuff that his challenger, his name is Paul Neiman, Paul Neiman, so two
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.840]  Pauls here, Paul Ryan O, Paul Ryan O, and Paul Nailin.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.960]  And as his challenger says, Ryan has betrayed all of us.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960]  Yes, he has.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.240]  He dares him to debate the TPP.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.840]  I would dare him to debate how he could override the Constitution with the Trade Promotion
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.840]  Authority.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.240]  You know, we have a process in the Constitution for ratifying treaties.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.680]  And they're still saying, hey, all of these people like Kerry, they all signed the treaty,
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.440]  all these government representatives signed the treaty, but it's got to go to ratification
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]  everywhere.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]  Or is this a treaty?
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.680]  NAFTA was a treaty.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.440]  They called it a trade agreement, but it was a treaty, folks.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.680]  And when they have the disputes, the people who represent them are called treaty lawyers.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.240]  They can call these things partnerships because they're written by multinational corporations
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:22.200]  who are partnering to create a global governance run by these multinational corporations, but
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.360]  it's a treaty.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.600]  And when they created the TPA, the Trade Promotion Authority, what they did was they
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.400]  shut down the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.800]  And I've got to say, every person, Republican and Democrat who voted for that, all the senators
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:47.280]  but four voted for that, every one of them, voted to violate the Constitution, to simply
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.960]  ignore the Constitution.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.600]  Not to amend the Constitution, just that we don't care what the Constitution says.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.000]  We've got a different process.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.240]  We all agree that we're going to ignore the oath to the Constitution that we took when
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240]  we took office.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:05.800]  Remember earlier, I said, the Guardian says, hey, oathkeepers assert that when people who
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.360]  are law enforcement officers take an oath to the Constitution, they're taking an oath
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.520]  to the Constitution, not to their political leaders.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.280]  Clearly Washington doesn't believe that.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.640]  The Guardian doesn't believe that, doesn't understand that.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.880]  The people in Washington think they can do whatever they want.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.240]  They take an oath to the Constitution and they're done with it.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.240]  They don't ever have to look at it.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.140]  They don't have to be bothered with it.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.240]  They can do whatever they please because they're in charge.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.040]  Executive orders or they can just all get together and the majority of these congressmen
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.800]  can say, we're going to ignore the constitutional process, which is what Paul Ryan did.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.240]  So yeah, if Trump is elected, the biggest obstacle that he's going to have to getting
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:49.400]  anything done with a border, with Obamacare, with the corporate takeover or management
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.680]  of our trade is going to be Paul Ryan.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.720]  He needs to be primaried out.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.120]  Get him out of there now.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.560]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.600]  A convicted robber who broke out of prison 48 years ago has finally been caught, reports
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.040]  Fox News.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.120]  Federal officials caught up with Robert Stackowitz, now 71 years old on Monday in Sherman, Connecticut.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:19.200]  Stackowitz is being held in a Connecticut jail and is waiting to be transported to Georgia.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.880]  He had served two years of a 17-year sentence for robbery at Carroll County Prison Work
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.360]  Camp when he busted out back in 1968.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.080]  Stackowitz, who escaped from the prison's infirmary, had been living in Sherman since
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.880]  at least July 1990, according to record viewed by the News Times.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:43.280]  Sherman is a sparsely populated town and has one independent grocery store and a daycare
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280]  center.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:49.760]  Fox Marshals Task Force recently uncovered a possible alias identity for Stackowitz leading
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.720]  investigators to Sherman.

[01:06:51.720 --> 01:07:10.080]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.720]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.160]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.680]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.040]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.640]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]  vitality.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.680]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.280]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:47.120]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.800]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.320]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.

[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.600]  with Anthroplex.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:15.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, we're going to be going to our guest,
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.960]  Michael Snyder in just a moment, real quickly I want to read you a headline from Infowars.com.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.480]  This has just been put up by Kit Daniels, Republicans for Hillary, major cruise donors
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.480]  are shifting to Hillary Clinton.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.000]  As he points out, one of the donors, Renaissance Technologies, spent over $13 million on Cruz's
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.480]  campaign, and is now pouring millions into Clinton's coffers.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.680]  They say her campaign is signaling to Republican donors that Hillary, quote, represents your
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.600]  values better than Trump, unquote, yes, she does.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.440]  She has Wall Street values.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.800]  She has globalist values.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.520]  She has international trade agreement values, okay, that's what they wanted to get through
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]  this time.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.360]  They wanted the candidate and they could get it either with Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz or pretty
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.960]  much any of the candidates except Donald Trump.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.920]  That's why they said, never Trump.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.360]  Because he's the only one out of the 17 that were running that opposed the trade deals.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.840]  I guess we could put Rand Paul in there as well.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.600]  I think he opposed those trade deals.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.840]  He certainly opposed the TPA, the Unconstitutional TPA, and he opposed those trade deals, even
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.040]  though he talks about free trade, this is nothing at all like free trade.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.920]  As Rand Paul's father pointed out, if you want free trade, you don't need thousands
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.200]  of pages of an agreement.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.400]  That is managed trade.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.160]  And as Senator Sessions has pointed out, who is now the advisor to Donald Trump, this is
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:45.640]  trade that is going to be managed by a multinational organization that we don't have any, has no
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.240]  accountability to us.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.720]  As you point out, once these things, the secret trade agreements, the TPP, the TTIP, the Trans
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.400]  Atlantic, the Trans-Pacific Partnerships, once those are put in place, you are not going
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.040]  to have any control anymore over your economy.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.640]  It's going to be managed by these people who are offshore.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.600]  You're going to create a living document that is going to be constantly changed by these
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.960]  people amended by them.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.520]  They're going to be setting up all the details without any input from your elected representatives,
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.200]  just as they created this treaty without any input from your elected representatives.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.360]  Because you are not a stakeholder.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  So now we see the Wall Street stakeholders are now coalescing behind Hillary.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.360]  Of course they are.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  Of course they are.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.780]  That was the plan all along, to have themselves perfectly hedged with either Hillary or a
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.720]  Jeb-like figure, and of course Ted Cruz qualified for that.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]  He qualified for that.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.400]  He supports, he wrote with Paul Ryan, these trade agreements.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.760]  So now these donors are coalescing behind Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]  It's very interesting.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.600]  Let's go to our guest now, Michael Snyder is the creator of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.000]  Also writes for the end of the AmericanDream.com, and theTruthWins.com is a frequent contributor
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.960]  to Infowars.com as well.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.720]  He does not belong to any political party or any political organization.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.320]  He believes the coming economic collapse is going to unfold over a number of years, and
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.160]  he tells us about the warning signs that he sees.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.520]  So joining us now is Michael Snyder.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520]  Welcome Michael.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.200]  Thank you for having me on the program, it's really great to be back with you again.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]  Well, thank you.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200]  It's good to talk to you again.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.000]  I was looking at this article that you just put out a couple of days ago.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.760]  The next employment crisis is here, job cuts at U.S. companies jump 35% in April.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.760]  What's causing this, Michael?
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.520]  Well, what's happening, causing this is an economic slowdown, and we see evidence of
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520]  this all around us.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.400]  So we got these new numbers, Challenger Green Christmas, which does a great job of tracking
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  these things.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.360]  And to them, the number of job cut announcements that major firms in the United States increased
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:55.120]  35% in April, a huge, massive increase, and in fact, and it's just, but it's not just
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]  one month.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.240]  For the first four months of 2016, January through April, compared to the same period
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:07.560]  a year ago, the number of announced job cuts are up 24% overall.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.680]  So this huge increase, we haven't seen anything like this since the last recession.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.960]  It's a huge signal that the economy's slowing down, that we're starting to see the, and
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.280]  we're starting to see this in the employment numbers.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.960]  And it's hitting many people personally, in fact, in my own extended family, just in the
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.720]  past few months, three people have lost their jobs just in the last few months.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.600]  So it's, of course, this is reflective of what's going on in the overall economy.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.920]  I mean, you look at the GDP numbers, the GDP number for the United States has been in
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:44.200]  decline for three quarters in a row, for the first quarter of this year, it came in a 0.5%,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.680]  which is just very, very poor.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:52.280]  But you have to keep in mind that a change was made in 2015 specifically to bolster the
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.480]  first quarter numbers, because they said, oh, the first quarter number always comes
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480]  in too low.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.960]  We've got to artificially inflate it.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.080]  So this number that we got, 0.5%, was actually with that artificial inflation that was built
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]  in.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.880]  So without that artificial inflation, it would have very likely.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.280]  been a negative number, but of course, we've seen very poor economic growth all throughout
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.440]  Barack Obama's tenure.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.800]  In fact, he's on track, this is maybe hard to believe, but he's on track to become the
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:29.480]  first president ever, never to have a year of an entire year of 3% growth for the economy.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.880]  And he's had, you know, he's going to have eight years, we're talking about even presidents
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.960]  that only had four years.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.080]  He's on track to be the first president ever to go through his entire presidency, never
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.520]  having a year of 3% growth.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.720]  In fact, when you look at the average economic growth under Barack Obama, he's on track
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.120]  to have the fourth worst in all of US history ever since our founding.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.960]  He's on track to be the fourth worst in terms of average economic growth.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.400]  So we're really seeing the economy slow down significantly right now.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.760]  I got to ask you, Michael, I got to interrupt you a second here and ask you, how could that
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.760]  be possible?
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.080]  Because we just had Barack Obama speaking at a commencement organization this last weekend
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:19.120]  saying, in every respect, this country is better than it was in 1983.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.480]  Was he lying to us through his teeth?
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.560]  Yeah, he's flat out lying to us, you know, it's completely and totally ridiculous.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:35.160]  You know, the Obama administration says, oh, unemployment's just 5%, and of course we don't
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.960]  believe him, but you know who else doesn't believe Barack Obama?
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.560]  The Federal Reserve, according to the New York Post, the Federal Reserve has started
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.040]  keeping their own unemployment statistics because they consider what the federal government
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.320]  is telling them to be so unreliable, and according to the Federal Reserve, the unemployment
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.160]  number is actually closer to 6%, but of course that's not really realistic either.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.520]  I mean, John Williams of shadowstats.com, he says that it's up above 22% the real unemployment
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.400]  number in this nation, and when you add the number of Americans that are officially unemployed
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:13.160]  to those that are considered not being the labor force, you get more than about 102 million
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.040]  Americans that are of working age that do not have a job right now.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.080]  And so, but it's, you know, not just employment, you look at, for example, total business sales.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.960]  I mean, businesses selling stuff to people, that those numbers have been declining since
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:34.920]  the middle of 2014, so almost for two year, two entire years, total business sales have
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.840]  been declining, or you look at corporate earnings.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.680]  Corporate earnings now have been falling for four quarters in a row.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.600]  Basically an entire year, corporations are earning less money.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:55.000]  For the first quarter of 2016, corporate profits were down 7.1% compared to the same period
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  a year ago.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.320]  So, things are slowing down for corporations big time, and then we're seeing more companies
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.120]  go under right now in a major way.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.080]  For the first quarter of 2016, commercial bankruptcies were up 32% compared to the same
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:17.160]  period last year, and firms filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has soared 67% compared to the
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.120]  same period a year ago.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.560]  So, look at JCPenney, that's one of the long term retail establishments in this country,
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:27.040]  one of the oldest retail establishment.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.040]  They're trying to reorganize and cut hours so that they can stay out of bankruptcy.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.920]  And we've got Hillary Clinton, where they've got a primary in West Virginia, goes to West
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.880]  Virginia and brags about how she's going to shut down coal mines and take coal jobs.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.200]  I guess she thinks that she's going to continue with the legacy of Barack Obama of unemployment,
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.560]  because that's what she's talking about.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.920]  It's absolutely amazing to me that she would go someplace like that and say, we're going
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:56.280]  to take your jobs, but don't worry, we'll put you on the green reservation.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.800]  And you'll all just be so happy there.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.400]  They've lost 10,000 jobs, Michael, in the last five years in the mining industry of
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.240]  West Virginia, just there alone.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240]  This is what we're seeing everywhere.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.280]  You pointed out in your article, we've lost over 100,000 good-paying jobs in the energy
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.240]  industry over the last couple of years.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.040]  Things are going to get a lot worse because we're not only going to lose jobs, but our
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.400]  power is going to get a much more expensive as we move to these new, untried, untrustworthy
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.320]  forms of crony capitalism that they're selling on us.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.600]  They call it green.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.240]  The only thing green about it is the money that they're stuffing under the table to the
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240]  candidates here.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.560]  I'm so glad you brought this up because, as you mentioned, we've lost over 100,000
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.960]  good-paying energy jobs since the beginning of last year.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.800]  Those are the kind of middle-class jobs that we need in order to have a middle-class.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.240]  You've got to have middle-class jobs.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:54.440]  So we're seeing oil companies, dozens of oil companies, of fracking companies are going
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.160]  under or are going bankrupt.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.800]  And then you mentioned coal, of course.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.640]  Well, Barack Obama's pretty much already almost destroyed the coal industry.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640]  And it's hitting the rail industry real hard because, of course, the rail industry moves
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.080]  around a lot of this coal.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.520]  And so you look at the rail traffic for the first quarter was down by something like 11
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.920]  percent year over year, which is just we've never seen that outside of a major recession.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.320]  And so you've got these rail companies are in huge trouble right now.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:31.640]  In fact, I just posted an article just recently about how Union Pacific, there's 292 Union
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.280]  Pacific engines that are sitting in the middle of the Arizona desert doing nothing because
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.760]  they don't have anything to do.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.760]  They don't have anything to ship.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.680]  And I included a picture of this from Google Earth, and you can see it up on the screen
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.320]  of these engines just sitting there.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.320]  They don't have anything to do.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.320]  That's interesting.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.120]  The rail traffic has declined so precipitously, and, of course, we're seeing some more numbers
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.560]  with air traffic with shipment by ground that, you know, in terms of the real economy
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.640]  stopping bought and sold and shipped around the country, it's slowing down dramatically.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.560]  So I have no idea with everything we're seeing around us how anyone can say that the US economy
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560]  is in good shape.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.120]  You know, it's interesting, too, when you show that picture off of your website there,
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:19.280]  economiccollapseblog.com, rail traffic, depression, 292 Union Pacific engines are sitting in the
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.560]  Arizona desert doing nothing.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.580]  I remember it was just a couple of months ago, we had an article about the largest shipping
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:34.360]  container ship ever to be created, and it was the volume of the Empire State Building.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.960]  And yet this was coming at a time when we've had, it was actually a snapshot, they showed
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.640]  all the shipping containers were at port.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.560]  Nobody was moving anything because we've seen a massive decline in all this when we look
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.720]  at the energy industry and the fact that we're having layoffs there, it's because there's
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.720]  no demand.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:20:01.120]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Michael Snyder.

[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.720]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.440]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.920]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.600]  But with a trusted Big Berky Water Filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.240]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.480]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.040]  I said, let me see.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.840]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:30.000]  companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.560]  he had been quoted.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.800]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience,

[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.160]  Paid non-attorney spokesperson, talcum powder justice with principal office in California
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.880]  is responsible for the content of this ad.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:08.920]  Attention women, new evidence shows that talcum powder products such as Johnson and Johnson's
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.760]  baby powder and shower to shower may cause ovarian cancer.

[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.360]  of a woman who died of cancer she said was caused by the company's talcum powder.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.080]  The jury found that Johnson and Johnson knew that these products could cause cancer and
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.760]  failed to warn consumers.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:43.080]  If you or a loved one use talcum powder and were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, call 1-800-323-1929.

[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:06.400]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.760]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.120]  We're talking to Michael Snyder of the Economic Collapse Blog.com.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.600]  I was just looking at one of your articles here, Michael.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.240]  All of a sudden, fish are dying by the millions all over the planet.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.640]  You go through talking about all the various articles that have come up.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.320]  And of course, you ask, why is this happening?
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.240]  We honestly don't know why it's happening.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.680]  But it's important to know that it is happening.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.560]  We got an article that you referenced in the here Smithsonian magazine.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.880]  It says, why are the Chilean beaches covered with dead animals?
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.080]  The South American country's beaches are covered with piles of dead sea creatures.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.080]  Scientists are trying to figure out why.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]  Then you go to China.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.280]  We have 35 tons of dead fish have piled up in a lake there, one province.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.640]  And going back to Bolivia, thousands of dead fish have washed up on the shores of a lake
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640]  in Bolivia.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640]  What's going on?
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.960]  I mean, is it some kind of a bacterial outbreak?
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]  Is it pollution?
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.960]  Who knows?
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.800]  But here's one idea, folks.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.360]  If you're not filtering your water, you really need to be taking care of that.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.880]  I mean, nobody knew in Flint, Michigan, that there was lead in the water until they started
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.680]  seeing the effects in their children.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.400]  They didn't taste it, they didn't smell it, they didn't see it.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.840]  But they saw what it was doing to their children.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.960]  So you don't want to wait until these things start piling up on you.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.600]  So make sure that you've got a good water filter to help you do that.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.520]  We always want to have a win-win situation here.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.840]  We not only do we sell good quality gravity feed filters like the ProPure filters, we're
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.960]  now offering a special.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.680]  If you get the ProPure Big or the King unit, you can get your choice of a free gift.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.280]  You can either get, and both of these gifts are $70 values, you can have the first one
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.600]  is a ProPure fruit-infused water pitcher.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.000]  You can see these on the website.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.720]  Second one is a ProPure ProMax shower filter.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:59.080]  And the idea is that you want to get rid of the stuff that is killing the fish, okay?
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.960]  Or causing mental issues for these children, and of course it's not just the lead.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.480]  They actually pay to put fluoride and has the same effect as lead.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.320]  We've got governments all over this country putting in fluoride at levels that Harvard
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:20.480]  tells us will cause our children to have mental issues, to lose IQ.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.320]  So they put this stuff in, they tax you to put it in.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.720]  You need to make sure that you're taking responsibility for your own water for the purity, whether
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.280]  it is some kind of a bacteria, whether it's pollution, or whether it is deliberate sabotage
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.120]  or incompetence by our government that is controlling the water supply you need to take
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.480]  care of yourself.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.520]  And we're offering that now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.360]  Also we still have on some of the best-selling info or select storeable foods, 30 to 40%
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.360]  off.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.600]  USA non-GMO packaging that is the best you'll find anywhere it will last on the shelf for
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.600]  25 years.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.560]  Now I want to go back and pick up with Michael Snyder again.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.840]  Also if you'd like to call in with questions for Michael Snyder about the economy or comments
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  that you've got about the situations that you're going through, I'm going to give out
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840]  that number here.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.840]  That's 800-259-9231.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.960]  Again, that's 800-259-9231.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.040]  If you'd like to call with comments or questions for Michael Snyder, creator of the economic
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:25.520]  collapse blog.com, also endoftheamericandream.com, a frequent contributor here at infowars.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.880]  Michael, we were just talking about what's going on with shipping containers, with railroad
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.040]  engines that are setting idle, with shipping containers that are setting idle all across
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.280]  the country.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.480]  And we know what's happening in the energy business.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.040]  You point out in your article that we've had 100,000 jobs lost in the energy business.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.600]  You're seeing the price of oil plummet.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.920]  And it's not because people are turning to green energy sources, it's because there's
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.960]  no demand for that.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.920]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to give us more expensive energy that
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.640]  will in turn drive the economy even farther down.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.680]  And of course one of the best predictors of your quality of life, even of your life expectancy,
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.280]  is to have cheap, affordable energy.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.920]  They're now working on removing that.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.120]  Hillary Clinton is bragging about that in the state when she's running for primary today.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.400]  She goes last week and brags about how she's going to take their jobs.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400]  Your comments, Mike.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  And let's keep in mind, this is not just a U.S. phenomenon.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.480]  This slow down that we're witnessing is truly global in scope.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.840]  In fact, to a certain extent, the U.S. economy is actually doing better than almost everywhere
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.120]  else around the rest of the planet right now.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.400]  For example, let's go down to South America, where you look at Brazil.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.400]  Brazil is the seventh largest economy in the entire world.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.920]  And their economy has been shrinking now for several quarters in a row.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.280]  And it's been getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.560]  This last quarter was the worst in terms of it's a Goldman Sachs around the turn of the
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.440]  year referred to it as a depression.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:00.960]  But just here recently, CNN ran an article that was with this title, Brazil, economic
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.960]  collapse worse than fear.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.760]  So CNN is using the term economic collapse to describe what is going on down in Brazil
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.760]  right now.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.280]  And it's interesting, I think, Michael, to point out that their economic collapse was
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.600]  preceded by a leftist move in politics.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.160]  We've now got this lady who was reelected in 2014.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.000]  There was a lot of talk about how corrupt that election was.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.560]  They tried to impeach her.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.520]  They passed a vote in the lower house and then the speaker of the house just says, well,
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.120]  I'm going to annul that.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.880]  That's the kind of dictatorship that we're getting very close to here in the United States.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880]  And people need to be aware of that.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:38.880]  Stay with us.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:30:00.840]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:27.520]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:57.320]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:25.720]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:54.680]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:24.520]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:54.360]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:24.200]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:54.040]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:34:23.880]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:53.720]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:35:23.560]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:53.400]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:36:23.240]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:53.080]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:37:22.920]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:50.760]  We'll be right back with Michael Schneider.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:38:10.760]  I'm curious what you see in the data, Michael, about people who happen to be in my particular
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:21.480]  category and the way that we participate in the economy and what sort of insight that
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.480]  my show you.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.040]  In my situation, I was after 30 plus years, corporate America, age of 58, got laid off
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:34.520]  outsourced of China, took about two months of unemployment, and then I said, you know,
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:41.200]  I'm just going to do it on my own, and I basically run an LLC out of my bedroom here, just a
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.000]  one man kind of show, don't take any support or any subsistence and just do it all on my
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  own.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.240]  And so I'm kind of curious, my feeling is that that's a big trend in the economy.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.120]  I don't know what you might be seeing.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.840]  And then my second question would be, you know, kind of for the both of you and Dave,
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:10.280]  I think more for you is, I keep telling some of my more conservative friends that Trump's
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:17.560]  a pretty smart guy and that as after he gets nominated and we start moving closer towards
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:23.520]  the election, that he's going to take more of a liberty stance and it's just an intuition.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.840]  And I'm kind of wondering what your input is on that thing.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.080]  Well, let's take the question to Michael Snyder first, Michael, he's asking about people
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.920]  who get laid off later in their working career, and they take that experience and they start
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.080]  a new job of their own.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.800]  Is that a significant trend that you see?
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.760]  Yeah, I'm seeing a number of people try to do this, unfortunately, on a broader scale.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.640]  Society as a whole, the rate of self employment in the United States is hovering near all
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.640]  time record lows been declining throughout the Obama administration because they make
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.200]  it so hard.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.280]  So you know, America was built on entrepreneurship on small businesses.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:07.360]  But today, because of all the red tape, literally we have millions of laws and rules and regulations
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.440]  when you add in state and local and federal, you know, red tape.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.440]  And so it's so hard.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.120]  And then of course, if you're self employed, they hit you with both halves of the they
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.480]  call it the self employment tax where, you know, instead of just, you know, the part
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.800]  of the social security, you have to pay both halves of the social security, everything
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.160]  else, so they tax you to death when you try to go on your own.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:32.040]  They hit you with all this red tape and they make it exceedingly difficult.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.560]  And so it's very, it can be very, very hard, very, very challenging.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.840]  But that's what America was built on, unfortunately, because of, you know, with socialism, they
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.080]  want to centralize everything.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.960]  They want to get, you know, the corporate big corporations in control of everything
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:47.520]  because big government and big corporations work very, very well together.
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.320]  That's why our founding fathers were so suspicious of both big government and any large concentrations
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.160]  of power, such as big corporations, they really limited the size and scope of corporations
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.520]  in early America.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.240]  But today, big government and big corporations run everything and the little guy who tries
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.360]  to set up his own business, do his own thing is very, very hard to just to compete against
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.840]  the corporations, then they tax you to death and they strangle you with red tape.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]  So it's very, very hard.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.840]  Yeah.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:13.840]  And I would second that.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.280]  I would say that, you know, both my grandparents and my father, both my grandfathers and my
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.520]  father were in business for themselves, and I look back at the businesses that they were
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.240]  in, they would not be allowed to operate today by federal regulations.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.880]  It's the federal government that has come in and shut down so many different opportunities.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.680]  And when they start shutting down small businesses in one of the businesses that we had, we were
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.320]  selling to other small businesses.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.720]  And as we saw them falling off and falling by the wayside, it started to hurt our bottom
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  line as well.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  So that's a very, it's kind of a cascading domino effect because we're not going to
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.360]  sell a lot to the big corporations.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.080]  They're going to be buying from China.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.200]  So when we've got a main street economy here, we've got small businesses who are buying
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.400]  and selling services or goods to each other as some of them start to get squeezed out
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.800]  by the big companies that are doing business in China or they get shut down by federal
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.240]  regulation, then your market starts to slip as well.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.800]  And we're talking and the other question you had, Dan, about whether or not Trump is going
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.280]  to move towards liberty, I don't know, we'll just have to wait and see.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.320]  We're going to push him as hard as we can towards individual liberty because as Alex
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.480]  has said, you can't make America great unless you make America free.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.120]  The first thing that we should be looking for, even above our economic issues, and I
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.600]  know that this is not practical.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.960]  I know the thing that motivates people to get involved is going to be economic suffering,
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.920]  but we have to understand that we're not going to have any economic prosperity if they shut
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.200]  down our individual liberty.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:41.600]  If they take the rule of law away from us, if they take away our bill of rights, we are
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.320]  not going to have an economically prosperous country.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.560]  We're not going to have a free country either, it's going to impact our security, our safety
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560]  as well.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.400]  We've got Alex Jones on the line here, ready to come in.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.400]  Alex, welcome.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.280]  David, it's good to be here with you today.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.760]  I appreciate you sitting in.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:02.280]  I got an eye infection, I guess, overnight.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:05.200]  I've actually gone to see the doctor and I can't find an infection.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.560]  It looks like I've got a scratch on the inside of my eye.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.440]  It should heal in a couple of days when I'm taking care of some business while that's
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.440]  going on.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:18.480]  In case folks wonder why I only have one eye open, but look, the writing of Michael Schneider,
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:23.800]  the analysis of the other economists and experts we have on, it's very, very clear that most
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.880]  of the world is already in a collapse event and it's an orchestrated collapse to bring
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.760]  in the world government, to bring in the world cashless society and they're preparing everyone
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.760]  to get rid of cash now.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.800]  They're preparing everyone to get rid of borders.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.920]  They are just brazenly throwing the entire agenda in everyone's face.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.400]  So the question is, is a collapse coming?
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400]  No.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.120]  There is a global collapse already happening.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.320]  It's just not equally distributed right now.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:58.320]  And that's really the main focus that I'm trying to laser beam in on is that the globalists
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.880]  admit they have organized crises.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:06.040]  They admit they have organized collapses at a nation by nation level, so the central banks
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:11.720]  can come in and buy the mouth of pennies on the dollar, give their corrupt leaders loans
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.240]  that they never pay off.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:17.720]  Case point example is Nigeria borrows a couple billion dollars in the 60s and they've paid
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.520]  over $100 billion today on the $3 billion.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.460]  And there's many other examples of that going on.
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.880]  So that's what this domestication is all about.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.680]  But meanwhile, while you're having the collapse, you want to divert the public and act like
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.120]  you're the saviors to get more banker bailouts, more power, more control.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.520]  In fact, the bankers just don't go in and set up an engineer system where countries collapse
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.560]  economically and they come in and take over.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.680]  The bankers go through their private subsidiaries, have one of them go bankrupt like Lehman Brothers,
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.920]  have the stock market go down by 35%, scare monger everybody and say, okay, we'll sign
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:59.200]  on to unlimited trillions in debt to your private system.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.360]  And then once we're signed on to the debt of the megabanks, 2.2 quadrillion, last time
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.960]  they released numbers in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today five years ago, it's much bigger
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.920]  derivatives overhang now.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.720]  We're signed on to over $2,000 trillion, so we're debating this $19 trillion national
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.720]  debt.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.720]  That's what we really owe.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:22.520]  If you look at expenditures and guarantees and things that are obligations, it's more
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.920]  like $100 trillion.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.520]  But still, our total debt's $100 trillion that you could argue that we were maneuvered
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:33.280]  into in this domesticated society, but we've been signed on to 2.2 quadrillion.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.440]  So it's the public's ignorance about how things really work that is allowing the social engineers
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.480]  to carry out these operations.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.640]  That's why it's so important to get the word out and why Donald Trump talking about globalism
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.360]  is the problem, unfair trade deals are the problem, politicians selling us out, he says
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.360]  because they're stupid.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.360]  No, they're not stupid.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:56.240]  Most of them are retiring overseas with the billions they've made by setting up laws
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.360]  that moved our jobs to China, Mexico, India, and other third world countries.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.080]  They make deals with the corrupt governments who are command and control.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.440]  That's why the CIA admitted back in the 60s, they want fascism, communism, socialism, oligarchy.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.440]  They don't care.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.360]  Carol quickly wrote about it in Tragedy and Hope.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.040]  They want a top-down system, so they're only working with a few people at the top who they
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:24.080]  can go multinationaly make deals with to basically have slave labor, i.e. Foxcom and Apple laboratories
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.680]  with the suicide nets forced abortion in 17-hour work days, no pensions, no environmental
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.880]  standards, and a 35% tariff on currency, impossible for us to compete.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.000]  This is how you bring America to its knees, this is how you bring Europe to its knees,
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.400]  this is how they've got us in checkmate, then they bring in a, quote, service economy, they
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.320]  bring in social engineering when the economy won't survive or you sign on to a government
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.600]  job or corporate welfare or other systems where you're dependent and now you're part
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.360]  of the high of the board, independence has been neutralized.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.720]  But to make sure the youth are so brain scrambled that they never figure out that they were
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.440]  induced into college degrees that were worthless 90% of the time to realize that they were
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:05.680]  being set up for post-industrial technocracy, you just brainwashed them with total political
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:12.520]  correctness where you actually say in public, let's go eat Mexican food and people look
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.280]  at you and say you're racist, you shouldn't have done that.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:23.920]  I actually today, today, was talking about Mexican food and had someone say that's racist
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.440]  and I said are you joking, someone walking by me and they said no.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.760]  So, so this is the total mental illness where words and language and numbers can just like
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.320]  voodoo be told to be evil and to create a new superstition where everyone just runs around
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:43.320]  hamstrung, rolling in a fetal position, metaphysically urinating on themselves, I mean this is just
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.840]  out of control and there's articles on info wars.com that dovetail with this, UVA student
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.840]  identifying as American is microaggression, safe space are having quote shut down and
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.280]  are appropriation of the entire hemisphere.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:04.360]  That's just like all over the United States, people that wear American flags on their shirts
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.840]  in public schools and colleges are being kicked out even though they're Hispanic because
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.280]  the illegals who've been brought in, they were totally nationalistic, in many cases
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.560]  very racist, a lot of them are great people but a lot of them are thuggish and you know
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:19.360]  trashy they are, every group's got their trash, you know white trash tends to be clan, Mexican
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.800]  trash tends to be la raza, mecha and the clan will intimidate whites to join them, mecha
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.600]  la raza will intimidate Hispanics to join them and then they get them into these groups
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.160]  but here you have the colleges and the media pushing it and major comedians pushing it
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.480]  so it's okay, so now you can't even see an American flag, people laugh at that, the UK
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.880]  is starting to take down its main national flag, the flag of the empire and they're
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.040]  also basically banned, the King George flag, the original flag of England, you know white
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:54.000]  with a red cross on it, that actually happened, so this is what the globalists are doing
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.400]  is this world corporate board is conquering everything, conquering culture, conquering
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.760]  mathematics, conquering, they're at war with reality like Winston Smith's told by O'Brien
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:09.160]  in 1984, he's in the torture center, Ampley named the Ministry of Love, he's told, hey
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.080]  don't worry, you know we can have our mathematicians suspend gravity if we wanted to, even though
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.400]  you wouldn't be floating in the air, you would believe that you're floating in the air because
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.760]  we control reality and I will torture you and brainwash you until you believe it, Winston
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:28.520]  says no, 2 plus 2 equals 4 and he says no in the end buddy you won't be able to know
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.440]  what 2 plus 2 equals and then when you're done we're going to burn your body up and
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:35.640]  shoot you into the atmosphere and you never would have existed, you'll be erased out of
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.800]  everything and that's what Facebook and everybody else does, when this is true scientific
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.040]  tyranny, the elite going for all the marbles, the brass ring is life extension, merging
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.280]  on machines they believe and living forever being gods, I'm not saying that's what's
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.520]  going to happen, I'm saying from my own books and films I've made with their own quotes,
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.600]  that's their in game goal and of course I made in game 8 years ago, 9 years ago, the
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.280]  media made fun of it, now everything in in game is kind of in your face out in the
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.480]  open and it's just an amazing time to be alive, so when we come back I'll tell you this discussion
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:11.160]  with you guys for two more sections, bring in David, bring in Mr. Schneider and more
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.800]  but that's why it's more important than ever to spread the word about infowars.com and
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:21.120]  other alternative news sites that are telling the truth is we're in a humid human war against
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.880]  the rigged technocracy and humans can use computers and technology that we rewire and
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.160]  re-equip to get around their algorithms by always changing and always resisting, they
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.880]  count on us being pliant serfs, pliant cattle lying down, but if we're aware of the enemy
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.000]  operations resisting it like weightlifting or mountain climbing only makes us stronger,
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.440]  this is the battle of the human species, on this planetoid, ubering a standard sun, two
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.480]  thirds of the way out of the Milky Way galaxy, it's an epic fight, you're part of it, we're
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.640]  going to the stars, let's break the eugenesis and go to the next level, stay with us as
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:51:00.480]  they accelerate their global collapse to capture humanity and bring us into submission.

[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.720]  Michael Steinders with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:30.920]  I know they've got another very informative guest coming up here on the transmission today.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:40.320]  I was mentioning this article on infowars.com, UVA student, identifying as American is a microaggression.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:48.080]  I talked about two years ago with my children at Barton Springs on a very sunny summer day
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:52.880]  and there were people frolicking around two white guys and a Hispanic guy.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.920]  They said, man, this is really fun, blah, blah, blah, hey, let's go get some Chinese
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.920]  food.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:54:59.920]  The guy's like 10 feet away.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.080]  He's like, hey, let's get some Chinese food.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:07.360]  The two friends go, that's racist and they weren't joking because there's no language
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  now.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.640]  Just saying, hey, let's go to a Russian house in Austin, Texas.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.640]  I've never been there before.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  It's good food.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:18.640]  Oh, he said Russian or hey, let's go get some Mexican food, oh my God, Mexican food.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:23.880]  Just just even identifying male or female as being banned, he or she, it's hurtful.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.160]  You had language.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.600]  You made me upset and then it's all, oh my gosh, this is very, very, very serious.
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.040]  It's mind control.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:32.600]  It's bullying.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  It's completely out of control.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.720]  I've got another article that's up here on infowars.com that deals with this.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:43.520]  It orders dad to start treating his 11-year-old daughter as a boy.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.560]  The father not only wants his daughter to cease taking hormone blockers, but also to
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.320]  cease all contact with transgender activists or transgender friendly therapists.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:56.840]  What's happening is you send your kid to therapy at the school or now they're doing it in the
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.840]  kindergarten.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.840]  Obama's announce was in Politico two days ago and then the government comes and says,
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.840]  you might be a boy.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.840]  You might be a girl.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  You might be a nothing.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.080]  You might be a trans species.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.320]  You might be a dog.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:09.360]  You might be, you know, you're a five and a half foot tall, let's say black woman.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.880]  No, you're really a six foot, seven Chinese man.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:17.080]  I mean, this is just all the, because you don't get privacy or freedom or rights anymore.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.080]  That's all gone.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.720]  But you get to be an Easter Bunny where you get to have taxpayers pay for your abortion
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:24.720]  or to have your, you know, tallywacker cut off.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.000]  I mean, this is the stuff that's going on in this country and in this world.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.080]  The reason I dovetail this with all the engineered collapse news is they're not just collapsing
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.880]  the economy, but the society, the culture, and it's in their textbooks.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:36.880]  It's in their admissions.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:42.000]  It doesn't mean I hate someone because they're female and they like women, or it doesn't mean
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.200]  I hate somebody because they're a man.
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.200]  They're attracted to men.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.200]  That's always gone on.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:46.200]  Some of that's in history.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  Whatever.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200]  They're just people.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.040]  The point is, is that they just take culture that isn't induced of the overall species
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:55.720]  and force jacket into everything and now they're coming after the cash.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.680]  Now they're coming after the Amish and the, and the farmers markets and the local bartering
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:00.680]  and the swap meets.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.240]  They're going after normal human activity because they want to socially engineer us.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:08.200]  The globalists see us as wild humans running around, eating up the earth.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.520]  The globalists have stolen my fraud, which they believe belongs to them.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.680]  The truth is they're farming our intelligence.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.120]  They're farming our technologies.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.040]  They're parasites, but now they don't need us because the age of computers and robots.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.160]  You can argue there's too many people in some areas and we are destructive.
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:27.400]  The point is there's a giant breakaway civilization that's taken away those decisions and is also
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:28.960]  not doing good things in the environment.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.120]  The globalists are the most destructive with their open air chem trailing and their geo-engineering
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:38.480]  and their biological and chemical testing and their cross species garbage everywhere.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:43.400]  And so I've analyzed them folks and if there isn't a devil, there is now.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.280]  Ray Kurzweil always says, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.280]  I'm going to become God.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.280]  This is profound.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.600]  Ray Kurzweil says, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.600]  I'm going to become God.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.120]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.840]  If you were an atheist, you didn't believe in the devil before and I could have questioned
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.280]  it, you know, 20, 30 years ago myself, you look at this and pull back, man.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:04.200]  It's like a satanic spirit, a hive mind, whatever you want to call it.
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:09.800]  These people are the perfect description of Satan of the Bible, of all the aspects of
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:10.800]  it.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.400]  And I'm telling you, they come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.920]  Michael Steiner, David Knight, and we're going to break what are we going to cover
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.400]  in the next segment, Steiner?
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.680]  Well, we can talk about the secret meeting that was just held in New York where globalists
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:26.040]  are taking things to the next level where they're introducing digital cash where before
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.920]  we could transfer money out of our bank account that would end up in another bank account.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.520]  So now they're actually going to digitize cash, make cash into the, actually, the digits.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.720]  Exactly what you've always warned is coming next and it still makes it digital.
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:39.720]  All of it to be tracked.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.720]  Great point.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:41.720]  Tracking cash.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:42.720]  They're moving, folks.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:43.720]  They're moving on every front.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.720]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:53.280]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.120]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:00.800]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.880]  care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:09.480]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:12.760]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.880]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:18.720]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:23.040]  vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional

[01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:01.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:14.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:20.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:25.280]  We're doing a Facebook mentions while we do this live show and Buckley, my cousin here
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:30.960]  running this over at Buckley's house, is holding the headphones up so you can actually hear
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.960]  the intro.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.120]  I'm going to turn this over to Snyder and David Knight right now, but Snyder brings
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.800]  up, they're bringing in digital cash where it tracks its whole history from the mint to
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.000]  the bank to you where it went, this is the global control and some will say, well that's
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  good, it'll stop criminals.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.320]  It's the big banks launder the money.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.920]  They exempt themselves from all this.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.080]  This is to shut down barter economies.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:56.160]  This is to bring in total control for social engineering and oh, you'll get your welfare
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:00.200]  check, you've got to take vaccines or you can keep your job, but the TSA has to approve
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.200]  it.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.880]  And by the way, we caught you getting some cash that wasn't yours and you get a digital
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.880]  bill.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.240]  It's beyond license plate readers and things like that.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.440]  So folks, I'd always warned people about this 20 years ago and they'd say, oh, there's
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.720]  no license plate readers.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]  Now you know about it.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:16.480]  I'd warn you about the new tech going in cars, it's actually by the mile.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.040]  All that doesn't exist and now it's ubiquitous.
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.800]  What he was just talking about with the digital cash is what I've always warned you of and
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.800]  it's here.
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.360]  It's how they get rid of cash and it's a very serious, serious situation.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.040]  It's about total, total control and that's why we've got to vote with our dollars now
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.840]  because they're bringing in an actuary system, an algorithm where they're going to selectively
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:41.480]  tax and enforce with fines and fees and things against any independent system to where you
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.480]  can operate.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:53.480]  This is a total takeover that would make the Nazis just absolutely have a dream, a dream.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.760]  This is something that authoritarians have dreamed of.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:59.440]  It's here, it's called smart systems, it's called Gen 21.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.840]  So Mr. Schneider, you and David Knight takeover, but folks, buy our products, buy our videos,
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:04.840]  the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.840]  We've got the new special out with 40% off of swirable food on the four best sellers.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.080]  Had to end the special on all of it, but those are the four best sellers and know that we're
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.960]  going against the wind, against the enemy, but we're having victories.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.040]  Thanks for your prayers and your support guys.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.040]  Please continue.
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:19.040]  God bless you.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  I hope you're feeling better.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  Get well soon.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  We need you back here.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:24.040]  Let's go to Michael.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.480]  You were talking about just, you mentioned it to Alex, this article you just had about
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:33.320]  the meeting and of course we've seen this covered a Bloomberg actually covered this is not something
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.320]  that you're breaking.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.800]  This is mainstream news.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:39.760]  Tell us about this secret meeting where they're working on a new kind of blockchain that will
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.040]  allow them to control this without anonymity.
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.040]  Yeah.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:48.080]  Is this company, the name of the company is actually chain, which seems quite appropriate
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.320]  as in the chains of our enslavement, but it was held right in Times Square this meeting
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:57.080]  and that this new digital currency, which isn't tied to your bank account at all, the digits
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.520]  are actually the currency, the dollars.
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.400]  And the idea is that we're going to go entirely away from paper currency and to this digital
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.240]  digital dollars and it's going to replace Bitcoin, it's going to replace all these things.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:11.640]  But of course it's going to be controlled by the bankers, by the elite.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.000]  And so at this secret meeting in New York, which was covered by Bloomberg, there were
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.920]  more than a hundred prominent Wall Street banking executives there.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:24.160]  People like Citigroup, other major financial companies were there and this new technology
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.160]  was unveiled for them kind of in secret because they don't want to alarm the general public
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.480]  because of the, of course the general public's not in favor of a casteless society, but we're
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.960]  seeing this happen all over the world where, for example, in Sweden, the ATMs are being
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.000]  pulled out by the hundreds and almost everything is cashless at this point.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.760]  They're even handing out cashless readers to the homeless people on the street so they
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:49.000]  can take their donations or they can sell their newspapers and they can have people,
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.800]  you know, swipe their card or whatever, you know, in Denmark, the official policy of the
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:57.720]  government is to eradicate cash by the year 2030.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.160]  In Norway, the biggest bank in Norway has come out and called on the government there
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:05.680]  to completely eliminate all cash, even though Norway is almost completely cashless at this
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:06.680]  point.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.720]  You can see other countries in Europe where they're setting caps on how much cash you
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:15.880]  can use, you know, whether it's 1,000 euros, 2,500 euros, it varies from country to country
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:21.280]  where they're slowly outlawing cash by saying, okay, you can use cash, but only up to a certain
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  amount.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:27.480]  And of course now they're, you know, they're moving to get rid of the 500 euro note completely,
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:32.720]  you know, but we're seeing these movements toward a cashless society all over the world
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.600]  and governments really are excited about this idea because they can watch, track, monitor
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:40.920]  everything we do, our financial privacy will be essentially gone.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:46.240]  That's right, they're selling it as a way of cutting down on criminal activity and
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:49.040]  that's the way they're selling it in Sweden, there's a story we're going to cover later
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:54.120]  in the show out of Wired Magazine about how one swede will kill cash forever.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.720]  Thank you so much, Michael Snyder.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:00.480]  Stay with us, we're going to be talking to a bank whistleblower when we come right back.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:06.520]  A convicted robber who broke out of prison 48 years ago has finally been caught, reports
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.960]  Fox News.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.480]  Federal officials caught up with Robert Stackowitz, now 71 years old on Monday in Sherman, Connecticut.
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:19.160]  Stackowitz is being held in a Connecticut jail and is waiting to be transported to Georgia.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:25.480]  He had served two years of a 17-year sentence for robbery at Carroll County Prison Work Camp
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:31.640]  when he busted out back in 1968. Stackowitz, who escaped from the prison's infirmary, had
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:37.040]  been living in Sherman since at least July 1990, according to record viewed by the News
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.040]  Times.
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:43.200]  Sherman is a sparsely populated town and has one independent grocery store and a daycare
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.200]  center.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:49.680]  A U.S. Marshals Task Force recently uncovered a possible alias identity for Stackowitz leading
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:55.680]  investigators to Sherman. You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:07:13.160]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:17.280]  at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:20.920]  it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:25.160]  right there. I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.160]  kind of clears up.
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:31.680]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:36.360]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:39.320]  based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:42.240]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:47.120]  it without brain force. I went home about 6.45 this morning. I took three hours of sleep,
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:51.760]  set up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find brain force and other game
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:08:03.600]  changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:14.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:18.800]  Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host. We're going to be going to a bank whistleblower.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:24.120]  A whistleblower from HSBC. John Cruz in just a moment. I won't tell the people who are
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.280]  holding to talk. If you can hang on long enough, I'll get to you at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.160]  I apologize we haven't been able to get to you yet, but I'll take your calls later in
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:35.520]  the show if you can hang on.
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:41.400]  As we've talked about in the past, we've interviewed one other whistleblower from HSBC. And as
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:45.760]  I think one of the best articles I've seen on this is a very in-depth article from Matt
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:49.240]  Paibi, I think is the way he pronounces his name. The writer for Rolling Stones talking
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.080]  about how gangster bankers are too big to jail. He broke it down. He broke down the
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:58.640]  history of HSBC, pointing out it is, of course, the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. It got its start
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:06.920]  during drug wars, okay? It's not the drug wars of the 1800s. This was associated in
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:10.800]  1865. They were associated with the opium wars that were going on there within the
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.800]  British Empire. As Everett Stern pointed out, he was a part of the group that was hired
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:24.080]  the first time HSBC was convicted of money laundering to drug cartels, to foreign terrorists.
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:30.200]  And he pointed out a number of ways that they skirted that issue. We have joining us now
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:35.280]  John Cruz, who is also a whistleblower and his testimony. And of course, this has been
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.720]  followed quite a bit by Jerome Corsi. He's done a lot of interviews with John Cruz and
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:44.520]  introduced the subject. We're going to play an excerpt from an interview that Jerome
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:49.960]  Corsi had. But he blew the whistle on what was going on at HSBC, sent information to
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:56.160]  Loretta Lynch, who is now our Attorney General. She never called him back. She admitted that
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.520]  she had the information and she never did anything with it. And it became part of the
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.200]  confirmation hearings for Loretta Lynch. And then we found out after she became Attorney
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.920]  General that she let these guys get away with bank robbery again, because it is bank robbery
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:16.040]  when the banks rob us. Let's play a clip of the interview with Jerome Corsi and John
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.040]  Cruz.
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:27.360]  I was the Vice President, Senior Business Relationship Manager. Job involved in helping
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:33.840]  businesses manage their business life, manage their finances, manage their trade, manage
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:38.960]  transactions, wire transfers, checking accounts.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:42.280]  And John, you have written a book. Can you show us the book?
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.280]  Yes. World Banking, World Friday, Using Your Identity.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.280]  Great.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:52.600]  Thank you. And okay, so you recognize that these are papers that you provided me?
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:53.600]  Yes.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:57.520]  So these are papers that you pulled out of the bank's computer system, is that correct?
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:00.400]  They're right straight from the bank's computer system.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.160]  So you pulled these because you suspected they were fraudulent transactions, is that
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:06.160]  correct?
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:09.840]  I pulled these because I thought they were suspicious activities taking place and these
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:13.280]  same documents I brought to senior security within the bank.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:20.000]  John, you realize what you're saying is that bank employees, including bank security officers
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.320]  and fairly senior officers of the bank are involved in a pattern of illegal activities.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.320]  That's correct.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:32.960]  That's what I'm saying and that's what I've also recorded in my voice record is during
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.880]  meetings with managers with senior security.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.480]  I have hours upon hours of voice recordings.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:46.640]  All right, now you can see the rest of that report at his website, that's worldbankingworldfraud.com.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:47.640]  It's just a sample of that.
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:55.720]  And of course, John Cruz has been a vice president, a senior business relations manager for HSBC.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:00.400]  He blew the whistle on criminal money laundering and yet, of course, as we've seen multiple
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.040]  times now with not only HSBC but with many other large banks, they are too big to jail.
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.720]  They don't pull their charter, nobody goes to jail and they get a fine that is incredibly
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:11.720]  small.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:12.720]  Joining us now is John Cruz.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:14.520]  Thank you, John, for joining us.
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  Thank you for having me.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.440]  I want to get a little bit of an idea of what you saw there, but before we do, your testimony
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.440]  figured in prominently in the confirmation hearings of Loretta Lynch, who replaced Eric
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.680]  Holder as attorney general.
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:33.600]  And of course, we'd seen the Holder administration of the Department of Justice give a wrist
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.280]  slap to HSBC and others.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:41.480]  And then people questioned her on the information that you gave that Jerome Corsi published
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:43.600]  at WND.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:46.000]  And then this became part of our confirmation hearing.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.680]  When she was confirmed as attorney general, the very first thing she did, and this is
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:56.160]  a report from Corsi at WND, the very first major action she did as attorney general was
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:01.880]  to allow five big banks, Citibank, JP Morgan, Chase, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland,
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:07.160]  and UBS, to plead guilty to felony charges for manipulating the foreign exchange currency
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.160]  markets.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.560]  That's called Forex, for those of you who do this on a regular basis, and pay $6 million
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.560]  in fines.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.040]  Now, that may sound like a lot of money to people, but to put that in perspective, Corsi
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.360]  points out the Bank of International Settlement estimated the market is averaging $5.3 trillion
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:25.840]  in trading per day in April of 2013.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.400]  So to put this in perspective, let's say that you go in and you rob a bank, and you get
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.320]  a million dollars, and they catch you, and you get a fine of $1,000.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.600]  Are you going to keep doing that?
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:39.280]  Of course, you're going to keep doing it.
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:42.440]  And these banks keep doing it, and it gets even worse than that because it's like you
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.160]  were robbing people for a million dollars per day, and you get a one-time fee of $1,000.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.920]  Of course, they're going to keep doing this.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.480]  John, tell us what you saw there as a bank manager that you were blowing the whistle
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.480]  on.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:01.200]  What I saw is I saw many transactions taking place around the world.
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.560]  The bank was conducting the transactions using the public's identity, using their social
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:10.760]  security numbers, using their tax IDs for their corporations, and laundering money around
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:16.560]  the world for drugs, for terrorists, for paying off politicians.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  It's just trillions and trillions of dollars.
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.560]  Never mind billions.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:23.760]  It's trillions of dollars, and it goes on every day.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:29.480]  Now, how did you see this in your capacity as a bank relations manager?
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.600]  What type of indications did you get to see that this was going on?
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:40.000]  Whenever you see launch transactions, 100,000s, a million, 10 million, 800 million, you're
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.680]  supposed to file suspicious actuary reports to confirm these transactions.
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:51.320]  The bank would never file suspicious actuary reports when I reported to them, the executives.
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:53.080]  The executives would leave the accounts open.
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.640]  They say, yes, there are no entities to these accounts, but leave them open.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.200]  They're not doing nothing with them.
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:59.480]  They make money off these accounts.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.480]  Yeah.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:03.640]  And of course, we saw a similar thing happen when I talked to Everett Stern.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:07.440]  He was in the money laundering division that they created after they were caught the first
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  time.
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.920]  And there were key terms that they had in their database that would flag certain types of
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.320]  transactions out of these suspicious activities reports.
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.520]  And he noticed that these things were not getting flagged, and he looked at the database,
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.680]  and there would be like a space inserted in the name, or a period inserted to the name.
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.440]  So it was something that was very deliberate.
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.000]  They didn't want it to get flagged by the software, and now you're telling us that even
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.240]  when it was flagged, because it was such a large transaction, they would just pass this
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.240]  through.
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  That is correct.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.000]  But the idea was that they're using the public's identity under escrow accounts.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.840]  They create accounts that are called unidentified, and they're checking accounts, so they do
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:48.920]  not report them to the IRS.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:50.360]  They use them to transfer money.
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:54.200]  They'll keep them open for 30 days, transfer all the money around the world what they want
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:00.080]  to transfer an account, and then close it the day before it was open to eliminate transactions
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.480]  once the money has passed.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:02.480]  Wow.
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:07.640]  And of course, it occurs to me that when we see the massive open borders in this country
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:13.800]  and the people who are coming in, and that gives them a very plausible deniability for
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:18.280]  all of this, because they can say, hey, this is just somebody who came in, they're undocumented.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.880]  So we create these bogus accounts and everything, but you're pointing out, and it goes even
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:22.880]  beyond that.
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:30.160]  I mean, that's a very plausible thing for them to be able to hide this money deliberately.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.600]  But then they go ahead and they even delete these accounts prior to their creation date,
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.840]  so they disappear completely, just flesh them down the memory hole.
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:39.840]  Yes.
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:40.840]  Wow.
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  This is what they do.
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:42.840]  This is how they wipe out transactions.
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.360]  Once the money is done, the crime is committed, they eliminate the evidence.
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.080]  You know, I find that interesting because as we're just talking to Michael Schneider
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:54.320]  about the meeting that was held recently with all these major banks talking about how they
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:58.480]  want to move to digital cash, we're going to talk about this later in the program, an
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:03.840]  article from Wired Magazine about how a former band member from ABBA is trying to sell this
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:04.840]  in Sweden.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:09.280]  Of course, he's got a lot of street creds, I guess, in Sweden still.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.360]  I'm not a big ABBA fan, but there's a lot of people in Sweden, I guess, still are.
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:18.560]  But he's trying to portray this as cash being something that is strictly the black market.
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:23.080]  But what you're pointing out here is that this was all done electronically, and it becomes
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:29.200]  even more easy for criminals, especially the ones in the banks, to hide and to launder
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.080]  money if we have a cashless society, doesn't it?
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:34.080]  Yes, it does.
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:35.080]  It's totally correct.
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:37.280]  And the criminals own HSBC Bank.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:43.680]  Now, tell us what happened with your whistleblowing to Loretta Lynch, because we've had a whole
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:49.840]  series of articles at Jerome Corsi did about how you contacted her, she never replied any
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:55.280]  of this response, and then you gave this information to senators and they brought it up to her
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.120]  again at the confirmation hearing.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.280]  Tell us a little bit about that chronology.
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.800]  Well, sending everything over to the Department of Justice went over to Eric Holder, it went
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:08.080]  to Eric Holder and it went to Loretta Lynch.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.880]  Both did nothing, refused to do anything.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:17.880]  Now, I have documented and recorded conversations with law enforcement, with Congress officials,
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.880]  Senate's judiciary committee, and as you see my website, World Bank and World Fraud, there
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:25.280]  is a CD now with those recordings on it to the world so they can listen to what's going
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:26.280]  on.
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:31.880]  But they did nothing and they are actually, it feels like they're part of the crime of
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:38.280]  what's going on in voice recordings of executives at the bank saying we pay off government officials.
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:39.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.280]  They're part of it.
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:41.280]  Absolutely.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.120]  And that's a key part that we all need to understand, but it's important that we get this information
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  out in the public.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:49.480]  I mean, we can see for the longest time, you know that when they give them these small
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:54.920]  wrist slaps, when they ignore this, and as I point out, they can allow these people to
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:01.000]  rig a trillion-dollar markets, they can allow them to launder money to drug cartels and
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.400]  to terrorists, and yet Loretta Lynch gets all upset about the bathroom laws in North
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.400]  Carolina.
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:08.400]  That's what she's focused on.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:12.960]  She's not going to focus on the real crime, and of course, we have to lose all of our
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:13.960]  bill of rights.
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.400]  We have to lose all of our privacy for these same people that they tell us are the security
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:22.320]  threats, that are the danger to us, the drug cartels, the terrorists, and yet they are the
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:25.360]  ones who are financing and giving them that money.
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:30.440]  Now, besides seeing the bank accounts that they are establishing, transferring the money,
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.040]  and then disappearing that money, tell us what else you saw there as a whistleblower.
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:38.480]  Well, hang on, we've got to take a quick break, and we're going to come right back.
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.480]  I didn't realize we're that close to the break.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:46.160]  We're talking to John Cruz, who is a whistleblower who used to work for HSBC, and his website
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.360]  is worldbankingworldfraud.com.
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:52.040]  You can see the conversations that he recorded with law enforcement there, as well as find
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.560]  out the, find the book that he recorded all this, will be right back with more information
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.560]  from John Cruz.
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:00.560]  Stay with us.

[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:02.880]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:06.040]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:08.360]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.320]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:12.320]  His excuse?
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:13.520]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:15.120]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:09.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:13.320]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to a whistleblower from HSBC, John Cruz.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.360]  His testimony was given to senators.
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:19.520]  It was first ignored by the Department of Justice.
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:23.600]  They questioned Loretta Lynch during her confirmation hearings and she basically blew
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:29.320]  that off and, as it says on his bio here, John Cruz had two choices while he was working
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:30.320]  for the bank.
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:33.880]  He could either commit willful blindness, he could break federal law violating the Bank
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:39.320]  Secrecy Act, or he could refuse to be a part of the money laundering scheme and get fired.
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.920]  He chose the latter and you can read about his episodes at worldbankingworldfraud.com.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:49.440]  And as he pointed out in the last segment, he has recorded conversations with law enforcement
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:50.960]  and others.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:56.280]  It's very important for us to understand the depth of corruption that is involved not only
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.280]  in this administration, but in previous administrations as well.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:03.280]  You have to understand this is not simply an Obama administration problem.
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:10.920]  It is on steroids with the Obama administration and we've seen them catch these bankers red-handed
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:16.760]  and give them a slap on their wrist and let them go without any serious penalties.
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:21.200]  You have to understand that what is feeding all of this is the war on drugs and the war
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:22.200]  on terror.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:26.960]  It was created by the banks so they could make money and it creates power for the government.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:30.720]  And it's very important for us to understand what the whistleblowers, to listen to these
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:35.640]  whistleblowers, understand what they're telling us and take it very seriously.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.680]  Mr. Cruz, tell us again what you think we should take away from this.
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:46.280]  What are your concerns for society in terms of how do we correct this?
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:49.480]  How do we do something about this?
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.840]  My opinion, we need to vote out the individuals that are in office.
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:55.360]  The corrupt individuals, they need to go.
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.920]  We need people in office, new, fresh, that are here for the American people.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.720]  We do not need people in office collecting money from lobbyists, through money laundering,
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:05.440]  through terrorists, through drugs.
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.640]  I mean, no presidential campaign should be allowed to collect money from a terrorist
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.320]  organization whatsoever if you're totally illegal.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:12.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:13.320]  I agree.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:15.920]  Now, when you were blowing the whistle on this, did you find, of course, we know that
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:20.960]  you got shut down at the highest levels from Loretta Lynch, from the Department of Justice.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:25.640]  Did you find people at lower levels that wanted to expose this or wanted to work with you,
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:28.600]  or did you get shut down at that level as well?
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:31.400]  I got shut down at every level I went to.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  This is a high industry of money that's going around the world, and everyone's involved
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.400]  to make money.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.960]  That's the way it's all created, that's how the bank makes it.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:43.880]  So more money that transfers, the more money the employees make, the more money that Congress
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:46.480]  makes, the more money law enforcement makes off of it.
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.840]  It goes around and around, it's a huge circle.
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:49.840]  Wow.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:53.480]  And that's not a surprise either, because we look at civil asset forfeiture, this legal
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.520]  fiction by which they charge inanimate objects and just take your property without charging
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.520]  you with a crime.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:04.160]  And we see the federal government is training local and state law enforcement to be partners
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.040]  in crime with them, to turn into literal highway robbers saying, hey, we'll give you a cut
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:14.600]  of all this, and as people started to expose these abuses, as we started to see things
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.880]  at the state level reforms being enacted by state legislators, we saw the Obama administration,
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:22.920]  the Department of Justice kind of back down and say, well, we're going to pull back from
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:27.080]  some of this, we're not going to share this revenue with them to incentivize them.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.160]  Then it kind of died down, and now they have quietly reasserted the fact that they are
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.560]  now going to partner with these law enforcement agencies to give them a percentage of the
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:37.960]  money they steal from people on the highway.
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  That's what we're seeing there.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:42.520]  So it doesn't surprise me that you would find this at every single level and in difference
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:43.520]  to the corruption.
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:44.920]  That is correct.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:45.920]  Where is the money going?
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.400]  I mean, I have conversations on my recordings on World Bank and Ruff-Royd that the Republican
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:56.840]  party doesn't even know where the $1.9 billion that was collected from HSBC by the Obama
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:59.840]  administration directed under Loretta Lynch.
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:02.320]  No one knows where the money is in a Republican party.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:05.760]  Yeah, and they don't care either, because they want to be, they've been a part of this
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.120]  game in the past, and they want to be a part of it in the future.
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.760]  You would think that they would be pushing on this like they pushed on Benghazi or some
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.800]  other issues, and they don't bring those issues to a conclusion either.
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.240]  But you would think that they would push on this, but they want to keep this whole scam
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:22.240]  going.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.920]  I think one of the things people don't realize either is that these issues at the bottom of
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:30.680]  this, again, the drug issues, the drug cartels, this is something that was created by the
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.680]  United Nations.
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:36.400]  And you would expect that the Republicans would be concerned about this war on drugs
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.440]  that was a UN creation.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.840]  They created the schedules, they even populated it with the drugs 10 years before Richard
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:44.400]  Nixon got in there.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:49.520]  Is there any place in the world that you've seen the governments that are interested in
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:54.640]  trying to crack down on these banks, or all the governments co-opted in your opinion?
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.560]  My opinion, all the officials high up are all corrupt.
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:01.660]  There are certain individuals in government that are not corrupt that would like to change
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:02.660]  but they're outnumbered.
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:03.660]  Yeah.
[02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:06.160]  That seems to be the case everywhere we look, isn't it?
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:11.680]  We'll tell people how they can find out more information about your whistleblowing activities
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:13.560]  and see the documents that you've got.
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:19.400]  Well, the documents, the voice recordings are all world-breaking, worldfroid.com.
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.440]  You can get a copy of the CD, get a copy of the book.
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:23.440]  It's all there.
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:26.720]  These are actual live uncut recordings.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.480]  Individual names are there, the actual conversations, everything that's going on within the bank,
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:33.280]  within our world, within our government.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.880]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:39.120]  It's very, very important for people to see for themselves the corruption that you're
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.480]  telling us about.
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:41.480]  Thank you for doing that.
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:42.880]  Thank you for documenting it.
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:46.120]  It's one way that we have to wake up and you have to wake up your neighbors for this.
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:47.120]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.120]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:49.760]  Thank you so much, John Cruz.
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.040]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.440 --> 02:30:04.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network, nearly one in six young men inside the U.S. are either
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:08.200]  jobless or incarcerated, reports Breitbart News.
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:13.560]  According to the Congressional Budget Office, out of 38 million young men in the U.S. in
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:17.480]  2014, 16 percent were jobless or incarcerated.
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:22.720]  The share of young men without a job or in prison has increased substantially since the
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:27.680]  1980s, when just 11 percent of young men fit into either category.
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:32.920]  CBO highlights that the level of joblessness and incarceration varies based on young men's
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.440]  educational attainment.
[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:38.600]  The less they have, the more likely they are to be jobless or incarcerated.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:44.320]  Economic, policy, and skill set changes contributed to the large increase of joblessness and
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:47.400]  incarceration from 1980 to 2014.
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:53.440]  The increased incarceration rates, CBO added, is not necessarily due to an increase of crime,
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:55.640]  but again, policy decisions.
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:31:01.440]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.200]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:10.040]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:12.760]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:19.160]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:21.680]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:26.080]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:31.720]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:35.680]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:39.200]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:47.120]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:50.440]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:53.320]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:58.200]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.200]  with Anthroplex.

[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.960]  nutraceuticals.

[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:19.360]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:20.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:24.640]  I'm going to go to our colors, many of whom have been holding since we were talking to
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:26.600]  Michael Schneider in just a moment.
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:31.160]  Before we do, I've been promoting this Bill Corgan report that we had.
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:35.360]  He was here with an interview for Alex Jones, if you remember, but we had another interview
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:36.360]  that you haven't seen yet.
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:39.960]  It was done in our newly remodeled studio that we have for the infowars nightly news.
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:40.960]  Leanne McAdoo did it.
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:45.320]  We're going to be premiering this on Wednesday on the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:49.360]  It's going to be a 30-minute interview, and we wanted to give you a little bit of a trailer
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.240]  that we shot with Bill Corgan.
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:55.800]  He fleshes out the social justice warrior movement as they put it here.
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:56.800]  Why is it happening?
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:57.800]  How will it end?
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:01.640]  Here's a trailer for this interview that's coming up.
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:04.120]  Premiering this week on the Alex Jones show.
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:07.680]  I was propagandized as a kid to believe that everything America did was great.
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.280]  For news is ready-made propaganda.
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:13.000]  The world is a vampire.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.280]  And like a lot of people, as I got into the world in the 70s and 80s, I realized that
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:18.400]  wasn't true.
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.360]  But I do believe America is better than any other political and social system that's ever
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:23.960]  been created in the world.
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:27.600]  So I don't care what's your trendy argument, I don't care what's your hashtag argument
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:28.600]  is.
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.240]  If you do not stand for free speech, you do not stand for America.
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:33.400]  That means you want something else.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.320]  And if you think you're something else is going to be better than America, I'm here
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:37.320]  to tell you you're wrong.
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:41.240]  I can't believe we're even having this discussion, if you can understand why I say that to you
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:42.240]  humbly.
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:47.920]  To be talking in America in 2016, you know, about Mao's a good idea, and a socialist is
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.480]  running for president, and that's okay.
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.000]  I mean, that's just crazy to me.
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.720]  You know, obviously I listened to you and I listened to Alex, I listened to David Knight
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:55.720]  and Chakari.
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:00.360]  I mean, you guys do a fine job of identifying the factual root.
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.400]  And as I once told Alex, literally sitting in this exact spot, you don't always have
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:04.400]  to be right.
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:07.160]  You just have to have the right intention to want to get to the truth.
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:09.560]  As long as you want to get to the truth, and that's your intention, that's fine.
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:12.960]  But what I would say to you, and I say this very plainly to you, is that most people don't
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:15.440]  care about facts.
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:16.760]  Most people do not care about facts.
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:19.160]  I work in the entertainment business.
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:21.160]  People in the entertainment business do not care about facts.
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:23.720]  They only care about facts when it involves a gross.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:29.560]  And to be participating not only at the citizen level, but then also be a public person and
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:34.560]  be part of the zeitgeist at different times, to be used and abused positively and negatively
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:36.880]  within the systems that exist today.
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.560]  Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins.
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:40.920]  Homie Simpson, smiling politely.
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:43.560]  You know, my kids think you're the greatest.
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:48.960]  And thanks to your gloomy music, they finally stop dreaming of a future I can possibly provide.
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:55.360]  And see how my participation is a constant decision making between either my helping
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:59.240]  and my hurting, and my informing, or I'm actually enslaving.
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:05.720]  You don't see how you've been engineered and steered, and people are heavily invested
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:07.400]  in convincing you of something.
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:10.680]  We all know the advertising model.
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:15.080]  Women very much understand, from a very young age, you start being told, you've got to look
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:18.040]  like this, you've got to think like this, you've got to do this in your head, buh-buh-buh.
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:19.840]  Young men, it comes a little bit later.
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.200]  We all understand that, and we don't, it doesn't really bother us.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.280]  We like when a clever ad manipulates us to want us to buy a certain product or something.
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:32.200]  What we don't realize is, think about people who have trillions on the line getting you
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:37.360]  to believe a lie, or lean you a certain way so that they can achieve some end that's ten
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:40.080]  years down the road that you don't even have the read for.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:44.920]  How do we kind of see through that knowing of an evolutionary step that we as humans
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:45.920]  need to take?
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:49.440]  I mean, it's pretty remarkable that, like, literally, okay, I'm talking to you right,
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:52.120]  I could say a one word right now that would destroy my career.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:57.440]  I could use the wrong racial epithet, or say the wrong thing to you, or look down at the
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:01.760]  wrong part of your body and be castigated, and it's a meme, and I'm a horrible person.
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:04.320]  You have to start by separating the truth.
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:09.800]  I think admitting to yourself your own truth is always a good place to start.
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:15.280]  Rock star Billy Corgan on the fascist attacks on free speech, premiering this week on the
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:16.280]  Alex Jones show.
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:21.720]  And again, as you just heard in that interview, Billy Corgan, the Smashing Pumpkins, very
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:24.080]  wise, very articulate, very insightful.
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:26.080]  That is going to be a very interesting interview.
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:27.080]  That's a trailer for it.
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.520]  We're going to have the 30 minute interview is going to be aired live tomorrow on the
[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:33.120]  Alex Jones radio show.
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:34.120]  So don't miss it.
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.720]  Let's go back to our callers now who've been waiting for a long time, James in California.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:39.920]  James, thank you for holding.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:40.920]  Yeah, hi, David.
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  How's it going?
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:49.160]  I came across a video on YouTube as a recording of a new show that's on GCN Live.
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.280]  And I didn't catch the host's name, but he had a guest on, and I'll describe basically
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:57.360]  the best I can when he's talking about it, but basically what he's saying is that we
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:01.640]  are right now in double font secret martial law.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.480]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, I guess is the Army General, is really in charge.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:13.080]  And they raided the Federal Reserve Bank and shut it down completely.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.880]  And now they're going, or they have been, or starting to print goldback dollars in
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:20.480]  Reno, Nevada.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.240]  And yeah, I know it's kind of weird, but anyways, it kind of got me thinking, because
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.520]  the largest bull producing mine, commercial mine, is actually located in Northern Nevada.
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.760]  I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but I was wondering if you guys heard
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:36.600]  anything about this or if it's something you guys can look into.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:38.200]  Sure, we'll look into it.
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:39.760]  I don't have any information about that.
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:41.240]  I can't verify that.
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:43.360]  I'll tell you this.
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.720]  I would say that we are under martial law, and it's not any secret.
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:51.160]  I would say that we're under de facto martial law.
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:56.960]  How else could you describe the situations that we have, where we have to have the government
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.520]  put their hands all over our bodies for us to fly anywhere, or x-ray us, or make any
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:04.920]  of these unconstitutional demands, just as we're talking about civil asset forfeiture
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:10.080]  for three decades now, or four decades, we've had the government feels that they can stop
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:14.040]  you alongside the road and seizure property without charging you with a crime, let alone
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:15.040]  finding you guilty.
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:16.440]  I mean, isn't that martial law?
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.960]  I mean, how much more do they have to do to suspend the rule of law, to suspend trials?
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:27.280]  I mean, they create the FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was created
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.920]  because of abuses that were happening in the 1970s, that the church and Pike Committee
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:35.680]  hearings pointed out, so they create something that's going to keep that in check and yet
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:37.000]  still try to keep our secrets.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.320]  So they use that, they turn that into a star chamber that does dragnet surveillance on
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:43.320]  all Americans.
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:49.080]  I mean, it's big brother that they're applying to everybody here, and yet, for the people
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:51.920]  who aren't really paying attention to what they get as a brave new world.
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:54.480]  I would say that we are under martial law.
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.240]  I don't know what's happening with generals, I don't see any evidence of that personally,
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:00.320]  I haven't seen anything.
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.120]  I've heard a couple of reports of people talking about that, but quite frankly, they don't
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:09.120]  have to declare martial law, they're just getting us there step by step in a de facto
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:10.120]  process.
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:12.440]  That's what I see happening, James.
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.520]  Thank you so much for holding, and I want to get to some of these other callers while
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:16.960]  we still have time.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:19.200]  Let's go to Stephen in Alabama.
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:20.200]  Stephen.
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  Hello there, sir.
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:22.600]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.600]  Thank you.
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  Thank you for listening.
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:31.400]  The last three months, I've gotten a Ph.D., I feel like, but a few questions I wanted
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:38.040]  you to ask in learning and stuff, I'm a blue collar guy, I'm an electrician, father, work
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:44.320]  for a defense contractor, my mother is a Sunday school teacher, been doing it for 40 years,
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:52.600]  they're still together, but is Donald Trump, is there, I've never seen anything like this
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:41:01.760]  in my life, where, and me, I graduated from college, and political science, criminal justice,
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:08.040]  my girlfriend was murdered and I decided that's not the line of work I want to go in, they
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:14.120]  executed the guy, and I prayed for his family, and it's a tough day, it changed me.
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:15.120]  I understand.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.720]  God, what a change, what a change, Christopher Eugene Brooks.
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:26.200]  I talked about an experience in my family last night as we're looking at Barack Obama,
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.920]  saying that felons are new protected class as far as discrimination goes, so if you're
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:34.080]  a landlord, you can't discriminate against somebody who's a felon, my aunt and uncle
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:38.120]  were murdered by a felon that they didn't know he was a felon when they rented to him,
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:43.200]  he got way behind in his rent, they eventually, after about six months, they told him they
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:46.960]  were poor, they were living in the other side of the house, they said we have to evict him,
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:51.120]  you know, we have to evict you, we can't keep carrying you here, there was a small amount
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:55.440]  of money, he paid them and then came back and brutally murdered them, and when I look
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:00.840]  at Barack Obama saying that we can't discriminate against people who are felons moving into
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:06.680]  our home, I mean, quite frankly, this is the open border situation taken to your own front
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:12.840]  door, to your home, this is where the logical conclusion of this is, he's letting people
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:17.560]  who are illegals, terrorists coming across, drug cartels coming across the borders, he
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.480]  could care less about our safety, and if we want to protect the borders, then we are racist,
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:27.960]  and now he's telling you, if you don't rent your home, maybe the home that you live in,
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:31.480]  like my aunt and uncle, if you don't rent that home to someone who is a convicted felon,
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:38.560]  this guy was a rapist, then it became a double murder, then you are racist, no, they weren't
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.840]  racist at all, but I'm sorry, I just had to inject that.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:45.400]  What were you going to say about Donald Trump, of course, it is something we've never seen
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.840]  before, I've never seen the kind of enthusiasm for a presidential candidate that we see for
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.640]  Donald Trump, that's part of what I've never seen before, I've never seen the establishment
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:59.400]  uncloak and talk and show their true colors like they're showing their true colors now.
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:00.880]  What did you want to say about that, Stephen?
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:08.600]  I hope you have a second delay, I didn't mean to say that word, the D word, but I'd said
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:17.000]  a long time ago, I said this is going to uncloak, and what an analogy, you know the WWF World
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:23.040]  Wrestling Federation, where these guys pretend to get out in an arena and fight each other,
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:27.680]  but at the end of the day, my grandfather, I come from a family where there's only two
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:32.360]  divorces in six generations.
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:39.240]  And we're just good blue collar folks, I'm an electrician, and I'm up with the word for
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:40.240]  a different kind of track.
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.480]  So do you think that Trump is going to wake people up, do you think he's going to change
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.680]  things or do you think he's part of the WWE game?
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:52.560]  He's already done it, and here's something that I want to get out there.
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:44:00.800]  I remember back when I'm 48 years old, and I remember back during the Reagan years, the
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:05.880]  Reagan years, Reagan was, I think he was a true patriot.
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:12.600]  Yeah, but I think when he took over, I think he wanted to make peace with the establishment.
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.040]  He did it the first time when he challenged Gerald Ford in 1976, he reached out to Schweikert,
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:21.360]  I believe his guy's name if I remember correctly, who was part of the liberal establishment,
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:24.120]  that he'll be my VP choice if you guys let me be president.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.520]  He did the same thing again in 1980, and then nearly killed him for it.
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.040]  And then once he became president, even though he was not a member himself of the Council
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:37.480]  on Foreign Relations, he put 360 people in the CFR in the State Department.
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:43.000]  So we always have to be concerned that they don't sell out, that they don't get co-opted
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.880]  by the establishment system.
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:47.520]  And I hope that doesn't happen with Trump.
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:48.520]  Thank you, Stephen.
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:52.120]  Let's try to get some of these other people who've been holding for a long time as well.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:54.600]  Let's go to Jeff in Missouri.
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:55.600]  Jeff.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:58.040]  Hey, David, how are you, my friend?
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:44:59.040]  Doing good.
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.040]  Good.
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  I know you guys are short on time.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:05.120]  You guys absolutely really do continue to inspire.
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.600]  I've had actually a podcast that I've had Staff Sergeant Joe Biggon, which I'm so thankful
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:15.200]  for, actually have a new podcast called The Conspiracy Farm with USC Hall of Famer Pat
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.200]  Militich.
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:20.760]  He just had on Sean Stone, Peter Schiff the other day, like I said, you guys have lit
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.040]  the flame, I guess, of liberty and it's catching on, man.
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:25.040]  That's good.
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:26.040]  Another comment.
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:27.760]  I am absolutely dreading.
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.880]  My co-host Pat Militich fit me something on Facebook the other day that Dennis Miller
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:38.920]  had said about, not that he liked it, but the inevitability of a Hillary Clinton presidency.
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:43.880]  And I can't say enough to you, sir, how much I dread that prospect.
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:44.880]  What are your thoughts?
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:45.880]  I don't think it's inevitable.
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:47.960]  I mean, why do you think it's inevitable?
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:52.160]  Why did he think it was inevitable?
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:56.920]  An anomaly, we see historically what happens to anomalies because the machine just doesn't
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:57.920]  allow that to happen.
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:45:58.920]  Look what they're doing.
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.480]  The popular vote is saying, as far as on the Republican side, we want Donald Trump and
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:05.360]  they're just like, we don't care, they're going to usurp that.
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:10.400]  So if he does happen to get an office and put things into place that he wants to, I,
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.360]  like my co-host says, we're a bulletproof or something because they're going to, they
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.920]  don't only eliminate anomalies like this.
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:21.480]  Well, you know, we were told by everybody, all these experts have told us from the very
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.600]  beginning and they repeated the message week by week by week by week that Donald Trump
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:26.600]  was not going to last.
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:27.760]  He was going to get out.
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:32.760]  We were told that Jeb Bush was inevitable because he had $150 million in the bank with
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:34.360]  his super PACs that he had raised.
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.360]  So don't even bother, you know, that was a shock and awe campaign of Jeb Bush.
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:40.360]  Where did they go?
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:46.000]  I mean, you know, this has been an unprecedented campaign and he hasn't even started, hasn't
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.240]  even started on Hillary Clinton.
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:53.280]  I think the key thing that I'm, and when we go back and look at Reagan, for example,
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.560]  in 1980, in the spring, early summer, he was still 15 points behind.
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:46:59.680]  He was running against a seated president.
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.080]  Now Jimmy Carter was not a strong president.
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:06.000]  But nevertheless, that is a tremendous advantage.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.800]  Reagan was 15 points behind.
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:10.400]  Donald Trump is doing way better than that now.
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:13.040]  And he's doing way better than Mitt Romney did at this point.
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:18.080]  So I think at this point, he's willing to do things that the Republicans would not
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:19.080]  do.
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.260]  He's willing to expose the skeletons in Hillary Clinton's closet the way that they never
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:24.520]  expose them.
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:27.440]  And he is not going to shy away from doing any of that.
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:28.920]  I think he's going to be a very strong candidate.
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:31.080]  I think it's going to be an amazing race.
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:35.680]  And I think we're going to see a lot of curtains pull back a lot more than we've already seen.
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:40.880]  I think it's a great thing that we see Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney and all the Bushes as
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:46.600]  a matter of fact and not that they're going to boycott the nominating convention.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  Good.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  Good.
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:53.400]  Why don't you go and start a third party and let's let the American people take over
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:58.560]  the GOP or let's change the system so that we can have a rise of another party.
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.160]  I think that's an important thing to happen.
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:04.240]  But it's very important that we have somebody who has pushed back against political correctness
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:07.480]  that's caused him to fire all the triggers on the social justice warriors.
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:13.720]  They are beside themselves and it's going to simply be more of this type of thing happening.
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:18.280]  We're going to see more and more exposed and we're going to out the people definitively
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:20.920]  who have supported a globalist agenda.
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:23.600]  There is no difference at the top between the Republicans and Democrats.
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:27.640]  And we now see that as these people start to line up behind Hillary Clinton, the Wall
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.160]  Street people move behind them, the talking heads that supposedly represented conservatism
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:35.560]  who supposedly represented the GOP.
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:37.600]  They're now saying they will support Hillary Clinton.
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.080]  We know what their agenda is.
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:41.040]  It's globalism.
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:46.200]  Just as the last agenda was to get healthcare pushed through here in America, now they want
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:47.600]  these globalist treaties.
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:50.960]  They want the open borders and they want the climate treaties pushed through.
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.400]  Thank you so much, Jeff.
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.880]  Let's go quickly to Adam in California.
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:55.880]  Adam, go ahead.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:56.880]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:48:57.880]  Doing good.
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:03.520]  So I have a three-year-old millennial, actually I'm 28, but I've been dealing with computers,
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:06.560]  my whole life, programming, technology and things like that.
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:10.840]  And I've been listening to the show for about four weeks now and you're pretty much spot
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  on with everything.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.880]  But I've been waiting for a conversation about blockchain technology to come up and it came
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.600]  up today and that's why I'm making this call.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:23.520]  I know there are conversations about the banks potentially using this against us or
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:28.640]  centralizing a digital form of cash, but I don't think that can be done.
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:30.520]  And I'd like to provide an example.
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:36.800]  For example, we can use blockchain technology for presidential elections for casting a vote.
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.960]  Every transaction that's casted, we can create a blockchain that keeps tallies of a vote.
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:46.280]  The blockchain is managed by a network of nodes that all have their own copy of the
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:47.280]  database.
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:51.040]  I understand that and I agree with you about the blockchain and I've heard people talking
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:54.400]  about that in order to keep the elections honest.
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.720]  But just like you can have the elections themselves be honest and then the people who tabulate
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:00.680]  the votes could rig it.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.560]  What we're talking about is not the blockchain per se, but they're taking that blockchain
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:09.520]  technology, if I understand this correctly, they're taking that blockchain technology
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.080]  out of Bitcoin and putting it into something else.
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:17.920]  This is a company called Chain and they're working with the major banking companies and
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:22.360]  those banking companies are not going to protect your anonymity, okay?
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:26.840]  That could be the mechanism by which they do the cash exchanges so they could verify
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:31.520]  that it is going to be a legitimate exchange using blockchain technology.
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:37.240]  But this chain company, if I understand correctly, they're going to use this as their way of
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:44.000]  moving money digitally so that they can make anonymous cash a criminal.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.560]  And I think once they do that, they're going to move against anonymous things like Bitcoin
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:49.720]  as well.
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:51:18.000]  Stay with us, we're going to take a break and we'll be right back.
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.720]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:26.240]  A U.S. company named HarvestRite has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.920]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:31.200]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:36.080]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:38.000]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:42.240]  With a home freeze dryer from HarvestRite, you can literally freeze dry anything you
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:45.000]  eat, even things like ice cream.

[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:26.360]  the same time.

[02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:30.360]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, OctoFX, Nacinotide.
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:31.360]  Why?

[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:33.360]  Have they worked for you?
[02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:35.880]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:36.880]  What products are you taking?
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:37.880]  Are you taking?
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:43.320]  I'm a SuperMail to BrainForce, to Wintersun, X2.
[02:52:43.320 --> 02:52:48.320]  Even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Auto
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:49.320]  Built.
[02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:53.960]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.

[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:07.120]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:10.120]  to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:13.800]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:18.040]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:19.600]  I said, let me see.
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:24.400]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive
[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:29.560]  companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:31.120]  he had been quoted.
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:36.240]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:43.160]  and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:44.160]  How about you?
[02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:48.720]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:57.280]  That's 1-800-654-1632, 1-800-654-1632 or go to selectquote.com.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:14.280]  We shop, you save.
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:19.440]  Okay, yeah, we haven't lost our mind, we actually are playing abba music, okay?
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:24.160]  Because this is a song, Money Money Money, which fortunately I'd never heard before.
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:27.320]  It was featured in a wired story we're going to talk about in just a moment.
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:32.120]  Of course, we were just talking to Adam from California, we were talking about the Cashless
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:38.160]  Society, and we had this story on Wired Magazine yesterday about how one swede will kill cash
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:39.160]  forever.
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:42.920]  And of course, that's the guy who wrote that song you just heard.
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:48.200]  The guy from Abba, of course, he has a big following still in Sweden, even though most
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:53.040]  of you probably don't know them or wish you hadn't heard of them, we're going to talk
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:54.520]  about that story in just a moment.
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:58.280]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about a new special we have.
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:04.720]  You can get a Pro Pure Big or a Cane Unit, and we will give you a choice of one free
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:05.720]  gift.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:08.640]  You have two gifts, both about $70 in value that you can choose from.
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:12.840]  The first one is a Pro Pure Fruit Infused Water Pitcher.
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:17.960]  Now, it's got a container there for your fruit that you can mix together with your filtered
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:21.440]  water to flavor it with oranges, lemons, whatever you choose to do.
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:23.280]  It's a really clever invention.
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:29.080]  That's $70 in value, you get that for free if you buy a Pro Pure Big, that's the large
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:33.200]  countertop gravity-fed water filter, or a Cane Unit.
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:37.880]  Also, you can choose instead of if you want to get the other choice, instead of the Fruit
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.800]  Infused Water Pitcher, you can get a Pro Max Shower Filter, which reduces or removes over
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:48.040]  200 contaminants from your shower water, including things like heavy metal, VOCs, pesticides,
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:51.360]  fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, and odors.
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:55.960]  That's also a $70 value, so you can choose from one of those two things as a bonus free
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:59.680]  gift if you buy a Pro Pure Big or a Cane Unit.
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:04.520]  Also, on some of our best-selling InfoWare Select Storeable Food, we still have 30% to

[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:27.600]  is.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.120]  Even after you open this, for the short-term use, you can reseal it in Ziploc bags.
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:32.520]  It's great packaging.

[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.360]  there at infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:45.760]  Now, as I came in there with the story from ABBA, and there's the article from Wired Magazine,
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.760]  they began, and when we were talking to Michael Snyder, he was talking about the various Scandinavian
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:55.800]  countries that were pretty close to having a cashless society already, and how many other
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:00.800]  countries within Europe have put limitations on the amount of cash that you can take out
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:03.600]  at any given time, prohibiting all of that.
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:05.400]  Now, what's behind all this?
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:13.040]  Well, a good example and shows where they are already in Sweden is on April 22, 2013,
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:16.480]  when a bank robber goes into a bank, this is the way they began their story, and says,
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:21.040]  I want some cash, and they calmly explained to him that they couldn't do it, because that
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:26.480]  bank had absolutely no cash on the premises, and he said, well, where else can I go?
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.400]  And I guess the answer is to another country, because they're pushing pretty heavily towards
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:36.400]  a cashless society in Sweden, and it's become the campaign of one man.
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:42.040]  This guy who wrote that song in 1976, Money Money Money, his name is Ulveus, I guess if
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:50.160]  I'm pronouncing it correctly, Bjorn Ulveus, he began his war against cash, because his
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:55.640]  apartment complex, actually his son's apartment complex was broken into.
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.440]  They got kind of nervous about that feeling that somebody would be back, and yes, they
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:04.200]  did come back a few weeks later, they stole a bunch of stuff, and he said, I started thinking,
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:05.720]  they took these things, and what are they going to do?
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:08.800]  They're going to convert it into paper bills.
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:11.560]  What if there wasn't any paper money?
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:16.840]  So he began a crusade to get rid of cash, because, you know, cash is criminal.
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:19.560]  Well, no, not completely, okay?
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:21.240]  You can do it in other ways.
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:26.240]  Remember the interview we just had with the whistleblower from HSBC, it can actually facilitate
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:31.240]  things, criminal activities, if you have a cashless society, it facilitates things for
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:35.400]  the big criminals, and of course, it takes away your anonymity, and when we come back,
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:37.160]  I'm going to tell you why that's important.
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:44.160]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:07.160 --> 02:59:14.160]  I'm going to tell you why I'm going to tell you why I'm going to tell you why I'm going
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:44.160] , I'm going to tell you why I'm going to tell you why I'm going to tell you
[03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:13.740]  who I am.
[03:00:13.740 --> 03:00:15.920]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:24.920]  Broadcasting world wide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.540 --> 03:00:27.940]  Welcome back to the fourth hour, that was Alex Jones Jones and David Knight your host,
[03:00:27.940 --> 03:00:28.940]  and we'll continue to take your calls.
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:32.360]  I just wanted to finish up on this article about the cashless society.
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:36.980]  We have saw this on Wired magazine came out yesterday, and we were talking about the
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:41.940]  former band member of ABBA, who is in Sweden, of course,
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:45.020]  his argument after his apartment was robbed
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:46.500]  was very simple, they say.
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:48.420]  The criminal economy depends
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:51.900]  on the anonymous, untraceable nature of cash.
[03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:55.380]  Well, yes, that helps it, and they're going to find,
[03:00:55.380 --> 03:00:57.100]  this is kind of like the idea
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:01:00.380]  that you're going to stop violent crime by banning guns, okay?
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.980]  Yes, that can be used, but they'll find another way to do it.
[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:06.780]  If you ban cash, there are going to be means
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:09.620]  of exchange and storage of wealth
[03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:11.380]  that are going to continue to be anonymous,
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:13.460]  whether it's going to be the actual items themselves
[03:01:13.460 --> 03:01:14.820]  and some kind of a barter exchange,
[03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:17.700]  most likely it will continue to be Bitcoin
[03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:20.180]  or something like that, some kind of a digital currency.
[03:01:20.180 --> 03:01:22.260]  They want to control this, though.
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:25.220]  Now you see, with these bankers meeting in April
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:29.620]  and a secret meeting, talking about how they're going to use
[03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:31.300]  the product of this company called Chain,
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:36.100]  use a bit chain technology to create a digital cash society,
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:38.900]  they want to make sure that this is not anonymous.
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:41.260]  That's the key concern that is there.
[03:01:41.260 --> 03:01:42.860]  And that's one of the ways
[03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:45.340]  that you can avoid being controlled by the government.
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:48.540]  So that's why they want to take that away from you.
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:50.300]  They want to be able to track you
[03:01:50.300 --> 03:01:52.420]  and tax you with everything you do.
[03:01:52.420 --> 03:01:54.500]  And that means digital cash.
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:56.860]  That means driverless cars.
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:59.700]  That means a real information highway
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:00.900]  where they mandate boxes
[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:03.100]  and they're going to propose this later this year.
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:05.220]  This year, they're going to start mandated,
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:06.380]  they're going to come out with proposals
[03:02:06.380 --> 03:02:09.260]  to mandate vehicle-to-vehicle communication
[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:11.300]  and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
[03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:13.620]  So your car is going to be talking to the highways,
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:15.140]  it's going to be talking to the stoplights,
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:19.300]  it's going to be talking to the government about how you drive.
[03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:20.780]  And they are going to use that
[03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:24.500]  to make it too expensive for you to drive your own car.
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.020]  And then they're going to control everything that you do
[03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:28.100]  and follow everything that you do.
[03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:31.220]  That is what's driving the digital cash issue.
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:32.940]  It isn't going to stop crying.
[03:02:32.940 --> 03:02:36.380]  We just had an HSBC whistleblower telling us
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:39.900]  that the bank itself was creating fake accounts
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:42.180]  and then deleting those accounts down the memory hole.
[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:43.340]  It's even easier for them to do it
[03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:45.820]  than it is to move big bags of cash around.
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:47.140]  They can do it with the little bits
[03:02:47.140 --> 03:02:50.300]  and they, so it's not going to change the criminal action.
[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:52.580]  And it's not even something that is going to be more safe
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:54.020]  and more secure because look at this story
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:55.460]  from the Free Thought Project.
[03:02:55.460 --> 03:02:58.180]  Anonymous takes nine central banks offline
[03:02:58.180 --> 03:03:00.020]  and unleashes a massive assault
[03:03:00.020 --> 03:03:02.100]  on the global banking cartel.
[03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:04.140]  So you want to take our anonymity
[03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:07.300]  by taking our paper cash?
[03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:08.620]  Well, we still have Bitcoin
[03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:11.860]  and some of these hackers have pointed out
[03:03:11.860 --> 03:03:15.740]  that you are not secure even in the central banks.
[03:03:15.740 --> 03:03:17.620]  They say after a global called arms,
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:21.140]  the anonymous campaign against the global banking industry,
[03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:24.020]  up by carriers, I believe is what it was,
[03:03:24.020 --> 03:03:25.860]  seems to be gaining major momentum
[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:27.940]  as eight more financial institutions have been taken down
[03:03:27.940 --> 03:03:30.580]  after the initial attack on the central bank of Greece,
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:33.220]  followed by similar denial of service attacks
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:34.900]  on the central bank of Cyprus.
[03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:36.180]  I say there's a 30 day campaign
[03:03:36.180 --> 03:03:37.860]  against central bank sites across the world.
[03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:39.780]  Look, the bottom line is this.
[03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:41.660]  They can get all the personnel records
[03:03:42.660 --> 03:03:44.460]  of everybody that works for the government
[03:03:44.460 --> 03:03:46.860]  from the Pentagon to all these other bureaucracies
[03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:48.500]  and they can steal that information.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:50.180]  They can steal the digital cash.
[03:03:50.180 --> 03:03:52.540]  All you're doing is you're making it easier for criminals.
[03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:54.300]  You're making it easier for the government
[03:03:54.300 --> 03:03:58.860]  to control our lives by taking away physical cash
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:00.180]  and making this digital.
[03:04:00.180 --> 03:04:01.820]  But that's the whole point.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:04.700]  That's precisely what they want to do.
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:07.540]  Let's go back to our callers, Eddie and Arizona.
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:08.420]  Eddie, go ahead.
[03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:12.060]  Got about a minute before we got a bit of a break.
[03:04:12.060 --> 03:04:14.340]  Yep, I'll be very, very, very, very brief.
[03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:17.100]  The biggest bubble that they're pumping up is the live bubble
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.380]  and you guys are bursting that worldwide.
[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:23.500]  Trump, he's probably got about 11 million voters.
[03:04:23.500 --> 03:04:26.340]  I would give more, but if everyone gave $100
[03:04:26.340 --> 03:04:28.940]  with 11 million voters, that's 1.1 billion.
[03:04:28.940 --> 03:04:32.020]  He does not need the RNC.
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:34.820]  His VP selection needs to be a general
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:36.660]  that was fired by Obama.
[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:39.220]  Someone they are scared of to be president.
[03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:41.260]  It's like a life insurance policy.
[03:04:41.260 --> 03:04:42.660]  And one thing I want you to do
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:46.460]  is to look into Albert Pike and research this.
[03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:48.300]  He wrote this letter and I researched it,
[03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:50.700]  but I can't ascertain if it's 100% true,
[03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:54.100]  but it explains why the Muslim immigration's coming in.
[03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:55.940]  He was a guy, you know about him.
[03:04:55.940 --> 03:04:57.420]  He started to...
[03:04:57.420 --> 03:04:59.740]  Oh yeah, we've had John Bowne has done a couple of reports
[03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:00.580]  on Albert Pike.
[03:05:00.580 --> 03:05:01.900]  Thank you so much, Eddie. Stay with us, Carlos.
[03:05:01.900 --> 03:05:05.700]  He broke out of prison 48 years ago as finally been caught.
[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:07.540]  Reports, Fox News.
[03:05:07.540 --> 03:05:10.340]  Federal officials caught up with Robert Stackowitz,
[03:05:10.340 --> 03:05:13.780]  now 71 years old on Monday in Sherman, Connecticut.
[03:05:13.780 --> 03:05:16.540]  Stackowitz is being held in a Connecticut jail
[03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:18.980]  and is waiting to be transported to Georgia.
[03:05:18.980 --> 03:05:23.140]  He had served two years of a 17-year sentence for robbery
[03:05:23.140 --> 03:05:25.380]  at Carroll County Prison Work Camp
[03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:28.020]  when he busted out back in 1968.
[03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:31.300]  Stackowitz, who escaped from the prison's infirmary,
[03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:34.980]  had been living in Sherman since at least July 1990,
[03:05:34.980 --> 03:05:37.700]  according to record viewed by the News Times.
[03:05:37.700 --> 03:05:40.100]  Sherman is a sparsely populated town
[03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:42.260]  and has one independent grocery store
[03:05:42.260 --> 03:05:43.540]  and a daycare center.
[03:05:43.540 --> 03:05:46.580]  A U.S. Marshals Task Force recently uncovered
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:49.220]  a possible alias identity for Stackowitz,
[03:05:49.220 --> 03:05:51.380]  leading investigators to Sherman.

[03:07:01.140 --> 03:07:04.820]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:04.820 --> 03:07:07.660]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[03:07:07.660 --> 03:07:09.900]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[03:07:09.900 --> 03:07:12.620]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:12.620 --> 03:07:15.700]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[03:07:15.700 --> 03:07:18.140]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:21.260]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:21.260 --> 03:07:24.420]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons
[03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:25.620]  for quiet war.
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:28.140]  Pathanogens added to the food and water,
[03:07:28.140 --> 03:07:31.260]  and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:07:31.260 --> 03:07:35.460]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:35.460 --> 03:07:38.860]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[03:07:38.860 --> 03:07:44.140]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[03:07:44.140 --> 03:07:48.940]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:50.060]  inside the human body.
[03:07:50.060 --> 03:07:52.940]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:56.060]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands,
[03:07:56.060 --> 03:07:58.940]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:08:02.380 --> 03:08:04.980]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:04.980 --> 03:08:09.100]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines
[03:08:09.100 --> 03:08:10.180]  of the Info War.
[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:16.020]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:18.260]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to go back to your calls
[03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:19.740]  in just one moment.
[03:08:19.740 --> 03:08:22.420]  We've been talking about the cashless society,
[03:08:22.420 --> 03:08:25.580]  the driverless car society.
[03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:27.260]  We have open borders, and we're told
[03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:32.100]  that it's racist for us to get any documentation or evidence
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:34.620]  of people who are entering our country walking
[03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:35.460]  across the border.
[03:08:35.460 --> 03:08:36.900]  And yet, look at this information.
[03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:40.820]  It seems like we are capable of screening people coming
[03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:43.340]  into our country from some areas.
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:45.420]  That would be from Britain.
[03:08:45.420 --> 03:08:47.780]  We don't want any people coming here from Britain.
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:51.740]  There's a story that came out about a tourist.
[03:08:51.740 --> 03:08:54.500]  Now, since April 1st, they've had new airport rules,
[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:56.900]  meaning that British tourists who are coming to the United
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:02.180]  States need to have a biometric e-passport before they're
[03:09:02.180 --> 03:09:03.540]  allowed to fly the United States.
[03:09:03.540 --> 03:09:05.100]  So there was a story.
[03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:10.220]  Several UK papers picked this up about one individual.
[03:09:10.220 --> 03:09:13.380]  His name is Vic Ryan of Lincoln.
[03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:15.180]  He had booked all of his vacation.
[03:09:15.180 --> 03:09:17.940]  He had his reservations everywhere for his whole family
[03:09:17.940 --> 03:09:19.460]  to take a vacation.
[03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:21.660]  And then he finds out that he can't get on the plane
[03:09:21.660 --> 03:09:23.780]  because even though he's got a passport,
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.660]  he doesn't have a passport with all of his biometric
[03:09:26.660 --> 03:09:28.580]  identification on it.
[03:09:28.580 --> 03:09:32.900]  So they screen very carefully for people coming from Britain.
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:35.420]  Because they said, this is in response.
[03:09:35.420 --> 03:09:38.580]  This is the way they sell it, the papers, OK?
[03:09:38.580 --> 03:09:42.300]  They say, this is in response to the wake of recent terrorist
[03:09:42.300 --> 03:09:45.420]  attacks, like we've had in San Bernardino and Paris
[03:09:45.420 --> 03:09:45.980]  and so forth.
[03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:47.180]  It's like, really?
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:49.820]  I didn't realize that was a British tourist that
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:53.220]  was shooting people in San Bernardino and Paris.
[03:09:53.220 --> 03:09:53.740]  Oh, that's right.
[03:09:53.740 --> 03:09:54.740]  It wasn't.
[03:09:54.740 --> 03:09:56.500]  It was the Muslims that were not allowed
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:10:00.220]  to look at what's going on or figure out what's going on.
[03:10:00.220 --> 03:10:03.300]  But we're going to shut down travel from the UK
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:03.980]  for these people.
[03:10:03.980 --> 03:10:08.460]  Now, it's not just us doing it to the British.
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.780]  They're doing something else that I
[03:10:09.780 --> 03:10:13.020]  thought was kind of interesting to the Australians who have,
[03:10:13.020 --> 03:10:16.060]  as they put it, the dream of working in Britain.
[03:10:16.060 --> 03:10:18.420]  I mean, these are Australian dreamers.
[03:10:18.420 --> 03:10:22.460]  These are people who want to go to Britain to work.
[03:10:22.460 --> 03:10:24.500]  And they're told that unless they've
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:28.300]  got a job that makes $72,000 a year,
[03:10:28.300 --> 03:10:30.500]  they're not going to be allowed to stay in Britain.
[03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:31.500]  They're going to have to leave.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:32.700]  And that goes for Americans too.
[03:10:32.700 --> 03:10:36.180]  Any American dreamers who want to go to the UK and work there,
[03:10:36.180 --> 03:10:39.100]  they're going to be kicked out under new visa rules
[03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:43.220]  if they earn less than $72,000 a year.
[03:10:43.220 --> 03:10:46.940]  OK, so it looks to me like we've got some double standards
[03:10:46.940 --> 03:10:47.580]  going on here.
[03:10:47.580 --> 03:10:48.460]  Don't you think?
[03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:50.940]  This is for, they say, non-European workers.
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:52.540]  We'll have to make $72,000 a year.
[03:10:52.540 --> 03:10:54.340]  But it's not going to be, don't worry, don't worry.
[03:10:54.340 --> 03:10:57.420]  They're not going to kick out the migrants who
[03:10:57.420 --> 03:10:58.820]  are coming in from Islam.
[03:10:58.820 --> 03:11:00.580]  Because we don't want to do anything
[03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:05.140]  to stop Britain from becoming part of greater Arabia.
[03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:06.740]  That's not going to happen.
[03:11:06.740 --> 03:11:09.460]  Meanwhile, we see, and you might get the idea,
[03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:11.780]  that our government wants to replace us.
[03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:13.900]  When we go back, the stories that I covered yesterday
[03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:18.100]  about Vincent T. Fox plotting with Nancy Pelosi
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:20.820]  about how they can defeat Donald Trump,
[03:11:20.820 --> 03:11:23.420]  meeting for a half hour with a House minority leader who
[03:11:23.420 --> 03:11:24.660]  used to be Speaker of the House.
[03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:28.460]  And I'm sure she agrees totally with the Speaker of the House,
[03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:29.140]  Paul Ryan.
[03:11:29.140 --> 03:11:30.020]  Let's all stop Trump.
[03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:33.980]  So you've got Nancy Pelosi, Paul Rhino, and Vincent T.
[03:11:33.980 --> 03:11:35.700]  Fox, the former Mexican president.
[03:11:35.700 --> 03:11:36.780]  They all want to get rid of.
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:38.660]  They all want to stop Donald Trump.
[03:11:38.660 --> 03:11:41.220]  He's looking better all the time, isn't he?
[03:11:41.220 --> 03:11:43.660]  And at the same time, we say that illegal immigrants
[03:11:43.660 --> 03:11:45.940]  get $1,200 more welfare than American families.
[03:11:45.940 --> 03:11:49.180]  They get a couple thousand dollars more than Social Security
[03:11:49.180 --> 03:11:52.820]  retirees who paid into this system their entire life.
[03:11:52.820 --> 03:11:55.700]  And of course, the dreamers who come here don't get thrown out.
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:59.140]  They get a free college tuition and free schooling
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:01.860]  that is paid for by your property taxes.
[03:12:01.860 --> 03:12:05.940]  So they're essentially coming here to take your home.
[03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:07.260]  Because at some point, you're not
[03:12:07.260 --> 03:12:10.940]  going to be able to afford to pay for the education of everybody
[03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:13.180]  in the world who wants to come to America
[03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:17.740]  and be educated at your expense in the language of their choice.
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:19.500]  That's what we're really talking about here.
[03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:22.020]  Let's go back to our callers, Bill, in Florida.
[03:12:22.020 --> 03:12:24.660]  Go ahead, Bill.
[03:12:24.660 --> 03:12:25.980]  Hey, David.
[03:12:25.980 --> 03:12:27.820]  Yeah, I just wanted to make sure there's some.
[03:12:27.820 --> 03:12:29.380]  I just wanted to make a statement really.
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:31.620]  Someone called in earlier.
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:35.260]  It's an inevitable Clinton presidency.
[03:12:35.260 --> 03:12:37.460]  But we can prevent that.
[03:12:37.460 --> 03:12:39.980]  Everybody has to do their own exit polling.
[03:12:39.980 --> 03:12:42.300]  And you should never believe the mainstream media who's
[03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:43.740]  doing all the polling now.
[03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:45.300]  They tried it with Trump.
[03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:48.420]  They tried to get out and tell Trump's losing, Trump's behind.
[03:12:48.420 --> 03:12:50.060]  And then when he started winning everything,
[03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:52.780]  then they had to submit and say, oh,
[03:12:52.780 --> 03:12:55.020]  looks like Trump might actually be leading.
[03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:58.580]  And as long as you sit there, just give people a piece of paper
[03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:01.620]  and a pencil with your YouTube channel on it.
[03:13:01.620 --> 03:13:04.660]  And say, tune in if you want to see our results.
[03:13:04.660 --> 03:13:05.260]  That's right.
[03:13:05.260 --> 03:13:05.820]  I agree with you.
[03:13:05.820 --> 03:13:07.620]  I think the exit polls are very important.
[03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:08.980]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:11.260]  They do exit polls, but the mainstream media
[03:13:11.260 --> 03:13:12.340]  will break the exit polls now.
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:14.740]  They won't say, well, we got this many for candidate A,
[03:13:14.740 --> 03:13:17.820]  this many for candidate B. What they'll tell you is,
[03:13:17.820 --> 03:13:21.460]  they say, well, women supported candidate A,
[03:13:21.460 --> 03:13:23.300]  or men supported candidate B, or what?
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:24.820]  They'll break it down demographically,
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:28.620]  but they won't tell you the actual results for candidate A
[03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:30.660]  and B because they don't want people
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:33.020]  to question the official results.
[03:13:33.020 --> 03:13:34.100]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:35.220]  Don't you find that interesting?
[03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:36.940]  We have all these polls leading up to it.
[03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:39.380]  Boy, they'd live and die by the poll, OK?
[03:13:39.380 --> 03:13:42.620]  We've got a gazillion polls, and they're all over the place.
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:49.780]  We're told that they've all got an margin of error of 4% or 5%.
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:52.580]  And yet, they're way different from each other
[03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:54.300]  in those margin of errors.
[03:13:54.300 --> 03:13:56.380]  Nevertheless, they don't do any polls
[03:13:56.380 --> 03:13:58.140]  and compare them to the actual results,
[03:13:58.140 --> 03:13:59.300]  even on a few precincts.
[03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:00.420]  And what you're talking about, I think,
[03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:02.300]  would be a very important thing for citizens
[03:14:02.300 --> 03:14:03.940]  to do to actually monitor this.
[03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:05.940]  Just select a couple of precincts
[03:14:05.940 --> 03:14:08.020]  and ask everybody coming out.
[03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:09.900]  Will you tell me who you voted for or whatever?
[03:14:09.900 --> 03:14:11.220]  And you could get a pretty good idea
[03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:13.380]  if they're rigging things at that precinct.
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:14.740]  They don't do that.
[03:14:14.740 --> 03:14:18.180]  And when I talked earlier about the election rigging that
[03:14:18.180 --> 03:14:21.020]  happened down in Brazil, they had a lot of electronic voting
[03:14:21.020 --> 03:14:22.300]  machines there.
[03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:25.300]  Going into that election, the female president
[03:14:25.300 --> 03:14:27.740]  that they're trying to impeach, the socialist Marxist
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:29.380]  that's down there, totally corrupt,
[03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:32.900]  they're trying to impeach her out of the presidency.
[03:14:32.900 --> 03:14:35.580]  And she was down 10% in the polls the day before.
[03:14:35.580 --> 03:14:39.300]  She went to a soccer game, had a stadium of 65,000 people
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:40.020]  boo her.
[03:14:40.020 --> 03:14:43.220]  And yet, the next day, she was ahead by 10%.
[03:14:43.220 --> 03:14:46.380]  And the company that typically did the exit polls
[03:14:46.380 --> 03:14:47.780]  didn't do any exit polls.
[03:14:47.780 --> 03:14:49.700]  That was a very telling thing as well.
[03:14:49.700 --> 03:14:53.340]  But they did get a large government contract shortly
[03:14:53.340 --> 03:14:54.900]  after that to do some other things.
[03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:56.140]  It was their payoff.
[03:14:56.140 --> 03:14:59.140]  And that's what everybody said it was at the time.
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:01.020]  Any other comments on how you think people can
[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:03.820]  keep this situation honest?
[03:15:03.820 --> 03:15:06.700]  No, no, I was just going to say, just film it and then
[03:15:06.700 --> 03:15:08.980]  put it on a YouTube channel.
[03:15:08.980 --> 03:15:11.460]  Just put it up there.
[03:15:11.460 --> 03:15:13.620]  And you said that before, how they always tell you,
[03:15:13.620 --> 03:15:16.380]  oh, there's so many people voted about the economy and this
[03:15:16.380 --> 03:15:16.980]  and that.
[03:15:16.980 --> 03:15:19.020]  But like you said, they never tell you
[03:15:19.020 --> 03:15:21.820]  who's leading, how many votes this person got in the exit
[03:15:21.820 --> 03:15:23.700]  polling, nothing like that.
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:26.300]  But if you record the whole thing and just put it on YouTube,
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:28.580]  it'll be right there for the lion thieves
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:33.620]  to have to the known liars that nobody trusts.
[03:15:33.620 --> 03:15:36.260]  So we've said even before the Trump phenomenon,
[03:15:36.260 --> 03:15:39.620]  we said, if people, we understand that there's
[03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:41.420]  multiple ways that you can rig the votes.
[03:15:41.420 --> 03:15:43.420]  You can have bogus voters.
[03:15:43.420 --> 03:15:45.260]  You can have, because of extended the times,
[03:15:45.260 --> 03:15:47.380]  people can vote multiple times.
[03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:49.900]  They can mess with the count, with the totals.
[03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:50.780]  We've seen that happen.
[03:15:50.780 --> 03:15:53.140]  We saw that happen with the Ron Paul situation
[03:15:53.140 --> 03:15:54.500]  when they phoned in the vote totals.
[03:15:54.500 --> 03:15:56.340]  We saw them flipping and switching stuff with that.
[03:15:56.340 --> 03:15:58.980]  So there's multiple ways that they can rig it at every level.
[03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:01.420]  And of course, voting machines are a big part of that.
[03:16:01.420 --> 03:16:04.700]  But I think at some point, if you show up in mass,
[03:16:04.700 --> 03:16:07.060]  and I think this is what's been happening with Donald Trump,
[03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:09.380]  people showing up in mass in such large numbers
[03:16:09.380 --> 03:16:11.420]  that they kind of back down and say, well,
[03:16:11.420 --> 03:16:14.140]  we'll try to take him down in another way.
[03:16:14.140 --> 03:16:16.460]  Maybe we'll try to co-op him after the election,
[03:16:16.460 --> 03:16:18.420]  or maybe we'll try to make an alliance with him
[03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:19.780]  during the election or whatever.
[03:16:19.780 --> 03:16:21.660]  They'll come at him from a different direction
[03:16:21.660 --> 03:16:22.660]  other than this.
[03:16:22.660 --> 03:16:23.980]  And I think that's very important.
[03:16:23.980 --> 03:16:25.620]  And I think it's important for us to show up.
[03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:28.700]  We have an article here that the radio crew gave me.
[03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:31.020]  Business Insider is reporting Ted Cruz
[03:16:31.020 --> 03:16:32.580]  doesn't endorse Donald Trump.
[03:16:32.580 --> 03:16:34.700]  But he tells Glenn Beck, his good buddy,
[03:16:34.700 --> 03:16:36.820]  that he won't rule out jumping back in
[03:16:36.820 --> 03:16:40.260]  if he sees, quote, a path to victory.
[03:16:40.260 --> 03:16:41.900]  Because he just suspended his campaign.
[03:16:41.900 --> 03:16:42.820]  He didn't end it.
[03:16:42.820 --> 03:16:43.660]  That's what they all say.
[03:16:43.660 --> 03:16:46.060]  They all say they're suspending their campaign.
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:48.620]  So if he sees a path to victory,
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:51.940]  slippery Ted is gonna slip right back in.
[03:16:51.940 --> 03:16:53.380]  And that's why I think it's very important for,
[03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:55.060]  if you live in West Virginia,
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:56.540]  you're listening to this broadcast,
[03:16:56.540 --> 03:16:57.780]  you need to show up to the polls.
[03:16:57.780 --> 03:17:02.260]  I don't understand why Donald Trump would go to West Virginia.
[03:17:02.260 --> 03:17:04.060]  And he has a massive rally there.
[03:17:04.060 --> 03:17:05.740]  And he's telling the people how he supports them,
[03:17:05.740 --> 03:17:07.780]  supports their economy.
[03:17:07.780 --> 03:17:10.700]  And yet he says, don't worry about it.
[03:17:10.700 --> 03:17:12.740]  You don't need to come to vote in the primary.
[03:17:12.740 --> 03:17:13.740]  We've got it all sewn up.
[03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:15.620]  Save your vote for the general election.
[03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:18.100]  Look, you don't lose your vote if you vote in the primary.
[03:17:18.100 --> 03:17:20.100]  You still get to vote again in the general election.
[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:24.340]  He's not at the magic 1237 number yet.
[03:17:24.340 --> 03:17:26.420]  And I think that if you're in West Virginia,
[03:17:26.420 --> 03:17:28.660]  you need to show up and vote there
[03:17:28.660 --> 03:17:31.180]  because it ain't over till it's over, folks.
[03:17:31.180 --> 03:17:32.020]  And it's not over.
[03:17:32.020 --> 03:17:33.660]  He doesn't have the 1237 yet.
[03:17:33.660 --> 03:17:35.700]  Should not get overconfident about that.
[03:17:35.700 --> 03:17:37.500]  And I think that's a big mistake to do that.
[03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:40.700]  Let's go to HB and FEMA region four.
[03:17:40.700 --> 03:17:41.540]  Go ahead, HB.
[03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:44.980]  Yeah, David, good job.
[03:17:44.980 --> 03:17:45.820]  Thank you.
[03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:46.660]  Go ahead.
[03:17:46.660 --> 03:17:47.500]  Am I on?
[03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:48.340]  Yes, you're on.
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:49.180]  There we go.
[03:17:49.180 --> 03:17:51.540]  I just, I can't understand.
[03:17:51.540 --> 03:17:52.860]  I don't think that we're,
[03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:55.220]  he's gonna get in because of the electronic voting machines.
[03:17:55.220 --> 03:17:57.940]  They're gonna portray Hillary as being,
[03:17:57.940 --> 03:18:00.660]  it's gonna be a neck and neck 50-50 with them.
[03:18:00.660 --> 03:18:02.300]  And then she's just gonna get it
[03:18:02.300 --> 03:18:05.660]  when everybody goes to vote, no matter how we vote.
[03:18:05.660 --> 03:18:06.580]  Yeah, it's gonna have to,
[03:18:06.580 --> 03:18:09.340]  I think if you've got a close race like that, they'll flip it.
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:13.540]  That's the easiest way for them to adjust the election
[03:18:13.540 --> 03:18:14.900]  to the outcome that they want.
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:17.380]  If you have to have people show up
[03:18:17.380 --> 03:18:19.700]  in massive numbers for them not to flip it.
[03:18:19.700 --> 03:18:22.900]  And it's very easy for them to do it with the voting machines.
[03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:26.900]  I mean, that's why we wanna go back to the simple paper ballots.
[03:18:26.900 --> 03:18:30.740]  If anything, just have everybody vote on the same day,
[03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:31.860]  paint your thumb purple.
[03:18:31.860 --> 03:18:33.660]  That's the way the US government did it
[03:18:33.660 --> 03:18:35.340]  when they wanted honest elections in Iraq.
[03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:37.460]  They know how to have honest elections
[03:18:37.460 --> 03:18:39.580]  and they know how to rig the elections.
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:41.460]  And they can do it however they wish.
[03:18:41.460 --> 03:18:43.900]  And that is just one of the ways that they rig the election.
[03:18:43.900 --> 03:18:45.380]  So yeah, I agree with you.
[03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:47.620]  If it's a close scenario,
[03:18:47.620 --> 03:18:50.020]  I think they will flip it using the voting machines.
[03:18:50.020 --> 03:18:53.580]  It's a very easy way for them to rig the elections.
[03:18:53.580 --> 03:18:56.460]  Can I say one thing that's not on target, on subject?
[03:18:56.460 --> 03:18:57.340]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:18:57.340 --> 03:19:02.740]  It's about the globalist long-term infrastructure plans for America.
[03:19:02.740 --> 03:19:05.100]  They got these 20, 30-year infrastructure plans
[03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:07.300]  building highways and pipelines everywhere.
[03:19:07.300 --> 03:19:10.380]  It doesn't seem like collapse is imminent.
[03:19:10.380 --> 03:19:11.660]  Well, that's true.
[03:19:11.660 --> 03:19:14.300]  I don't, it's a very long-term plan.
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:17.060]  And I think they're going to continue going down that path.
[03:19:17.060 --> 03:19:18.380]  But we'll just have to see.
[03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:20.260]  This election I think is fundamentally
[03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:22.460]  about nationalism versus globalism.
[03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:24.020]  I think people are starting to realize that.
[03:19:24.020 --> 03:19:25.900]  They're starting to realize that's a real issue.
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:27.220]  You can talk about civil liberties.
[03:19:27.220 --> 03:19:28.380]  You can talk about a lot of different things,
[03:19:28.380 --> 03:19:31.860]  but you're not going to have a bill of rights.
[03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:32.940]  You're not going to have a constitution.
[03:19:32.940 --> 03:19:34.340]  You're not going to have a country
[03:19:34.340 --> 03:19:38.940]  unless you win this war about globalism versus nationalism.
[03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:40.380]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[03:19:40.380 --> 03:19:43.020]  I see one person there disagrees with me on Donald Trump.
[03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:45.260]  So we'll take them right away.
[03:19:45.260 --> 03:19:47.260]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[03:19:47.260 --> 03:20:06.860]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story
[03:20:06.860 --> 03:20:09.580]  of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life
[03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:10.940]  insurance.
[03:20:10.940 --> 03:20:14.540]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:16.500]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote
[03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:18.940]  another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:18.940 --> 03:20:20.820]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:20.820 --> 03:20:22.780]  Well, I took his pertinent information,
[03:20:22.780 --> 03:20:25.780]  then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies
[03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:28.700]  we represent, and found one who pre-approved him
[03:20:28.700 --> 03:20:31.860]  for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:34.180]  When it comes to term life insurance,
[03:20:34.180 --> 03:20:37.140]  no other company touches select quotes, experience,
[03:20:37.140 --> 03:20:42.100]  and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price
[03:20:42.100 --> 03:20:43.900]  for almost anyone.
[03:20:43.900 --> 03:20:44.900]  How about you?

[03:20:49.420 --> 03:20:52.980]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:52.980 --> 03:20:56.220]  1-800-654-1632.

[03:20:58.060 --> 03:20:58.940]  We shop.
[03:20:58.940 --> 03:21:00.620]  You save.
[03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:02.900]  Are you concerned about the power grid?
[03:21:02.900 --> 03:21:05.340]  About the new war on the power grid?
[03:21:05.340 --> 03:21:08.460]  If so, this will be the most important radio message
[03:21:08.460 --> 03:21:10.900]  you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:11.900]  Here's why.
[03:21:11.900 --> 03:21:15.420]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities
[03:21:15.420 --> 03:21:17.420]  of the power grid has just been written.
[03:21:17.420 --> 03:21:20.140]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away
[03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:23.180]  several free copies, but only for a limited time
[03:21:23.180 --> 03:21:24.900]  to GCN listeners.
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:28.300]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping
[03:21:28.300 --> 03:21:29.500]  and handling cost.
[03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:33.100]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today,
[03:21:33.100 --> 03:21:35.340]  he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[03:21:35.340 --> 03:21:36.260]  Why do this?
[03:21:36.260 --> 03:21:38.580]  Why would he spend extra money and all that
[03:21:38.580 --> 03:21:40.140]  bothered to FedEx his new book?
[03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:41.420]  The answer is simple.
[03:21:41.420 --> 03:21:43.700]  America's power grid is in grave danger,
[03:21:43.700 --> 03:21:45.620]  and most Americans are clueless.
[03:21:45.620 --> 03:21:48.020]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes,
[03:21:48.020 --> 03:21:51.020]  and why the most common question this author gets is,
[03:21:51.020 --> 03:21:52.460]  do you fear for your life?
[03:21:52.460 --> 03:21:54.780]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[03:21:54.780 --> 03:21:56.860]  That's waronthegrid.com.

[03:22:00.060 --> 03:22:01.620]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:03.500]  I'm a former 22-year congressman
[03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:05.780]  and Republican presidential candidate.
[03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:07.380]  I'm here to tell you about something
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:09.500]  that just might save your lives.
[03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:11.820]  You never know when there will be another Katrina,
[03:22:11.820 --> 03:22:14.340]  an economic collapse, or a serious drought.
[03:22:14.340 --> 03:22:16.020]  We should all have a little food storage
[03:22:16.020 --> 03:22:18.020]  that will carry us through tough times.
[03:22:18.020 --> 03:22:20.820]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[03:22:20.820 --> 03:22:22.860]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right
[03:22:22.860 --> 03:22:26.140]  has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:22:26.140 --> 03:22:27.820]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[03:22:27.820 --> 03:22:31.060]  With the product, you can preserve the food your family loves.
[03:22:31.060 --> 03:22:34.380]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years
[03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:36.180]  and still taste great.
[03:22:36.180 --> 03:22:37.900]  I've tried it, and it's amazing.
[03:22:37.900 --> 03:22:40.100]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right,
[03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:42.980]  you can literally freeze dry anything you eat,
[03:22:42.980 --> 03:22:44.940]  even things like ice cream.

[03:22:59.660 --> 03:23:01.020]  Paid non-attorney spokesperson,
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:03.100]  talcum powder justice with principal office in California
[03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:04.700]  is responsible for the content of this ad.
[03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:06.460]  Attention women, new evidence shows
[03:23:06.460 --> 03:23:08.820]  that talcum powder products such as Johnson & Johnson's
[03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:10.620]  baby powder and shower to shower
[03:23:10.620 --> 03:23:12.500]  may cause ovarian cancer.
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:14.460]  If you or a loved one use talcum powder
[03:23:14.460 --> 03:23:16.300]  and were diagnosed with ovarian cancer,
[03:23:16.300 --> 03:23:19.100]  call 1-800-323-1929.
[03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:20.580]  Right now, you may be entitled
[03:23:20.580 --> 03:23:22.380]  to significant cash compensation.
[03:23:22.380 --> 03:23:24.140]  Recently, Johnson & Johnson was ordered
[03:23:24.140 --> 03:23:26.700]  to pay $72 million in damages
[03:23:26.700 --> 03:23:28.740]  to the family of a woman who died of cancer
[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:31.140]  she said was caused by the company's talcum powder.
[03:23:31.140 --> 03:23:33.140]  The jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew
[03:23:33.140 --> 03:23:34.740]  that these products could cause cancer
[03:23:34.740 --> 03:23:36.500]  and failed to warn consumers.
[03:23:36.500 --> 03:23:38.300]  If you or a loved one use talcum powder
[03:23:38.300 --> 03:23:40.100]  and were diagnosed with ovarian cancer,
[03:23:40.100 --> 03:23:42.820]  call 1-800-323-1929.
[03:23:42.820 --> 03:23:44.940]  You may be entitled to cash compensation.
[03:23:44.940 --> 03:23:45.820]  Time is limited.
[03:23:45.820 --> 03:23:48.580]  Call 1-800-323-1929.
[03:23:48.580 --> 03:23:50.940]  Our toll-free phone lines are open 24-7.
[03:23:50.940 --> 03:23:53.740]  Call 1-800-323-1929.

[03:23:56.700 --> 03:23:59.340]  1-800-323-1929.
[03:24:00.300 --> 03:24:02.300]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[03:24:02.300 --> 03:24:04.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:04.300 --> 03:24:06.300]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this hour,
[03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:08.300]  and we're taking your calls.
[03:24:08.300 --> 03:24:10.300]  That number is 800-259-9231.
[03:24:10.300 --> 03:24:14.300]  800-259-9231.
[03:24:14.300 --> 03:24:16.300]  We just got this article from Kit Daniels.
[03:24:16.300 --> 03:24:18.300]  Of course, we've been talking about having
[03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:20.300]  Sente Fox, former president of Mexico's
[03:24:20.300 --> 03:24:22.300]  meeting with Nancy Pelosi,
[03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:24.300]  and the president of Mexico's meeting
[03:24:24.300 --> 03:24:26.300]  with the president of Mexico's meeting
[03:24:26.300 --> 03:24:28.300]  with the president of Mexico's meeting
[03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:30.300]  with the president of Mexico's meeting
[03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:32.300]  with Nancy Pelosi.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:34.300]  And of course, they share the same goal
[03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:36.300]  as Paul Ryan, oh,
[03:24:36.300 --> 03:24:38.300]  they would like to stop Trump.
[03:24:38.300 --> 03:24:40.300]  And yet we see that Mexico
[03:24:40.300 --> 03:24:42.300]  is taking nearly 4,000 Cuban
[03:24:42.300 --> 03:24:44.300]  migrants from Panama
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:46.300]  and escorting them
[03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:48.300]  to the U.S. border.
[03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:50.300]  Because Mexico doesn't even want them passing
[03:24:50.300 --> 03:24:52.300]  through their country.
[03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:54.300]  But they're going to dump them on the United States.
[03:24:54.300 --> 03:24:56.300]  And of course, we're racist if we want
[03:24:56.300 --> 03:24:58.300]  to patrol our border.
[03:24:58.300 --> 03:25:00.300]  Mexico patrols their border with Panama,
[03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:02.300]  with Nicaragua. They closed their border
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:04.300]  last year as they reports in this.
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:06.300]  So that's what we're seeing everywhere.
[03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:08.300]  This is a deliberate takedown
[03:25:08.300 --> 03:25:10.300]  of our society, folks. It is very,
[03:25:10.300 --> 03:25:12.300]  very deliberate what is happening here.
[03:25:12.300 --> 03:25:14.300]  And this is not something that is
[03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:16.300]  a humanitarian issue, in my opinion.
[03:25:16.300 --> 03:25:18.300]  This is something that is going
[03:25:18.300 --> 03:25:20.300]  to cost us our entire country
[03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:22.300]  if we don't get control of these borders.
[03:25:22.300 --> 03:25:24.300]  Now, let me go to Antoine in California
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:26.300]  who says he disagrees with me.
[03:25:26.300 --> 03:25:28.300]  Go ahead.
[03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:30.300]  Hi, David.
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:32.300]  Hi.
[03:25:32.300 --> 03:25:34.300]  So what I disagree with is that
[03:25:34.300 --> 03:25:36.300]  I see a lot of these
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:38.300]  I saw a lot of people wearing
[03:25:38.300 --> 03:25:40.300]  red and
[03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:42.300]  hammer and sickles
[03:25:42.300 --> 03:25:44.300]  at these Trump rallies. And he doesn't
[03:25:44.300 --> 03:25:46.300]  acknowledge where I
[03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:48.300]  come from. I'm guessing it's not the Chinese
[03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:50.300]  or like, you know, Alex Artiglobalist
[03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:52.300]  and I see a lot of it
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:54.300]  and also
[03:25:54.300 --> 03:25:56.300]  Alex Paxton, you know...
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:25:58.300]  Wait a minute. You saw...
[03:25:58.300 --> 03:26:00.300]  Wait a minute. Let's look...
[03:26:00.300 --> 03:26:02.300]  You saw people at the Trump rallies
[03:26:02.300 --> 03:26:04.300]  that were inside the rallies that were wearing
[03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:06.300]  hammer and sickle clothing and stuff like that
[03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:08.300]  supporting communism, right?
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:10.300]  No, these are the people that are
[03:26:10.300 --> 03:26:12.300]  starting stuff, burning the American flag.
[03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:14.300]  Okay, yeah, right, right.
[03:26:14.300 --> 03:26:16.300]  So, I mean, it's weird
[03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:18.300]  because they everywhere, they all wear red.
[03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:20.300]  And now, you know, recently
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:22.300]  in Southern California, they started
[03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:24.300]  being wearing having, you know,
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:26.300]  Mexican flags and stuff like that.
[03:26:26.300 --> 03:26:28.300]  So, the whole year before that, you know, it was
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:30.300]  all red people and he talked a lot
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:32.300]  about how they showed up to his
[03:26:32.300 --> 03:26:34.300]  rallies that he would have at abortion clinics
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:36.300]  and, you know, they'd be Satanists
[03:26:36.300 --> 03:26:38.300]  and stuff. So, I mean, it's
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:40.300]  weird. I looked into this stuff because
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:42.300]  I have a channel on YouTube called Orbiter
[03:26:42.300 --> 03:26:44.300]  and Satanists is
[03:26:44.300 --> 03:26:46.300]  really weird because they everywhere
[03:26:46.300 --> 03:26:48.300]  and he
[03:26:48.300 --> 03:26:50.300]  associates that with the hammer and sickle, people
[03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:52.300]  wearing red, you know, communism.
[03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:54.300]  I don't think that's the Chinese side of communism.
[03:26:54.300 --> 03:26:56.300]  I think that's, you know, Russian side
[03:26:56.300 --> 03:26:58.300]  of communism. And Alex likes to say
[03:26:58.300 --> 03:27:00.300]  they're all sweetie baby good guys
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:02.300]  but I heard from
[03:27:02.300 --> 03:27:04.300]  the ISIS guy, Yadon, he said
[03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:06.300]  he saw a lot of Russians
[03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:08.300]  in one of the episodes, you know, handling
[03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:10.300]  some of the ISIS people
[03:27:10.300 --> 03:27:12.300]  and, you know, coordinating with them.
[03:27:12.300 --> 03:27:14.300]  So, this is weird, you know, and I think
[03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:16.300]  Donald Trump should probably look into it
[03:27:16.300 --> 03:27:18.300]  and also vaccines, you know,
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:20.300]  in our health and all these former suitable
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:22.300]  commercials that run these Republican
[03:27:22.300 --> 03:27:24.300]  evil, you know, people.
[03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:26.300]  They make a lot of money off this stuff
[03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:28.300]  off of him, you know.
[03:27:28.300 --> 03:27:30.300]  I agree with you. I think that, you know,
[03:27:30.300 --> 03:27:32.300]  I don't think that it's simply a Russian
[03:27:32.300 --> 03:27:34.300]  issue and we have to understand that communism
[03:27:34.300 --> 03:27:36.300]  was essentially established by central bankers, okay.
[03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:38.300]  They're the ones who gave
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:40.300]  Lenin $10 million
[03:27:40.300 --> 03:27:42.300]  in Switzerland and sent him on a steel train to go start
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:44.300]  the Russian Revolution. And that was,
[03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:46.300]  you know, the German central banker whose
[03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:48.300]  brother was establishing the Federal Reserve.
[03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:50.300]  Alex has mentioned this many times. I've
[03:27:50.300 --> 03:27:52.300]  mentioned it as well. So, we need to understand
[03:27:52.300 --> 03:27:54.300]  that, you know, we don't have
[03:27:54.300 --> 03:27:56.300]  capitalism and Wall Street on one
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:27:58.300]  side and the communists
[03:27:58.300 --> 03:28:00.300]  on the other side. It's the
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:02.300]  bankers and the Wall Street
[03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:04.300]  people who are benefiting from the communist
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:06.300]  dictators like Hugo Chavez.
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:08.300]  They brag about the fact they get a 700% return
[03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:10.300]  on their investment. It works out really well
[03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:12.300]  for them. They love to create the chaos
[03:28:12.300 --> 03:28:14.300]  and the division. And, of course,
[03:28:14.300 --> 03:28:16.300]  you talk about the ties to Satanism.
[03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:18.300]  We've seen one of the tenets
[03:28:18.300 --> 03:28:20.300]  of Marxism is that they have to
[03:28:20.300 --> 03:28:22.300]  eradicate religion. They call it
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:24.300]  the opiate of the masses. So,
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:26.300]  there's all this religious
[03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:28.300]  persecution that we see is
[03:28:28.300 --> 03:28:30.300]  something that these atheist
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:32.300]  communists and socialists are
[03:28:32.300 --> 03:28:34.300]  actively fomenting. So, there's that connection
[03:28:34.300 --> 03:28:36.300]  there as well. That's not a hidden secret.
[03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:38.300]  I mean, we don't even have to say,
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:40.300]  well, you know, I think that there's Satanists or whatever.
[03:28:40.300 --> 03:28:42.300]  They're open about this. This is something we've
[03:28:42.300 --> 03:28:44.300]  seen in the past. They turn
[03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:46.300]  the churches into museums or
[03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:48.300]  they destroy them as they went through
[03:28:48.300 --> 03:28:50.300]  Russia, as they went through China.
[03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:52.300]  I don't really make that much of a distinction
[03:28:52.300 --> 03:28:54.300]  between different countries
[03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:56.300]  having their socialist
[03:28:56.300 --> 03:28:58.300]  or communist government, or
[03:28:58.300 --> 03:29:00.300]  a distinction between communism and socialism.
[03:29:00.300 --> 03:29:02.300]  The fundamental thing at the bottom
[03:29:02.300 --> 03:29:04.300]  of all of it is a centralized
[03:29:04.300 --> 03:29:06.300]  control, a command-control
[03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:08.300]  economy. And as our
[03:29:08.300 --> 03:29:10.300]  government becomes more and more
[03:29:10.300 --> 03:29:12.300]  centrally controlled, as they
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:14.300]  get away from the rule of law
[03:29:14.300 --> 03:29:16.300]  and resort to executive orders,
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:18.300]  as they thumb their nose
[03:29:18.300 --> 03:29:20.300]  at the Constitution, like we've seen
[03:29:20.300 --> 03:29:22.300]  with the Trade Promotion Authority, and saying
[03:29:22.300 --> 03:29:24.300]  we are going to run this thing
[03:29:24.300 --> 03:29:26.300]  through. We're not going to pay any attention
[03:29:26.300 --> 03:29:28.300]  to the constitutional process for
[03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:30.300]  ratifying a treaty. We're going to take this treaty
[03:29:30.300 --> 03:29:32.300]  that was put together by foreigners,
[03:29:32.300 --> 03:29:34.300]  by multinational corporations,
[03:29:34.300 --> 03:29:36.300]  done in secret, and we're going to
[03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:38.300]  ram this thing through in a unique
[03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:40.300]  process that has nothing to do with the Constitution.
[03:29:40.300 --> 03:29:42.300]  That's what we need to be afraid of,
[03:29:42.300 --> 03:29:44.300]  and that's what these people are all uniting
[03:29:44.300 --> 03:29:46.300]  with, whether it's Hillary Clinton, or
[03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:48.300]  Jeb Bush, or Paul Ryan,
[03:29:48.300 --> 03:29:50.300]  they're all on the same team. Folks, those will be right back.
[03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:52.300]  The empires on the run.
[03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:56.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.300 --> 03:30:02.300]  Nearly one in six young men
[03:30:02.300 --> 03:30:04.300]  inside the U.S. are either
[03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:06.300]  jobless or incarcerated.
[03:30:06.300 --> 03:30:08.300]  Report, Breitbart News.
[03:30:08.300 --> 03:30:10.300]  According to the Congressional Budget Office,
[03:30:10.300 --> 03:30:12.300]  out of 38 million young men
[03:30:12.300 --> 03:30:14.300]  in the U.S. in 2014,
[03:30:14.300 --> 03:30:16.300]  16% were jobless or
[03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:18.300]  incarcerated. The share of young
[03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:20.300]  men without a job or in prison
[03:30:20.300 --> 03:30:22.300]  has increased substantially
[03:30:22.300 --> 03:30:24.300]  since the 1980s, when just
[03:30:24.300 --> 03:30:26.300]  11% of young men fit
[03:30:26.300 --> 03:30:28.300]  into either category. CBO
[03:30:28.300 --> 03:30:30.300]  highlights that the level of joblessness
[03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:32.300]  and incarceration varies based
[03:30:32.300 --> 03:30:34.300]  on young men's educational attainment.
[03:30:34.300 --> 03:30:36.300]  The less they have, the more likely they are
[03:30:36.300 --> 03:30:38.300]  to be jobless or incarcerated.
[03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:40.300]  Economic, policy, and
[03:30:40.300 --> 03:30:42.300]  skillset changes contributed to the
[03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:44.300]  large increase of joblessness
[03:30:44.300 --> 03:30:46.300]  and incarceration from 1980
[03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:48.300]  to 2014. The increased
[03:30:48.300 --> 03:30:50.300]  incarceration rates, CBO added,
[03:30:50.300 --> 03:30:52.300]  is not necessarily due to an increase
[03:30:52.300 --> 03:30:54.300]  of crime, but again,
[03:30:54.300 --> 03:30:56.300]  policy decisions. You can find
[03:30:56.300 --> 03:31:06.300]  more reports on Infowars.com.
[03:31:26.300 --> 03:31:28.300]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet
[03:31:28.300 --> 03:31:30.300]  to gather these purple-blue crystals
[03:31:30.300 --> 03:31:32.300]  to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[03:31:32.300 --> 03:31:34.300]  On top of that, we also screen
[03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:36.300]  our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[03:31:36.300 --> 03:31:38.300]  It is the purest, cleanest,
[03:31:38.300 --> 03:31:40.300]  strongest out there. Quite frankly,
[03:31:40.300 --> 03:31:42.300]  I'm flattered that with the launch of
[03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:44.300]  Survival Shield, nascent iodine,
[03:31:44.300 --> 03:31:46.300]  that major brands and major companies
[03:31:46.300 --> 03:31:48.300]  have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[03:31:48.300 --> 03:31:50.300]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything
[03:31:50.300 --> 03:31:52.300]  even close to what we have.
[03:31:52.300 --> 03:31:54.300]  It is exclusive to
[03:31:54.300 --> 03:31:56.300]  InfowarsLife.com
[03:31:56.300 --> 03:31:58.300]  and the InfowarsLife family of
[03:31:58.300 --> 03:32:00.300]  incredible products.
[03:32:00.300 --> 03:32:02.300]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say
[03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:04.300]  Secret 12 X2 SuperMail
[03:32:04.300 --> 03:32:06.300]  Brainforce Prostagart Silver
[03:32:06.300 --> 03:32:08.300]  Board. I use them all. They're phenomenal.
[03:32:08.300 --> 03:32:10.300]  They work. Buy them, folks.
[03:32:10.300 --> 03:32:12.300]  Thank you, brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:14.300]  I am a relatively short-time listener
[03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:16.300]  and I'm a quite a supporter
[03:32:16.300 --> 03:32:18.300]  of your fine, fine products.
[03:32:18.300 --> 03:32:20.300]  Welcome to the Infowars.
[03:32:20.300 --> 03:32:22.300]  It's so easy to get these incredible
[03:32:22.300 --> 03:32:24.300]  nutraceuticals that support your health
[03:32:24.300 --> 03:32:26.300]  and the Infowar at the same time.
[03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:28.300]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[03:32:28.300 --> 03:32:30.300]  Casio FX,
[03:32:30.300 --> 03:32:32.300]  Mason, iodine, iodine. Right. Let me ask you a question.
[03:32:32.300 --> 03:32:34.300]  Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable
[03:32:34.300 --> 03:32:36.300]  products I've ever had in my life.
[03:32:36.300 --> 03:32:38.300]  What products are you taking? Everything from
[03:32:38.300 --> 03:32:40.300]  SuperMail to
[03:32:40.300 --> 03:32:42.300]  Brainforce to Wintersun
[03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:44.300]  X2 even got a little
[03:32:44.300 --> 03:32:46.300]  a DNA force. So, and I just
[03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:48.300]  re-upped everything and I just went to Autoville.
[03:32:48.300 --> 03:32:50.300]  Visit InfowarsLife.com
[03:32:50.300 --> 03:32:52.300]  to read the information and research
[03:32:52.300 --> 03:32:54.300]  and to see the reviews for yourself.
[03:32:54.300 --> 03:32:56.300]  That's InfowarsLife.com
[03:32:56.300 --> 03:33:21.300]  today at 825-33139.
[03:33:21.300 --> 03:33:23.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.300 --> 03:33:25.300]  I'm David Knight, your host. We're going to go back
[03:33:25.300 --> 03:33:27.300]  to your calls in just a moment, but I want to ask you a question.
[03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:29.300]  What if America had a Chernobyl?
[03:33:29.300 --> 03:33:31.300]  Do you think
[03:33:31.300 --> 03:33:33.300]  that they'd try to keep it secret?
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:35.300]  Do you think that they would ridicule investigators
[03:33:35.300 --> 03:33:37.300]  as conspiracy theorists,
[03:33:37.300 --> 03:33:39.300]  as anti-government people because it criticized
[03:33:39.300 --> 03:33:41.300]  the government?
[03:33:41.300 --> 03:33:43.300]  I wasn't aware of this story
[03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:45.300]  until Joe Jennings brought this end.
[03:33:45.300 --> 03:33:47.300]  This is something that was released last September.
[03:33:47.300 --> 03:33:49.300]  I'm sure we covered it at Infowars,
[03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:51.300]  but this is a one-year investigation
[03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:53.300]  that a television
[03:33:53.300 --> 03:33:55.300]  crew did in Southern California.
[03:33:55.300 --> 03:33:57.300]  It was absolutely amazing to me,
[03:33:57.300 --> 03:33:59.300]  but Joe Jennings noticed this because
[03:33:59.300 --> 03:34:01.300]  the people that are dying
[03:34:01.300 --> 03:34:03.300]  in Southern California, where his family was,
[03:34:03.300 --> 03:34:05.300]  are dying
[03:34:05.300 --> 03:34:07.300]  with the same kind of cancer that his dad did.
[03:34:07.300 --> 03:34:09.300]  Here's what's behind it.
[03:34:09.300 --> 03:34:11.300]  Let me just read you just the intro to this
[03:34:11.300 --> 03:34:13.300]  because this is a very long investigation.
[03:34:13.300 --> 03:34:15.300]  There's a lot of detail in this.
[03:34:15.300 --> 03:34:17.300]  If you're not aware of this story from last September,
[03:34:17.300 --> 03:34:19.300]  you need to be.
[03:34:19.300 --> 03:34:21.300]  The US government secretly allowed radiation from a damaged
[03:34:21.300 --> 03:34:23.300]  reactor to be released into the air
[03:34:23.300 --> 03:34:25.300]  over the San Fernando and semi-valleys
[03:34:25.300 --> 03:34:27.300]  in the wake of major nuclear meltdown
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:29.300]  in Southern California
[03:34:29.300 --> 03:34:31.300]  more than 50 years ago.
[03:34:31.300 --> 03:34:33.300]  Fallout
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:35.300]  that nearby residents contend continues
[03:34:35.300 --> 03:34:37.300]  to cause serious health consequences
[03:34:37.300 --> 03:34:39.300]  and in some cases death.
[03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:41.300]  Now they say there was this lab,
[03:34:41.300 --> 03:34:43.300]  the Santa Susana Field Lab.
[03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:45.300]  They called it Area 4.
[03:34:45.300 --> 03:34:47.300]  Isn't that nice? They have those, you know,
[03:34:47.300 --> 03:34:49.300]  Area 51
[03:34:49.300 --> 03:34:51.300]  or the UFO place.
[03:34:51.300 --> 03:34:53.300]  Was that Area 59?
[03:34:53.300 --> 03:34:55.300]  Whatever, I can't remember. Never us.
[03:34:55.300 --> 03:34:57.300]  Founded in 1947 to test experimental
[03:34:57.300 --> 03:34:59.300]  nuclear reactors and rocket systems,
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:35:01.300]  a research facility was built in the hills
[03:35:01.300 --> 03:35:03.300]  above the two valleys.
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:05.300]  In 1959, Area 4 was the site of one of the
[03:35:05.300 --> 03:35:07.300]  worst nuclear accidents
[03:35:07.300 --> 03:35:09.300]  in US history. Have you ever heard of it before?
[03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:11.300]  No.
[03:35:11.300 --> 03:35:13.300]  Do you think that there's going to be a lot of things
[03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:15.300]  that come to light eventually that our government
[03:35:15.300 --> 03:35:17.300]  has hidden from us? Of course.
[03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:19.300]  This has taken
[03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:21.300]  1959. I mean, we're getting close to
[03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:23.300]  60 years, okay?
[03:35:23.300 --> 03:35:25.300]  That this has been out there, not just 50 years,
[03:35:25.300 --> 03:35:27.300]  but 60 years, one of the worst nuclear accidents
[03:35:27.300 --> 03:35:29.300]  in US history. But the federal government
[03:35:29.300 --> 03:35:31.300]  still hasn't told the public
[03:35:31.300 --> 03:35:33.300]  that radiation was released and the atmosphere
[03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:35.300]  is a result of a partial nuclear
[03:35:35.300 --> 03:35:37.300]  meltdown right there in California.
[03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:39.300]  Now Whistleblowers interviewed on camera
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:41.300]  by NBC4 have recounted how during and after
[03:35:41.300 --> 03:35:43.300]  that accident, they were ordered to release
[03:35:43.300 --> 03:35:45.300]  dangerous radioactive gases
[03:35:45.300 --> 03:35:47.300]  into the air above Los Angeles
[03:35:47.300 --> 03:35:49.300]  and Ventura counties,
[03:35:49.300 --> 03:35:51.300]  often under cover of night
[03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:53.300]  and how their bosses
[03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:55.300]  swore them to secrecy.
[03:35:55.300 --> 03:35:57.300]  The I-Team, the NBC I-Team
[03:35:57.300 --> 03:35:59.300]  reviewed over 15,000 pages
[03:35:59.300 --> 03:36:01.300]  of studies and government documents,
[03:36:01.300 --> 03:36:03.300]  interviewed other insiders, uncovered that
[03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:05.300]  for years, starting in 1959,
[03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:07.300]  workers in Area 4 were routinely
[03:36:07.300 --> 03:36:09.300]  instructed to release radioactive
[03:36:09.300 --> 03:36:11.300]  materials into the air.
[03:36:11.300 --> 03:36:13.300]  We
[03:36:13.300 --> 03:36:15.300]  and back in North Carolina, we used to live
[03:36:15.300 --> 03:36:17.300]  not too far from a nuclear reactor
[03:36:17.300 --> 03:36:19.300]  that was put there at night. I opposed that
[03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:21.300]  from the very beginning. I'm an ardent
[03:36:21.300 --> 03:36:23.300]  opponent of nuclear power because
[03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:25.300]  there is no
[03:36:25.300 --> 03:36:27.300]  long-term solution to storing the waste.
[03:36:27.300 --> 03:36:29.300]  As we saw in Fukushima, in most cases,
[03:36:29.300 --> 03:36:31.300]  they take the nuclear waste and they store it
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:33.300]  on site at the nuclear facilities. But you may
[03:36:33.300 --> 03:36:35.300]  not know that nuclear facilities
[03:36:35.300 --> 03:36:37.300]  themselves become radioactive after a
[03:36:37.300 --> 03:36:39.300]  certain number of years. They need to be
[03:36:39.300 --> 03:36:41.300]  decommissioned. They come with a lifetime
[03:36:41.300 --> 03:36:43.300]  of
[03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:45.300]  grant or permission to operate
[03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:47.300]  of 20, 25, 30 years.
[03:36:47.300 --> 03:36:49.300]  What we're seeing now
[03:36:49.300 --> 03:36:51.300]  is these nuclear facilities, like the one in North Carolina,
[03:36:51.300 --> 03:36:53.300]  have
[03:36:53.300 --> 03:36:55.300]  passed their
[03:36:55.300 --> 03:36:57.300]  lifetime license and they just get their license extended.
[03:36:57.300 --> 03:36:59.300]  Okay, let's just extend it for another
[03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:01.300]  20 years. Don't worry about it.
[03:37:01.300 --> 03:37:03.300]  And we're starting to see, back at the one
[03:37:03.300 --> 03:37:05.300]  in North Carolina, the Sharon Harris
[03:37:05.300 --> 03:37:07.300]  nuclear facility there,
[03:37:07.300 --> 03:37:09.300]  they're having minor, they tell us,
[03:37:09.300 --> 03:37:11.300]  accidents. But of course, you never know, do you?
[03:37:11.300 --> 03:37:13.300]  Because you can't see, smell,
[03:37:13.300 --> 03:37:15.300]  taste this.
[03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:17.300]  Okay, just as the people, nobody knew.
[03:37:17.300 --> 03:37:19.300]  Now, for 60 years, nobody knew
[03:37:19.300 --> 03:37:21.300]  that they had, nearly had, a nuclear meltdown.
[03:37:21.300 --> 03:37:23.300]  Nobody knew that they were
[03:37:23.300 --> 03:37:25.300]  releasing nuclear
[03:37:25.300 --> 03:37:27.300]  radioactive materials
[03:37:27.300 --> 03:37:29.300]  into the air
[03:37:29.300 --> 03:37:31.300]  in Los Angeles County, in Ventura County.
[03:37:31.300 --> 03:37:33.300]  Okay, they say
[03:37:33.300 --> 03:37:35.300]  to prevent a potentially devastating explosion, one
[03:37:35.300 --> 03:37:37.300]  that in hindsight, the 76-year-old
[03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:39.300]  whistleblower believes would have been
[03:37:39.300 --> 03:37:41.300]  just like Chernobyl. He and other workers were instructed
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:43.300]  to open up the exhaust stacks and release
[03:37:43.300 --> 03:37:45.300]  massive amounts of radiation into the sky.
[03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:47.300]  He said this was a very dangerous radioactive material,
[03:37:47.300 --> 03:37:49.300]  went straight out in the atmosphere,
[03:37:49.300 --> 03:37:51.300]  went straight to Semi Valley, to Chatsworth,
[03:37:51.300 --> 03:37:53.300]  to Kanoga Park. Area
[03:37:53.300 --> 03:37:55.300]  four workers, of course, were sworn to secrecy.
[03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:57.300]  They would never tell anyone what they had done.
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:01.300]  Yeah. So, we see that
[03:38:01.300 --> 03:38:03.300]  happening over and over again. Occasionally, we see
[03:38:03.300 --> 03:38:05.300]  things like Flint, Michigan, where
[03:38:05.300 --> 03:38:07.300]  they
[03:38:07.300 --> 03:38:09.300]  put the lead in the water, allowed that,
[03:38:09.300 --> 03:38:11.300]  knew that it was there, did nothing to protect the people
[03:38:11.300 --> 03:38:13.300]  until somebody blew the whistle on them.
[03:38:13.300 --> 03:38:15.300]  Bottom line, folks,
[03:38:15.300 --> 03:38:17.300]  is that you need to
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:19.300]  protect yourself. You need to be skeptical
[03:38:19.300 --> 03:38:21.300]  of the government. You need to understand
[03:38:21.300 --> 03:38:23.300]  that, yes, even in America,
[03:38:23.300 --> 03:38:25.300]  we can have a criminal government
[03:38:25.300 --> 03:38:27.300]  that endangers the people
[03:38:27.300 --> 03:38:29.300]  and lies to us about it
[03:38:29.300 --> 03:38:31.300]  and keeps it secret for decades.
[03:38:31.300 --> 03:38:33.300]  Now, most of the listeners
[03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:35.300]  to this radio program know that.
[03:38:35.300 --> 03:38:37.300]  Most of you realize that
[03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:39.300]  it wasn't
[03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:41.300]  some kind of magic unicorn
[03:38:41.300 --> 03:38:43.300]  science that brought down
[03:38:43.300 --> 03:38:45.300]  three steel buildings
[03:38:45.300 --> 03:38:47.300]  with only two planes.
[03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:49.300]  And you realize that the
[03:38:49.300 --> 03:38:51.300]  cover story about these
[03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:53.300]  Saudi terrorists is just that, a cover story.
[03:38:53.300 --> 03:38:55.300]  But you also realize
[03:38:55.300 --> 03:38:57.300]  that that's an important way that we're going to begin
[03:38:57.300 --> 03:38:59.300]  to unravel the truth, that we're going to begin to unravel
[03:38:59.300 --> 03:39:01.300]  the relationships between our secret
[03:39:01.300 --> 03:39:03.300]  government, the CIA
[03:39:03.300 --> 03:39:05.300]  and the Saudis.
[03:39:05.300 --> 03:39:07.300]  And that's one of the reasons why they want
[03:39:07.300 --> 03:39:09.300]  to keep this quiet. They put this
[03:39:09.300 --> 03:39:11.300]  in, they had this beard, and then when it started
[03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:13.300]  to get some traction, they actually put it in their report. They said,
[03:39:13.300 --> 03:39:15.300]  well, wait a minute, we don't want our allies
[03:39:15.300 --> 03:39:17.300]  sued.
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:19.300]  But be skeptical, protect yourself
[03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:21.300]  and one of the things that we're doing
[03:39:21.300 --> 03:39:23.300]  to try to help people prepare, we've run
[03:39:23.300 --> 03:39:25.300]  specials on preparedness products, we've got
[03:39:25.300 --> 03:39:27.300]  specials on our select storeable food,
[03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:29.300]  it helps to support our operation,
[03:39:29.300 --> 03:39:31.300]  helps to provide
[03:39:31.300 --> 03:39:33.300]  for your future.
[03:39:33.300 --> 03:39:35.300]  And make sure that you take advantage
[03:39:35.300 --> 03:39:37.300]  of this 30 to 40 percent that we've got
[03:39:37.300 --> 03:39:39.300]  off on our bestselling products at Infowar
[03:39:39.300 --> 03:39:41.300]  Select Storeable Food. I don't know how much longer
[03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:43.300]  that sell is going to last, it's not going
[03:39:43.300 --> 03:39:45.300]  to last much longer and it's now just on
[03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:47.300]  the, we've just extended it
[03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:49.300]  for our bestsellers at Infowarstore.com.
[03:39:49.300 --> 03:39:51.300]  Also, to try to help you
[03:39:51.300 --> 03:39:53.300]  make sure that you've got clean water.
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:55.300]  That's one of the essentials. You know, food and water.
[03:39:55.300 --> 03:39:57.300]  Why wouldn't you prepare for
[03:39:57.300 --> 03:39:59.300]  food and water? Make sure that you've got
[03:39:59.300 --> 03:40:01.300]  a backup source of food that's going to last
[03:40:01.300 --> 03:40:03.300]  you a long time. Get it while you can get a discount.
[03:40:03.300 --> 03:40:05.300]  Make sure that you've got clean
[03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:07.300]  water. That in case
[03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:09.300]  they dump something into it that you can't
[03:40:09.300 --> 03:40:11.300]  detect, you can still get
[03:40:11.300 --> 03:40:13.300]  that out and you know they're putting fluoride
[03:40:13.300 --> 03:40:15.300]  in it. You know they're putting chlorine in it
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:17.300]  if you're on city water. If you're on rural water
[03:40:17.300 --> 03:40:19.300]  you don't know if somebody
[03:40:19.300 --> 03:40:21.300]  in some farmer nearby is
[03:40:21.300 --> 03:40:23.300]  dumping glyphosates into
[03:40:23.300 --> 03:40:25.300]  the aquifer. Okay, so
[03:40:25.300 --> 03:40:27.300]  you need to filter this stuff out.
[03:40:27.300 --> 03:40:29.300]  If you don't have one now, you should
[03:40:29.300 --> 03:40:31.300]  be getting it. We've tried to extend
[03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:33.300]  another sale to you here. Propure
[03:40:33.300 --> 03:40:35.300]  big or king units. If you get one of the
[03:40:35.300 --> 03:40:37.300]  large units that sit on the countertop
[03:40:37.300 --> 03:40:39.300]  you can get your choice or a free gift
[03:40:39.300 --> 03:40:41.300]  either a propure fruit infused water pitcher.
[03:40:41.300 --> 03:40:43.300]  That's a $70 value or
[03:40:43.300 --> 03:40:45.300]  a propure shower filter.
[03:40:45.300 --> 03:40:47.300]  Also a $70 value.
[03:40:47.300 --> 03:40:49.300]  That's a good way for you to
[03:40:49.300 --> 03:40:51.300]  try that out. And of course
[03:40:51.300 --> 03:40:53.300]  when we talk about the propure units
[03:40:53.300 --> 03:40:55.300]  they have water and fluoride filter
[03:40:55.300 --> 03:40:57.300]  elements that help to reduce or remove
[03:40:57.300 --> 03:40:59.300]  pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[03:40:59.300 --> 03:41:01.300]  ammonia with chloride, hydrofluorosilicic acid
[03:41:01.300 --> 03:41:03.300]  the latest form
[03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:05.300]  of fluoride that is not covered
[03:41:05.300 --> 03:41:07.300]  by other fluoride filter brands
[03:41:07.300 --> 03:41:09.300]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[03:41:09.300 --> 03:41:11.300]  Okay, so you want to make sure
[03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:13.300]  that you're not drinking that stuff. You want to make sure you're not getting
[03:41:13.300 --> 03:41:15.300]  bacteria
[03:41:15.300 --> 03:41:17.300]  cysts and other things that are
[03:41:17.300 --> 03:41:19.300]  possibly in your water. Make
[03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:21.300]  sure before you
[03:41:21.300 --> 03:41:23.300]  analyze after the fact that they have
[03:41:23.300 --> 03:41:25.300]  somehow slipped this in or
[03:41:25.300 --> 03:41:27.300]  forgot to tell you that they had a nuclear meltdown
[03:41:27.300 --> 03:41:29.300]  nearly
[03:41:29.300 --> 03:41:31.300]  at the reactor in southern
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:33.300]  California. They just decided
[03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:35.300]  that they wouldn't tell you to swear each other to secrecy
[03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:37.300]  and then do things
[03:41:37.300 --> 03:41:39.300]  like allow the lead to continue
[03:41:39.300 --> 03:41:41.300]  to be in the water at Flint, Michigan.
[03:41:41.300 --> 03:41:43.300]  I want to go back to our callers.
[03:41:43.300 --> 03:41:45.300]  Let's go to Dave
[03:41:45.300 --> 03:41:47.300]  in Ohio. Dave, go ahead.
[03:41:47.300 --> 03:41:49.300]  Dave, David
[03:41:49.300 --> 03:41:51.300]  This is Dave from
[03:41:51.300 --> 03:41:53.300]  Checkerbar Ice Cream Company in Cleveland, Ohio.
[03:41:53.300 --> 03:41:55.300]  I'm going to be donating
[03:41:55.300 --> 03:41:57.300]  five ice cream carts
[03:41:57.300 --> 03:41:59.300]  and $1,000 worth of red, white
[03:41:59.300 --> 03:42:01.300]  and blue bomb pops
[03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:03.300]  to pass out during the RNC
[03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:05.300]  and it's going to be distributed
[03:42:05.300 --> 03:42:07.300]  from Info Wars,
[03:42:07.300 --> 03:42:09.300]  Roger Stone
[03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:11.300]  and Donald Trump. That's great.
[03:42:11.300 --> 03:42:13.300]  That's great. Yeah, so we don't have
[03:42:13.300 --> 03:42:15.300]  another Ferguson or Baltimore here in Cleveland.
[03:42:15.300 --> 03:42:17.300]  Maybe you can get the people to chill out.
[03:42:17.300 --> 03:42:19.300]  Screaming in people's
[03:42:19.300 --> 03:42:21.300]  faces is just
[03:42:21.300 --> 03:42:23.300]  end of an ice cream cone.
[03:42:23.300 --> 03:42:25.300]  Yeah, you know, red, white
[03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:27.300]  and blue bomb pops ice cream carts. I don't know if you've
[03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:29.300]  ever seen them before going up and down the street. People
[03:42:29.300 --> 03:42:31.300]  fell in ice cream. That's great.
[03:42:31.300 --> 03:42:33.300]  That's one way to lick the burning
[03:42:33.300 --> 03:42:35.300]  protesters, right?
[03:42:35.300 --> 03:42:37.300]  We can lick them with kindness and lick them
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:39.300]  with an ice cream cone. I can imagine the protesters
[03:42:39.300 --> 03:42:41.300]  are going to be coming out here.
[03:42:41.300 --> 03:42:43.300]  So if you got ice cream carts
[03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:45.300]  and ice cream bicycles with
[03:42:45.300 --> 03:42:47.300]  free ice cream for those
[03:42:47.300 --> 03:42:49.300]  people that don't know any better
[03:42:49.300 --> 03:42:51.300]  they get a free bomb pop
[03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:53.300]  just because. That's super. Well, we're going
[03:42:53.300 --> 03:42:55.300]  to be there. Alex is going to be there
[03:42:55.300 --> 03:42:57.300]  along with the Info Wars crew.
[03:42:57.300 --> 03:42:59.300]  I'm going to be staying behind here in the studio
[03:42:59.300 --> 03:43:01.300]  kind of in case we lose communication.
[03:43:01.300 --> 03:43:03.300]  We'll keep the broadcast going.
[03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:05.300]  But it's going to be an interesting event.
[03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:07.300]  I think it will still possibly
[03:43:07.300 --> 03:43:09.300]  be interesting in the
[03:43:09.300 --> 03:43:11.300]  convention itself because
[03:43:11.300 --> 03:43:13.300]  if Donald Trump is going to tell people
[03:43:13.300 --> 03:43:15.300]  about the primaries, this thing ain't over yet.
[03:43:15.300 --> 03:43:17.300]  And we just had the report
[03:43:17.300 --> 03:43:19.300]  from Ted Cruz saying, well, I'm going to see
[03:43:19.300 --> 03:43:21.300]  if I've got a way to sneak back in here, I'll do it.
[03:43:21.300 --> 03:43:23.300]  You can bet he'll do it. This is
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:25.300]  a guy his whole life has been
[03:43:25.300 --> 03:43:27.300]  trained towards the ambition of
[03:43:27.300 --> 03:43:29.300]  being president. We've had
[03:43:29.300 --> 03:43:31.300]  his co-senator here from
[03:43:31.300 --> 03:43:33.300]  Texas saying he was never interested in being
[03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:35.300]  a senator. He always wanted to just be president.
[03:43:35.300 --> 03:43:37.300]  I've said that from the very beginning. One of the reasons
[03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:39.300]  I think his colleagues in the Senate
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:41.300]  dislike him so much is because he started climbing
[03:43:41.300 --> 03:43:43.300]  over their back immediately. He wasn't interested
[03:43:43.300 --> 03:43:45.300]  in being a senator. He was throwing them under the bus
[03:43:45.300 --> 03:43:47.300]  to get traction for his presidential campaign.
[03:43:47.300 --> 03:43:49.300]  I think that's been it from the very beginning.
[03:43:49.300 --> 03:43:51.300]  Well, thanks Dave. That's going to be real interesting
[03:43:51.300 --> 03:43:53.300]  and I'm sure you'll see Alex and the crew there.
[03:43:53.300 --> 03:43:55.300]  That's great. You're going to be donating some ice
[03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:57.300]  cream to get people to
[03:43:57.300 --> 03:43:59.300]  maybe calm down a little bit
[03:43:59.300 --> 03:44:01.300]  at the convention because
[03:44:01.300 --> 03:44:03.300]  I know we're going to have some supporters.
[03:44:03.300 --> 03:44:05.300]  And they know
[03:44:05.300 --> 03:44:07.300]  that it's the supporters. They know they're not
[03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.300]  being controlled and manipulated
[03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:11.300]  by Donald Trump because we've had
[03:44:11.300 --> 03:44:13.300]  the same thing said about the Democrat convention.
[03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:15.300]  We've got the former governor of
[03:44:15.300 --> 03:44:17.300]  Pennsylvania who's going to be running
[03:44:17.300 --> 03:44:19.300]  the Democrat convention saying the Bernie Sanders
[03:44:19.300 --> 03:44:21.300]  people better behave themselves
[03:44:21.300 --> 03:44:23.300]  after Bernie doesn't win because Bernie's
[03:44:23.300 --> 03:44:25.300]  not going to win. They're going to make sure. And that's
[03:44:25.300 --> 03:44:27.300]  another story right there that we've mentioned
[03:44:27.300 --> 03:44:29.300]  but we really haven't covered that much. We're going to see it again today.
[03:44:29.300 --> 03:44:31.300]  What happens is as long as
[03:44:31.300 --> 03:44:33.300]  Bernie Sanders doesn't get more
[03:44:33.300 --> 03:44:35.300]  than like a 10% win
[03:44:35.300 --> 03:44:37.300]  over Hillary Clinton, she's going to get
[03:44:37.300 --> 03:44:39.300]  more delegates than he does. And even if he gets
[03:44:39.300 --> 03:44:41.300]  like 10% more delegates, they're going to get the same number
[03:44:41.300 --> 03:44:43.300]  of delegates because they have
[03:44:43.300 --> 03:44:45.300]  allocated themselves
[03:44:45.300 --> 03:44:47.300]  approximately 10% of the delegates
[03:44:47.300 --> 03:44:49.300]  to be superdelegates and they're all going for
[03:44:49.300 --> 03:44:51.300]  Hillary Clinton. So he's got to win by a massive
[03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:53.300]  amount to get anything. They'd like to portray
[03:44:53.300 --> 03:44:55.300]  it as if they
[03:44:55.300 --> 03:44:57.300]  have a very democratic
[03:44:57.300 --> 03:44:59.300]  process or going to award all the delegates
[03:44:59.300 --> 03:45:01.300]  proportionally. But when they do that proportionally
[03:45:01.300 --> 03:45:03.300]  we just saw that happen in the last
[03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:05.300]  election in Indiana. He beat her by
[03:45:05.300 --> 03:45:07.300]  like eight points, okay?
[03:45:07.300 --> 03:45:09.300]  And they awarded all the delegates
[03:45:09.300 --> 03:45:11.300]  proportionally. But then
[03:45:11.300 --> 03:45:13.300]  they throw in 10% of the delegates
[03:45:13.300 --> 03:45:15.300]  and give them all to Hillary Clinton. So there you
[03:45:15.300 --> 03:45:17.300]  go. And they know that it's going to
[03:45:17.300 --> 03:45:19.300]  annoy the Bernie Sanders supporters
[03:45:19.300 --> 03:45:21.300]  and they should be annoyed.
[03:45:21.300 --> 03:45:23.300]  But we also know how they're going to express
[03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:25.300]  that annoyance and that's what we don't want
[03:45:25.300 --> 03:45:27.300]  to see happen. Let's go to
[03:45:27.300 --> 03:45:29.300]  thank you Dave. Let's go to
[03:45:29.300 --> 03:45:31.300]  Caitlin and Connecticut. Go ahead, Caitlin.
[03:45:31.300 --> 03:45:33.300]  Hi
[03:45:33.300 --> 03:45:35.300]  how are you Dave? Doing good.
[03:45:35.300 --> 03:45:37.300]  I'm sorry
[03:45:37.300 --> 03:45:39.300]  I'm a new listener so
[03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:41.300]  this is my first time calling in actually.
[03:45:41.300 --> 03:45:43.300]  Thanks so much for having me
[03:45:43.300 --> 03:45:45.300]  on the air. I was just wondering
[03:45:45.300 --> 03:45:47.300]  if you knew anything about Donald Trump's plan
[03:45:47.300 --> 03:45:49.300]  for the FEMA camps and
[03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:51.300]  if he's going to be able to get anything done
[03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:53.300]  and accomplished in the first 100 days he's in
[03:45:53.300 --> 03:45:55.300]  office because I'd like to see if he can.
[03:45:55.300 --> 03:45:57.300]  Well you know he hasn't said anything to
[03:45:57.300 --> 03:45:59.300]  my knowledge about any FEMA camps.
[03:45:59.300 --> 03:46:01.300]  But I think it is interesting the number of
[03:46:01.300 --> 03:46:03.300]  topics that Donald Trump
[03:46:03.300 --> 03:46:05.300]  has approached. Remember
[03:46:05.300 --> 03:46:07.300]  the 28 pages from the 9-11 report
[03:46:07.300 --> 03:46:09.300]  that was something we've talked about many, many times.
[03:46:09.300 --> 03:46:11.300]  We've had Congressman Walter Jones
[03:46:11.300 --> 03:46:13.300]  on many times from North Carolina.
[03:46:13.300 --> 03:46:15.300]  We've had former Senator
[03:46:15.300 --> 03:46:17.300]  Bob Graham. He didn't come on our program
[03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:19.300]  but he's talked incessantly about this
[03:46:19.300 --> 03:46:21.300]  since he retired in the mid-2000s
[03:46:21.300 --> 03:46:23.300]  and yet nobody got any traction on it until
[03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:25.300]  Donald Trump brought it up at one of the debates.
[03:46:25.300 --> 03:46:27.300]  And then he was ridiculed by the National Review
[03:46:27.300 --> 03:46:29.300]  as sounding like an Alex Jones caller.
[03:46:29.300 --> 03:46:31.300]  He sounded like you Caitlin according
[03:46:31.300 --> 03:46:33.300]  to the National Review. Then
[03:46:33.300 --> 03:46:35.300]  things turned.
[03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:37.300]  We had 60 minutes go in
[03:46:37.300 --> 03:46:39.300]  and talked to Senator Graham
[03:46:39.300 --> 03:46:41.300]  and others who had been trying to blow the whistle
[03:46:41.300 --> 03:46:43.300]  on this for the last 15 years
[03:46:43.300 --> 03:46:45.300]  and now
[03:46:45.300 --> 03:46:47.300]  nobody is laughing at Donald Trump
[03:46:47.300 --> 03:46:49.300]  about that. Of course he's spoken out on vaccines
[03:46:49.300 --> 03:46:51.300]  as well even though Ben Carson said
[03:46:51.300 --> 03:46:53.300]  that he would support mandatory vaccines.
[03:46:53.300 --> 03:46:55.300]  Donald Trump says hey I know some employees
[03:46:55.300 --> 03:46:57.300]  of mine who had perfectly healthy
[03:46:57.300 --> 03:46:59.300]  kids and they got a vaccine
[03:46:59.300 --> 03:47:01.300]  and all of a sudden they came down with autism.
[03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:03.300]  So he's not afraid
[03:47:03.300 --> 03:47:05.300]  to broach these subjects if he agrees
[03:47:05.300 --> 03:47:07.300]  with them. And that's
[03:47:07.300 --> 03:47:09.300]  a really powerful thing. I think
[03:47:09.300 --> 03:47:11.300]  unlike these other candidates he's not
[03:47:11.300 --> 03:47:13.300]  controlled by the men at the top
[03:47:13.300 --> 03:47:15.300]  who are going to tell them there are certain things
[03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:17.300]  that are off limits that you don't talk about.
[03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:19.300]  He's like one of you. Now
[03:47:19.300 --> 03:47:21.300]  he could be wrong on something. He could be ignorant
[03:47:21.300 --> 03:47:23.300]  about something just like you and I could be wrong
[03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:25.300]  or ignorant about something. But I think if he believes it
[03:47:25.300 --> 03:47:27.300]  he'll talk about it and he'll come out with it.
[03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:29.300]  And I think we've seen that over and over again.
[03:47:29.300 --> 03:47:31.300]  The Republican Party hates him
[03:47:31.300 --> 03:47:33.300]  for that. The media hates him
[03:47:33.300 --> 03:47:35.300]  for that. I think that's one of his strongest
[03:47:35.300 --> 03:47:37.300]  points. So yeah in
[03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:39.300]  terms of FEMA camps and a lot of other
[03:47:39.300 --> 03:47:41.300]  things I think that'll be we'll have to just
[03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:43.300]  see what he does. But I think the key issue
[03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:45.300]  that this election is about Caitlyn
[03:47:45.300 --> 03:47:47.300]  is nationalism versus
[03:47:47.300 --> 03:47:49.300]  globalism. And Donald Trump has been
[03:47:49.300 --> 03:47:51.300]  authentic on that for the last 30 years.
[03:47:51.300 --> 03:47:53.300]  He's been talking about
[03:47:53.300 --> 03:47:55.300]  the travesties of these
[03:47:55.300 --> 03:47:57.300]  trade agreements that we have like NAFTA.
[03:47:57.300 --> 03:47:59.300]  He's also complained about the fact that we're paying for
[03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:01.300]  everybody else's security.
[03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:03.300]  We can't continue to do that with NATO
[03:48:03.300 --> 03:48:05.300]  and these other alliances. They don't have to
[03:48:05.300 --> 03:48:07.300]  shoulder any of the responsibility, any of
[03:48:07.300 --> 03:48:09.300]  the financial burden for their defense. That's what
[03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:11.300]  he's talking about with America first. And the reality folks
[03:48:11.300 --> 03:48:13.300]  is, and I'll say this to the GOP
[03:48:13.300 --> 03:48:15.300]  establishment as well,
[03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:17.300]  it's what Donald Trump said.
[03:48:17.300 --> 03:48:19.300]  Eventually we're going to go broke from
[03:48:19.300 --> 03:48:21.300]  doing this. We can't be the policemen
[03:48:21.300 --> 03:48:23.300]  of the world, the unpaid mercenaries
[03:48:23.300 --> 03:48:25.300]  of the world. Eventually we're going to go
[03:48:25.300 --> 03:48:27.300]  broke. And guess what? All these countries
[03:48:27.300 --> 03:48:29.300]  that people are so afraid of having
[03:48:29.300 --> 03:48:31.300]  their own military like Japan or South Korea
[03:48:31.300 --> 03:48:33.300]  or whatever, they're all going to have to have their own
[03:48:33.300 --> 03:48:35.300]  military at that point anyway.
[03:48:35.300 --> 03:48:37.300]  So why not allow them to start
[03:48:37.300 --> 03:48:39.300]  to wean themselves off
[03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:41.300]  of the special
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:43.300]  breastfeeding that we give them from
[03:48:43.300 --> 03:48:45.300]  Uncle Sam. Thank you, Caitlyn.
[03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:47.300]  Let's go to Steven in Tennessee. Go ahead, Steven.
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:49.300]  Hello, David.
[03:48:49.300 --> 03:48:51.300]  I'm watching you on my Roku
[03:48:51.300 --> 03:48:53.300]  device today.
[03:48:53.300 --> 03:48:55.300]  There you go. That's good.
[03:48:55.300 --> 03:48:57.300]  That works out a great way to
[03:48:57.300 --> 03:48:59.300]  watch the broadcast, isn't it?
[03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:01.300]  Yeah, it works really well at my place
[03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:03.300]  anyway.
[03:49:03.300 --> 03:49:05.300]  I heard a previous caller mention the joint
[03:49:05.300 --> 03:49:07.300]  chiefs of staff
[03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:09.300]  that seems to be
[03:49:09.300 --> 03:49:11.300]  trying to oppose martial law.
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:13.300]  And
[03:49:13.300 --> 03:49:15.300]  the one that's doing it, doing a lot of it
[03:49:15.300 --> 03:49:17.300]  anyhow, is this General
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:19.300]  Dunford.
[03:49:19.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  Back in January,
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:23.300]  he did meet with the Federal Reserve Board
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:25.300]  and
[03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:27.300]  after the meeting, the next day
[03:49:27.300 --> 03:49:29.300]  the Federal Reserve
[03:49:29.300 --> 03:49:31.300]  changed their website
[03:49:31.300 --> 03:49:33.300]  from
[03:49:33.300 --> 03:49:35.300] .org to.gov
[03:49:35.300 --> 03:49:37.300]  Really? Really?
[03:49:37.300 --> 03:49:39.300]  To.gov?
[03:49:39.300 --> 03:49:41.300]  Yeah, he flew straight from there
[03:49:41.300 --> 03:49:43.300]  over to Israel
[03:49:43.300 --> 03:49:45.300]  and that's when they started all the
[03:49:45.300 --> 03:49:47.300]  deal about having to bail out Puerto Rico
[03:49:47.300 --> 03:49:49.300]  and
[03:49:49.300 --> 03:49:51.300]  Ray and Paul was on the campaign trail
[03:49:51.300 --> 03:49:53.300]  saying that the Federal Reserve
[03:49:53.300 --> 03:49:55.300]  was part of the government now.
[03:49:55.300 --> 03:49:57.300]  Really?
[03:49:57.300 --> 03:49:59.300]  And then last week
[03:49:59.300 --> 03:50:01.300]  or maybe two weeks ago when they were
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:03.300]  having somebody
[03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:05.300]  storm the White House grounds, you know, some
[03:50:05.300 --> 03:50:07.300]  crazy guy,
[03:50:07.300 --> 03:50:09.300]  Obama did turn over
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:11.300]  all executive powers
[03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:13.300]  to that General
[03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:15.300]  Dunford and he can look it up
[03:50:15.300 --> 03:50:17.300]  on the computer. He says that, you know,
[03:50:17.300 --> 03:50:19.300]  maybe it was a drill,
[03:50:19.300 --> 03:50:21.300]  maybe it was for five minutes or whatever
[03:50:21.300 --> 03:50:23.300]  but he did turn over power to the
[03:50:23.300 --> 03:50:25.300]  General Dunford.
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:27.300]  Well, we'll have to look that up.
[03:50:27.300 --> 03:50:29.300]  I guess that I'm not aware of that
[03:50:29.300 --> 03:50:31.300]  so yeah, that's interesting.
[03:50:31.300 --> 03:50:33.300]  We'll take a look at that. Stay with us
[03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:35.300]  callers when we come back. We're going to take
[03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:37.300]  some more of the calls. We've got Frank in North Carolina,
[03:50:37.300 --> 03:50:39.300]  we've got Anthony in Arizona, so
[03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:41.300]  hang on. We'll be right back after short break.
[03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:43.300]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.300 --> 03:51:03.300]  My name is Don Wiskin and at
[03:51:03.300 --> 03:51:05.300]  42 years old I suffered a massive
[03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:07.300]  heart attack and was told I'd be
[03:51:07.300 --> 03:51:09.300]  on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.300 --> 03:51:11.300]  What did I do?
[03:51:11.300 --> 03:51:13.300]  I created Extendivite,
[03:51:13.300 --> 03:51:15.300]  a garlic and cayenne mix of seven
[03:51:15.300 --> 03:51:17.300]  herbs which rebuilt my heart
[03:51:17.300 --> 03:51:19.300]  and gave me back my life.

[03:54:51.300 --> 03:54:57.460]  God, isn't it? And isn't it interesting that 10 years after the end of World War II, at
[03:54:57.460 --> 03:55:04.380]  the site of the last Nazi victory, we had the Bilderberg meeting. At the Bilderberg meeting,
[03:55:04.380 --> 03:55:08.140]  as we've talked about, of course, we're going to be covering the Bilderberg group when it
[03:55:08.140 --> 03:55:13.460]  meets this year. At that Bilderberg meeting, the very first one, they came out with a blueprint
[03:55:13.460 --> 03:55:19.020]  for European Union, also for the currency, the EU as well. And you can see stories like
[03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:23.540]  this one at the New American that came out a couple of days ago. The real agenda behind
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:30.860]  the CIA spawning the EU. Of course, it's our secret, dark government, the CIA. Hail Hydra,
[03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:37.860]  okay? These people are the government of the globalist elite. And as one editorial pushing
[03:55:37.860 --> 03:55:42.500]  the Brexit says, the EU's commitment to open borders mass immigration has damaged our national
[03:55:42.500 --> 03:55:47.220]  security, as have European laws which stop us from dealing with terrorists. And of course,
[03:55:47.220 --> 03:55:51.780]  it is the deliberate planned takedown of Europe. And we see this over and over again, and yet
[03:55:51.780 --> 03:55:52.780]  people are waking up.
[03:55:52.780 --> 03:55:57.860]  We just saw the Austrian Chancellor get a drubbing in the election, according to an Austrian
[03:55:57.860 --> 03:56:03.580]  paper here. This is a center left party, which has ruled since World War II with a center
[03:56:03.580 --> 03:56:08.780]  right party. And yet they say, no, there's a far right wing party, the freedom party.
[03:56:08.780 --> 03:56:13.100]  Okay, they're going to characterize them as far right wing, why? Because they're opposed
[03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:17.820]  to the globalist takedown of their countries using open borders. And the interesting thing
[03:56:17.820 --> 03:56:22.740]  also is, and Drudge had these stories linked up over the weekend, the domino effect seen
[03:56:22.740 --> 03:56:26.300]  by half of Europeans, they believe that there'll be a lot of other countries that will leave
[03:56:26.300 --> 03:56:33.220]  if the UK exits the EU. And nearly half the voters in EU countries say they want a referendum
[03:56:33.220 --> 03:56:36.380]  as to whether or not to remain in the block. There's a lot of people that are not happy
[03:56:36.380 --> 03:56:40.100]  with the way they're being controlled from one central location. And of course, it's
[03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:43.900]  not Brussels and Belgium that's going to be controlling them. It's going to really
[03:56:43.900 --> 03:56:48.420]  be the ones pulling the strings are going to be the Germans and behind them, the globalists,
[03:56:48.420 --> 03:56:52.260]  the secret government, the multinational corporations who've created this economic union so they
[03:56:52.260 --> 03:56:56.500]  can create a political union. Let's go quickly to your phone calls here. Frank in North Carolina,
[03:56:56.500 --> 03:57:00.020]  you wanted to call about the transgender issues there. Go ahead.
[03:57:00.020 --> 03:57:04.300]  Well, I'm not going to really have time to get into it, but I just I'm kind of suspicious
[03:57:04.300 --> 03:57:11.100]  that the mayor, the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina is the one along with a non governmental
[03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:17.140]  organization, the activist who is a registered sex offender by later, even though the media
[03:57:17.140 --> 03:57:22.580]  here in North Carolina covered that up when it appears that they knew about it. But you
[03:57:22.580 --> 03:57:27.820]  know, the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, she mentioned yesterday that she's proud to
[03:57:27.820 --> 03:57:32.780]  be from North Carolina. And I know the secretary of transportation, I believe his name is
[03:57:32.780 --> 03:57:38.460]  Fox. He's he was he's a former mayor here in Charlotte. I'm just wondering if there's
[03:57:38.460 --> 03:57:44.980]  this wasn't all preplanned and coordinated for this to happen here in North Carolina.
[03:57:44.980 --> 03:57:49.980]  Well, it could be. It could be. And clearly, what they have pointed out is that this is
[03:57:49.980 --> 03:57:54.620]  not a protected class. This is the way the governor of North Carolina has said, he said,
[03:57:54.620 --> 03:57:59.260]  look, if you're going to protect transgenders or transvestites, you need to have the US
[03:57:59.260 --> 03:58:04.220]  Congress say this is a protected class of people. That's not what the Civil Rights Act
[03:58:04.220 --> 03:58:08.540]  was there for. And I think maybe you agree with me. Maybe you don't. I think the correct
[03:58:08.540 --> 03:58:12.900]  way to do this would have been to shut down this regulation in Charlotte and say, we're
[03:58:12.900 --> 03:58:17.940]  going to let people at their own businesses with their private property rights, businesses
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:20.580]  and churches decide what they're going to do with their bathrooms. And we're going to
[03:58:20.580 --> 03:58:23.700]  get the government out of their bathrooms. And we're going to especially get the federal
[03:58:23.700 --> 03:58:28.300]  government out because the federal government has no authority under the Ninth and Tenth
[03:58:28.300 --> 03:58:33.020]  Amendment to do any of this. Join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern for the Infra Wars
