[00:00.000 --> 00:16.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.720 --> 00:27.480]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones the first
[00:27.480 --> 00:34.720]  attack against our second amendment was the national firearms act of 1934 the
[00:34.720 --> 00:39.800]  official reason for this unlawful act was mob violence and the attempted
[00:39.800 --> 00:46.200]  assassination of president FDR this treasonous legislative act made felons
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.920]  out of law-abiding citizens who lawfully owned automatic rifles silencers and
[00:51.920 --> 00:57.160]  short-barreled rifles and shotguns anyone with a modicum of awareness could see
[00:57.160 --> 01:02.760]  the blatant authoritarianism law-abiding citizens were being punished for the
[01:02.760 --> 01:09.160]  inevitable crimes of evil men the next assault on our second amendment rights
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.880]  was the 1968 gun control act officially motivated by the assassinations of JFK
[01:15.880 --> 01:24.200]  MLK and RFK this unlawful legislation bans mail-order gun sales created a
[01:24.200 --> 01:28.960]  federal licensing system and reclassified various military weapons
[01:28.960 --> 01:34.880]  into newly created categories that required federal registration once
[01:34.880 --> 01:40.640]  again turning law-abiding citizens into de facto felons with the stroke of a
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.440]  pen an unalienable right is a right that can't be restrained or repealed by
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.720]  human laws since we are all human we are born with certain inherent natural and
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.360]  unalienable rights those rights include life liberty and the pursuit of
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.720]  happiness this essential equality means that no one is born with a natural
[02:04.720 --> 02:08.960]  right to rule over others without their consent and that governments are
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.080]  obligated to apply the law equally to everyone but president Biden says that
[02:15.080 --> 02:20.560]  these rights are not absolute but no amendment no member to the Constitution
[02:20.560 --> 02:26.160]  is absolute with an insidious executive order Joe Biden is once again
[02:26.160 --> 02:31.920]  unlawfully turning millions of law-abiding citizens into felons with
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.240]  the criminal stroke of a pen introducing red flag laws that provide family
[02:37.240 --> 02:43.320]  members a legal process to bar people from owning guns and nominating gun
[02:43.320 --> 02:50.800]  control advocate David Chapman as director of the ATF confiscation is next
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.720]  and all this while police departments are defunded and criminals are set free
[02:56.720 --> 03:02.680]  you thought your government was there to serve you you were wrong and this is
[03:02.680 --> 03:08.760]  why we have guns this is why we have the second amendment we have made our
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.800]  lives very comfortable and convenient but we are still living in the jungle
[03:13.800 --> 03:20.280]  millions every year defend themselves against violent crimes with the gun they
[03:20.280 --> 03:26.880]  protect themselves against rape robbery and physical harm according to the CDC
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.740]  as many as three million crimes each year are stopped by a law-abiding gun
[03:31.740 --> 03:38.680]  owner over 8,000 each day in a reality where the most dangerous threat is a
[03:38.680 --> 03:46.360]  man guns are the great equalizers there are dangerous evil human beings among
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.400]  us who wish to control and dominate many of them are running our government and
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.720]  attempting to take away our ability to defend ourselves prior to the Bill of
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.120]  Rights when did the people ever have a chance against tyrannical government and
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.700]  when these rights are taken away then the people will forever become slaves to
[04:09.700 --> 04:37.520]  the system free info wars.com this is Greg Rees
[04:39.700 --> 05:04.160]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control
[05:04.160 --> 05:10.620]  big pharma they control academia they control military industrial complex they
[05:10.620 --> 05:15.740]  control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[05:15.740 --> 05:21.820]  world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it
[05:21.820 --> 05:26.420]  is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[05:26.420 --> 05:30.340]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so
[05:30.340 --> 05:35.540]  because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it
[05:35.540 --> 05:42.540]  upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and
[05:42.540 --> 05:46.460]  the free market that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they
[05:46.460 --> 05:51.020]  target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them but the only
[05:51.020 --> 05:55.260]  our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video
[05:55.260 --> 06:02.380]  so we double your efforts we're all on this together
[06:12.820 --> 06:23.020]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance every day that
[06:23.020 --> 06:28.660]  we're still on air is a blessing we are going under true hardcore
[06:28.660 --> 06:33.500]  authoritarianism the decision has been made to basically bring an internet
[06:33.500 --> 06:36.940]  kill switch for all Christians all conservatives the decision has been made
[06:36.940 --> 06:40.980]  to flood us with 600 million people in the next 25 years as part of
[06:40.980 --> 06:48.900]  replacement migration the decision has been made to poison the u.s. population
[06:48.900 --> 06:53.460]  with tainted vaccines and they are going to use a Praetorian guard of the
[06:53.460 --> 06:58.500]  federal government and the FBI the globalists believe to carry this out but
[06:58.500 --> 07:05.140]  if info wars and people like Tucker Carlson and you can come together and
[07:05.140 --> 07:08.180]  recognize the real attack we're under and the fact that this is illegitimate
[07:08.180 --> 07:13.660]  and globalists run and try com run it's game over but you've got to know the
[07:13.660 --> 07:17.620]  documents you've got to know the battle plan now we have James O'Keeffe joining
[07:17.620 --> 07:22.500]  us another one of America's greatest hopes and the great project Veritas who's
[07:22.500 --> 07:26.380]  very active on the Texas border kept joining us the bottom of the hour with
[07:26.380 --> 07:31.300]  the breaking exclusive news on multiple fronts will be in studio with us next
[07:31.300 --> 07:35.020]  week and we're working down there on the border very closely obviously with those
[07:35.020 --> 07:39.420]  great folks oh and Troyer's doing an incredible job he posted a bunch of out
[07:39.420 --> 07:44.140]  of this world videos of anchor baby women 30 women getting off a bus all nine
[07:44.140 --> 07:48.980]  months pregnant and just the most insane stuff going on at night it's even
[07:48.980 --> 07:53.980]  crazier with the human smuggling that's all coming up and just pray for our
[07:53.980 --> 07:56.660]  crew there's other stuff going on behind the scenes I'm not liberated to tell you
[07:56.660 --> 08:01.420]  about at this time but just believe me this is not sensational when I tell you
[08:01.420 --> 08:04.900]  they didn't just take the president off the internet for no reason they're going
[08:04.900 --> 08:09.460]  after everybody and submitting and bowing down and groveling is only going
[08:09.460 --> 08:13.700]  to make it worse they're starting forced inoculations in California of mentally
[08:13.700 --> 08:18.460]  handicapped I mean this is bad folks this is what happens when
[08:18.460 --> 08:23.420]  authoritarians take over it's the same pattern over and over and over and over
[08:23.420 --> 08:30.420]  again and so we're going to be laying it all out here today but I play Tucker
[08:30.420 --> 08:34.620]  Carlson clips a few times a week because he makes great points but we're all
[08:34.620 --> 08:38.340]  Tucker Carlson we're all Alex Jones we're all under attack by the sensors he
[08:38.340 --> 08:42.380]  did a great 15 minute piece that's posted on info wars.com right now if you
[08:42.380 --> 08:45.660]  want to see the whole thing it's in the live show feed we have it posted under
[08:45.660 --> 08:51.180]  my live feed you see the whole thing but I want to hear some of it now because he
[08:51.180 --> 08:56.140]  really lays out the replacement migration UN plan to conquer the US the only
[08:56.140 --> 09:00.580]  party leaves out is it's an official UN plan so while we play this tape the
[09:00.580 --> 09:03.820]  crew is going to show you some of the articles about the 600 million to replace
[09:03.820 --> 09:08.140]  the US 200 million to replace just the French alone they want another 600
[09:08.140 --> 09:11.980]  million plus in Europe we brought in they've only brought in about 50 million
[09:11.980 --> 09:18.100]  Muslims so far you see what that's like and this is their takeover plan and then
[09:18.100 --> 09:21.700]  they have a kept group they put on welfare they never allowed to assimilate
[09:21.700 --> 09:26.420]  into society who then votes for them that they control so Tucker gives you most
[09:26.420 --> 09:30.160]  of the equation it's not the final piece that it's a UN run operation though he
[09:30.160 --> 09:33.340]  alludes to some of that but that's what you get here is the rest of the story
[09:33.340 --> 09:37.900]  but here's Tucker Carlson last night after the ADL and CNN called for him to
[09:37.900 --> 09:42.260]  be removed from the air as a white supremacist here it is last week we said
[09:42.260 --> 09:46.300]  something on television that the usual chorus of hyper aggressive liars is now
[09:46.300 --> 09:50.220]  pretending was somehow highly controversial we're nearly we'd ignore
[09:50.220 --> 09:54.300]  all of this once you've been denounced as a white supremacist for quoting
[09:54.300 --> 09:57.500]  Martin Luther King you realize none of it's real it's all another form of
[09:57.500 --> 10:01.740]  social control honestly who cares what they think but in this one case we thought
[10:01.740 --> 10:05.940]  it might be worth pausing to restate the original point both because it was true
[10:05.940 --> 10:09.940]  and therefore worth saying and also because America badly needs a national
[10:09.940 --> 10:13.980]  conversation about it on Thursday our friend Mark Stein guest host to the
[10:13.980 --> 10:18.020]  7 p.m. hour here on Fox he did a segment on how federal authorities are
[10:18.020 --> 10:22.940]  allowing illegal aliens to fly without ID something in case you haven't noticed
[10:22.940 --> 10:27.540]  you are not permitted to do the following exchange took place in response to that
[10:27.540 --> 10:31.260]  story we're gonna play the entire clips you can be certain we're not leaving out
[10:31.260 --> 10:37.380]  context here it is I'm laughing because this is one of about 10 stories I know
[10:37.380 --> 10:42.660]  you've covered where the government shows preference to people who have shown
[10:42.660 --> 10:48.180]  absolute contempt for our customs our laws our system itself and they're being
[10:48.180 --> 10:52.220]  treated better than American citizens now I know that the left and all the
[10:52.220 --> 10:56.660]  little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term
[10:56.660 --> 11:01.660]  replacement if you suggest the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current
[11:01.660 --> 11:06.300]  electorate the voters now casting ballots with new people more obedient
[11:06.300 --> 11:09.660]  voters from the third world but they become hysterical because that's that's
[11:09.660 --> 11:14.220]  what's happening actually let's just say it that's true if if look if this was
[11:14.220 --> 11:17.380]  happening in your house if you were in sixth grade for example and without
[11:17.380 --> 11:22.100]  telling you your kid your parents adopted a bunch of new siblings and gave
[11:22.100 --> 11:26.260]  them brand new bikes and let them stay up later and help them with their homework
[11:26.260 --> 11:30.900]  and gave them twice the allowance that they gave you you would say to your
[11:30.900 --> 11:34.420]  siblings you know I think we're being replaced by by kids that our parents
[11:34.420 --> 11:38.620]  love more and it'd be kind of hard to argue against you because look at the
[11:38.620 --> 11:43.380]  evidence so this matters on a bunch of different levels but on the most basic
[11:43.380 --> 11:49.100]  level it's a voting rights question in a democracy one person equals one vote if
[11:49.100 --> 11:53.940]  you change the population you dilute the political power of the people who live
[11:53.940 --> 11:59.580]  there so every time they import a new voter I become disenfranchised as a
[11:59.580 --> 12:02.860]  current voter so I don't understand we don't understand this I mean everyone
[12:02.860 --> 12:06.260]  wants to make a racial issue out of it who the you know white replacement there
[12:06.260 --> 12:11.900]  no no this is a voting rights question I have less political power because they're
[12:11.900 --> 12:16.260]  importing a brand new electorate why should I sit back and take that the
[12:16.260 --> 12:20.340]  power that I have in America guaranteed that he gets into more of it I'm gonna
[12:20.340 --> 12:23.820]  play more of it next segment because he lays it all out perfectly and shows the
[12:23.820 --> 12:26.700]  replacement migration and we're gonna put some of the UN documents up on screen
[12:26.700 --> 12:30.860]  for TV viewers to add even more context but Tucker's being really nice here
[12:30.860 --> 12:35.220]  because he knows the globalists want to trick whites into hating brown people so
[12:35.220 --> 12:39.620]  that they then won't adopt the Republic and the Second Amendment and freedom and
[12:39.620 --> 12:46.260]  capitalism but what he's leaving out to is the left energizes the new people
[12:46.260 --> 12:50.540]  that come here with America is evil and racist and bad and white people are
[12:50.540 --> 12:53.900]  inherently evil hell you see it everywhere constantly that's all they do it's
[12:53.900 --> 12:59.660]  all they say it's like parrots just chirping it just at nauseam repeating it
[12:59.660 --> 13:03.660]  over and over again and so Tucker's not playing into that but but they are
[13:03.660 --> 13:11.180]  teaching in all the major schools the US actual Aztec chance and chance about
[13:11.180 --> 13:14.900]  genociding white people and this is what's being taught and everybody knows
[13:14.900 --> 13:18.620]  it so let's not lie to ourselves about that so it's worse than what Tucker's
[13:18.620 --> 13:23.180]  saying it's you and run and they're turning the brown people into racist now
[13:23.180 --> 13:27.500]  it's backfired you had triple the number of black males vote for Trump you had
[13:27.500 --> 13:31.100]  double the amount of black females vote for Trump that's why suddenly the media
[13:31.100 --> 13:35.180]  is like oh we love black people oh liberals want to give you all reparations
[13:35.180 --> 13:39.580]  and free goodies like the illegals they're given $15,000 a piece in New
[13:39.580 --> 13:46.180]  York to nothing for citizens because they're bringing the country down this
[13:46.180 --> 13:50.500]  is this is pure evil ladies and gentlemen this is all completely illegal and
[13:50.500 --> 13:55.540]  and you it gets worse you know what they just announced right in fact pull this
[13:55.540 --> 13:58.580]  up I sent it to you guys and I know it's in the stack but I couldn't find it so
[13:58.580 --> 14:04.740]  just reprint it for me Joe Biden announced illegally he just about my
[14:04.740 --> 14:11.940]  executive fiat four months of paid leave to anybody that takes one of these
[14:11.940 --> 14:16.260]  illegal aliens in and of course you don't have to have a background check
[14:16.260 --> 14:20.140]  either you're just and that's what I told you is the Democrats already do this
[14:20.140 --> 14:22.980]  they already go they already get them through refugee centers through Catholic
[14:22.980 --> 14:26.340]  charities through the Jewish care the charities there's a bunch of them that
[14:26.340 --> 14:31.380]  do it these refugee charities and then there's private non-religious groups do
[14:31.380 --> 14:35.780]  it as well it's a whole industry it's all business and what they do is a lot of
[14:35.780 --> 14:40.700]  these households house 5 10 15 20 of these people hell they'll put trailers in
[14:40.700 --> 14:44.380]  their backyard and just warehouse the children you name it and then they get
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.060]  welfare checks and then they also make them work in sweatshops and restaurants
[14:48.060 --> 14:52.620]  while they're at it and if they don't do what they're told then they call and
[14:52.620 --> 14:55.860]  they're deported because you notice the Democrats decide who they can let in and
[14:55.860 --> 15:01.380]  who they won't notice Carlson makes the point that polls got to experience 50
[15:01.380 --> 15:05.860]  something years 60 years of communism so they really hate it and most Polish
[15:05.860 --> 15:11.060]  immigrants vote Republican it's about 7 to 7 to 1 and in some estimates and so he
[15:11.060 --> 15:15.620]  makes the point if we had 200,000 polls on our southern border that it'd be an
[15:15.620 --> 15:21.260]  emergency there'd be a wall built in a week they'd all be deported because you
[15:21.260 --> 15:25.620]  see they vote Republican because they want America they want guns they want
[15:25.620 --> 15:30.180]  private property they want what they didn't have under the Soviet Union they've
[15:30.180 --> 15:33.860]  already been through the scam and so no no no we don't want those in fact if you
[15:33.860 --> 15:37.380]  look they won't even if you're Polish it's almost impossible to even get to the
[15:37.380 --> 15:41.940]  US now because the Democrats do not want you here but if you're coming from
[15:41.940 --> 15:46.100]  some third world place like Venezuela already prime for communism baby come on
[15:46.100 --> 15:49.980]  up here and then they take your cell phone away lock your ass up in a trailer
[15:49.980 --> 15:54.220]  get welfare in your name and then $15,000 checks get sent to your masters
[15:54.220 --> 15:59.340]  these the illegals aren't getting this money epic is one of only a handful of
[15:59.340 --> 16:05.580]  domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they
[16:05.580 --> 16:09.260]  know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and
[16:09.260 --> 16:13.500]  engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why
[16:13.500 --> 16:17.700]  they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or
[16:17.700 --> 16:21.060]  want to register a domain or what help building a website or what servers or
[16:21.060 --> 16:25.180]  any other major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go
[16:25.180 --> 16:30.700]  to info wars domains.com and follow that link you get all their services at the
[16:30.700 --> 16:36.460]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes
[16:36.460 --> 16:41.020]  to fund the info war then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[16:41.020 --> 16:45.580]  of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open
[16:45.580 --> 16:48.780]  free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open
[16:48.780 --> 16:53.820]  and what was free so info wars domains.com the revolution starts there
[16:53.820 --> 16:59.700]  info wars domains.com take action now it's very simple every household not just
[16:59.700 --> 17:04.260]  in America but worldwide should be taking a high-quality multi-vitamin mineral
[17:04.260 --> 17:08.700]  every single day but so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even
[17:08.700 --> 17:13.420]  absorbed in fact in many cases are toxic but if I'm a mineral fusion in stock

[18:34.740 --> 18:40.220]  breaking news it's always huge with Veritas this time internal information
[18:40.220 --> 18:45.900]  from CNN from their director CNN director on how they stage everything now
[18:45.900 --> 18:54.900]  we already know this you can see it Mrs. Mrs. First Lady wearing fishnets
[18:54.900 --> 19:00.620]  Biden wearing aviator jackets and aviator glasses and running up the Gantry
[19:00.620 --> 19:05.900]  all of this is scripted by CNN so that is coming up this is breaking as we
[19:05.900 --> 19:09.820]  speak James O'Keefe next segment let's get back to Tucker Carlson because he
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.220]  knocked it out of the park he really should watch the whole 15 minute monologue
[19:13.220 --> 19:17.100]  it's on info wars.com again the live show feed of the show today under our live
[19:17.100 --> 19:20.900]  feed and we have the full monologue posted right there but here is what he
[19:20.900 --> 19:27.460]  had to say about the the war on America's existence and literally oh here's
[19:27.460 --> 19:30.980]  $15,000 for everybody in New York if you're an illegal alien citizens get
[19:30.980 --> 19:35.740]  nothing oh and oh you get free tuition in California real alien citizens don't I
[19:35.740 --> 19:39.020]  mean this is a joke but we just put up with it because they hold up the magic
[19:39.020 --> 19:42.980]  thing of oh you're racist and then they're exploiting these very people got a
[19:42.980 --> 19:46.700]  bunch of articles on it right here but Biden administration offers four months
[19:46.700 --> 19:50.780]  paid leave to federal employees who care for illegal alien children yeah these
[19:50.780 --> 19:54.780]  agencies don't have anything else to do oh but they got the FBI to arrest 400 plus
[19:54.780 --> 19:58.780]  people that were at the Capitol former Long Island bar owner sentenced to 60
[19:58.780 --> 20:02.100]  years in prison for sex trafficking forced labor and immigration crime on
[20:02.100 --> 20:07.660]  Long Island that's how all this works ladies and gentlemen so here's Tucker
[20:07.660 --> 20:11.540]  Carlson laying out with the Democrats admit and CNN and the ADL say boy god
[20:11.540 --> 20:16.340]  him take him off a year. This is a voting rights question I have less
[20:16.340 --> 20:21.020]  political power because they're importing a brand-new electorate why should I sit
[20:21.020 --> 20:25.100]  back and take that the power that I have as an American guaranteed at birth is
[20:25.100 --> 20:29.460]  one man one vote and they're deluding it no they're not allowed to do that why
[20:29.460 --> 20:35.980]  are we putting up with this so it's a political question obviously at least
[20:35.980 --> 20:39.940]  one prediction came true right away all those little gatekeepers on Twitter did
[20:39.940 --> 20:44.140]  become hysterical based on the last four days jumping up and down furiously
[20:44.140 --> 20:48.940]  trying once again to pull the show off the air once again they will fail though
[20:48.940 --> 20:54.300]  it isn't using to see them keep at it they get so enraged it's a riot but why
[20:54.300 --> 20:58.300]  all the anger if someone says something you think is wrong as your first
[20:58.300 --> 21:03.500]  instinct to hurt them probably not normal people don't respond that way if you
[21:03.500 --> 21:07.340]  hear something you think is incorrect you try to correct it but getting the
[21:07.340 --> 21:11.140]  facts right is hardly the point of this exercise the point is to prevent
[21:11.140 --> 21:15.180]  unauthorized conversations from starting in the first place shut up racist no more
[21:15.180 --> 21:19.860]  questions you've heard that before you wonder how much longer they imagine
[21:19.860 --> 21:23.620]  Americans are going to go along with this an entire country forced to lie
[21:23.620 --> 21:28.340]  about everything all the time it can't go on forever but you can see why they're
[21:28.340 --> 21:33.380]  trying it demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party's political
[21:33.380 --> 21:37.380]  ambitions let's say that again for emphasis because it is the secret to the
[21:37.380 --> 21:43.020]  entire immigration debate demographic change is the key to the Democratic
[21:43.020 --> 21:48.460]  Party's political ambitions in order to win and maintain power Democrats plan
[21:48.460 --> 21:52.500]  to change the population of the country they're no longer trying to win you over
[21:52.500 --> 21:56.420]  with their program they're obviously not trying to improve your life they don't
[21:56.420 --> 21:59.820]  even really care about your vote anymore their goal is to make you irrelevant
[21:59.820 --> 22:05.220]  that is provably true and because it's true it drives them absolutely crazy
[22:05.220 --> 22:09.940]  when you say it out loud a hurt dog barks they scream about how noting the
[22:09.940 --> 22:14.500]  obvious is immoral you're a racist if you dare to repeat things that they
[22:14.500 --> 22:19.100]  themselves proudly say most people go along with this absurd standard they
[22:19.100 --> 22:23.020]  dutifully shut up they don't think they have a choice but no matter what they're
[22:23.020 --> 22:27.300]  allowed to say in public everyone understands the truth when you change
[22:27.300 --> 22:32.020]  who votes you change who wins that fact has nothing inherently to do with race
[22:32.020 --> 22:36.940]  or nationality it's the nature of democracy it is always true you can
[22:36.940 --> 22:40.820]  watch it happen you probably have all across the country we have seen huge
[22:40.820 --> 22:44.860]  changes in election outcomes caused by demographic change new people move in
[22:44.860 --> 22:48.380]  and they vote differently as a practical matter doesn't matter what they look
[22:48.380 --> 22:51.820]  like or where they're from even all that matters it's is that they have
[22:51.820 --> 22:55.900]  different political views this is every bit is true and the migrants come from
[22:55.900 --> 23:00.460]  Brookline is when they come from Oaxaca in Vermont white liberals fleeing the
[23:00.460 --> 23:05.180]  mess they made in New York turned the state blue as recently as 1992 Vermont
[23:05.180 --> 23:09.100]  was reliably Republican hard to believe as that is Vermont is now a parody of
[23:09.100 --> 23:13.540]  lifestyle liberalism that's demographic change at work you see the same thing
[23:13.540 --> 23:16.580]  happening in the state of New Hampshire's refugees from Massachusetts flood
[23:16.580 --> 23:21.100]  north and bring their bad habits with them Montana Idaho Nevada all face
[23:21.100 --> 23:24.740]  similar problems the affluent liberals who wrecks California aren't sticking
[23:24.740 --> 23:28.300]  around to see how that ends they're running to the pallid hideaways of
[23:28.300 --> 23:32.100]  Boise and Bozeman distorting local culture and real estate markets as they
[23:32.100 --> 23:36.100]  do it pretty soon people who are born in the Mountain West won't be able to live
[23:36.100 --> 23:40.740]  there they'll be yes replaced by private equity barons yoga instructors and
[23:40.740 --> 23:44.380]  senior vice presidents from Google beautiful places are always in danger
[23:44.380 --> 23:49.020]  of being overrun by the worst people ask anyone to grew up in Aspen but in most
[23:49.020 --> 23:52.420]  of this country it is immigration from other nations more than anything else
[23:52.420 --> 23:55.940]  that has driven political transformation and this is different from what we've
[23:55.940 --> 23:59.940]  seen in Vermont Americans have every right to move to new states if they
[23:59.940 --> 24:04.020]  want even if they have silly political opinions but our leaders have no right
[24:04.020 --> 24:08.180]  to encourage foreigners to move to this country in order to change election
[24:08.180 --> 24:13.860]  results doing that is an attack on our democracy yet for decades our leaders
[24:13.860 --> 24:16.500]  have done just that and they keep doing it and they keep doing it because it
[24:16.500 --> 24:21.660]  works consider Virginia the counties across the river from Washington DC now
[24:21.660 --> 24:24.700]  contain one of the largest immigrant communities in the United States most
[24:24.700 --> 24:27.460]  these immigrants are hard-working and decent people many have been very
[24:27.460 --> 24:30.980]  successful in business good for them but they also have very different
[24:30.980 --> 24:34.260]  politics from the people who used to live there their votes have allowed
[24:34.260 --> 24:38.020]  Democrats to seize control of the entire state and change it into something
[24:38.020 --> 24:42.820]  unrecognizable governor blackface clan robes in Richmond owes his job to
[24:42.820 --> 24:46.620]  immigrants in Arlington and Falls Church similar trends are now underway in
[24:46.620 --> 24:51.180]  Georgia and North Carolina and many other states mass immigration increases the
[24:51.180 --> 24:57.140]  power of the Democratic Party period that's the reason Democrats support it
[24:57.140 --> 25:02.140]  it's the only reason if 200,000 immigrants from Poland showed up at our
[25:02.140 --> 25:05.940]  southern border tomorrow Kamala Harris wouldn't promise them health care why
[25:05.940 --> 25:11.260]  simple polls tend to vote Republican that's the difference Democrats would
[25:11.260 --> 25:15.260]  deport those migrants immediately no more hand-wringing about how we're a
[25:15.260 --> 25:19.740]  nation of immigrants hundreds of thousands of likely Republicans massing
[25:19.740 --> 25:23.500]  in Tijuana that would qualify as a national crisis we have a border wall
[25:23.500 --> 25:28.420]  by Wednesday for Democrats the point of immigration is not to show compassion to
[25:28.420 --> 25:33.300]  refugees much less to improve our country it's definitely not about racial
[25:33.300 --> 25:37.460]  justice mass immigration hurts African-Americans maybe more than anyone
[25:37.460 --> 25:44.420]  else immigration is a means to electoral advantage it is about power more
[25:44.420 --> 25:49.460]  Democratic voters mean more power for Democrats admit all of this we let it
[25:49.460 --> 25:52.100]  out yesterday we showed their own articles their own admissions you see it
[25:52.100 --> 25:57.180]  everywhere the universities teach it and then out comes the ADL and Brian
[25:57.180 --> 26:03.580]  Stelter and CNN to say we've never seen such white supremacism because we don't
[26:03.580 --> 26:10.700]  want 600 million people brought in by a UN refugee program and then given all
[26:10.700 --> 26:16.220]  these freebies to get them to come here which is the same thing Europe did
[26:16.220 --> 26:19.140]  remember Europe 10 years ago sort of offering all this free stuff the quote
[26:19.140 --> 26:25.660]  migrants including young women that's why half the rapes in Europe are the
[26:25.660 --> 26:28.580]  illegals that have come in that the statistic out today half the rapes in
[26:28.580 --> 26:31.980]  Europe are a minority of less than 10% of people because they come and they
[26:31.980 --> 26:34.500]  just believe you're supposed to rape everybody I mean we were told we're
[26:34.500 --> 26:39.220]  getting women and they run PSAs in Germany and Sweden for middle school
[26:39.220 --> 26:43.500]  girls saying get yourself a 25 year old Muslim have sex with him get married and
[26:43.500 --> 26:47.260]  it shows 14 year old girls on TV living with 25 year old men and how happy they
[26:47.260 --> 26:51.220]  are I mean this is like literally the total takeover by design we'll be right
[26:51.220 --> 26:56.500]  back hey we got free women get on up here rape them do wherever you want I'm
[26:56.500 --> 27:01.900]  not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[27:01.900 --> 27:05.860]  info versus that if you're paying attention you know we've done together
[27:05.860 --> 27:13.420]  but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they
[27:13.420 --> 27:17.780]  are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shudder
[27:17.780 --> 27:23.060]  and silence a human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything
[27:23.060 --> 27:25.740]  we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you warned your
[27:25.740 --> 27:29.140]  friends and family about it's about to be true so it's now that your
[27:29.140 --> 27:33.580]  credibility is way up the power structures of the silence those of us
[27:33.580 --> 27:40.020]  that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we
[27:40.020 --> 27:46.020]  have the power but the Sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we
[27:46.020 --> 27:50.100]  have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long dark night
[27:50.100 --> 27:54.660]  doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[27:56.460 --> 28:02.860]  as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have
[28:02.860 --> 28:08.220]  to understand that this is all a test this experience this wife on this planet
[28:08.220 --> 28:15.060]  is a reckoning it's God giving us a chance to work things out with third
[28:15.060 --> 28:19.380]  dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we
[28:19.380 --> 28:24.140]  want to go to and it really does come down to that so as saddest things are
[28:24.140 --> 28:27.180]  and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize
[28:27.180 --> 28:31.860]  that God is the author of our consciousness God is the author of us
[28:31.860 --> 28:37.820]  having our own will God is the author of us having free will and the free will
[28:37.820 --> 28:42.340]  is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this
[28:42.340 --> 28:47.660]  whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the and the mass cult it's
[28:47.660 --> 28:51.100]  all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty
[28:51.100 --> 28:54.300]  you're ugly you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in
[28:54.300 --> 28:58.860]  the image of God the creator of the universe I am a very humble person but
[28:58.860 --> 29:02.900]  I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the globalist attack
[29:02.900 --> 29:07.060]  of humanity all the terrible things are unfolding I want you to know a lot of
[29:07.060 --> 29:12.620]  positive things are happening as well I'm a public figure so I get to see things
[29:12.620 --> 29:15.940]  the Republic doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs
[29:15.940 --> 29:21.220]  or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or
[29:21.220 --> 29:26.620]  industry people are really really away in the establishment they don't want to
[29:26.620 --> 29:30.300]  go along with the globalist but they're scared they're looking for leadership
[29:30.300 --> 29:35.260]  well that's where info comes in you fund us you support info store.com

[32:01.900 --> 32:05.460]  because I wanted to be part of that you talk about election meddling and then
[32:05.460 --> 32:09.420]  then lying and saying oh we're not partisan wow so these are really
[32:09.420 --> 32:14.380]  political donations in kind this is what they said the Russians did James O'Keefe

[32:37.580 --> 32:44.780]  helping biden through his term talking about the network being propaganda
[32:44.780 --> 32:49.740]  saying things that we've all suspected trying to make biden look healthy this
[32:49.740 --> 32:55.020]  are his words painting him even painting him as a young man with aviator
[32:55.020 --> 33:01.580]  shades he talks about how the network is engaging in propaganda and he says
[33:01.580 --> 33:04.820]  this things over a series of meetings that are undercover reporter bragging
[33:04.820 --> 33:08.780]  that they got Trump out of office he says quote I am a hundred percent gonna
[33:08.780 --> 33:13.500]  say it if it wasn't for CNN I don't know that Trump would have got voted out and
[33:13.500 --> 33:19.460]  he says the network is trying to help biden through his term so they talk
[33:19.460 --> 33:24.940]  about how they were trying to create a story or make a story in regarding
[33:24.940 --> 33:29.460]  Trump's health and they any characterizes it as propaganda so that this is one of
[33:29.460 --> 33:34.540]  those stories that kind of speaks for itself I believe that CNN is putting
[33:34.540 --> 33:37.860]  together a comment right now we believe that this man will probably be fired
[33:37.860 --> 33:42.740]  we're not sure how CNN is going to respond it's already been covered by
[33:42.740 --> 33:47.060]  media this is breaking news we just broke the story 20 minutes ago and this is a
[33:47.060 --> 33:51.380]  multi-part series there you have biden and his aviator shades the network
[33:51.380 --> 33:56.940]  CNN admitting that they're trying to make him look young so CNN is helping a
[33:56.940 --> 34:02.580]  federal candidate for office and and we like comment from both zucker and
[34:02.580 --> 34:08.380]  CNN's parent company Warner media we'd like to know what what AT&T has to say
[34:08.380 --> 34:11.780]  about this we'd like to know what war media has to say about this and what is
[34:11.780 --> 34:16.780]  this man's status as an employee after making all these admissions well it's
[34:16.780 --> 34:20.260]  great to have this information because when they gaslight us and say it's
[34:20.260 --> 34:24.300]  preposterous that they are you know trying to cover for Joe Biden maybe
[34:24.300 --> 34:27.940]  here's here here's the premeditated proof but watching them is that proof as
[34:27.940 --> 34:32.340]  well where do you expect this to go because having a major director a major
[34:32.340 --> 34:36.420]  producer of shows there admitting that they help get him elected and that their
[34:36.420 --> 34:43.140]  job was getting elected I mean isn't that a campaign donation in a way I think
[34:43.140 --> 34:46.940]  it's devastating Alex I think we've done five four or five investigations of
[34:46.940 --> 34:51.420]  CNN this is probably the most devastating content we have ever released
[34:51.420 --> 34:56.980]  and this is just part one of a multi-video series so I think they're
[34:56.980 --> 35:00.780]  just scared and they don't know what to do and they don't want to say because if
[35:00.780 --> 35:04.980]  they fire the man that's going to just draw more attention to this and if they
[35:04.980 --> 35:08.940]  don't fire the man and they agree with it well that so I mean I think this is
[35:08.940 --> 35:13.900]  just literally breaking news here and just trying to get this information out
[35:13.900 --> 35:19.740]  to your audience he says he came to CNN this is Charlie Chester CNN's director
[35:19.740 --> 35:25.980]  came to CNN quote because he wanted to be part of getting Trump out unquote so
[35:25.980 --> 35:30.220]  this is a guy who is bragging about it and I think that they you know your to
[35:30.220 --> 35:34.540]  your point is it a federal campaign donation well it ought to be and this
[35:34.540 --> 35:38.260]  goes to the really the heart of everything in this country this is this is
[35:38.260 --> 35:43.180]  the whole problem we have the most trusted name in news this is a network
[35:43.180 --> 35:49.500]  which Google and Facebook and Twitter algorithms prefer their content and their
[35:49.500 --> 35:55.580]  directors of of of their news networks are saying that they are preferring a
[35:55.580 --> 36:00.420]  certain political candidate and he says quote without saying that's what it was
[36:00.420 --> 36:05.020]  so this man is admitting that we're doing this but we're hiding what we're
[36:05.020 --> 36:08.180]  doing and we don't want people to know that that's what our intent is I mean
[36:08.180 --> 36:13.220]  this is this is potentially the biggest story in project Veritas history and I
[36:13.220 --> 36:17.420]  look forward to getting a comment from CNN in the coming and you know over the
[36:17.420 --> 36:23.340]  course of the afternoon well watching the first lady the frauds are in chief's
[36:23.340 --> 36:30.980]  wife wear fishnets and then he's wearing Tom Cruise top gun outfits when
[36:30.980 --> 36:34.820]  he's not falling down he can barely talk I mean none of this is working on the
[36:34.820 --> 36:38.340]  public but but as you said this is your biggest CNN story maybe one of your
[36:38.340 --> 36:42.300]  biggest ever period because you you have the open and shut where they admit the
[36:42.300 --> 36:45.620]  fraud that they're lying to people on purpose how they're getting away with
[36:45.620 --> 36:49.340]  it and how they were successful so you have the entire chain of events there
[36:49.340 --> 36:54.140]  really what they call an open and shut case a fraud well what I and I think the
[36:54.140 --> 36:58.100]  biggest the most fraudulent thing that's been covered in this investigation so
[36:58.100 --> 37:01.620]  far is him saying that they don't want people to know that's what their intent
[37:01.620 --> 37:06.220]  was so my point to Charlie Chester Jeff sucker and Jake Tapper and Anderson
[37:06.220 --> 37:11.780]  Cooper and Anna Cabrera I also spoke this will be coming out this afternoon this
[37:11.780 --> 37:16.180]  evening I spoke with Jim Shudeau who's a host at CNN is I said why do you guys
[37:16.180 --> 37:20.740]  want to hide it why not just say this publicly what what why does Charlie
[37:20.740 --> 37:25.020]  Chester the director say that without telling people that's what our intent
[37:25.020 --> 37:29.460]  that to me is the strongest line of the whole expose where he says we're trying
[37:29.460 --> 37:32.020]  to get Trump out but we don't want people to know that's what we're doing well
[37:32.020 --> 37:36.420]  why not tell people why not tell people and if it's gonna take litigation then
[37:36.420 --> 37:41.300]  let's sue let's sue the crap out of CNN and let's get them under oath saying
[37:41.300 --> 37:46.700]  that's what it is because to me Charlie Chester saying that they're trying to
[37:46.700 --> 37:52.340]  help Biden through his term get Trump out he came to the network to do that but
[37:52.340 --> 37:57.020]  he's hiding that from people it's like I'm fine with you being a network that is
[37:57.020 --> 38:01.820]  a arm of the of the Biden administration but I think you need to tell your
[38:01.820 --> 38:06.500]  audience and tell your stakeholders AT&T and Warner Media that's precisely what
[38:06.500 --> 38:10.260]  your stated mission objective is but do not tell the people that you're the most
[38:10.260 --> 38:14.500]  trusted name of news and then lie about it and go around and police the internet
[38:14.500 --> 38:19.300]  with Brian Stelter and the ADL had everybody saying everyone that is
[38:19.300 --> 38:23.620]  conservative is a Nazi and demanding that they lose their license and be
[38:23.620 --> 38:28.740]  taken off cable and taken off satellites I mean this is a partisan group trying to
[38:28.740 --> 38:32.820]  get people that don't agree with them taken off the air and when CNN snaps its
[38:32.820 --> 38:37.180]  fingers and ordered media platform they did it and now they go around ordering
[38:37.180 --> 38:41.500]  folks to take off Tucker Carlson they want you destroyed I know you just want
[38:41.500 --> 38:46.340]  a big case in court where they prove the New York Times did lie about you when
[38:46.340 --> 38:51.140]  they said you manufacture stuff I mean none of that's true so so you know the
[38:51.140 --> 38:54.100]  good news is we're starting to see subtraction here and more and more their
[38:54.100 --> 38:57.340]  lies are coming up and I think people are gonna be inspired to go blow the
[38:57.340 --> 39:02.300]  whistle Veritas tips at proton mail comm as we're that's Veritas tips at proton
[39:02.300 --> 39:06.540]  mail I know you have your own proton mail people are coming out now and they're
[39:06.540 --> 39:11.660]  shocked by this and I'll tell you this is part one Alex it gets worse I think
[39:11.660 --> 39:15.860]  it gets much worse we're gonna we're gonna do it the next story is about
[39:15.860 --> 39:19.780]  about how that the health data that they that they manufacture and some of
[39:19.780 --> 39:24.020]  things that they've painted and they had the admissions to this and this is
[39:24.020 --> 39:26.900]  really the heart of it and people say well no one watches CNN well you know
[39:26.900 --> 39:31.860]  what Google Twitter and Facebook prefer CNN and the New York Times in their
[39:31.860 --> 39:36.540]  algorithm they get marching orders from CNN CNN creates the talking points for
[39:36.540 --> 39:40.380]  all of the other parents people need to go to project Veritas dot com and share
[39:40.380 --> 39:44.180]  the video share the article that CNN doesn't want seen we're posting the full
[39:44.180 --> 39:49.180]  article video and info wars dot com and news wars dot com CNN admits that they
[39:49.180 --> 39:53.580]  are total fraud and engaged in fraud and engaged in propaganda 60 seconds
[39:53.580 --> 39:58.820]  closing points James O'Keefe now this country the media in this country is the
[39:58.820 --> 40:02.220]  problem you know government is downstream for media I've been doing this for a
[40:02.220 --> 40:07.060]  decade and I this is this one is really near and dear to my heart because this
[40:07.060 --> 40:10.980]  is the problem in this country that there's a manufacturing of consent
[40:10.980 --> 40:15.700]  people are being lied to and it's disgraceful and these trillion dollar
[40:15.700 --> 40:21.140]  tech companies are preferring CNN's news if we want to call it that in their
[40:21.140 --> 40:25.260]  algorithms and we have a director on tape saying it's all propaganda we're
[40:25.260 --> 40:28.740]  just trying to help political candidates this is disgraceful this is
[40:28.740 --> 40:33.140]  everything right here so your audience needs to tweet at every so tweet write
[40:33.140 --> 40:37.220]  emails write letters put pressure on AT&T and war media that's right
[40:37.220 --> 40:42.020]  Democrat members of the FCC have called for myself to be taken off air drudge
[40:42.020 --> 40:44.820]  before he went to the other side and everybody else saying that we're
[40:44.820 --> 40:47.740]  political contributions when we're honest about the fact that we love America
[40:47.740 --> 40:50.980]  but we're not part of a party they are saying they're aligned with a party
[40:50.980 --> 40:56.140]  James O'Keefe look forward to you being in studio next week God bless you I'm
[40:56.140 --> 41:01.820]  gonna say it again I am not lecturing you I'm lecturing myself I need to take

[43:10.100 --> 43:13.980]  all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun
[43:13.980 --> 43:19.060]  like me I was loaded up the sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[43:19.060 --> 43:23.540]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[43:23.540 --> 43:29.660]  gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your
[43:29.660 --> 43:33.340]  other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[43:33.340 --> 43:36.740]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[43:36.740 --> 43:41.380]  taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I
[43:41.380 --> 43:45.740]  started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[43:45.740 --> 43:51.100]  wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so
[43:51.100 --> 43:56.940]  anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin I
[43:56.940 --> 44:01.860]  don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast I love it on

[44:58.820 --> 45:04.300]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[45:28.820 --> 45:43.820]  you better turn me loose you better set me free
[45:47.820 --> 45:53.140]  live wire my friends Alex Jones here at FactLive very honored to be here with you
[45:53.140 --> 45:59.700]  on this April 13th Tuesday transmission you know I'm not complaining at the
[45:59.700 --> 46:04.100]  crew I'm not complaining at myself I'm just pointing this out of the listeners
[46:04.100 --> 46:08.340]  that we all need to appreciate info wars we all need to appreciate project
[46:08.340 --> 46:11.900]  Veritas we all need to appreciate the collector Carlson we need to appreciate
[46:11.900 --> 46:14.900]  Rush Limbaugh he wasn't perfect but he was pro-american pro-gun and he's dead
[46:14.900 --> 46:22.580]  now these are authoritarians conquering us taking us over and Owen Schreuer and
[46:22.580 --> 46:27.340]  crew did an incredible job last night shooting seven different out of this
[46:27.340 --> 46:33.620]  world clips and I noticed that a few of the videos when I got up at 5 a.m. this
[46:33.620 --> 46:39.500]  morning had been posted inside other articles that's how I got reminded to
[46:39.500 --> 46:44.300]  go to Band-Aid video and see what Owen did and then look I love our crew I
[46:44.300 --> 46:47.500]  called Paul Watson like five this morning because you know he's six hours
[46:47.500 --> 46:52.420]  ahead and I said please do a story on this and he didn't maybe is doing one
[46:52.420 --> 46:56.260]  he's coming on the third hour he's a great guy but I guarantee you if somebody
[46:56.260 --> 47:00.580]  else had these videos it'd be posted everywhere but see everyone got taught
[47:00.580 --> 47:06.020]  early you don't promote info wars or you get censored and then when you get
[47:06.020 --> 47:12.540]  censored nobody will promote about you either and so it's just a constant that
[47:12.540 --> 47:17.780]  the most powerful stuff we've got is hidden under a bushel don't hide your
[47:17.780 --> 47:23.100]  light under a bushel as the Bible says let it shine and I tell myself that we
[47:23.100 --> 47:27.860]  you know I built up the spars 2025 2028 document for two days because it is
[47:27.860 --> 47:32.020]  important and so it got seen tens of millions of times and is a huge story
[47:32.020 --> 47:35.100]  and the former head of defense intelligence endorsed it that's causing
[47:35.100 --> 47:38.180]  congressional investigations I can tell you right now we've got new documents
[47:38.180 --> 47:43.420]  are important so people expect fanfare for something important why is the
[47:43.420 --> 47:46.100]  Super Bowl important when you see all this fanfare but it's not really important
[47:46.100 --> 47:53.100]  is it it's not socially important to the future or any of our lives other than
[47:53.100 --> 47:57.380]  when Tom Brady didn't wear a mask and buck the system but but we give it such
[47:57.380 --> 48:01.700]  fanfare when the literal end of the of our civilization as we know it is being
[48:01.700 --> 48:05.300]  taken over by Claus Schwab the UN and Bill Gates they admit it's the end of
[48:05.300 --> 48:09.460]  the industrial world they say you'll never take the mask off you'll never have
[48:09.460 --> 48:12.420]  a job you'll never be able to be close to people we're gonna get rid of the
[48:12.420 --> 48:15.980]  family let them dozens of shots a year even though leave your house they
[48:15.980 --> 48:19.780]  said all that years ago in white papers people are like how do you know this I
[48:19.780 --> 48:28.780]  remember 14 months ago and this all started in February sitting in the
[48:28.780 --> 48:36.660]  conference room with my managers are they're great people and and saying to
[48:36.660 --> 48:42.420]  them they're never gonna reopen till we demand it this is permanent and we are
[48:42.420 --> 48:47.300]  a essential business even under federal and state law as media but if we don't
[48:47.300 --> 48:50.780]  believe we're essential they'll even get rid of that and I had all the federal
[48:50.780 --> 48:55.860]  documents and people didn't believe me and of course I'm sitting in that
[48:55.860 --> 49:01.700]  meeting and I'm up putting the crew down I'm putting this is an illustration when
[49:01.700 --> 49:05.020]  a lot of my crew didn't think they were even allowed to leave their house that's
[49:05.020 --> 49:09.380]  when the Psyop first hit and I said this is a UN takeover Psyop it's never gonna
[49:09.380 --> 49:13.260]  end unless we say no and I said believe me and I even got lawyers involved so
[49:13.260 --> 49:16.340]  the crew would believe me most the crew did some did and I'm not putting people
[49:16.340 --> 49:20.620]  down I'm explaining that I understand why they didn't believe that they'll try
[49:20.620 --> 49:22.900]  to never end the lockdown in which they've done an area is they're able to
[49:22.900 --> 49:27.500]  get away with it how long is the lockdown eat go how long you put up with it but
[49:27.500 --> 49:31.740]  my own crew was sitting there doubting me which is fine because I don't mind
[49:31.740 --> 49:34.260]  being doubted because I'm wrong sometimes I wish I was wrong a lot of the
[49:34.260 --> 49:40.460]  time I'm not but I'm sitting there in the meeting getting mad because I'm
[49:40.460 --> 49:43.580]  already looking years into the future and seeing their whole operation and
[49:43.580 --> 49:47.820]  knowing what they're gonna do let me give you an example here's my film from
[49:47.820 --> 49:52.780]  14 years ago on DVD that they censored off the internet for free at Band-Aut
[49:52.780 --> 49:55.940]  video in the film section hope you share it you want a DVD to have and burn
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.860]  copies and educate others we're selling it very close to cost as low as $3.95 a
[50:00.860 --> 50:05.500]  piece at infowarstore.com when you buy them in bulk
[50:06.180 --> 50:13.540]  what is it overhead shop please the Alex Jones film in-game blueprint for
[50:13.540 --> 50:17.980]  global enslavement what is it it's a UN building with a skull and it says the
[50:17.980 --> 50:21.500]  UN's gonna carry out a worldwide medical tyranny with forced inoculations
[50:21.500 --> 50:25.380]  sterilization and then mass death and it lays it all out they want you dead on
[50:25.380 --> 50:29.060]  the back now people are freaking out about the film now because everything in
[50:29.060 --> 50:34.540]  it has basically come true except the last part the New York Times wrote
[50:34.540 --> 50:38.380]  reviews of this attacking it saying I'm insane I believe the elite want to live
[50:38.380 --> 50:42.140]  forever and have a plan to depopulate us through forced inoculation it's in
[50:42.140 --> 50:50.740]  their plans people and look it's healthy to doubt stuff I'm the same way I
[50:50.740 --> 50:56.660]  thought they'd roll out a big beta test then roll out bigger attacks years later
[50:56.660 --> 51:01.380]  no they're gonna just roll it out right away and so I get why people want to
[51:01.380 --> 51:06.220]  think that this isn't as scary as it is because it is scary and I've been having
[51:06.220 --> 51:12.740]  to psychologically get myself ready for this too I've been very upset I've been
[51:12.740 --> 51:15.540]  a jerk to my family some have been a jerk to some of the crew and I apologize
[51:15.540 --> 51:18.420]  publicly for that I just blew up at Owen on air for no reason yesterday because
[51:18.420 --> 51:21.060]  they didn't do the shot where I wanted it from down there I wanted it from the
[51:21.060 --> 51:25.380]  Catholic smuggling center and not the other smuggling center no reason for
[51:25.380 --> 51:29.900]  that but I get so desperate because I've literally got all these incredible
[51:29.900 --> 51:35.540]  articles incredible reports bombshell information and I'm mad at myself that
[51:35.540 --> 51:41.700]  I'm not doing enough to cover it all but I tell you if the rest of the public had
[51:41.700 --> 51:46.580]  an attitude like that we would not even be in this position we're in I mean
[51:46.580 --> 51:50.900]  folks this is only gonna get worse till we stop it
[51:50.900 --> 51:55.420]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are the worst people on earth and they're fully committed
[51:55.420 --> 51:59.420]  to this takeover dividing us conquering us a hundred different ways poisoning the
[51:59.420 --> 52:02.460]  hell out of us and all that evidence is mounting I'll cover it the start of the
[52:02.460 --> 52:06.580]  next hour you notice they pulled the J and J shot because it's killing so many
[52:06.580 --> 52:10.900]  people then they try to spin it go one woman died that's one woman in one town
[52:10.900 --> 52:19.140]  thousands of died I know people dying from it and it's always just let us have
[52:19.140 --> 52:22.420]  our privacy please don't talk about it I got crew members to crew members whose
[52:22.420 --> 52:25.420]  kids were killed by vaccines are like please don't even mention that on air
[52:25.420 --> 52:29.700]  well I mean I know you you told me this I know it's true my grandmother got
[52:29.700 --> 52:34.900]  polio from the damn vaccine I mean I'm on Joe Rogus show three or four months ago
[52:34.900 --> 52:39.580]  and five months ago and I'm like yeah you know the main cause of polio is the
[52:39.580 --> 52:44.940]  Bill Gates vaccine and Joe goes whoa whoa whoa he pulls it up Reuters I mean
[52:44.940 --> 52:51.140]  the thing is they tell you all this in the fine print and so I'm just very very
[52:51.140 --> 52:55.540]  frustrated at myself and everybody else and we've got the best crew in the world
[52:55.540 --> 52:58.740]  we got the best audience in the world we shouldn't be mad at ourselves I shouldn't
[52:58.740 --> 53:03.260]  be mad at myself I should have some type of glee or feeling of success that we've
[53:03.260 --> 53:06.180]  been proven right and at least we're here at least we've got a fighting chance
[53:06.180 --> 53:11.740]  but I don't have that feeling I feel dirty I feel upset I feel really pissed I
[53:11.740 --> 53:16.020]  wake up at 2 a.m. thinking about Bill Gates thinking about Klaus Schwab because
[53:16.020 --> 53:22.540]  my very cells as a man are saying you're not doing enough but I'm not gonna let
[53:22.540 --> 53:29.460]  them destroy my mind I'm going to expose them and we're gonna publicly convict
[53:29.460 --> 53:32.620]  them for their crimes against humanity that violate the Nuremberg code and the
[53:32.620 --> 53:36.820]  Geneva Convention and we are gonna be loving and rejoice that God is real and
[53:36.820 --> 53:40.620]  that Christ is real we have ever-living souls and we're going through a time of
[53:40.620 --> 53:44.700]  great evil but that is part of the process and so thank God for giving us a
[53:44.700 --> 53:50.300]  warning and thank God for laying it all out in the Bible from Genesis right
[53:50.300 --> 53:53.740]  through Revelation it's all there how would they know that because it was
[53:53.740 --> 53:57.820]  divinely inspired and God is real and you see the enemies writing the churches
[53:57.820 --> 54:01.740]  you see them attacking everything because the globalist know this is a fight
[54:01.740 --> 54:04.940]  between good and versus evil and they are slaves of Satan and they are
[54:04.940 --> 54:10.740]  prosecuting their attacks on Orthodox Jews just practicing Jews what they are
[54:10.740 --> 54:16.780]  faithful Jews and faithful Christians why are they doing that because they know
[54:16.780 --> 54:21.340]  that we know ladies and gentlemen and we have got the real God that literally
[54:21.340 --> 54:25.980]  warned us exactly what was gonna happen that's total proof as we should be very
[54:25.980 --> 54:29.420]  happy about that and worry about our spiritual lives you're not gonna get it
[54:29.420 --> 54:32.820]  at most these churches these churches are run by Satanist I mean I can tell you
[54:32.820 --> 54:36.540]  I got a six cents even get in and you feel it in the ear of the doctor and it's
[54:36.540 --> 54:41.540]  bunch of feel-good raw raw hey scan your QR code make sure you had your your
[54:41.540 --> 54:45.060]  mark of the beast vaccine before you can be in this church what a joke so I'll
[54:45.060 --> 54:47.860]  play the project Veritas clip I'm gonna play some of these amazing Owen
[54:47.860 --> 54:51.460]  shroyer clips where they've just got dozens of anchor baby women getting off a
[54:51.460 --> 54:54.900]  bus nine months pregnant ready to pop ready to just come in and milk the hell
[54:54.900 --> 54:57.940]  out of us and the point is I'm not against the poor women I'm against the
[54:57.940 --> 55:04.220]  industrialization of the globalist and their takeover plan I'm not against
[55:04.220 --> 55:07.660]  bullets I don't want to fire it into me though I'm not against the water but I
[55:07.660 --> 55:11.940]  want to be by damn when it breaks and I drowned and that's what this is is a
[55:11.940 --> 55:16.420]  flood of refugees that Biden told come here who are then organized and farmed
[55:16.420 --> 55:20.020]  out by Democrat employees who then get a part of these people's paycheck
[55:20.020 --> 55:26.220]  forever the Democrats are farmers farmers of illegal aliens milk cows is what
[55:26.220 --> 55:30.420]  they are so please get your end game for blip-blip for global enslavement at

[56:53.580 --> 56:57.500]  of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been
[56:57.500 --> 57:02.140]  trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have
[57:02.140 --> 57:07.320]  bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my
[57:07.320 --> 57:12.180]  life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living
[57:12.180 --> 57:17.540]  defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as
[57:17.540 --> 57:22.300]  to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall
[57:22.300 --> 57:28.620]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[57:28.620 --> 57:33.860]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[57:33.860 --> 57:38.060]  one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and
[57:38.060 --> 57:41.580]  that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what
[57:41.580 --> 57:47.540]  they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[57:49.900 --> 57:55.260]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:55.260 --> 58:02.260]  you
[58:08.580 --> 58:16.460]  sorry John from 1810 to 1913 baby's great-grandchildren believe you could live
[58:16.460 --> 58:22.620]  to a hundred and three hundred threes forever three is forever when you're just
[58:22.620 --> 58:32.620]  a little kid so so I'd add grandmother lived a hundred and three
[58:32.620 --> 58:39.660]  when you dig my grave called her ma Jones moon Jones
[58:40.860 --> 58:47.740]  grave digger won't be a lot of folks live in a hundred three now though they're
[58:47.740 --> 58:51.300]  gonna euthanize people I got that video next segment most horrifying stuff you've
[58:51.300 --> 58:55.900]  ever seen the disabled being begging not for vaccines the police jamming needles
[58:55.900 --> 58:59.660]  in their arms illegally in California there's just a beta test the rest of
[58:59.660 --> 59:05.460]  country but the full project veritas video is at info wars dot com and it's
[59:05.460 --> 59:09.820]  also at project veritas comm among competition project veritas I invite
[59:09.820 --> 59:13.460]  them on to plug that they're the best place to whistle blow because they get
[59:13.460 --> 59:16.860]  so much of it actually on the air we're trying to organize to do that more
[59:16.860 --> 59:21.140]  because there's so many stories and you can send us tips at info wars tips at
[59:21.140 --> 59:26.100]  proton mail dot com we are checking those and we are in McCallan area of the
[59:26.100 --> 59:30.860]  border for the next week and other areas of Texas so if you want to whistle blow
[59:30.860 --> 59:34.220]  you want to talk to us off record we're excellent at that we will keep you
[59:34.220 --> 59:38.780]  secret and we'll also put you in touch with veritas when I call James will keep
[59:38.780 --> 59:43.100]  up if it's falling to the cracks I can I can also something's really big big big
[59:43.100 --> 59:47.740]  big I'll end up usually handing it over to them so we're not here in competition
[59:47.740 --> 59:51.100]  with Tucker Carlson or James will keep for anybody so much other conservative
[59:51.100 --> 59:57.380]  media is in competition and I can tell you Carlson isn't I can tell you a
[59:57.380 --> 1:00:01.300]  veritas isn't we're fighting for this country to survive so here's a few
[1:00:01.300 --> 1:00:06.020]  minutes from their big CNN report CNN director admits network engaged in
[1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:09.660]  propaganda to remove Trump from presidency our focus was to get Trump out
[1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:13.700]  of office and then to stage stuff and make Biden look like a tough guy that's
[1:00:13.700 --> 1:00:16.620]  healthy here it is I think I think we got him through the
[1:00:16.620 --> 1:00:22.020]  girls we would always hear shots of him jogging him and maybe it was she is in
[1:00:22.020 --> 1:00:23.320]  like it's like you hate them as a young gerry
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:31.860]  at first we were creating story there we didn't know anything about you know
[1:00:31.860 --> 1:00:36.740]  that's that's I think that's a problem yeah I think what we did we got about
[1:00:36.740 --> 1:00:44.500]  that I am a hundred percent gonna say it I don't know that Trump would have got
[1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:49.220]  voted out our focus was to get Trump out of office right without saying that
[1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:52.140]  that's what it was right so our next thing is gonna be for climate change
[1:00:52.140 --> 1:00:57.460]  awareness do you think it's gonna be just like a lot of like fear yeah
[1:00:57.460 --> 1:01:00.900]  fear cells fear cells no one ever says that those things out loud but it's
[1:01:00.900 --> 1:01:06.020]  obvious for years we've heard that CNN is the most trusted David news but a
[1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:11.100]  CNN director is on tape telling us that their propaganda helping a certain
[1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:18.540]  political candidate employees admitting what we've always known to be true I
[1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:22.620]  am like saying shaking or whatever I did we brought in like so many medical
[1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:27.700]  people so like all tell a story that like it is all speculation he was like
[1:01:27.700 --> 1:01:35.020]  neurologically damaged like that he was losing it whatever we were we were
[1:01:35.020 --> 1:01:39.420]  creating story there we didn't know anything about you know I think there's
[1:01:39.420 --> 1:01:43.660]  just like a code of fatigue so like whenever a new story comes up they're
[1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:51.260]  gonna latch on to it they've already announced inner office that once the
[1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:56.140]  public is will be open to it we're gonna start focusing mainly on climate it's
[1:01:56.140 --> 1:02:00.580]  our it's gonna be our focus like our focus was to get Trump out of office
[1:02:00.580 --> 1:02:04.260]  right without saying that that's what it was right so our next thing is gonna be
[1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:22.420]  for climate change awareness ahead of the network like just our focus was to
[1:02:22.420 --> 1:02:26.340]  get Trump out of office right without saying that that's what it was and that's
[1:02:26.340 --> 1:02:32.260]  the question mr. Zucker why is it so important to hide the truth of what
[1:02:32.260 --> 1:02:37.180]  you're really trying to do absolutely a criminal organization trying to cause
[1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:41.540]  race wars in America trying to get our guns trying to deceive us on every
[1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:47.620]  level and then it's force-fed into buses trains airplanes hotels bars
[1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:56.500]  airports it's just the enemy of the people the globalists are purposely
[1:02:56.500 --> 1:03:01.620]  collapsing our world they're creating insecurity crying war and famine all of
[1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:06.060]  us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and
[1:03:06.060 --> 1:03:10.980]  our family's sakes but also our immunity and citizen stronghold.com is the best

[1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:20.660]  are a pretty dark occultic group some of their songs are powerful because the
[1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:26.420]  humanity still shining through but that was the Rolling Stones 30 40 50 years
[1:04:26.420 --> 1:04:35.380]  ago they are now geriatric globalist geriatric satanist and Mick Jagger has
[1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:41.220]  come out with a new song here are the lyrics we took it on the chin the
[1:04:41.220 --> 1:04:48.660]  numbers were so grim bossed around by pricks stiffen upper lips pacing in the
[1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:54.220]  yard you're trying to take the Mick you just think I'm really thick looking at
[1:04:54.220 --> 1:05:01.060]  the graphs with the magnifying glass cancel all the tours football fake
[1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:05.660]  applause no more travel brochures looking out from these prison walls
[1:05:05.660 --> 1:05:11.820]  you've got to Rob Peter if you're paying Paul and it goes on to say take your
[1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:19.020]  vaccine we're gonna be present till you do it that's right Mick Jagger sends up
[1:05:19.020 --> 1:05:28.100]  anti-vaxxers in surprise new covid song easy sleazy so I guess we're sleazy in
[1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:38.540]  bags we don't want experimental poison vaccines or is it the opposite is he
[1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:45.780]  being anti-vaxx and in the media just spin that
[1:05:49.300 --> 1:06:00.700]  what's really going on there with Mick Jagger maybe he's being pro anti-vaxxer
[1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:09.460]  the way the media spinning it is did Mick Jagger decide to try to save his soul
[1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:16.860]  he decided to not join with Satan because as many times as I've seen
[1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:22.420]  mainstream media come out with lies and disinformation I should know never to
[1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:29.020]  believe their headlines because the headlines are Mick Jagger has got a
[1:06:29.020 --> 1:06:35.740]  pro-vaxx story but you read the lyrics it's the opposite I'm gonna cover this
[1:06:35.740 --> 1:06:42.220]  coming up at the bottom of the hour when I can write wrap my mind around it
[1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:46.180]  because I'm sitting here during the breaks trying to read these stories as
[1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:50.100]  fast as they come in and who knows if this stuff's even true I like Matthew
[1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:53.700]  McConaughey I've met Matthew McConaughey a couple times he's a fellow
[1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:58.180]  Austinite and there's another article right here saying he's pro-vaxxing maybe
[1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:02.220]  he is I like President Trump but he was went along the vaccine to try to get
[1:07:02.220 --> 1:07:12.100]  things moving again I don't think that Trump's a bad guy that he was misled but
[1:07:12.100 --> 1:07:16.100]  still it's a terrible folly so maybe Mick Jagger isn't a devil worse for
[1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:21.780]  after all we'll we'll get to the bottom of that at the bottom of the hour here on
[1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:33.740]  the Alex Jones show but here is what I do know here is what I do understand the
[1:07:33.740 --> 1:07:37.300]  reality of the fact that we're on a controlled planet with these global is
[1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:44.660]  trying to play God is coming out and that's just a fact and so we're gonna be
[1:07:44.660 --> 1:07:50.500]  looking at that coming up and as the world turns you're gonna see people that
[1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:54.020]  were on the bad guy side turned towards the light you're gonna see those that
[1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:58.540]  were on the good guy side turned towards the dark but the most important thing to
[1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:05.540]  do is admit when we go off half cocked like I just did that's right I'm sitting
[1:08:05.540 --> 1:08:10.180]  here during the break reading over a bunch of articles checking it saw a
[1:08:10.180 --> 1:08:14.620]  headline saying Mick Jagger puts out a pro-vaxxing rant I come out here and
[1:08:14.620 --> 1:08:19.140]  attack him on legitimate fronts then I actually start reading it he's attacking
[1:08:19.140 --> 1:08:27.300]  Bill Gates and says don't take the vaccine or then later the lyrics sound
[1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:32.620]  like maybe he says do take it I'm gonna have to figure this out and tell you
[1:08:32.620 --> 1:08:36.980]  coming up bottom of the hour very very important and I really want to also
[1:08:36.980 --> 1:08:42.260]  shift gears here and I want to talk about the collapsing border and what our
[1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:46.260]  crew was doing at the border and just how amazing the footage is that they're
[1:08:46.260 --> 1:08:50.020]  shooting at the border and premier some of that here in just a moment on the
[1:08:50.020 --> 1:08:57.660]  Alachone show and then we've got this document another document from John
[1:08:57.660 --> 1:09:04.820]  Hopkins that is horrifying and then when I read over the document yesterday and
[1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:09.740]  again some today and read an article that Jamie White wrote in fours dot com
[1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:15.780]  that boils it down nicely it freaked me out even more as if the stress level
[1:09:15.780 --> 1:09:19.500]  couldn't be any higher for all of us as we discover all this that they had been
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:23.340]  pre-programming and much of what I read in the report they've already said in
[1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:27.260]  other ways and so I'm pretty sure they're gonna go operational with this with
[1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:33.020]  the great reset financially where they worldwide collapse that wipes out your
[1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:36.900]  money digitally and so they can basically steal their money from you and
[1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:40.780]  then quote later figure out what happened to your money and only give you part of
[1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:45.220]  it back I mean there's nothing these swindlers won't do if they think they
[1:09:45.220 --> 1:09:50.420]  can get away with it and they control Interpol and they control the FBI and
[1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:55.180]  they control most the states in the US and Soros has got most the attorney
[1:09:55.180 --> 1:10:02.140]  generals and most district attorneys and so they can basically pretty much do
[1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:09.980]  anything at this point God help us I mean we are at that point where the
[1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:15.380]  authoritarians always go into an orgy of corruption and an orgy of evil and I
[1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:18.900]  just pray that somehow we can have an awakening and say no to this because
[1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:22.820]  people ask what level will tyrants go to Thomas Everson rightly said to whatever
[1:10:22.820 --> 1:10:25.980]  level you will accept he was asked what is the limit of time it's he said
[1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:30.860]  whatever you submit to someone out there will want to push you to that point
[1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:35.020]  there are evil bad people in the world that want control and want to enslave and
[1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:39.540]  want to dumb down and want to dominate that's their nature and those of us that
[1:10:39.540 --> 1:10:44.620]  aren't like them tend to project who we are on to them and that's why we get
[1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:50.180]  hurt most victims of crime got lured into it because they projected their own
[1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:55.980]  goodness on to the bad guys there are a lot of corrupt evil people there's also
[1:10:55.980 --> 1:11:01.460]  folks that have been hurt by the system who decide to join it it's like the song
[1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:05.940]  no more mr. nice guy Alice Cooper everybody's mean to him so he becomes a
[1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:11.780]  mean person he adopts what was done to him to be worse than those that have
[1:11:11.780 --> 1:11:16.180]  used him instead of transcending that and and and organizing people to be good
[1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:20.260]  and helpful and loving which America got to the greatest level of we weren't
[1:11:20.260 --> 1:11:25.100]  perfect but it was real chivalry and honor and strength building communities
[1:11:25.100 --> 1:11:34.140]  based on that but instead that's all been thrown out on the wayside and now
[1:11:34.140 --> 1:11:38.740]  we're in a deep crisis okay I played this at the very start of the show but I
[1:11:38.740 --> 1:11:42.780]  haven't addressed it yet shop video cops force vaccinate special needs girls in
[1:11:42.780 --> 1:11:47.140]  statewide operation homebound in California this is all you in directed
[1:11:47.140 --> 1:11:51.780]  beta test operation homebound of course it's California basically going in with
[1:11:51.780 --> 1:11:57.620]  the police and intimidating people into taking vaccines more criminal activity
[1:11:57.620 --> 1:12:01.860]  and we're gonna be looking at Senator Rand Paul saying Fauci is a fraud and a
[1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:06.900]  petty dictator a petty tyrant he's now calling him a tyrant absolutely that's
[1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:14.980]  the spirit that's how you beat him you call a spade a spade we also have FDA and
[1:12:14.980 --> 1:12:19.860]  CDC recommending a pause on J&J COVID-19 vaccines because there are so many
[1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:24.580]  deaths happening they call it one death that's the spin no that's that's that's
[1:12:24.580 --> 1:12:29.700]  in one area so there's so much more coming up on the other side please don't
[1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:33.540]  forget we've got a big initiative I'm running right now my instrumental

[1:16:58.100 --> 1:17:06.740]  moment we have senator Rand Paul tweeting Fauci continues to ignore 100
[1:17:06.740 --> 1:17:11.900]  years of vaccine science his only real theme is do what I say even when it
[1:17:11.900 --> 1:17:17.020]  makes no sense if you're recovered or been vaccinated go about your life eat
[1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:23.540]  drink work open the schools enough with the petty tyrants but go all the way
[1:17:23.540 --> 1:17:28.300]  talk about how he ran the Luhan lab with Bill Gates talk about the UN talk
[1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:31.100]  about the New World Order talk about China bragging that they're open for
[1:17:31.100 --> 1:17:37.020]  business we're not talk about how Schwab bragging is the great reset I mean
[1:17:37.020 --> 1:17:43.460]  these people are out in the open let's see you get attacked we talk about
[1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:48.140]  replacement migration or Fauci running Luhan but hey good job a daily caller
[1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:54.260]  14 months after we broke it six months after Newsweek even reported it they
[1:17:54.260 --> 1:17:57.740]  came out and said Fauci should be investigated for running 11 programs at
[1:17:57.740 --> 1:18:03.500]  Luhan including coronavirus gain of function programs and now it's in the
[1:18:03.500 --> 1:18:08.380]  Johns Hopkins document we covered yesterday that's the main group that
[1:18:08.380 --> 1:18:15.780]  Han shows this that they'd already tested all these coronaviruses in animals
[1:18:15.780 --> 1:18:20.660]  for industrial use they should call it COVID-19 and they knew it killed a
[1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:26.300]  bunch of animals in tests and studies including a ferret test all of them that's
[1:18:26.300 --> 1:18:32.900]  why the former chief scientist at Pfizer went public last year and said this is
[1:18:32.900 --> 1:18:36.140]  madness and again this weekend says depopulation program because now he's
[1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:43.380]  been able to study the data and confirm what he thought up front that it's
[1:18:43.380 --> 1:18:48.540]  depopulation do you understand what that means we've got tens of thousands of
[1:18:48.540 --> 1:18:51.540]  people in the US alone and in Europe that have died right after they got the
[1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:59.620]  shot that we know of they only count maybe one out of a hundred that dies as
[1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:04.300]  dying from it so they've got in Europe over 4,000 a month ago no new numbers
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:09.420]  over 2,000 in the US a month ago no new numbers are out so if it's a hundred
[1:19:09.420 --> 1:19:15.900]  times that and I know a bunch of people that died from it well yeah you know dad
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:20.180]  took it and he died a day later but we're not sure he had to have a convulsion when
[1:19:20.180 --> 1:19:26.660]  he got home and his liver failed I mean come on he has like a rattlesnake by
[1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:29.900]  chin the Arizona desert your leg falls off week later you die right well we
[1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:33.060]  don't know the rattlesnake is what killed him you know it bit him and then he got
[1:19:33.060 --> 1:19:40.220]  real sick you don't know what's that fine kid got him drunk yeah that that that
[1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:44.220]  truck ran over my neighbor in the street at 50 miles an hour and he died but we're
[1:19:44.220 --> 1:19:53.180]  not sure the truck did it a lot of people die within minutes of taking it
[1:19:53.180 --> 1:19:57.860]  cold tyranny but see no one can admit that they're actually killing us gee
[1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:01.820]  Bill Gates his whole life a modern life adult life so he wants to kill people
[1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:05.420]  and bring in world government his dad ran Planned Parenthood and they run this
[1:20:05.420 --> 1:20:08.660]  big eugenics global program he's been kicked out of 30-something countries and
[1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:12.660]  has been caught giving people polio all over the world that's Reuters and it's
[1:20:12.660 --> 1:20:20.940]  like oh gee wants to hurt us but look at this headline FDA and CDC recommending a
[1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:26.300]  pause on J&J COVID-19 vaccine over rare blood cutting issues oh it's very rare
[1:20:26.300 --> 1:20:30.620]  and the headline on drugs is you know oh they say one woman died when you
[1:20:30.620 --> 1:20:33.860]  actually read the town hall article it goes to the vars reporting system or
[1:20:33.860 --> 1:20:39.300]  veirs it's thousands getting sick hundreds died but they're only saying one
[1:20:39.300 --> 1:20:47.940]  woman died for sure from it it's like okay one person died one's in critical
[1:20:50.580 --> 1:20:58.300]  devastating blow to J&J and J&J is a virus vector so it's the same thing as
[1:20:58.300 --> 1:21:02.340]  mRNA or beyond it because it takes a virus into your cell to reprogram
[1:21:02.340 --> 1:21:06.580]  yourself not to teach yourself how to know how to beat viruses but to teach
[1:21:06.580 --> 1:21:11.900]  your cell how to operate the way it wants it takes your damn cells over
[1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:18.020]  Biden's America is starting to look like Nazi Germany operation homebound
[1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:21.140]  we're gonna play that little bit a moment they mentally retarded girls
[1:21:21.140 --> 1:21:27.180]  begging saying they don't want it but oh they don't have their rights I guess
[1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:30.300]  they have a guardian because they're childlike oh that's why they want
[1:21:30.300 --> 1:21:34.060]  children though to have the right to bypass their parents and take vaccines
[1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:36.940]  but I thought a child doesn't have conform consented they're not of age
[1:21:36.940 --> 1:21:41.180]  and side see how they play both ways oh your gown syndrome you're 25 30 years

[1:28:57.100 --> 1:29:01.140]  some good news there's major pushback by some cities in towns and by
[1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:08.140]  legislatures there's an article from the von mis institute on info wars.com that
[1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:12.100]  lays this out state legislatures are finally limiting governors emergency
[1:29:12.100 --> 1:29:18.820]  powers but only some of them and that's why you've got all these caribbean islands
[1:29:18.820 --> 1:29:22.180]  and all asian countries and african countries it doesn't matter in european
[1:29:22.180 --> 1:29:24.700]  countries humans are all the same at the end of the day when it comes to
[1:29:24.700 --> 1:29:29.420]  behavior it might look different but that's about as far as it goes we act
[1:29:29.420 --> 1:29:34.140]  the same people are people and you've got people power grabbing everywhere it's
[1:29:34.140 --> 1:29:38.540]  family liberals communists and socialists that are doing it
[1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:41.660]  trying to put balsam arrow in jail now because he didn't lock the country down
[1:29:41.660 --> 1:29:44.780]  they're all hyping up record deaths and all this crap because the medical
[1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:47.980]  systems not run by the government and i'm not saying it should be run by the
[1:29:47.980 --> 1:29:50.940]  government but it's run by corporations that are as big and bad as the
[1:29:50.940 --> 1:29:55.500]  government in fact bigger and batter and who are above the law and that's what
[1:29:55.500 --> 1:30:00.140]  globalism is is corporations acting as government so how do libertarians deal
[1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:03.220]  with that i'm not against libertarian thinking in general i'm just saying it's
[1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:07.700]  like communism totally doesn't work at any level and is a total fraud and
[1:30:07.700 --> 1:30:12.660]  creates a dictatorship instantly well libertarian ideas and social constructs
[1:30:12.660 --> 1:30:16.460]  could work i guess at some level and if you had a very moral society that didn't
[1:30:16.460 --> 1:30:19.780]  let corporations can get out of control you had some check on them then you
[1:30:19.780 --> 1:30:23.260]  could have maybe a total libertarian society but that doesn't take human
[1:30:23.260 --> 1:30:28.260]  nature into account so libertarianism big L libertarianism is just as
[1:30:28.260 --> 1:30:34.940]  unfeasible and workable as communism it the dog doesn't hunt the fish don't
[1:30:34.940 --> 1:30:40.540]  swim the gun don't shoot that's just the way it works i mean we are our
[1:30:40.540 --> 1:30:43.620]  governments withering away can do nothing and big tech and all these
[1:30:43.620 --> 1:30:46.660]  companies are becoming governmental and shutting down their competition and
[1:30:46.660 --> 1:30:49.900]  waging war and the government's like oh if you're an illegal alien you can flaw
[1:30:49.900 --> 1:30:57.820]  you want citizens you can't the social contract is broken the total fraud is
[1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:02.300]  here and i don't want a big government i want one just big enough to arbitrate
[1:31:02.300 --> 1:31:07.860]  for me we the people with juries and voting and things like that notice it's
[1:31:07.860 --> 1:31:11.100]  all those things to be taken away i'm gonna play dozens of pregnant illegal
[1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:17.220]  immigrants it's an anchor baby train arrive in darker the night at the
[1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:24.820]  texas border and illegally cross so we're gonna play that moment but first
[1:31:24.820 --> 1:31:29.860]  let's get back into these articles ran Paul Fauci is a petty tyrant yes yes
[1:31:29.860 --> 1:31:36.820]  yes i mean it's like this Travis County judge she just so happens to be my
[1:31:36.820 --> 1:31:40.740]  family court judge and you know what i don't care if she's over my family court
[1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:46.940]  cases i'm gonna go protest judge livingston and not because she's on my
[1:31:46.940 --> 1:31:52.340]  family court cases because she said last week in hearings that was somebody
[1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:56.100]  get the use of chronicle as a awesome chronicle as a quote center for me that
[1:31:56.100 --> 1:32:00.060]  oh your rights don't extend when it hurts other people so you're a virus

[1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:25.580]  down so she can work for home from ever
[1:32:25.580 --> 1:32:31.140]  that's so you know you interesting i can't go protest judge livingston at the
[1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:36.140]  courthouse because she never gets over there i'm gonna have to go to her house
[1:32:36.140 --> 1:32:42.060]  i don't care how she rules with my children because you got to be all in
[1:32:42.060 --> 1:32:45.980]  on this you know all these conservatives are oh oh that brings me to

[1:35:18.780 --> 1:35:22.300]  and they're running three dozen pregnant women and a bunch of other
[1:35:22.300 --> 1:35:26.180]  mothers and children up to the Catholic facilities right now as we speak they
[1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:32.220]  tried to call the police to get media off the property and the police know
[1:35:32.220 --> 1:35:36.540]  that what they're doing is trying to stop our first amendment right from
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:40.140]  happening so here you go folks this happens all hours of the day all hours
[1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:53.660]  of the night take a look for yourselves look at how young some of these

[1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:15.820]  and who are pregnant again every one of them pregnant all night some of these
[1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:21.380]  women look like they're 12 years old and so you get pregnant and they want to
[1:36:21.380 --> 1:36:24.940]  tell you you come here you have a baby the baby's a citizen it's the anger she
[1:36:24.940 --> 1:36:30.060]  stays on then the whole family comes up or other eight kids or whatever and then
[1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:38.780]  you pay for the entire operation and every person if what they're doing
[1:36:38.780 --> 1:36:44.900]  every person why do they hate that the media is here that is able to get into
[1:36:44.900 --> 1:36:49.860]  places like New York it's 15,000 extra dollars from taxpayers they go oh feel

[1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:54.780]  don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the
[1:38:54.780 --> 1:38:58.500]  globalist their attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be a
[1:38:58.500 --> 1:39:01.980]  public figure and we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their
[1:39:01.980 --> 1:39:06.380]  money because of God and I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about
[1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.620]  God all day but just give me a break the statinism's out in the open I've always
[1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:13.580]  been a Christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so
[1:39:13.580 --> 1:39:17.380]  clear and I get it a lot of you been turned off by big churches a lot of you
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:22.420]  been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it me too believe
[1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:26.660]  me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God and just God's
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:31.180]  universe that God created that is so essential and and God created the
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:35.260]  universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so
[1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:38.220]  that's what info wars is really all about so thank you all for your word of
[1:39:38.220 --> 1:39:41.020]  mouth thank you for spreading the word about info wars and thank you for
[1:39:41.020 --> 1:39:44.940]  supporting us to keep us on air by visiting info wars store.com because
[1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:48.500]  without your daily and weekly monthly purchases we'll be taken off the air so
[1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:51.700]  thank you for the support info wars store.com
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:57.460]  humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[1:39:57.460 --> 1:40:01.380]  to submit do what you're told and it's all gonna pass but if you study
[1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:04.220]  authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they
[1:40:04.220 --> 1:40:07.900]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of
[1:40:07.900 --> 1:40:11.420]  being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak
[1:40:11.420 --> 1:40:15.460]  and see us as stupid they are now making that move and they are collapsing the
[1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:18.940]  third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[1:40:18.940 --> 1:40:24.500]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crises under such a
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:28.980]  load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping
[1:40:28.980 --> 1:40:33.020]  that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing
[1:40:33.020 --> 1:40:37.820]  COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwab was saying and Bill Gates
[1:40:37.820 --> 1:40:42.940]  is saying but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates
[1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:47.660]  ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:52.140]  money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist you
[1:40:52.140 --> 1:40:56.580]  know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've
[1:40:56.580 --> 1:40:59.820]  talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of
[1:40:59.820 --> 1:41:03.180]  credibility but I don't care about that I care about beating the new world order
[1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:06.420]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to
[1:41:06.420 --> 1:41:09.820]  stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're
[1:41:09.820 --> 1:41:13.540]  doing to us for a lot of reasons I can't tell you what's going on but let's just
[1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:17.460]  say this we're gonna see this through the end we're gonna stay on air as long as
[1:41:17.460 --> 1:41:21.820]  we can so please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store.com
[1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:26.100]  they're great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike other
[1:41:26.100 --> 1:41:29.860]  products you can buy they're still great do they fund freedom no a lot of them don't
[1:41:29.860 --> 1:41:34.020]  these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole
[1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:37.780]  world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring
[1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:41.820]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air so while
[1:41:41.820 --> 1:41:45.060]  you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download
[1:41:45.060 --> 1:41:48.540]  everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're
[1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:53.660]  gonna be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[1:41:53.660 --> 1:42:00.060]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:30.780]  that's what's bringing his hand escape to the present planet website
[1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:33.780]  present planet com it's just a mirror of info or is they're gonna take that site
[1:42:33.780 --> 1:42:36.860]  and rework it know if you're totally different site just covering the COVID
[1:42:36.860 --> 1:42:40.580]  global lockdown you got that in the works I think all for your support that's

[1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:38.340]  test and if we go along with it then that ensures more of an assault so

[1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:52.140]  let's let's roll this for TV viewers I'll describe it for radio listeners this

[1:44:21.340 --> 1:44:29.060]  organization by the UN at refugee centers in Guatemala almost all these

[1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:36.660]  get here they've set up with NGOs non-government organizations on this
[1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:42.540]  end they have cell phones and they pay thousands of dollars to the UN the UN
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:45.580]  already has taxpayer money the State Department they get here then their
[1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:51.260]  phones are taken and in most cases their their families are broken up including
[1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:55.500]  children and are sent to different people this is human smuggling it's in the
[1:44:55.500 --> 1:45:01.460]  news we have Senate reports and we caught it on tape last week and we had
[1:45:01.460 --> 1:45:05.540]  undercover people inside that will have those interviews out soon where there
[1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:09.460]  are men there saying I paid your charity money I want her her and her and they

[1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:26.740]  women back to Illinois and other states because they don't want to have a record
[1:45:26.740 --> 1:45:31.300]  of being an airport even though they're not checking them the FBI says look the
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:36.380]  FBI is a mafia okay the FBI is the big dog in America burns down the Waco
[1:45:36.380 --> 1:45:42.500]  Church and you know it does it teaches us it's our boss and you can say oh was it
[1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:46.660]  good under Jig or Hoover you know the G men all of it but all I know is it's
[1:45:46.660 --> 1:45:51.500]  really bad now and you just call the whole organization that oh it's the guys
[1:45:51.500 --> 1:45:55.380]  at the top only well where are the FBI agents resigning or going public
[1:45:55.380 --> 1:46:00.380]  because they're mass smuggling women and children into sex slavery medical stuff
[1:46:00.380 --> 1:46:09.220]  you name it and it's all on record but the FBI is arrested what 450 people that
[1:46:09.220 --> 1:46:13.660]  were at the Capitol that they say in the indictments oh he walked in when the
[1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:18.620]  police opened the doors and meandered around the Capitol
[1:46:18.620 --> 1:46:22.980]  one thing if you had died of people that actually hurt cops or broke in or
[1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:27.620]  whatever but most of those your own provocateurs no no no now the illegal
[1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:35.580]  aliens are waved on the planes their IDs aren't even checked and everyone that
[1:46:35.580 --> 1:46:39.820]  went into that Capitol is being indicted
[1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:46.140]  when the left storms capitals and throws fits everywhere constantly and burns
[1:46:46.140 --> 1:46:50.940]  down buildings and loots Google the articles on informers.com
[1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:58.500]  censored rioting so that you couldn't see that all over the country ahead of the
[1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:05.780]  Chauvin trial the Chauvin trial in George Floyd all right let's go to Owen
[1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:09.340]  Shroyer he got hooked up out there he's gonna tell us where he is he said hey
[1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:11.620]  where do you want to be I said wherever you want to be you're the ones down there
[1:47:11.620 --> 1:47:15.780]  so he's been all over the place he's giving us a quick update from the Texas
[1:47:15.780 --> 1:47:20.380]  Mexico border where I'll be joining him soon oh and a lot of incredible videos
[1:47:20.380 --> 1:47:26.500]  you posted last night yeah Alex and we've still got multiple teams scouting
[1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:30.540]  at the illegal immigration pipeline but we decided to come down here right to
[1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:35.100]  the border where we're trying to link up with some other patriots and there's
[1:47:35.100 --> 1:47:37.940]  some former military veterans that are trying to have a press conference out
[1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:42.700]  here to address this national security issue of the wide open border and as you
[1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:46.660]  can see behind me Alex we're at one of the spots here where they've stopped
[1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:50.780]  construction so they still have some of the construction wiring up and they
[1:47:50.780 --> 1:47:54.340]  still have some of the barricades up and you can see to the left and the right
[1:47:54.340 --> 1:47:59.540]  the gaps that they have failed to finish constructing here at the southern
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:04.980]  border wall so this is just another indication that as soon as the new
[1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:09.220]  administration got in the White House they intentionally intentionally as we
[1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:13.860]  knew they would decided to have less border security stop the construction of
[1:48:13.860 --> 1:48:17.060]  the wall apparently it's not infrastructure we've got a two trillion
[1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:22.140]  dollar infrastructure bill that Biden is trying to get passed and the wall is
[1:48:22.140 --> 1:48:26.940]  not even included in fact they made sure to leave funding for the wall out but
[1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:31.060]  it's clear they are releasing people that are turned over to them on purpose
[1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:34.820]  they know to turn themselves into more patrol now because then their IDs aren't
[1:48:34.820 --> 1:48:39.460]  even checked they don't even meet with a judge they are released to NGOs and then
[1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:44.220]  their phones are taken away and they're handed over to weird men I mean what could
[1:48:44.220 --> 1:48:49.220]  go wrong this is incredible Owen yeah and we've even got more footage that
[1:48:49.220 --> 1:48:54.380]  we're gonna be uploading to band.video today where the same woman with the
[1:48:54.380 --> 1:48:59.620]  Santa Muerte tattoo that same woman who was engaged in suspicious activity when
[1:48:59.620 --> 1:49:03.540]  you guys were down there the same woman who was trying to intimidate us when we
[1:49:03.540 --> 1:49:07.780]  were filming her a few weeks ago now all of a sudden she's driving a cab Alex
[1:49:07.780 --> 1:49:11.220]  now all of a sudden she has a cab license somehow she passed that
[1:49:11.220 --> 1:49:16.060]  certification overnight and when we came up today into the alley where they're
[1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:20.100]  dropping and picking the kids up now because no one media filming she tried
[1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:25.220]  to pull away as soon as she saw our cameras she tried to pull away with
[1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:31.820]  kids in the back the door to the van was wide open as she was trying to speed
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:36.300]  away now tell me does that sound like some suspicious behavior to you Alex
[1:49:36.300 --> 1:49:40.340]  with kids people media said that we were spinning things you know they're
[1:49:40.340 --> 1:49:43.420]  the one spinning it's all illegal Biden doesn't have the authority to do this
[1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:46.260]  there's not even an executive order which would be overturned there's no law
[1:49:46.260 --> 1:49:49.580]  he's violating current law he's ordering them released without backgrounds
[1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:53.780]  he's ordering to be put on airplanes and this woman God knows who she is if
[1:49:53.780 --> 1:49:58.060]  they're not just cramming them in the backs of of of of Trump's now now she's
[1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:01.860]  driving off so fast that doors are hanging open with children is what you're
[1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:06.100]  saying yes and we have it on footage the HD is gonna be up at band.video
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:10.420]  right now the crew is getting it up there that's gonna be a border crisis
[1:50:10.420 --> 1:50:14.420]  section oh and that's the first question I should have asked you because you guys
[1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:17.420]  haven't posted stuff since last night great job working so many hours what
[1:50:17.420 --> 1:50:22.340]  else have you discovered since I talked to you last night so when I was so I
[1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:26.740]  went out there this morning Alex and I was filming a report because we realized
[1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:31.940]  something last night just from kind of doing more scoping of the scene that not
[1:50:31.940 --> 1:50:37.980]  only has the testing facility expanded but the Catholic Charities facility has
[1:50:37.980 --> 1:50:44.180]  quadrupled in size and now they have five storefronts on the entire block that
[1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:49.500]  they're running this is a massive facility and there and we were there two
[1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:54.980]  weeks ago and last week suddenly it's just mushrooming everywhere huge numbers
[1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:58.460]  and you can see inside how they're lined up and they're all sitting against the
[1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:03.180]  wall just stacked shoulder to shoulder and it's like five storefronts wide the
[1:51:03.180 --> 1:51:07.820]  building across the street is now vacant as well we've been told that the
[1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:13.060]  Catholic Charities has interest in trying to rent that space as well $7,500 a
[1:51:13.060 --> 1:51:17.380]  month was the price that we were told on that so they're expanding their
[1:51:17.380 --> 1:51:22.620]  facilities in McAllen Texas and I think they're using this as a major hub for
[1:51:22.620 --> 1:51:25.420]  some sort of criminal activity with this is the thing that has the rest of the
[1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:29.100]  country this is going on all along the 2300 mile border but it's but this is
[1:51:29.100 --> 1:51:32.580]  the epicenter today they're already five more minutes with you at a Paul Joseph
[1:51:32.580 --> 1:51:36.820]  Watson on what you get back to what you're doing but folks this is groundbreaking
[1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:40.780]  stuff which the crew is doing a fabulous job but you are just as important as we
[1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:44.860]  are if you don't go to Band-Aid video if you don't get the reports you think are
[1:51:44.860 --> 1:51:47.460]  most important to share them on your email your text message where they can't
[1:51:47.460 --> 1:51:52.020]  censor as much or on Facebook or Twitter read redownload it upload it with
[1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:56.620]  your own name on it we don't care get it out folks I see you doing it on Twitter
[1:51:56.620 --> 1:52:02.220]  I see you doing it on Facebook beautiful job folks I see you on TikTok video of
[1:52:02.220 --> 1:52:06.580]  anchor baby mamas coming across the border at industrial level I mean it is
[1:52:06.580 --> 1:52:10.940]  just absolutely wild and I see some of the criticism why are you showing
[1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:16.340]  children's faces these children may never be seen again they're using the
[1:52:16.340 --> 1:52:20.980]  mask to cover up the smuggling I'm we are I ordered the people to leave the
[1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:24.740]  faces up because this is illegal and the board of patrols in order to do
[1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:30.420]  illegal activity and Congress must act this is incredible to let him get on
[1:52:30.420 --> 1:52:34.740]  planes everything and disappearing into the hands of the Democrats who didn't
[1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:37.980]  give $15,000 per legal alien they're not giving that money to them they're
[1:52:37.980 --> 1:52:43.420]  stealing it but right back it's hard to believe that we're already in the middle
[1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:46.500]  of April and our borders collapsing and world
[1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:49.980]  governments being announced that Joe Biden's coming after our guns and
[1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:53.900]  that's our war with Russia but told China they can take over Hong Kong and
[1:52:53.900 --> 1:53:00.340]  Taiwan so China's done a blockade around Taiwan is threatening to invade Hong
[1:53:00.340 --> 1:53:05.100]  Kong they already sent troops into Hong Kong this is madness and our
[1:53:05.100 --> 1:53:07.940]  government's been hijacked now by these globalists they're trying to shut us
[1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:13.780]  down they took our sponsors away a long time ago but you sponsor us by buying

[1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:52.940]  work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is

[1:54:16.380 --> 1:54:21.180]  are I want to keep working in the future but again that's really up to you and
[1:54:21.180 --> 1:54:26.260]  up to God so please I hope God works through you and puts a message in your
[1:54:26.260 --> 1:54:29.820]  heart to support us but again that's up to you and your relationship with God I
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:33.220]  just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what
[1:54:33.220 --> 1:54:37.340]  you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is
[1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:40.660]  for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him
[1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:43.660]  for worse God bless
[1:54:43.660 --> 1:54:49.500]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:54:55.060 --> 1:55:00.820]  it's the same formula over and over again it was made a test in Europe 10
[1:55:00.820 --> 1:55:05.060]  years ago that you would admit they ran out they told people in Africa and in
[1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:10.020]  Asia but mainly the Middle East down come to Germany come to France come to
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:13.540]  England you'll get free welfare you'll be given a job to be given a woman if
[1:55:13.540 --> 1:55:17.580]  this is in the ads will be given welfare and so they had tens of millions
[1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:20.740]  come and and now they've got a group they can control give one order will burn
[1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:24.940]  the whole thing down and now they've been it's called replacement migration but
[1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:28.900]  the ADL says and CNN says you're not supposed to talk about that so now we
[1:55:28.900 --> 1:55:33.100]  see this in mass it's so important that we're down there project Veritas is down
[1:55:33.100 --> 1:55:38.860]  there but almost no media in in just an incredible incredible story they're now
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:43.500]  admitting tenfold increase Obama's previous record of people and that's
[1:55:43.500 --> 1:55:48.140]  the numbers we know about one I mean this is bedlam other observations you've
[1:55:48.140 --> 1:55:53.940]  made well yeah and on the angle of the media Alex no local media we haven't
[1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:58.780]  seen a single local news affiliate out here there have been a couple of
[1:55:58.780 --> 1:56:01.700]  independent journalists that come out here you know they still got a Facebook
[1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:05.460]  account they still got a Twitter they're still able to go live they come out here
[1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:08.300]  they film it they're out they were out there for a couple hours last night so
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:12.980]  it's just independent mostly citizens of McCallan that are just coming out here
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:16.500]  with their own accounts as independent media filming documenting what's going
[1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:21.380]  on staging a little bit of a protest a little bit of a resistance to it and so
[1:56:21.380 --> 1:56:24.540]  we're able to kind of talk to them and they said the only media that they've
[1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:28.300]  seen out there every once while they'll they said they saw a French reporter
[1:56:28.300 --> 1:56:31.380]  Al Jazeera so every once while a foreign reporting crew will come in just to
[1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:34.820]  report on it and then they'll leave the scene but I mean local news should be out
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:38.220]  there every night local news should be out there getting this b-roll getting this
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:41.420]  footage every night I mean you can sit out here and that's the crazy thing I
[1:56:41.420 --> 1:56:45.100]  feel redundant Alex we go to the scene we film the drop-off we film the
[1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.580]  transfer we film them at the airport and I feel redundant but everything we
[1:56:48.580 --> 1:56:53.020]  capture is a criminal act every time we captured it but it's not redundant I mean
[1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:58.220]  you're out there what is it every 15 30 minutes more buses arrive around the
[1:56:58.220 --> 1:57:03.220]  clock all night long so now we're just gonna look like there's more activity at
[1:57:03.220 --> 1:57:07.180]  night than during the day well and that could be because they're trying to
[1:57:07.180 --> 1:57:12.220]  adjust their schedules so that the media doesn't know what's going on and so I
[1:57:12.220 --> 1:57:15.100]  mean you know it's downtown McAllen where they're doing this there is some
[1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:19.140]  foot traffic there is some car traffic there's people commuting they see this
[1:57:19.140 --> 1:57:22.540]  going on so maybe they figure if they do it in the dark of night with three
[1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:25.780]  dozen pregnant women and children walking across the street there'll be less
[1:57:25.780 --> 1:57:29.220]  of an uproar if they're doing it in the dark of night but see Alex here's the
[1:57:29.220 --> 1:57:33.020]  problem about the border that bus look like a clown car and so many people in
[1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:38.740]  there everybody gets in the phone booth how much three dozen got off one bus yes
[1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:42.700]  three a lot of them had children and we're pregnant and we got to pay for it
[1:57:42.700 --> 1:57:47.140]  all and some of these some of these girls I won't even call them women some of
[1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:51.260]  these girls look like they were 12 years old multiple and you know I just wonder
[1:57:51.260 --> 1:57:55.100]  what's happened to them I mean it's it's really gut wrenching to think how
[1:57:55.100 --> 1:58:00.580]  either they're being used by the cartel or they're being raped on their way up
[1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:05.380]  here let's be clear the cartel tells them we're in control of you we know where
[1:58:05.380 --> 1:58:09.180]  you're going and you have a cartel woman wearing cartel tattoos literally
[1:58:09.180 --> 1:58:12.860]  delivering them and separating a baby and handing it off to somebody I mean my
[1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:17.500]  god this is not marriage I mean it was happening last night to Alex and there's
[1:58:17.500 --> 1:58:21.220]  no DNA testing there's no DNA testing and there was another late last night oh
[1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:24.580]  these are my babies these are my babies that's what the Santa Muerte lady said
[1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:28.060]  and then gave it to somebody else so that man there's I'm telling you there's a
[1:58:28.060 --> 1:58:31.140]  legal statement they go these my babies these might and we know they're not we
[1:58:31.140 --> 1:58:34.740]  see the same women grabbing kids handing them off splitting people up this is
[1:58:34.740 --> 1:58:40.260]  humble this is what the Senate report found Owen that Obama placed over 10,000
[1:58:40.260 --> 1:58:44.100]  children with sex traffickers knowingly not just smugglers that this is on
[1:58:44.100 --> 1:58:49.940]  steroids of that what a crime and all Democrats now have signed on to this well
[1:58:49.940 --> 1:58:54.740]  look if you were trying to run a child sex trafficking operation this would be
[1:58:54.740 --> 1:58:58.780]  it this would be how it's done this would be how you facilitate it this would
[1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:02.300]  be how you cover it up and this is how you would fund it and organize it and
[1:59:02.300 --> 1:59:05.940]  nobody would have a clue nobody would have any idea these kids come in they're
[1:59:05.940 --> 1:59:09.420]  not on any records and they're with an unaccompanied oh there was someone
[1:59:09.420 --> 1:59:13.940]  claims to be their mom nobody knows no DNA testing and it's just total lawlessness
[1:59:13.940 --> 1:59:18.700]  and if I'm the FBI in a better way federal law we don't even need a
[1:59:18.700 --> 1:59:23.460]  Congress now our Supreme Court we have the FBI Owen well don't even get us
[1:59:23.460 --> 1:59:29.340]  started on what's happening to patriots and and pastures and organizers and
[1:59:29.340 --> 1:59:33.620]  leaders that were in DC on the 6th that are being harassed by the FBI but they
[1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:38.540]  can't seem to stop the riot season that everybody sees is impending they can't
[1:59:38.540 --> 1:59:43.940]  seem to investigate what is clearly a high potential to be held there'll be an
[1:59:43.940 --> 1:59:48.220]  FBI you're gonna get paid leave paid leave to bring illegal aliens into their
[1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:54.300]  house we'll be right back thank you on the equation is very simple the bank of
[1:59:54.300 --> 2:00:00.180]  banks control the media they control big pharma they control academia they
[2:00:00.180 --> 2:00:05.340]  control the military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere
[2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:08.940]  that they have been in control in the third world they have established
[2:00:08.940 --> 2:00:14.540]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the Western
[2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:19.620]  Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's
[2:00:19.620 --> 2:00:22.940]  rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't
[2:00:22.940 --> 2:00:28.300]  defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and
[2:00:28.300 --> 2:00:34.780]  use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free
[2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:39.020]  market that threatens their monopolies of control that's why they target info
[2:00:39.020 --> 2:00:43.060]  wars because we understand the keys to the feeding them but the only way our
[2:00:43.060 --> 2:00:48.220]  transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and bad that video so we double
[2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:51.100]  your efforts we're all in this together
[2:00:51.100 --> 2:00:54.100]  you've got it
[2:00:58.100 --> 2:01:07.420]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[2:01:07.420 --> 2:01:24.980]  of the info war
[2:01:25.140 --> 2:01:30.700]  I'm watching the midterms then you would think our country is Mad Max
[2:01:30.700 --> 2:01:34.860]  Thunderdome this guy is like they're coming from Guatemala they're coming
[2:01:34.860 --> 2:01:43.660]  from Mexico there's a liberal mob that's coming
[2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:57.180]  I love you
[2:01:57.180 --> 2:01:58.840]  You ain't supposed to be...
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:01:59.600]  Muslim.
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:21.600]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like to the bunker.
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:33.600]  Welcome to our number three.
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:41.600]  Paul Joseph Watson is our guest for the next 53 minutes or so.
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:44.600]  The Democrats, the globalists, the UN party have already invaded Europe.
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:45.600]  They've now invaded the United States.
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:49.600]  They're running the same replacement migration operation against us.
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:58.600]  And Paul Joseph Watson lives in London over a year of lockdown with the new vaccine passports rolling out.
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  And the UK model, the Israeli model, the Australian model is now being adopted in blue cities and blue states like New York and Hawaii.
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:10.600]  This is an iron curtain of surveillance and tyranny and fraud.
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:11.600]  It doesn't even protect you.
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:15.600]  Finally, Senator Paul is calling Fauci a liar and a tyrant.
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:17.600]  It's all a power grab.
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  That's a day late, a dollar short, but we need to organize against this now.
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.600]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:28.600]  Paul, you are in there in Europe, the epicenter of the invasion, I would say would be France.
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  You've written prolifically about the 600 million replacement for the US.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:34.600]  Macron wants 220 million for France alone.
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  They say that they're going to control people bringing these folks in.
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:44.600]  So I'm not against these poor people that have been under a year of lockdown with their starving to death in Latin America and Asia.
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:49.600]  In fact, most of the migrants say we're here because we haven't had a job and are starving to death.
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:04:00.600]  So the UN deliberately collapses the third world, organizes them, brings them here to be a group they control as a voting block and to put on welfare that the bureaucrats then milk and house these people.
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  This is racketeering.
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  You're at the edge of the epicenter of this.
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  What is your take on it and how do we counter it and where do you see this world going?
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:11.600]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  Well, obviously, I actually referenced this because of Tucker Carlson.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:24.600]  Once again, they're trying to de-platform him because he got involved in this debate by merely pointing out that it is a voter replacement program.
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  Now, as he stated, if you go to Israel, if you merely look at the ADL website, they state the exact same thing that they blame so-called white supremacists as stating, you know, white supremacists who claim that America will be a different country
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  if white people become a minority in America.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  And that's been proven already.
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:54.600]  But then on the flip side, you have the ADL on their own website saying that Israel needs to be basically Israeli first.
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:05:02.600]  If we don't have a majority Israeli citizenship residency in Israel, then it's going to change the country and it will change any country.
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:15.600]  And Joe Biden, we had the clip, this was about five years ago, literally came out and said that we're going to import vast numbers of people from Central America to change the voting demographic.
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:23.600]  He didn't say it in those exact words, but he said it, that it was clearly a stated goal, but it was a good thing.
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:37.600]  So as long as you say it's a good thing, Alex, then apparently it's okay. But apparently it's merely to make the argument that replacing a voter demographic in any country, whether it be Israel, America, Denmark, wherever,
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:43.600]  that that's a conspiracy theory, that that's a dangerous conspiracy theory that doesn't exist.
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:49.600]  That's not the argument. The argument is that it's happened in some countries and it changes the course of countries.
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:59.600]  And there was a big study by Copenhagen University a couple of years ago, which came out and specifically said, quote, diversity doesn't work.
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:08.600]  It isn't a strength in every single country that they studied where they brought in huge numbers of unassimilated migrants who became enclosed in their own ghettos.
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:16.600]  And you've seen this in Paris, in France to a great degree over the past few years, which by the way has changed dramatically, even though the past five years.
[2:06:16.600 --> 2:06:26.600]  It's not a strength, cohesion, social cohesion immediately diminishes, crime increases, sexual assaults of women increase.
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:33.600]  And you can track that across every country and specifically over the past five years with this migrant wave in European countries.
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:47.600]  So you've literally got dry academic papers being published by academics from Copenhagen University saying the exact same thing that Tucker Carlson says, saying the exact same thing that the ADL says.
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:58.600]  But if you say, maybe this is a negative, maybe this will have some effects, some knock on effects, which will not be positive for anyone living in America, regardless of their color.
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:04.600]  Then suddenly you're a white supremacist on the level of the New Zealand massacre.
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:11.600]  Well, that's right. And I can tell you Tucker wasn't even aware of the ADL's official site saying that a certain busy beaver sent it to him this weekend.
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:16.600]  And I'm glad it was on the show last night. We actually have that clip from last night. We'll play at the start of the next segment.
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:23.600]  But I mean, this is outrageous. The Democrats are everywhere, Paul. So is the EU saying we're going to bring in people to be the new voters.
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:30.600]  And they're saying, oh, whites are evil. We want to get rid of you. It's the left trying to turn brown people into anti-whites.
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:36.600]  What's the goal there? And how does Greenblatt think he's going to get away with this?
[2:07:36.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  Well, the goal is to cultivate this environment of self-loathing and self-hatred, which is what we've seen in the UK.
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:52.600]  And if we want to segue into the whole Prince Philip death, which I know you wanted to talk about, we have a situation in the UK where it's basically a sin now
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:08:01.600]  to fly the British flag. It used to be the St. George's Cross. I mean, that was verboten. That was literal like EDL, right-wing racist propaganda.
[2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:08.600]  That's right. So there's a dialectic here where you want to defend the crown because it's seen as British because the left's attacking it.
[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:17.600]  But it's bad as well. So 10 years ago, they were saying, don't fly the original English flag, which is a white flag with a red cross on it, the King George flag.
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:24.600]  And then now they're saying that the actual modern UK flag should be gotten rid of.
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:38.600]  Yeah. And the context of this was a few weeks ago. There was a BBC interview. This went viral this video with a conservative MP who had a Union Jack, the British flag behind him during the interview.
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  And when the interview ended or when it was about to end, the two hosts of the BBC Breakfast Show started sniggering and laughing and basically taking the piss out of him because he had, he dared Alex.
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:59.600]  He dared to display the flag of his own country, the country which he serves for in Parliament, and they started insulting him over the side of this flag.
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:05.600]  Well, they made basically a general joke like, oh, it's not big enough. It should have been bigger. His flag wasn't big enough.
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:12.600]  Yeah. So you had that context where it's verbulton to even display the flag. Then you had the death of Prince Philip.
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  Now, we've gone back and forth over the past 10, 15 years over what Prince Philip said about certain subjects and we can get into that.
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:33.600]  But the fact is, there were 1000 complaints to the BBC because they dared to cover and dared to be somewhat respectful over the death of a royal Prince Philip.
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:45.600]  Now, this is interesting because this is the only time that I've been alive over the past 38 years that I've actually seen the BBC play the British national anthem.
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:53.600]  That was their first response to the death of Prince Philip when they announced the news. They actually played the anthem of the country in which they're based.
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:10:11.600]  They called the British Broadcasting Corporation. They played the anthem. Oh my God. A thousand complaints for playing the anthem and for daring to recognize what is basically, as he said, the last vestige, the last symbol of British patriotism, which is...
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:18.600]  Exactly. Even though the Royal Family's got problems and is out of control and is globalist, the people, the left sees it as British, so they want it gone.
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:24.600]  So it's like a cross to an empire and so that's why people are defending it. We'll talk about that when we come back.
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  And again, folks, they haven't had British kings in over 300 years in the UK.
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:36.600]  Nothing against Germans, nothing against Hungarians, nothing against Count Dracula, but this group is.
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:46.600]  And technically, they're actually Saxons because the barbarians, the Vikings went and took over Europe, so technically, they actually are British in a way because the Vikings took over England 1000 years ago.
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:48.600]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:10.600]  Welcome back to the most banned, demonized line about broadcast in the world.
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:34.600]  And I don't want to go into a history lesson here, but when I say the British royalty is not British, I've done a lot of deep historical research, they actually are in a weird way.
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  Over a thousand years ago, they've dug up Viking skeletons in Northern China. The Vikings were taking rivers because they're flat bottom boats all the way to China.
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  And that's what they found, like Chinese jade and things in Viking burial mounds. They found it also in Latin America and Mesoamerica. The Aztecs were doing trade with the Chinese and others, and there were Vikings going all over the world at that time as well.
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:04.600]  But that's before the history books were written. And so I'm always hyping on the British royalties on British.
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:15.600]  Their lines got two inbred out of the original kings of England, which themselves came out of the Norman invasion. And before that, it was still Vikings that set it up. And the Romans created some civilization there.
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  So I have obsessed on the fact that the House of Windsor is like a made up name and the real name of Saxe Coburg, Goethe, Von Matten, Batten, all this other stuff.
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:34.600]  And at the end of the day, it was the Saxons that actually went and stopped the Muslim invasion. They went into Hungary, Romania, Germany, everywhere, stopped the Muslim invasion, went into Poland.
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  And so all the kings of Russia and of everywhere were this original British line, which was a mix of the original Britons with the Vikings that then simultaneously kept invading all those isles back into Europe.
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:59.600]  So that's a little history lesson. Back to Paul Joseph Watson talking about the last vestige of any type of sovereignty being the royal family, whether you're disgusted with it or not.
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:08.600]  And I certainly don't like it. The fact is the left wants it gone. So it's a very schizophrenic moment for them. Continue, Paul.
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:20.600]  Yeah, I mean, that's always what I say, you know, if the right people are pissed off or upset with something, then it tends to give an indication that you're in the right from a wider perspective.
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:25.600]  And you're a bigger history buff than I am. I'm no historian, but I know a little bit about the French Revolution.
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:39.600]  You could take the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution to make the point that, generally speaking, life was better for the populations of those countries, pre-revolution than post-revolution than post-monarchy.
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:53.600]  I mean, for example, the French Revolution, Louis XVI, he was introducing reforms. People were having greater freedom of speech to the point where they could literally call, you know, Marie Antoinette a whore and no consequences would come of it.
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:16:02.600]  And then you had the overthrow and literally in France, the mob took control. They say a minimum 50,000 people were genocided.
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  Other historians say it's probably more likely to be 300,000. Again, post-Louis the 16th, you had Nicholas II in Russia, same process, you had Stalinism, mass genocide.
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:26.600]  So generally speaking, in Eastern Europe and in France specifically over the past 500 years in Europe, once they got rid of the monarchy, mob rule tyranny and genocide followed.
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:34.600]  Because at least the royalty in those countries and other countries had some semblance of loyalty, had some semblance of public duty.
[2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:44.600]  Well, exactly. That's why it was the Saxons ended up from Russia to Germany to Romania to France being the ones that were royal because they would do the best job for the public.
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:47.600]  Because if royals didn't do a good job, they got overthrown or defeated very quickly.
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:17:03.600]  Yeah, they were absolutely petrified. If you look at the last few months, few years of Louis XVI rule, he was completely closeted within his Versailles palace, completely anxious about the consequences of him not fulfilling his duties to the country.
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:08.600]  They were overthrown and mass bloodshed followed, the same thing happened in Russia.
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:17.600]  So generally speaking, from a philosophical point of view, I don't want to be the subject of anyone. I'm very philosophically libertarian in that mindset.
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:26.600]  But generally, I'd rather be subject to a crown, a royalty that has some loyalty to the country than to a tyrannical, genocidal, violent mob.
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:35.600]  Well, let's be clear. Thomas Jefferson was the head of the Illuminati or co-head for a while with Benjamin Franklin, but they almost got killed in France after our revolution and said, this is a bad thing.
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:42.600]  So the Illuminati revolution, the Illuminati wants to overthrow royalty in the church and make itself that, but even more tyrannical.
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:46.600]  So all we're saying is there's been enmity between these two groups for a while.
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  Yeah. And basically, it's two different mobs. But if you look at history over the past 500 years, generally speaking, the population had it better under royalty compared to the mob.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:04.600]  Now the mob in America, in the UK is empowered, is legitimized by the media, and that's what we've seen on a micro...
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:08.600]  And isn't that what Visop did with the French Revolution? They're doing it again here.
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:15.600]  The French Revolution became the model for the Communist Revolution, whether it was in Russia or China. Now we see the same operation.
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:27.600]  Exactly. To bring it back, that's precisely why the leftist mobs were so irate over the fact that the British Broadcasting Corporation, they played the anthem of the country.
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:42.600]  Oh my God. They were also irate, Alex, about the fact that we have all these billboards in London now, electronic billboards on all major highways in Leicester Square, in Piccadilly Circus, all these major tourist and population hubs,
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:48.600]  that not only now show advertisements and commercials, but they show government propaganda.
[2:18:48.600 --> 2:18:54.600]  So for the past year, it's been wear a mask, wash your hands, social distance.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:19:01.600]  And it's been pictures of people ill in hospital saying, look him in the eye and say you can't stay at home.
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  Now, over the past few days, the two or three days, they showed not the social distancing mask propaganda, but simply an image of Prince Philip saying, rest in peace, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:25.600]  And Twitter went mad. They were like, oh my God, this is an example of authoritarian dictatorship. They're paying respects to a royal who died at the age of 99.
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:31.600]  This is tyranny. No, the tyranny is that you've been under de facto house arrest for the past year.
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:43.600]  And not only have you said nothing about it, you've cheerleaded it and encouraged it for the fact that they were upset about how the propaganda billboards were repurposed for a couple of days to pay respects to the royal family.
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:48.600]  Kind of gives you an insight into the right people being pissed off about his death.
[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:59.600]  That's right. Since you mentioned the COVID lockdown, that's why we really wanted to get you on is you're the model. So is a few other countries like Chile where old ladies can't go to the grocery store unless they've got their COVID passport.
[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:14.600]  So they don't, they starve to death. What do you make of Mick Jagger's new pro vaccine story? His new pro vaccine song where he says, looking at the graphs with the magnifying glass, he goes on to say, shooting the vaccine, Bill Gates is in my bloodstream.
[2:20:14.600 --> 2:20:30.600]  It's mind control. The earth is flat and cold is never warming up. I mean, it just sounds like a sounds like an idiot wrote this. So I guess Mick Jagger joins Matthew McConaughey, you know, pushing the force inoculation.
[2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:45.600]  Well, it's interesting that the Rolling Stones used to hang out at Alice the Crowley's mansion back in the day. So, but at the point, the point that is serious to consider here is that we have the vaccination. We're supposed to support it. We're supposed to encourage people to support it.
[2:20:45.600 --> 2:21:02.600]  There's a big problem in the UK, by the way, and probably have the same thing in America with illegal aliens not taking the vaccine criminals not taking the vaccine because they don't want to have any interaction with authorities. So there's a big public moral panic about all these people aren't taking the vaccine.
[2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:20.600]  But then also on the same score, you have Joy Reid of MSNBC and all these other celebrities taking the vaccine, taking their vaccine selfies, you know, broadcasting to the world what good, gracious, tolerant, moral people they are by taking the vaccine.
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:29.600]  And then saying, Oh, by the way, I'm going to continue to wear two or three masks. I'm going to continue to social distance. I'm not going out anywhere.
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:35.600]  Because that's how it works. We always said this year ago, once you get the vaccine, once you do what they say, they're never going to let it go away. Fauci has said that.
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:43.600]  That's the point. If the vaccine was sold on the basis of getting back to normal, from that perspective, you could kind of understand it.
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:22:00.600]  Stay there. Let's come back with that follow back in a few minutes. I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together.
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:16.600]  The technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:31.600]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true. So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:31.600 --> 2:22:42.600]  We have the power. But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:48.600]  So be the tolerbearers you are.
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:51.600]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:52.600]  Hey, Alex.
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:22:53.600]  Welcome.
[2:22:53.600 --> 2:23:01.600]  Would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay.
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:15.600]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:32.600]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:39.600]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother.
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:48.600]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:24:01.600]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:17.600]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:24.600]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:38.600]  You fund us, you support m4store.com, you get rate policy at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.

[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:27.600]  One Way or another...it was about a week ago. So much happens every day that a CNN medical analyst said we need to make the public stay locked up in the U.S.
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:33.600]  take the shot. We can't like let them out. They got hit the shot. So when you look at it, shot
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:37.760]  doesn't protect you. They say there's all these mutations of the cold virus which scientists
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:44.400]  told you a year ago on the show. So then even if you take it just so they let you travel or go to a
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:50.000]  park or whatever in these cities that are in these countries that are totally locked down,
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:54.640]  and they say oh sorry that doesn't work either because it's never meant to let you out. It's
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:27:00.240]  house arrest with a smartphone where you have to get authorization just like they do in Australia
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:06.400]  to go to the grocery store. This is total authoritarianism, a light years jump to that.
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:11.520]  And I told our crew over a year ago this would happen. They were like oh that's you know it's
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:16.480]  not that bad Alex. Now they listen to me and I'm not bragging about that. I'm saying there's been
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:21.680]  a real wake-up process here Paul and you know I've told you publicly and privately that the
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:26.720]  lockdown is never going to end in places like the UK and Canada. They'll let it off a little bit
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:31.280]  and bring it tighter the next time because they believe they've got full control. They're never
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:37.920]  going to relinquish it. What's your view on that? Well the process that they go through Alex is that
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:44.640]  every what four, five, six months especially here in the UK they release the stranglehold of tyranny
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:50.000]  for two or three months. Then the virus magically comes back and they say oh well it was because
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:56.320]  we released the lockdown that's why it came back. We have pictures, we have videos of people enjoying
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:01.760]  themselves on beaches. How dare they going to parks meeting family members and the reaction
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:06.720]  every single time is oh my god these selfish horrible people they're going to bring the virus
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:12.240]  back. We're going to have a third fourth wave and it's like we need to get to a point where normal
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:19.040]  life becomes normal life once again. We had a big reopening yesterday in the UK where people were
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:25.680]  allowed by the government to go to a pub outdoors or to go to a restaurant outdoors and then on
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:31.040]  Twitter many people on the right included are posting these photographs these selfies of themselves
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:37.760]  at the pub. That's a problem within itself. It makes it look like you're grateful for the privilege
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:44.240]  of being allowed by the government to go to a pub so they've lowered the bar where our expectations
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:50.080]  are so low Alex that now we can have a pint outside because the government said so. Exactly your
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:55.600]  prisoners that they let out an hour a day and you feel lucky. Yeah and it's a complete reversal
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:02.000]  of English common law which says anything that's not explicitly illegal you're allowed to do.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.960]  Over the past 12 months alone that's now changed to anything that the government doesn't give you
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:13.520]  permission to do that's now illegal. So we've switched 180 in the space of 12 months to that
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:19.120]  kind of mindset and these people who are posting pub selfies are playing into it. And let's talk
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:24.080]  about that. You brought up the French Revolution in parallels to the Jacobin situation that happened
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:28.720]  at that time and then of course later the Russian Revolution the Communist Revolution
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:34.400]  under Mao the Maoist Revolution in China. What came out of the false French Revolution in the
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:41.040]  Illuminati was a dictator and a giant 15 year off and on war Napoleon Bonaparte and that's
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:45.680]  actually where the globalists mean to go with this is to bring in a form of ultra fascism
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:50.080]  after the left has burned through things and consolidated power to offshore corporations
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:56.720]  they're then going to move in with an ultra fascist model. Precisely and as ever the people who led
[2:29:56.720 --> 2:30:02.800]  the French Revolution Robosphere and all his allies the fact that they in some case that didn't
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:08.880]  show absolute loyalty to the revolution they were the first people under the frigging guillotine
[2:30:08.880 --> 2:30:12.800]  and that's precisely what's going to happen and it's always that way anytime you read a section
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:18.720]  balances it's the people that got rid of them that get hoisted on their own petard. Precisely and then
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:23.520]  to bring it back to to communist left-wing revolutions that's literally what we have
[2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:30.640]  with the introduction of these lockdown laws it's ritual public humiliation if they can force you
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:37.600]  Alex to emasculate yourself by complying with these increasingly pedantic mandates what effect
[2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:44.880]  does that have it lowers self-respect it demoralizes you it emasculates men particularly and makes
[2:30:44.880 --> 2:30:50.160]  everyone less likely to stand up in future to these government dictates and I'll give you some
[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:56.640]  examples forcing people to wear a mask if they are sat at a table at a restaurant if they want to
[2:30:56.640 --> 2:31:02.720]  go to the bathroom oh you have to wear a mask to go this 10 yards to the bathroom the UK government
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:08.880]  literally came out and said you can't hug your family members you have theme parks in California
[2:31:08.880 --> 2:31:14.560]  telling people they can't shout laugh or scream oh nuisance told churches you can't sing I mean
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:20.960]  this is this is not satire folks this is the cult seeing what we'll put up with yeah so the mask is
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:26.560]  not merely a physical item it's a symbolic tool of oppression it's political it's always been
[2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:34.320]  political and it means comply submit just like the burqa just like sharia law yeah and we've
[2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:39.280]  we've quoted for example norwegian psychology professor charlotte reid she said quote the
[2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:45.280]  political landscape has changed to become a national obedience contest and what did we see
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:51.280]  during the first lockdown in the UK every single week you had to come outside your house and applaud
[2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:58.720]  the NHS even as literally tens of thousands of people now have died because of the NHS cancelling
[2:31:58.720 --> 2:32:04.480]  their cancer treatments people dying of dementia Alzheimer's all these other illnesses they got
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:09.280]  to the point where people were literally being publicly shamed on community Facebook groups
[2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:15.520]  because oh you know alison at number 12 oh we didn't see her come out and applaud the NHS they're
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:23.040]  literally mimicking chinese communist struggle session terrorizing propaganda to get this agenda
[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:26.960]  through and remember how they told us in the u.s and europe and the uk that oh the hospitals were
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:31.040]  overwhelmed when they were almost completely empty then people that go videotape at the UK
[2:32:31.040 --> 2:32:36.000]  get arrested same thing in australia and they're all just drinking vodka and having sex that later
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.840]  came out i know people that were working in nursing and his daughter they said that we just
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:44.720]  basically watching tv and drinking and having sex because now some of the insurance companies
[2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:49.040]  don't have to pay out to everybody the national health service can just sit on their ass and
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:52.720]  the schools parents can't come in to see what's happening the school can't come see your parents
[2:32:52.720 --> 2:32:58.240]  at a nursing home that's how they got industry seduced into this laziness of the COVID lockdown
[2:32:59.520 --> 2:33:05.920]  which is the same reason laziness why people in the UK as far as 75 to 80 percent of people in
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:10.400]  polls if you believe the polls are accurate will literally not only support the lockdown
[2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:14.480]  but come out and say no it should be stricter and it should be maintained for another
[2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:19.840]  year or two at least if not forever because Alex they're getting paid 80 percent of their
[2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:26.400]  wages and the rest is made up by the company to sit on their asses at home and do absolutely
[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:32.720]  nothing so again it's this automated nobody has to have a job and it was all actuary globally
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:36.880]  in the john hopkins reviews year before of how do we run the lockdown during a disaster
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:41.120]  this is just a drill they actually worried the COVID payments for what they were going to claim
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:45.680]  to then actually keep the healthcare industries making profits so the healthcare industries
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:50.800]  while they cut off real care made bigger profits all over the world under this global directive
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:56.880]  all orchestrated with precision precisely yeah the biggest corporations have got way bigger
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:01.520]  because all their competition has been basically eviscerated at this point bill gates all these
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:06.720]  big billionaires have literally doubled their income over the past year they're benefiting poor
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:12.880]  people are going broke they're losing their jobs we also have the social credit score situation
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:18.640]  and this this really pisses me off Alex because people say oh we're moving towards a social credit
[2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:25.040]  score in the west this is really dangerous no our social credit system is already in place
[2:34:25.040 --> 2:34:31.360]  and it's worse than china in china which is a tyrannical dictatorship it's bad but they at
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:38.320]  least apply it equally and generally it's for infractions like jaywalking smoking on a train
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:42.960]  or whatever they've already had the system in place where they hunt down dissidents for posting
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:49.440]  anti-government information on the internet in the west the social credit system is exclusively
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:56.080]  predicated around eliminating people for their political opinions and i'm not just talking about
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:35:01.120]  people being banned on twitter and facebook i'm talking about people being deprived of banking
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:05.440]  i'm talking about people being fired from their jobs i'm talking about people being ostracized
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:11.440]  from their communities their own family members disavowing them we have that system in place it's
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:18.640]  more weaponized it's more top down than anything that they've got in china and this vaccine passport
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:23.600]  system is only going to make that worse so the point is we're not heading towards the social
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:29.200]  credit score we're in one with being in one for the past three years and it's only getting worse
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:34.240]  that's right paul i've got a lot of questions for you but we got 10 seconds what's front and
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:41.280]  center on your radar when we come back i think we should talk about the truth behind covid the
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:45.280]  actual death rates and we should get into that that's right folks we've got to discredit this
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:50.640]  fraud or they'll keep us in lockdown forever i'm gonna say it again i am not lecturing you i'm
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:57.920]  lecturing myself i need to take vitamin urinal fusion every day it tastes great it's all natural

[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:18.240]  pray and who to blame 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central everybody won't be treated all this and there's
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:23.520]  a war room with Elmer Schreuer there'll be a golden they'll be broadcasting live in texas collapse
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:31.360]  border today patrick howley in studio run the man don't forget weekday morning's great show with a
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:36.400]  lot of big guests lately and that is american journal with harris and smith they take a lot of
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:41.200]  calls and i show it's a great show i watch it was at least an hour every morning all joseph
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:48.240]  watson is here with us and paul you were getting into the actual death numbers everything they
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:53.520]  told us was a lie everything was a power grab and they want us to move on out they're going to
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:40:56.640]  lightly release some of the pressure only to clamp it down obviously later that's their
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:41:01.280]  admitted plan we need to keep pushing until it's fully discredited i think fousings to go to prison
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:07.520]  for the lies he's told and for being involved in the wuhan lab we're now vindicated if you or i
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:13.280]  try to talk about the wuhan lab and how it probably leaked out of there according to experts we'd be
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:18.240]  censored but now even biden state department is saying that's what happened because that is what
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:24.640]  happened where do you see all this going paul and what are the real numbers well you had the
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:31.200]  comedic episode a few weeks ago where the wh show visited the wuhan lab to conduct their thorough
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:37.840]  breathless investigation of the origin of the virus they literally visited the lab for three
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:43.600]  hours spoke to a few people and basically said oh mate by the way did you release this virus
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:48.640]  from the lab and they were like no we never did that case closed they left they were there for
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:55.680]  three hours it was ludicrous it was pathetic the other aspect alex and i'll get into the actual
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:01.360]  death numbers and the speculation behind that they openly mockers not only do they crush us under this
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:06.880]  iron boot of tyranny they mock us while they're doing it i put out an article about a week ago
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:13.200]  didn't get much attention but the cdc in their promotional propaganda for people to take the
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:21.920]  vaccine they literally characterized and portrayed a woman taking the vaccine as an npc world jack
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:27.920]  meme now for people who don't know what the npc meme is from the know your quote know your meme
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:33.840]  website this is what it means when you display this image the character is meant to represent
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:39.520]  people who do not think for themselves or are incapable of having an internal monologue bearing
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:46.800]  many similarities to the terms basic and normie so it's literally a symbol that you use to take
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:51.360]  the piss out of someone to ridicule someone who has no idea what they're doing but who just
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:58.320]  regurgitates mainstream normie propaganda and the cdc used that in their own promotional campaign
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:05.120]  it's the exact same image with the same eyes with the same nose as the npc world jack so they do it
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:11.440]  and they laugh in our faces as they're doing it and come into the virus itself of course we've
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:15.680]  got this lockdown in england which is we're still under lockdown people celebrating that we're getting
[2:43:15.680 --> 2:43:21.680]  out of it it's going to drag on forever the timetable is bs forest johnson said all restrictions
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:26.400]  are going to be lifted on june 21st but then he says oh by the way all these sporting events after
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:31.520]  that date are going to have limited capacity oh so the restrictions are not going to be lifted
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:38.880]  timetables bs there was a freedom of information act request submitted to the uk government this
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:43.760]  was about three months ago again received very little attention somebody asked the government
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:50.800]  and by law they have to reply quickly honestly and accurately how many covid deaths which are listed
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:58.400]  which are published occurred as a result of covid alone being on the death certificate the government
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:05.680]  came back and this is published on their own website it was one in ten so one in ten of the
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:11.600]  total covid deaths in the united kingdom which i think is somewhere near 200 000 by the way the
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:14.560]  new york times he would say that six months ago with accurate numbers i don't know why the report
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:22.160]  of the truth yeah that 94 percent were not color related only six percent yeah the cdc literally
[2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:29.440]  came out and said only six percent of covid alone so 90 in the uk covid deaths are overstated it's
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:36.480]  literally one tenth of that total and now alex they also tell us oh the flu has disappeared
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:41.600]  there have been no recorded flu deaths same thing over here but let's just back up there for a minute
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.400]  remember first they overstated 500 000 would die in your country and it wasn't a fraction
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:51.120]  millions and millions of die here it was a fraction and then out of the new low number they gave us
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:56.880]  that's 90 percent in your country 94 percent here not that same thing in brazil so it's organized
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:02.240]  fraud all over the world the same numbers of fraud keep coming up it's being directed by john hopkins
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:08.480]  yeah and then you go to the polls and we also had a poll that came out back in august again
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:14.000]  not much media attention americans thought this was in august so it's going to be the same right
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:22.080]  now americans thought in august that by august 2020 30 million americans had died of covid
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:29.360]  it was 225 times the actual number that had actually died at that point so they're overstating
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:37.520]  the deaths by 90 to 94 percent but the public thinks that the deaths are 225 times higher
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:41.920]  and that can only be a result of obviously media propaganda and i try to talk to people that live
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:46.880]  in irrational fear i have people that are close people i know a small number of them but they
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:50.800]  literally go i don't want to hear it i know it's millions have died okay in the in the u.s and i
[2:45:50.800 --> 2:45:54.880]  like millions have not died and most of that died of something else and it's like leave me alone it's
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:46:03.200]  too scary so exactly i literally have people alex leap out of the way when i go jogging out in the
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:09.680]  city they literally just jump out of the way if you get within 10 feet of them meanwhile by the way
[2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:15.600]  the very same scientific elite telling us for example as you mentioned neil ferguson professor
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:20.720]  professor lockdown as they call him it was his policy his graph his predictions that led to our
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:27.760]  lockdown predicting 500 000 people in the uk would die all these people if they think that this virus
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:34.240]  is so deadly why are they not cowering inside their ivory towers why when you go down the line
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:40.960]  are every single one of them breaking the rules on a whim to live their own lives this professor
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:46.800]  by the way it came out six months ago was literally traveling across london during our first lockdown
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:53.920]  to shag his married mistress the same guy whose very same policy put the entire population of the
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:47:00.000]  uk under lockdown Gavin Newsom in the restaurant not wearing a mask not social distancing all of them
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:07.840]  life for it all of them now french elite going to secret underground restaurants kissing each other
[2:47:07.840 --> 2:47:15.120]  no social distancing paying 490 euros a head for an illegal meal nancy polosi in the hairdressers
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:21.600]  no mask john kerry removing his mask on a plane joe biden passing along masks on federal property
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:26.720]  literally the same day he passes the law not wearing masks when he takes the group photograph
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:31.520]  so it's not just hypocrisy it's not just oh they're telling us to do this while they're doing that
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:37.280]  exactly but now twitter it would be show a justice department quote official putting his mask on
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:43.440]  before he goes on stage and taking it off they remove that i mean and now they cover up the riots
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:47.280]  it won't even let you search those i mean these people are crazy paul where's it all going
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:55.440]  where's it going is is the fact that we had um an article yesterday of DARPA developing
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:01.360]  oh implantable chips to detect covid oh my god what a crazy conspiracy theory that's alex
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:08.160]  jones level stuff carl schwab claus schwab world economic forum the great reset right
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:15.360]  who literally admits in his book oh covid's not an existential threat those are his exact words
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:22.560]  in the very same book alex he says quote as capabilities in this area improve the temptation
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:27.920]  for law enforcement agencies and courts to use technique to determine the likelihood of criminal
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:34.720]  activity this is literally minority report stuff directly from directly recovering memories from
[2:48:34.720 --> 2:48:40.560]  people's brains will increase he goes on now they want chips directly wired into our brains
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:45.440]  unbelievable paul you're going to be hosting your own hour i appreciate you doing it that's

[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:48.720]  i've been forced to last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the globalist one hell of
[2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:54.000]  a run for their money because of god and i know some of our listeners get mad when i talk about god
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:58.240]  all day but just give me a break the satanism's out in the open i've always been a christian but
[2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:02.640]  now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and i get it a lot of you've been
[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:08.160]  turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:13.840]  i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that relationship with god and just god's
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:20.000]  universe that god created that is so essential and and god created the universe for us to have
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:24.400]  communion with god through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really all about so

[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:44.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:53:07.520]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[2:53:07.520 --> 2:53:11.840]  that's right matt bracken is coming up next segment i'm alex jones finishing up right now
[2:53:11.840 --> 2:53:15.280]  uh look i may have a major announcement at the start of the war room today at three o'clock
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:19.520]  i'm just gonna leave it at that this is gonna be a big deal when this comes out okay i'm telling
[2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:23.920]  everybody you're gonna want to tune in at three o'clock today i've been advised not to talk about
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:28.400]  it by council but i'm gonna do what i want to do but let's just say this country's in a lot of
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:35.440]  trouble okay so look for that at three o'clock today at the start of the war room um but here's
[2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:39.120]  tucker carlson on the adl wanting him to silence because they want to get you they want to go through
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:43.440]  him to get to you they want to go through me to get to you and it's shameful what the adl does
[2:53:44.320 --> 2:53:49.360]  and and how they promote tyranny and defend radical islam and all the rest of it while trying to
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:53.440]  silence tucker carlson but tucker carlson pointed out that even the adl's website said israel does
[2:53:53.440 --> 2:53:58.080]  not want replacement migration because that'll bring their country down so this is a state of
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:02.880]  un policy we're not supposed to talk about it and it's wrong and the adl has become a very very
[2:54:02.880 --> 2:54:07.120]  dangerous organization that hates this country and basically controls a lot of law enforcement in
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:13.040]  this nation here it is let's call this what it is harris wrote on twitter it's an attempt to remake
[2:54:13.040 --> 2:54:18.000]  the demographics of our country by cracking down on immigrants that this threat is coming from the
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:23.440]  president of the united states is deeply reprehensible and an affront to our values we will fight this
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:29.920]  but wait a second donald trump has announced he was deporting illegal aliens
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:34.880]  illegal aliens aren't allowed to vote in our elections they're not even allowed to live here
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:39.920]  how is sending them home to their own countries quote an attempt to remake the demographics of
[2:54:39.920 --> 2:54:44.720]  our country illegal aliens shouldn't even count in the demographics of our country they're not
[2:54:44.720 --> 2:54:51.520]  americans kamala harris's response only makes sense if you believe that the millions of foreigners
[2:54:51.520 --> 2:54:57.680]  breaking our laws to live here are future democratic voters and that's exactly what kamala harris
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:02.960]  does believe it's shocking if you think about it and that's why you're not allowed to think about
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:07.600]  it thinking about what kamala harris is planning kamala harris herself would like you to know
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:13.760]  is deeply reprehensible and in front of our values in other words submit to our scheme or your immoral
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:20.880]  if you heard prominent people talk like this in any other country you'd be confused a nation's
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:27.280]  leadership class admitting they hope to replace their own citizens it seems grotesque if you believed
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:33.760]  in democracy you would work to protect the potency of every citizen's vote obviously you wonder if
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:38.560]  people even debate questions like this in countries that don't hate themselves countries like japan
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:44.240]  or south korea or israel go to the anti defamation leagues website sometime if you'd like a glimpse
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.400]  of what an unvarnished conversation about a country's national interest might look like
[2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:54.000]  in a short essay posted to the site the adl explains what the state of israel should not allow more
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:59.120]  Arabs to become citizens with voting rights quote with historically high birth rates among the
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:03.360]  palestinians and a possible influx of palestinian refugees and their descendants now living around
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:08.960]  the world the adl explains jews would quickly become a minority within a binational state
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:14.640]  thus likely ending any semblance of equal representation and protections in the situation
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:18.960]  the jewish population would be increasingly politically and potentially physically vulnerable
[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:24.640]  it is unrealistic and unacceptable the adl continues to expect the state of israel to
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:30.000]  voluntarily subvert its own sovereign existence and nationalist identity and become a vulnerable
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.880]  minority within what was once its own territory end quote now from israel's perspective this makes
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:44.240]  perfect sense why would any democratic nation make its own citizens less powerful isn't that
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:50.000]  the deepest betrayal of all in the words of the adl why would a government subvert its own
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:55.440]  sovereign existence good question maybe adl president jonathan greenblatt will join us
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:00.720]  sometime to explain and tell us whether that same principle applies to the united states
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:05.360]  most americans believe it does unfortunately most americans don't have a say in the matter
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:09.760]  most americans aren't even allowed to have the conversation so they watch from the sidelines
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:14.960]  as their democracy is murdered by people who claim to be its defenders democracy democracy
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:20.800]  democracy screams the twitter mob even as the votes of the people who were born here declined
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:26.800]  steadily in value diluted and increasingly worthless like the u.s. dollar this is what it
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:33.120]  looks like when an entire native population black and white but every one of them an american
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:38.560]  is systematically disenfranchised middle class americans become less powerful every year they
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:43.680]  have less economic power and thanks to mass immigration they now have less political power
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:46.800]  the leaders making these changes have no sense
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:54.560]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:58:00.080]  challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:05.120]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:11.040]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:18.560]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[2:58:18.560 --> 2:58:23.200]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:27.680]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it me it doesn't happen
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:34.080]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[2:58:34.080 --> 2:58:40.080]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:45.040]  know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[2:58:45.040 --> 2:58:53.040]  and
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:09.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex joneshow
[2:59:09.280 --> 2:59:20.320]  it's real good to be back you know the history is history is coming at us uh full speed now
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:27.520]  the reason the reason why i'm wearing this uh info wars t-shirt is i don't want anybody to
[2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:34.960]  make any mistake about who i stand with what i stand for i don't want to be one of these
[2:59:34.960 --> 2:59:43.440]  lukewarm patriots as they're called you know a sunshine patriot brave when it's easy hiding
[2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:50.880]  when it's not easy so i i just want it to be real clear for anybody paying attention taking notes
[2:59:51.440 --> 3:00:00.320]  making lists i want to be known to be on the info wars team and you can support it you can
[3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:05.760]  you can get the same shirt you can get the stickers you can get the products and along
[3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:13.360]  with supporting info wars you'll be making a stand and that's just as important because as we've seen
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:20.800]  for example from oan shroyer's first hand videos from the border i mean there you'll never see
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:27.600]  that not even on fox we've seen how you know we we just saw the tucker interview that's good
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:33.600]  and i'm glad he did it that's really that was brave of him but obviously that's an area that's
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:39.840]  carved out for him at fox where he's allowed to speak he won't bring up vote fraud he'll barely
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:46.160]  talk about the vaccines so you can see where there are are certain red lines at any network news
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:53.360]  if you want the unvarnished truth if you want the straight distillate you know the un unadulterated
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:01:00.160]  you've got to come here and that's why i'm proud to be on this broadcast from time to time very
[3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:07.680]  proud now there's so much to talk about i don't even know where to begin i think that everything
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:14.640]  going on in minnesota is essentially a sideshow it's a it's a way for the all the networks to suck
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:24.480]  all the networks to suck up 90 of the airtime on basically what really are routine traffic stops
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:31.680]  in an age of of uh video cameras these always happened you know there there's the
[3:01:32.400 --> 3:01:40.240]  unfortunate taser versus gun accidental shooting there's the george floyd was his knee on his neck
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:48.240]  or was it on his back but the whole world is is getting ready to burn and america is basically
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:55.440]  staring at its naval with the help of the media and the corporate elites they want us to be at
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:01.840]  naval staring right now but that's by by no means is this the big show that's going on in the world
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:10.160]  in fact america's self-obsession is blinding us like a like a a draft horse pulling a wagon
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:20.880]  with blinkers on these this little uh self-absorbed sideshow is not giving us airtime to pay attention
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:29.360]  to major events around the world of course you know the the vaccine is a global event and we're
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:34.000]  and we're covering it on info wars quite in detail and i'm gonna i have some things to
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:43.840]  say about it but while america is in this clown world fetish where we're going into extreme
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:53.760]  wokeism china and russia and iran are getting ready to make major moves they see that our president
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:03:01.760]  is a non-president we don't even know who is writing the the uh talking points or you know
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:07.920]  putting up the um putting up his text on the screen we don't even know who that is we can
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:16.160]  guess that it's obama via uh susan rice or or others but we really don't know i mean imagine
[3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:23.280]  this is the united states of america and we don't know who is in control one thing that i am very
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:30.880]  confident of is that china and russia both because of the people that are surrounding biden they have
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:38.640]  penetrated the inner circle of the white house they know without just guessing what we'll do if
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:46.640]  they if china invades taiwan if russia and ukraine go at it i'm i'm pretty sure that they know
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:54.640]  that we won't fight and that they've got a a two to four year window of opportunity or at least
[3:03:54.640 --> 3:04:02.640]  until uh the next presidential election they've got at least that much time with somebody even weaker
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:10.240]  than jimmy carter if you can imagine under jimmy carter that's when the iranians seized the embassy
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:17.040]  they knew how weak he was this was a you know slapping our face a major draw you know drawing
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:25.040]  the gun and pointing at us and we basically were humiliated well biden makes jimmy carter look like
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:30.720]  arnold schwarzenegger and terminator this is this is going to be the time when they move
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:37.920]  the russians have got 80 000 troops up on the border they've got you know big air mobile divisions
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:46.080]  in Crimea if if ukraine does anything at our behest it's going to be war and the problem
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:53.200]  for america is we have no longer got conventional superiority especially when you're talking right
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:05:01.840]  up against the landmass of russia or china we can't escalate against them every card we put down
[3:05:01.840 --> 3:05:10.720]  they can match and overmatch up until total nuclear war so any conventional conflict against china or
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:19.680]  russia will mean either we lose we back down or we threaten total nuclear annihilation how how many
[3:05:19.680 --> 3:05:25.600]  people out there think that joe biden or whoever is you know speaking for joe biden through his
[3:05:25.600 --> 3:05:33.600]  earpiece who believes that we're going to go to total nuclear war over taiwan or ukraine and i
[3:05:33.600 --> 3:05:39.600]  think that this is going to in fact be coordinated when any one of these happens all three of them
[3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:45.600]  are going to happen the third being iran they've just announced today that re they've reached 60
[3:05:45.600 --> 3:05:52.880]  percent enrichment they're very close to getting nuclear weapons i know that it supposedly the
[3:05:52.880 --> 3:05:58.880]  it supposedly the israelis did a cyber attack against their program and set it back but if they're at
[3:05:58.880 --> 3:06:04.960]  60 percent enrichment it's not going to take them long to get weapons grade uranium and and
[3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:10.560]  they're going to they're probably going to do a test and then when you've got russia threatening
[3:06:11.120 --> 3:06:17.520]  ukraine and i think also the baltix if you just look at a map if you look at a map of europe
[3:06:17.520 --> 3:06:26.080]  russia controlled the baltix up until recent history they need the baltix for their naval ports
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:32.480]  they've also got a port in syria now you know russia's problem on the global stage is similar
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:39.840]  to china's they don't have direct access to the world's oceans like the united states does on each
[3:06:39.840 --> 3:06:48.240]  coast china has a series of islands from japan running down through taiwan the philippines
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:55.760]  malaysia and indonesia that in the event of war pins china in inside of this island chain
[3:06:56.480 --> 3:07:02.560]  they're going to take taiwan and break out of that island chain that's going to be the the launch pad
[3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:09.040]  instead of a keep a key link in the chain holding china in during war taiwan will become their launching
[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:16.400]  pad it'll be their open door to the world as well as well taiwan is the world's leader in
[3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:23.120]  semiconductors and chips if you've been hearing about a chip shortage lately most of them come from
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:30.560]  taiwan most of the rest come from south korea but taiwan is the world leader in semiconductor
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:36.880]  semiconductors and chips when china takes taiwan not only will they break that island chain defense
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:43.760]  holding them in they'll become the unapproachable leader in high tech in terms of chips and
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:50.720]  semiconductors that'll leapfrog them ahead and at the same time russia is not only going to
[3:07:50.720 --> 3:07:55.680]  take at least half of ukraine they're going to probably push right through the Baltics
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:08:02.560]  and there there won't be anything we can do about it it'll either be a feta complete or we go total
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:10.000]  nuclear who thinks that biden is going to go total nuclear you know as opposed to letting russia
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:16.480]  have a freehand and china take taiwan and when we come back on the other side we're going to see
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:24.080]  the ramifications for the coming years this is going to happen this isn't some theoretical
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:30.480]  thing that's going to happen in 2040 or 2050 this is going to happen soon while there's no
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:35.120]  leader in the white house and when we come back we're going to talk about some of the next things
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:46.240]  that are going to happen and that are happening i mean we are a clown nation now the people are
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:51.600]  awakening they're taking control of their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:57.200]  really they're a super computer that's handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:03.520]  foreign governments the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data to share your data
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:08.400]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:15.600]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:21.520]  absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own words they admit it so i've been selling
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:25.680]  privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade and now the
[3:09:25.680 --> 3:09:30.000]  units have gotten really lightweight they're faraday cages they just look like a cloth envelope
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:35.520]  they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have power over your data and
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:39.600]  power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:46.000]  up to because it's not their business get yours at info or store dot com today when i tell you

[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:25.280]  have it all concentrated in one place for you to make sure that every essential vitamin mineral
[3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:32.080]  you need you get the d3 the k in winter sun and all of them together with amino acids in
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:38.080]  the vitamin refusion and then one cleanse research for yourself it's amazing they're all 50 off
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:44.320]  together 40 off individually at infowarstore.com back in stock for a limited time and if i'm seeing
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:11:00.800]  infowar you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:13.920]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:26.240]  i'm just uh i guess i'm just a bundle of joy today kind of uh kind of padded down
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:31.360]  so it's hard to it's hard not to be when you're watching what's coming
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:39.760]  and this is this is where our obsession with the events in in minnesota really we are like a
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:46.480]  we really are being blinkered everybody is staring at the shiny object you know looks squirrel
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:51.600]  will they riot it's very photogenic it's very telegenic i mean it's a real story
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:57.200]  you know it ultimately it can lead to some form of a race war inside of america
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:04.720]  and that's no no trivial matter but meanwhile huge mounting forces are surrounding us while
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:13.600]  we're all staring at at minnesota and others other uh blm and tifa side shows you know diversions
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:21.920]  like diversionary attacks the big outside forces are beginning to move now these forces
[3:12:22.640 --> 3:12:29.120]  roughly are the communist chinese party and putin's russia putin's russia only because
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:35.280]  it's an opportune moment if china attacks taiwan which they'll do regardless of what anybody
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:40.960]  else wants or thinks then putin is going to see it as his time america will not have the
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:48.320]  forces to respond even to taiwan much less to a move against you know ukraine and the baltics
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:54.400]  that's an old map that even it even shows you go slavia on that map as one country
[3:12:55.440 --> 3:13:01.520]  those three x's up at the top are the baltik states they used to be controlled by russia
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:09.200]  they were russian puppets imagine the seafront the naval bases that russia has if they own those
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:16.800]  states again compared to now or looking at the three x's in the middle crimea is at the bottom
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:23.840]  that's crimea especially is absolutely imperative you know for their for their naval power the
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:30.400]  bottom x is syria russia now has a warm water port something that they've always desired a warm
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:37.200]  water port in syria they're not going to give it up easily and if if ukraine tries to grab the
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  the uh you know eastern ukraine region back russia is going to counterattack and take even
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:49.040]  more territory probably all the way to the deneper river they won't do this in a vacuum but
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:56.160]  when china attacks taiwan that's when the iranians are probably going to test a missile i mean it's
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:02.080]  all going to happen at once and this couldn't happen on the outside yet this this map is a
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:09.200]  good visual representation ever since the cold war that chain on the left with the american flag
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:18.960]  representing the fleet our fleet that chain has been hemming china in and they can't in a wartime
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:24.000]  they can't get through there without running through these islands where american submarines
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:30.800]  would be waiting and other weapons systems if they take taiwan that chain is broken and taiwan
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:36.880]  becomes their powerful launching pad instead of a key link in the chain holding them in people
[3:14:36.880 --> 3:14:41.280]  say matt what are you talking about a chain chinese ships go through there all the time yeah in
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:48.000]  peacetime but they very well recognize that in any in the event of hostilities that chain is there
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:55.440]  to hold them in and something that americans can barely grasp is how deep in the chinese psyche
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:03.840]  is what they consider 200 years of humiliation there's almost no comparison in any american
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:11.280]  psychology that we can that we can think of going back to the the the what they call the unequal
[3:15:11.280 --> 3:15:17.680]  treaties you know the chinese invented gunpowder they only made fireworks in a little bit of small
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:24.560]  rockets out of it the next time that the chinese saw gunpowder was when amer was when european ships
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:29.840]  showed up and pointed cannons at their coastal cities and they were forced to sign treaties
[3:15:29.840 --> 3:15:36.640]  which are called the unequal treaties at gunpoint you know a contract signed at gunpoint to the
[3:15:36.640 --> 3:15:43.600]  person that's signing it with a gun at their head it's not considered legit this was this began a
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:49.280]  period of humiliation for the chinese they considered themselves what you know the greatest
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:54.640]  power on earth as more of the earth opened up to them they at least considered themselves one of
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:01.440]  the greatest powers then these upstart europeans from tiny island nations like england showed up
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:08.240]  pointed cannons at them and then subjected them to centuries as they perceive it of humiliation
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:15.840]  if you recall the opium wars england really had nothing that china wanted to trade for
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:23.280]  england found out about opium in india in that area so they hooked china on opium
[3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:29.760]  so that china would that england would have something to sell to china in return for the
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:36.400]  opium so when we hear about fentanyl coming across the mexican border fentanyl from chinese
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:43.280]  precursor chemicals you know what the chinese think about that they laugh they say hey round eye
[3:16:43.280 --> 3:16:49.280]  remember the opium wars ring a bell so they're not we're not getting any sympathy for the opium
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:55.760]  you know for the fentanyl flooding our country now they laugh in their schools children are taught
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:17:02.400]  about the opium wars gunboat diplomacy and the centuries of humiliation and now that their
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:09.840]  military is powerful they're seeing the end of this taiwan is the biggest thorn still sticking
[3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:16.320]  in their side from the communist chinese perspective now you can think that or hope
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:22.080]  that most chinese hate the communist chinese party and wish they were free that may or not may
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:29.040]  not be true but how can we know in a in a social credit system no two chinese are going to get
[3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:35.040]  together and talk about it all they're going to do is be subjected to mass propaganda day in and
[3:17:35.040 --> 3:17:42.720]  day out about the humiliation and that taiwan and the island chain defense is the last vestige
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:49.440]  of the gunboat diplomacy that kept them penned in as they perceive it they're going to go for
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:58.480]  taiwan and they see it as the final repudiation the final revenge against the english they consider
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:06.320]  the americans just england 2.0 so don't think well hey that was england that wasn't america
[3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:12.720]  to the chinese it's the same thing all of the european nades that carved up china they're going
[3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:19.040]  to get their revenge it's coming this is so important inside of the chinese mentality
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:25.760]  and when and when the chinese move the russians are going to move and iran is going to move and
[3:18:25.760 --> 3:18:32.720]  as we saw in the suez canal two weeks ago that canal can be shut at a moment's notice anytime
[3:18:32.720 --> 3:18:39.440]  that china wants to they can shut the suez canal and they can shut the panama canal and that'll mean
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:45.840]  that american fleets will take another week to two weeks to get around africa or get around
[3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:52.480]  south america to get to the china theater they're going to take taiwan and we're not going to be able
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:59.600]  to stop it and when china has taken taiwan they're going to then force a new power structure on all
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:07.200]  of asia anybody that wants to trade is from japan to malaysia indonesia brunay all of these countries
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:12.880]  the philippines they're going to have to go to beijing and get permission and get the new terms
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:18.880]  from you know the center of heaven from the middle kingdom that's the plan and it's coming
[3:19:18.880 --> 3:19:25.680]  while we're all staring at minnesota these these vast forces are moving across the globe and it's
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:30.400]  going to hit with a speed that's going to shock people and i think it's going to be within the
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:36.320]  next two to three years at the outside at the very outside we'll get into this a little more on the
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:48.480]  other side you know listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel

[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:39.360]  pretty fast that was written in 2006 you can believe it and it appears to be full speed ahead
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:44.640]  and the the good work of the good work that tucker carlson's been doing is exposing that it's
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:52.480]  it's not just a border war because these these future democrat voters are being seated throughout
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:59.440]  the country i did read today that the iowa governor has said that she will not take any of these so
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:04.800]  called refugees that they're not going to be allowed in but it's hard to see how she can stop them
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:11.280]  from when they're being given these brown manila folders with their it's not even a ticket it's
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:17.760]  just a voucher from the government saying don't worry airline you'll get your money put this

[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:40.000]  seated with a takeover a complete takeover and and it's every one of these children believe me
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:45.840]  they're going to be dreamers in a year or two they'll be called dreamers then the top priority
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:51.920]  will be family reunification so mom dad sister brother and some uncles back in the old country
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:56.240]  they're going to be getting an american plane ticket to come up and reunify with the
[3:25:56.240 --> 3:26:02.800]  people you know the the anchor baby was just the pioneer the scout every one of those so called
[3:26:02.800 --> 3:26:09.920]  children and remember at you know the ms-13 they make their bones when they're like 14 or 15
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:15.520]  they have to do killings and other atrocities to prove that they're really down for the gang
[3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:22.320]  that's as teenagers our government still calls them children and in fact they changed the law a
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:29.280]  couple years ago to say that ms-13 and other gang tattoos couldn't be considered as proof of gang
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:36.000]  affiliation they said well maybe they were coerced into getting those tattoos all over them so you've
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:41.520]  got to let them in anyway and these guys that are maybe they're not so tall so they could be in their
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:47.440]  mid 20s they say that they're a teenager the next thing you know it's like a dream come true they're
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:53.600]  in an american high school and you know god help anybody that has a problem with it that that brings
[3:26:53.600 --> 3:27:00.160]  this up this is this is a really horrible thing that's being done by the democrats and other
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:07.360]  globalists to our country in the first two segments i was talking about primarily china but china and
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:15.280]  russia's plans to move while america is engaged in this internal clown show but this couldn't
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:23.040]  have happened without the american fifth column this is the final fruition of the long frankfurt
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:31.200]  school and grand sian plan it goes back to the 1920s after the bolshevik revolution in russia
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:38.080]  communists around the world were hopeful that the workers of the world were going to literally
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:43.440]  you know stand up and throw off their chains and have bolshevik revolutions in country after country
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:51.440]  it didn't happen so in the 1920s the frankfurt school in germany and the thinker antonio
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:59.040]  gramsie and also the fabian society people in england they came up with a long long term strategy
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:05.600]  they they call it critical race or critical theory race theory is just one of one of its
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:11.200]  branches but they call it critical theory critical is one of these nonsense words
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:17.920]  they should just call it communist theory the critical part is camouflage so when you think
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:24.800]  or hear critical theory or critical race theory just in your mind translate it to
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:33.760]  camouflaged communist theory they figured out that the people in the more affluent countries
[3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:39.600]  that were a little better off than russia in 1917 they weren't going to just overturn their
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:46.400]  societies not while they were still patriotic and religious and family oriented those were the
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:52.320]  three pillars that they had to destroy to create the conditions where communists could finally
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:29:00.160]  succeed you know italians and french they all over europe america people love their country
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:07.680]  they love their religion they love their families so they had to destroy each one of these branches
[3:29:07.680 --> 3:29:16.320]  poison it destroy it from inside this long-term fifth column attack has finally borne fruit
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:23.680]  it's come to fruition they are now at the point where the mighty oak tree of america and the west
[3:29:24.240 --> 3:29:31.520]  has rotted from the inside the roots are dead and a strong wind is going to just blow it over
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:39.120]  and this has been done from the inside by our own traders everybody by now should have seen
[3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:46.640]  many times i hope the uri bezmanov tapes where he talked about the soviet subversion efforts
[3:29:47.200 --> 3:29:54.400]  they were wildly successful they provided you know the money and the and the logistics behind
[3:29:54.400 --> 3:30:01.840]  the frankfort school theoretics the frankfort school the antonio graham see theories of destroying the
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:10.160]  west from the inside you can't just you know fight off communist china and russia if americans hate
[3:30:10.160 --> 3:30:18.000]  america when americans are dragging our own flag around the street and burning it and the and nobody
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:25.280]  does anything about it in fact the police will stand by while antifa and blm beat up patriots
[3:30:25.840 --> 3:30:32.560]  you know if patriots walk into an open capital they're going to be in jail forever but meanwhile
[3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:39.520]  last weekend they again tried to burn the ice building in portland arson of a building with
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:30:47.520]  people inside you know in a sane society this would result in the police shooting the arsonists
[3:30:48.320 --> 3:30:57.840]  there's a famous quote by tomas sol it says you know a paraphrasing if a society won't use force
[3:30:57.840 --> 3:31:05.840]  to defend civilization that it had better get used to barbarism we're now like the collapse of
[3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:14.480]  room where nobody will even defend our civilization the rot has gone so far that it's taken over even
[3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:21.520]  our military we know about the fbi we saw that all during the russia the russia hoax era but now
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:29.680]  even the military has gone full woke full woke they're throwing out traditional conservative
[3:31:29.680 --> 3:31:38.080]  christians under the ages of they are some kind of extremists while supporting black lives matter
[3:31:38.880 --> 3:31:46.000]  as just social justice they want only people left in the military that don't care about the
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:52.880]  constitution as written that will consider it just an old document an old dust department
[3:31:52.880 --> 3:31:58.640]  written by white slave owners so they're going to drive out the people that actually believe in the
[3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:05.680]  bill of rights and replace them with woke communists of course they won't put the hammer and sickle on
[3:32:05.680 --> 3:32:12.240]  until everything is finished they're just but i mean right now as of now they're teaching critical
[3:32:12.240 --> 3:32:22.000]  race theory at west point they're teaching our cadets to be communists to hate our constitution
[3:32:22.000 --> 3:32:28.880]  they don't say it in those words but that is the clear meaning of critical race theory
[3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:35.760]  that is the clear meaning of calling heritage christian and you know jadeo christian values
[3:32:36.480 --> 3:32:45.360]  white supremacy we are in for a very hard road a very hard road and it's at the same time that
[3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:50.880]  china and russia are preparing to move we have our own fifth column doing everything it can to
[3:32:50.880 --> 3:32:59.280]  weaken us from the inside to make our country undefendable from inside or from outside and the
[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:06.960]  only thing the only advice i can give anybody besides pray a lot is you can still move you know
[3:33:06.960 --> 3:33:14.240]  not everywhere is going to be impacted in the same way if you looked at a map of ugo slavia before
[3:33:14.240 --> 3:33:21.680]  their breakup if you had moved to slovenia the far western province of ugo slavia you would have
[3:33:21.680 --> 3:33:28.400]  hardly known a civil war was going on but if you stayed in the olympic city of sarajevo you were in
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:36.880]  for years of sniper alley bombings and starvation so the one thing you can do now is move and we'll
[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:45.840]  finish this on this talk on the other side of this break we here at info wars are proud to

[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:09.600]  to ancient simoan legend kava was given as a gift by the sun god tagaloa who they considered to be

[3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:57.600]  wanes world even before i had an access to your show in the mid 1990s i wouldn't call that movie
[3:34:57.600 --> 3:35:02.880]  and thought man that was fun back to speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:11.360]  you're still entertaining because you're real well what do they say in wanes world every day
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:15.760]  when i cover these huge topics i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge
[3:35:15.760 --> 3:35:19.440]  are so real but i'm trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and most of time we
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:25.520]  do the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:31.120]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:37.680]  set down and disgusting so you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:42.320]  will never join the globalists we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all
[3:35:42.320 --> 3:35:50.960]  in this together you cannot hide a grand assault america is about to have its energy cut off its
[3:35:50.960 --> 3:35:58.480]  borders destroyed its dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served satan believe
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:04.880]  that you are on the right team you're about to find out how pathetic you are so i ask all of you
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:12.960]  you who are awake and who love god stop living in fear the enemy is about to expose itself
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:21.680]  the enemy can't help itself the enemy comes to kill steal destroyer we sit here as good people
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:28.960]  get upset about that and try to stop it we should but once it comes through once it hits us once it's
[3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:35.680]  dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to point out we tried to stop it so
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:39.920]  prepare yourselves america you're going under judge but just like all the children that were
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:48.880]  aborted this is the truth this is the info war epic is one of only a handful of domain registers
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:55.680]  that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:37:00.160]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:04.880]  racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:09.360]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:14.720]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:21.120]  dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:25.920]  your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war and then we get
[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:30.880]  five percent as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them so it's
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:35.840]  a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:42.240]  what was open and what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there info
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:52.720]  wars domains dot com take action now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:38:15.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:25.200]  if you don't if you don't want to get my books you don't want to get my books from amazon and i
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:30.640]  totally understand that especially in kindle and audible i mean i love i love my kindle
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:37.600]  while it lasts and i i appreciate audiobooks but um you know with a with a flip of a switch
[3:38:37.600 --> 3:38:42.480]  everything digital that that big brother doesn't like it's just going to disappear
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:50.640]  or probably my greatest satisfaction is that lots of lots of these books in the physical
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:56.560]  form are out in the world in the wild on people's shelves they can never be deleted and if you don't
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:02.000]  want to get them from amazon you can get them from me anyway we're talking about the fifth
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:09.040]  column inside of america so while we've got a threat probably stronger than japan and germany
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:14.720]  ever presented you know when you when you add up the industrial capacity of japan and germany
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:24.880]  you know at the end of the 1930s uh china just outweighs them by fact multiple factors and
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:31.360]  china also has something that no other country ever had which is approximately 80 million the
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:36.880]  numbers vary depending what generation you're talking about but 50 to 100 million extra men
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:45.120]  access males no woman for them ever you know what are they going to do for a married life when
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:51.600]  there's no woman because of the one child abortion policy selective abortion you know
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:58.480]  getting rid of the girls now they've just got too many men well if you're going to invade an island
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:04.800]  like taiwan that might cost hundreds of thousands of lives to take it what is china care what are
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:10.800]  the communist chinese care in the we saw an early version of this during the korean war
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:17.120]  those mass human wave attacks by the communist chinese when they counterattacked you know from
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:24.560]  the from the yalu river coming south they were primarily or to a large extent chang chi shek's
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:30.000]  former nationalist soldiers that the communist chinese they doubted their loyalty they didn't
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:36.160]  trust them so they fed them against american machine guns as human cant literal human cannon
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:41.760]  fodder hoping that you know they'll they'll kill some americans and then be wiped out themselves
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:47.920]  solving two problems you know defeating americans and getting rid of their unwanted
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:55.920]  disloyal or possibly unloyal troops so if they invade taiwan they will be able to absorb manpower
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:41:03.040]  losses that would be just shocking to america in fact sinking a ship at sea on the way to the
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:08.800]  invasion of taiwan is one of the neatest ways that you can even imagine of getting rid of these
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:16.160]  excess males and we're seeing one version of the way an invasion of taiwan could go they've
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:21.680]  there's an island off the philippines inside of claimed philippine territorial waters called
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:28.240]  witson reef the chinese plan to make it into another one of these gigantic artificial islands
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:35.680]  you know big enough for bomber bases you know big enough for uh ship anchorages so how do how
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:42.320]  are they going to do it without tripping some you know warfare tripwire they can't just send chinese
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:48.560]  marines and landing craft and destroyers so what they did was they've surrounded it with
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:54.880]  more than 200 quote unquote chinese fishing vessels these are boats over a hundred feet long
[3:41:54.880 --> 3:42:01.360]  hundreds of them if the philippines come out in a coast guard cutter a couple of chinese fishing
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:08.320]  boats just bump into the coast guard cutter surround it block it well the chinese could send
[3:42:08.320 --> 3:42:14.960]  thousands of these so-called you know quote unquote fishing vessels against taiwan each loaded
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:23.680]  with hundreds of men if 90 of them are sunk before they even reach taiwan it won't bother the ccp a
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:30.960]  bit it'll solve two problems they'll invade taiwan and get rid of some of those 50 million
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:37.440]  excess chinese troops and this is this is the reality of the future that we're facing
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:47.120]  now back in america we're engaged in this woke fantasy we've got more attention by our military
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:58.080]  on promoting transsexualism offering free free sex change operations uh promoting you know every
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:06.480]  perversion as normal and telling anybody that objects to it that they are an extremist what's
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:15.360]  the purpose of this the purpose is to drive out conservative americans traditional conservative
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:22.560]  americans will not be able to tolerate living in this perversion environment deliberately
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:31.520]  fostered they will get out the goal is to only have a u.s military you know full of woke progressive
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:38.400]  lefty pro-communists well why would they want that how are they going to defeat china or russia
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:45.520]  with an army like that the answer is they have no plan to fight the communist chinese or russians
[3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:53.360]  they will allow china to carve up asia that military is going to be turned against us the
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:44:00.720]  holdouts against progressivism remember what i said before whenever you see critical theory
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:10.880]  or critical race theory translate it from the marxist into camouflaged communist theory we
[3:44:10.880 --> 3:44:18.720]  are we are literally sleepwalking into communism the new so-called infrastructure bill is another
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:26.640]  one of these camouflaged communist plans only a what five percent is actually going for bridges
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:34.480]  and airports the rest is going for what they're calling social infrastructure social infrastructure
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:41.760]  is medicare for all and you know the illegals will be first in line every one of these illegals
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:49.920]  that crosses the border who does not speak english has no education or a very backward you know limited
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:57.840]  education is going to require a platoon of government workers to nurture them every one
[3:44:57.840 --> 3:45:04.640]  of them is going to need dental work from day one most of these kids have never had any kind
[3:45:04.640 --> 3:45:10.720]  of a vaccine or ever seen a doctor they're going to need a medical workup from day one
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:17.440]  for for the government this is a fantasy they're they've just imported a class of people
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:24.640]  who will be reliably voting democrat who each will need just a platoon of government workers
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:32.240]  it's it's all going to be part of their their their mission which is to wreck america as we
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:39.120]  know it it's the cloward piven plan on steroids being cloward and piven just thought about
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:46.160]  you know making welfare so enormous that it would crash our system this is even
[3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:52.160]  way more brilliant because they're it mass importing people who don't speak english and
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:46:00.080]  have never seen a doctor they're going to require bilingual education translators for them at the
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:06.240]  dmv at the dentist's office at the doctor's office there's no way this country can afford it
[3:46:06.800 --> 3:46:15.760]  their solution air court solution is to digitally print trillions of dollars this is an unfathomable
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:25.360]  an unfathomable figure a trillion is a thousand billion it's a million million it's like yeah
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:31.760]  it's money stacked to the moon and back a million times it's it's a number that can never be repaid
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:38.720]  this is not an accident this is intentional they are building hyperinflation they're cooking it
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:45.280]  into the cake we don't see it yet except you know gasoline is going up a little uh lumber is out of
[3:46:45.280 --> 3:46:51.440]  out of control the price of lumber but what's happening with the the hyperinflation it's like
[3:46:51.440 --> 3:46:59.360]  magma under our feet we feel a little rumbling the ground gets warm but that magma dome is building
[3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:06.560]  under our feet when weimar germany began to hyperinflate it didn't happen all at once for a
[3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:11.440]  while they got a stimulus it's like well this is pretty good economics then boom hyperinflation
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:19.680]  out of control if our cities are ungovernable now while there's an ebt system while food stores are
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:28.480]  full atm machines are working imagine how our cities are going to explode when this hyperinflation
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:37.760]  bites and the ebt system collapses the food supply system completely falls apart stores will be
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  looted they will never be resupplied the only advice and the best advice that i can give anybody
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:53.760]  is please move far away from the blue hives that's the big democrat run cities they are going to be
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:48:01.840]  the epicenter of these mount visuvius is exploding these krakatoa is exploding everywhere in this
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:08.720]  country is going to be hurt but but at least get away from the lava flow you know don't be on the
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:17.680]  side of visuvius when it happens move from from sarajevo to slovenia you know move from new york
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:24.960]  to florida or texas do it while you can when it happens it's going to be too late now i don't know
[3:48:24.960 --> 3:48:32.800]  when i'll be back on but um i always look for the opportunity and i'll see you again
