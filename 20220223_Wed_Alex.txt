[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:27.000 --> 00:43.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  Alex Jones is the greatest. He has been so cancelled.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  I can justify it. I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Isn't he fantastic?
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  And no one is perfect.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  I've known Alex for more than 20 years.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  I've hung out with that guy. We've been hammered together so many times.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Shout out to Alex Jones. We love you.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  End of story.
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or conspiracy theorist,
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  He runs a media organization.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our First Amendment protections.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the Capitol,
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  Now the committees decide to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  Yes, journalists.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  is subpoenaing Trump allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it. We happen to know this for a fact.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it. We happen to know this for a fact.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemonar.
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  Absolutely. Alex Jones never lied to us into a war.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists are supposed to do.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that. He told me about Epstein a f***ing decade ago.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Alex detailed all of that.
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  Alex Jones info wars. The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling, conspiracy theorist, bomb thrower.
[04:07.000 --> 04:13.000]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[04:13.000 --> 04:23.000]  He is as smart as a whip. He absolutely believes in what he believes in, and he also does his research and his homework.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  Truly compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones' views on COVID and ask yourself, who's Sainer?
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's not even close.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  He's incredibly detailed in his research. He loves this country. He is a patriot.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  And he's somebody who we better listen to, or others in this country better listen to.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  Is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones?
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  They're no vaccine passports. That's insane. It's Alex Jones stuff.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your vaccine papers.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  It's just like you need oxygen. You die in four minutes without oxygen. You die in five or six days without water.
[05:29.000 --> 05:37.000]  You die in a month without food. Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[05:41.000 --> 05:52.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[05:52.000 --> 06:11.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[06:22.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:43.000]  It was about five minutes before showtime and I'm sitting there looking at a computer screen and I'm trying to come up with a headline for today's show.
[06:43.000 --> 06:58.000]  And things are so intense. Things are so serious that I haven't been able to come up with one that really hits on the magnitude of the current point we're at.
[06:58.000 --> 07:16.000]  I saw a video this morning when I was perusing through Jack Mesovic's amazing Twitter feed that somebody had tweeted at him of a car on a tiny mountain road turning itself around on a one lane road.
[07:16.000 --> 07:26.000]  And if they make one inch mistake, they will fall more than 3000 feet and die.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  That's human intelligence. That's human AI. That's how amazing we are.
[07:31.000 --> 07:48.000]  The confidence of somebody to do that with no curb, multi-thousand foot, cliff, certain death and doing it very calmly with precision because they're a local taxi driver and know how to do it.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  And living under that level of pressure makes you a better driver and not a worse driver.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  If you look at the statistics, people that live in mountain areas like that have less car wrecks and people that live down in the flatlands.
[08:00.000 --> 08:17.000]  Even though they're in much more dangerous areas because it's like going on a Mars mission, even the best athlete will have about half of their lung and heart capacity after the six-month mission just to get to Mars.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  Much less once they get there, it has lower gravity than Earth.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  That's the same thing. By not living under the pressure of gravity, you become weak.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  And by not living in a mountain pass area, you become not as strong.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  And that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger is really what I'm trying to get at here.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  And that we have lived under so much liberty and so much freedom for so long, we take things for granted.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  And I'm saying that, I'm saying that to myself as well. I don't have the work ethic of my dad's dad.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  I don't have the skills he had to do basically everything and anything.
[08:57.000 --> 09:09.000]  Now, he didn't call the repair company to come out and fix the electricity or fix the well or butcher the hogs or the chickens or the cows.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  He did it. And he knew how to do everything else, too.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  But the point is, is that we are falling apart, myself included.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And let's just be honest about that so we can try to turn this thing around.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  But the real metaphor for the car on the mountain pass that radio listeners will just add the live show feed today so you can find the link.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  But for TV viewers, you can see it. It's pretty amazing.
[09:37.000 --> 09:45.000]  It's more than just an allegory of how stress and pressure and knowing you're under stress and pressure and not buckling the stress and pressure,
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  but using it like weightlifting or jogging to become stronger.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  See, a victim would just give up and roll under the bed and never leave their house again and just die of sedentary lifestyle.
[09:58.000 --> 10:05.000]  But people that go into life with gusto and exercise with gusto, they end up being healthier and happier and wiser and living longer.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  And I'm not perfect. I'm overweight because I overwork, but I understand the process.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  I've been the guy that ran six miles every other day and lifted weights five days a week and can do 100 pull-ups, where I can do like five now.
[10:22.000 --> 10:30.000]  But that's a larger gestalt of the huge news we've got here today.
[10:30.000 --> 10:38.000]  What I'm really getting at with the allegory of the car is this, and the headline I'm going to write during the break will have something to do with this,
[10:38.000 --> 10:56.000]  because I want everybody to just pause for a moment and meditate and think about the fact that if we don't turn around,
[10:56.000 --> 11:08.000]  we're going to go off the edge of a cliff soon. And turning around is as hard as it was for the taxi driver to turn around on that multi-thousand foot mountain top
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  where one-inch mistake would have killed him. One-inch, dead.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  And that's basically where we're at now. And so here's the big announcement.
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  Now, I'm just going to tell you this right now. I don't know why I worry about lawyers and CNN hit pieces and any of that,
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  because I intellectually know that we are about to be in devastation.
[11:33.000 --> 11:42.000]  And I want you all to know that, too. Everybody worried about bills or worried about, you know, is your wife cheating on you
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  or worried about, does the neighbor have a nicer pool than you? All that kind of stuff.
[11:49.000 --> 11:57.000]  Or do you have the latest appliances? None of that matters at this point,
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  because I'm going to explain something to you with mathematical equations that are all right here, and it's very well known.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  But you understand, I know the average listeners are really smart here, but for new viewers and listeners,
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.000]  and I think everything's real funny, you understand what the great reset's next phase going in means
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  and what the mathematical equations are that equal mass starvation, uprisings, war, and death.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  You understand that we are plowing into hell itself.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  So I'm just going to give you something very simple here. When we come back, I'm going to go over some of the numbers for you.
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  You know that global economists look at fertilizer as an equation of energy,
[12:40.000 --> 12:50.000]  and pounds of protein, pounds of carbohydrate, pounds of fat that are produced.
[12:50.000 --> 13:02.000]  And so if China and Russia don't ship the world fertilizer that's distributed out by multinational corporations,
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.000]  Russia doesn't even have the distribution system, hundreds of millions will starve to death in the next 12 months.
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  And that's a fact. That's not even debated.
[13:15.000 --> 13:25.000]  Joe Biden has cut off over a thousand gas oil and gasoline pipelines in the U.S. alone in the last 13 months.
[13:25.000 --> 13:35.000]  He shut down the Middle Eastern pipeline that was set to be done soon going into Europe.
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  The Germans just shut down the Russian Nord Stream too.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  The globalists are making moves and blocking basically all commerce into Russia, so Russia's fine.
[13:48.000 --> 14:00.000]  We'll cut fertilizer distribution when they're the largest supplier in that region and the second largest supplier in the world.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  And I've got the numbers. They run from bad to worse. We're talking 100 million extra people will starve to death.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  And you get to see Raggedy Ann Saki up there giggling and snickering.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  It's all funny. When she already lives in a city that's the richest in the world,
[14:15.000 --> 14:22.000]  and it has the most homeless people and poor people except for Los Angeles.
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  D.C. is a festering, satanic, forced-vax vaccine passport hellhole.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And you've got these perching globalists living in the middle of this time bomb.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  While they turn off the world's energy and while the energy secretary, remember six months ago,
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  when gas prices started to explode, they've now doubled gasoline prices, she said,
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  oh, we're doing this on purpose. We're going into a transition.
[14:53.000 --> 15:01.000]  We're going into a reset. And we are lockstep, she said in the full interview,
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  with our partners around the world to stop global warming and climate change.
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  And when you hear that, that means kill billions of people.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  So all the little cuties and liberals and purple hair people that think they're cool and trendy
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  because they wear, you know, little funny socks and pink sunglasses.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Hey, I don't care if you have no hair or blue hair or what it is.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  I care about the content of your brain. But all of you let this thing,
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  you're part of some big winning, fun team and you're going to have this progressive utopia building.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  No, you're building a hole in the ground that we're all going to be shoveled into, you dumbasses.
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  So the next phase of the great reset is beginning now.
[15:46.000 --> 15:55.000]  Famine, collapse, war, hyperinflation, civil unrest, false flags, mass arrests.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  The end of the world as you know it.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.000]  eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  It's just like you need oxygen. You died four minutes without oxygen.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  You die in five or six days without water. You die in a month without food.
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  and it funds the info war 50% off.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  to get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilus.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  I have bad joints. Thanks, mom.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news,
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  and Sorilus can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[18:05.000 --> 18:11.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  And creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.

[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  against the globalist a true 360 win.

[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  That's the survival instinct.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, no.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Stay in the city.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[19:56.000 --> 20:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.000]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  How to prepare takes the necessary action to create the fair world.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  I see the need for a great reason.
[20:40.000 --> 20:48.000]  The people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  This is, let's say, fiction. It will not happen.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[21:01.000 --> 21:09.000]  The next crisis is already waiting for us around the corner and it is the climate crisis.
[21:09.000 --> 21:21.000]  All right, here's the best way I can lay this out for you.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  And again, I don't like to bring people really bad news.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  And I think listeners have now figured out, even new listeners can go back and see things.
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  I said 10 years ago, 25 years ago, 28 years ago and see that it's about 98% accurate.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  I don't tell you this to scare you. This is not fear porn, it's the opposite.
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  It's reality and it's preparation.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  Already, things can't be turned around.
[21:50.000 --> 21:58.000]  And we should talk about where we are now, even if we tried to fix things at this point, what is about to unfold.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  But instead, they're going to accelerate it and make it as bad as they can.
[22:02.000 --> 22:09.000]  So I personally have very serious nightmares now.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  And I'm not the type of person that has nightmares.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  I mean, I have nightmares about what's happening and about how to fix it.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  And in life-like dreams where I'm working and reading and researching,
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  that only happens when people are under the highest levels of do or die situations.
[22:24.000 --> 22:31.000]  And so I just want you to know, in my 28 years on air, I've never been this concerned.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  And I say that because I think everybody that's in their comfort zone, including myself and everybody else out there,
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  needs to get out of our comfort zones and needs to get ready.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  So let me explain it this way.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  And I think people that are out there that are farmers or people that are engineers or people that are economists
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  or people that are in business or transport, people that understand what it takes to produce things and do things
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  and how delicate this industrialized world is.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  And it's hard to run a civilization when you've got good, smart, hardworking people.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  This wasn't easy to build.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  And if you deliberately start attacking major sectors of it,
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  while you consolidate money and power and take over the world to collapse it,
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  so you can bring in an authoritarian, casual society with calorie rations and tracker systems
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  and social credit scores controlling every fast of your life,
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  if you want to live under that, you are a sadomasochist.
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  So let me just say it very, very calmly.
[23:38.000 --> 23:49.000]  The controlled organized demolition of the world economy to create a post-industrial world for 90 plus percent of the world population is underway.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  The globalist institutions organizing this, BlackRock, the Carnegie Endowment that runs the CIA, the Ford Foundation,
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Group, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[23:59.000 --> 24:16.000]  the Combines, the Sachs-Coburg-Gotha family, and others have decided to just destroy civilization.
[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  And what they're now implementing irrevocably is economic cultural war.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  And by strategically cutting off the energy supplies and strategically cutting off the fertilizer,
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  which Klaus Schwab called for a decade ago, and so did Henry Kissinger in 1973 and said,
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  I'm in a random 200, that's public by the way, go read it folks, that they were looking at things like this.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  And here's the deal, they're doing it now.
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  And so if I flew to Africa and pulled out a machete and walked to an African village and killed 10 African children,
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  I'd be called the biggest racist mass murderer on earth.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  But if I cut their energy and food off and starve 50 million of them to death in the next year,
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  conservatively in Africa, throughout the death schedule to happen, then it would be trendy and liberal.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  And then we get to be lectured by all these leftists that work for this vicious scientific global dictatorship,
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  and they'll tell you, well there aren't too many people, hey, hey, so it's this weird double think where they're fighting Nazis
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  and they would make Hitler blush, and they work for people that would make Hitler blush.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  They work for people whose grandfathers literally train the Nazis.
[25:42.000 --> 25:52.000]  It just so happens most of these great recent people are the grandchildren of top Nazis, or worked for them.
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  And it's not that it's a Nazi conspiracy, it's that these families are in on everything bad.
[25:59.000 --> 26:06.000]  They could be German, they could be Chinese, they could be Jewish, they don't give a damn, they're going to be in on the evil.
[26:06.000 --> 26:15.000]  Every person we're putting on screen openly, work for the Nazis, or their family literally train the Nazis.
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  Can't make it up. And they have horrible ill will towards you and your family,
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  and they're coming at you through their administrative systems of the technocracy.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  We're in a technocracy, so they can hit a button, pull a switch, give an order,
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  and tens of millions star to death, war start, energy prices explode, savings are annihilated,
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  currencies are devalued, inflation spirals out of control.
[26:43.000 --> 26:50.000]  And all over the West, Bill Gates says, I don't want people to have access to fertilizer anymore.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  And you're not going to get meat anymore. People say, well, how are they going to do that?
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  Well, we've got the energy secretary, you guys have the clip, I don't know if you found it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  Six months ago, say, oh, this is part of the, this is part of a transition.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  Yeah, we could lower your gas prices, but we're not, we're going to make you transition to electric cars that use just as much carbon.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  What do you think the power plants are burning? It's all bull.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  Yeah, let's play the clip of her another little cute world economic forum face,
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  the secretary of energy just telling you, yeah, we could do that,
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  but we're not going to, we're not going to let you have cheaper energy here at ish.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  But the bottom line is that this president and this administration are looking at every single tool
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  to shield American families from the impact of rising energy prices and we're working through,
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.000]  we're working through an energy transition and we've got to start by adding energy.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  And the reality is we have to take some time to get off of oil and gas.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  We recognize this, this is a transition.
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.000]  She goes on, you can pull up the articles and videos to say, yes, we can lower your gas prices, but we're in this transition.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  There it is.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  So that's war.
[28:10.000 --> 28:20.000]  When somebody artificially doubles or triples your fuel prices or increases fertilizer prices by 200, 300%,
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  you will pay more for food now.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  You will go broke. You might even get homeless.
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  In the third world, you die.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  You die.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  And they're doing everything they can to cut potash production and to cut fertilizer production and to cut fuel production.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  And it's causing mass death and that's the next level of the great research.
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  And now these sanctions on Russia are tripping their sanctions back in a cascading event.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  And then Joe Biden comes out and says, the whole media says, Russia's to blame for all the inflation.
[28:59.000 --> 29:09.000]  Two, life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out for months at infowarstore.com.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  It also has vitamin K, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  It's 50% off, despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody needs this.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter. You need what's in winter sun and then.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  We have brain force, ultra, super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  Neutropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus and of course, turbo force.
[29:39.000 --> 29:46.000]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  Thank you all for your support. If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[29:56.000 --> 30:19.000]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:34.000]  Your whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.000]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[30:42.000 --> 30:51.000]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in Marshall Law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[30:51.000 --> 30:59.000]  So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  I think Bill Lantash is their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[31:25.000 --> 31:41.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID-19 area, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[31:41.000 --> 31:48.000]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share infowar's links and band of video links.
[31:56.000 --> 32:21.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.000]  We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call.
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.000]  We are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you.
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges. We control every part of your life.
[32:37.000 --> 32:45.000]  We are the middle children of history raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[32:45.000 --> 32:52.000]  But we won't. And we're just learning this fact. So don't f*** with us.
[32:52.000 --> 33:18.000]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[33:18.000 --> 33:27.000]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.000 --> 33:56.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. You are in the reality zone.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  So the organized collapse of the planet to consolidate power and control and depopulate
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  and destroy any vestiges of a free society or checks and balances is now upon us.
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  And make no mistake, when you see people like Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab or Justin Trudeau,
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  they are the Stalin's, the Hitler's, the Mao of our age.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  And they do it through covert means, but they are criminals.
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.000]  And so it's not as covert as they'd like because they love to brag and give battle orders to their minions.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  And now the public's waking up. So as bad as the news is, there is a great awakening happening.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  So we're in the fight. That's the way it's always been.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  Evil always runs out ahead. Looks like it's invincible till the good people wake up.
[34:39.000 --> 34:52.000]  People have erased color and creed. Globalist sanctions set to trigger next phase of the great reset.
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  Planetary collapse of energy and food production systems watch live.
[34:59.000 --> 35:08.000]  Today's broadcast is absolutely essential.
[35:08.000 --> 35:15.000]  And everything we do is about giving you the power, empowering you with reminding you that God is eternal
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  and that these globalists are transitory and will pay for what they've done.
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  And to remind you that you are part of a larger destiny, part of a wider, beautiful universe that God created
[35:23.000 --> 35:31.000]  and that your eyes have not seen, your ears have not heard, your mind has not imagined what God has in store for all of us.
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  And that we need to recognize the evil, but then transcend it and build a new, better future together.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  Now, I can hit these clips and I can go over the absurdity of it all, but suddenly on a dime,
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  they go from a year ago saying there is no inflation to saying inflation is only brief and light,
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  to okay, there's inflation, it's good for you, so you use less things.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  And now they say it's all the Russians fault.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  And finally, when you're lying this much, occasionally it becomes partially true.
[36:05.000 --> 36:12.000]  Yeah, the Russians just announced massive sanctions on raw material that they are in the top two or three,
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  in some cases number one, suppliers of on the planet.
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  Fertilizer, potash, everything.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  And so that is going to do what?
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  Kill competition, which the globalists want.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  That's why they're shutting down all the different pipelines, the Israeli pipeline, the Saudi Arabian pipeline,
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  the US pipeline, the Russian pipeline.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  Who's that hurt?
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  And see, the Russians have gone to the trap and I get it if Putin doesn't do that, the hardliners will remove him.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  If he doesn't sell fertilizer to the West, and then that jacks up prices,
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  and then it doesn't get shipped to the third world where they need it to produce food for us and for themselves,
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  that's going to cause mass death.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Well, what else can Russia do?
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  Well, be more Christ-like and just keep selling the raw material.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Because the Russians are willing to hurt themselves to stand up and fight back.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  But when you pull back and realize it's the globalist and it's Klaus Schwab,
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  and it's the big banks of corporations that are bragging and doing this,
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  Russia responding like this, in my view, is not good.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  Because that's the Klaus Schwab plan, the angrier world.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  They've scripted all this out that first they locked the world down, then they collapsed the third world,
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  then the UN organizes the refugee flows, be brought into the West,
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  then big corporations are paid by governments to house the, quote, refugees.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  Airbnb just announced a huge plan.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  That's all paid for.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  The media spends it like, oh, aren't they sweet?
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  No, it's an organized political takeover.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  So the first world, the third world, everything's under attack.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  The middle class is under attack. Poor people are under attack.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  It isn't the 2% or the 1%.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  We've done the math and it varies on how you do the numbers.
[38:01.000 --> 38:11.000]  But if you count people that make $250,000 or above, it's the 1%.
[38:11.000 --> 38:20.000]  But it is not even 1 tenth of 1% of that 1% that has 80% of the wealth.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  They only had 60% two years ago.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  They got 80% roughly now and they're about to have it all.
[38:26.000 --> 38:33.000]  And then they believe they own it through fraud and they don't want you on their property.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  They want you dead.
[38:34.000 --> 38:44.000]  So if you're going to let them depopulate you and slowly poison you with GMO and shots and, you know, just watch TV and Netflix while you live in the 200-square-foot coffin apartment,
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  if you're an adult and you're lazy and you're caught up in this and you think it's fun, then just do it.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  In fact, save us all time and energy and just blow your brains out, seriously.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  But do not do this to the children.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  Do not lead them into the darkness.
[39:00.000 --> 39:12.000]  Do not go along as parents with this and sign them onto this technocracy or you will be destroyed spiritually.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  When this whole world is blown asunder, remember, someone really loves you.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  We're going to live forever.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  We're going to cross that river.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  We're going to reach tomorrow now.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  And I'm paraphrasing that song.
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  You guys give me the lyrics to that highwayman song because that's really what this is all about.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  We're all about to get tested really bad.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  They're already killing 40 extra million people.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  The UN admits and I believe the numbers have starved to death from their lockdown.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  They never point out they did it.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  They go, give us money, give us money, we've got to save these people, of course, they give them nothing.
[40:00.000 --> 40:09.000]  I mean, the UN on record goes into Africa particularly and just lines up thousands of people on a routine basis that are on their tribal lands that they won't give up.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  And they just shoot men, women and children, just blow their brains out.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  And the peacekeepers will rape the children, rape the babies, and then just blow their brains out.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  I mean, there's videos, photos, hours of it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  I never even show you this stuff, folks.
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  I never show you what the, I mean, you can go find it if you want to see this stuff.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's stuff so unspeakable where they're roasting humans and eating them.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  The UN and Al Qaeda does it too, ISIS.
[40:35.000 --> 40:44.000]  And they've got these roasted people and they're getting slices off of it like it's ham.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  And they're eating hearts.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  Okay.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  And then they tell you America's bad.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  America's evil.
[40:52.000 --> 41:00.000]  Where we are the freest, fairest, most open country in the world with the left destroying it at every level.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm just going to say this right now.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  And, you know, I almost came in here today and just talked about Info Wars,
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  because if you can look through the prism of Info Wars, you can basically see everything else just on a larger scale.
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  But what we experience, what we go through, what we have dealt with has given us a lot of frontline experience with the enemy
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  and given us observations and life lessons that really not a lot of the people have had.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  And I can see God's, you know, put us through this training.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  And I actually am very blessed for all of this persecution.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  I don't say that just to act like I'm blessed.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  I am extremely thankful for everything God's done to me.
[41:37.000 --> 41:45.000]  It's all been shaping me and preparing me like a sword in the forge and our club or hammer.
[41:45.000 --> 41:53.000]  And when my usefulness is up, God will take me out of this realm.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  But I just want to tell you, we've done the numbers.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  We've looked at the actuaries.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  We know about inflation.
[41:59.000 --> 42:08.000]  We know that in sectors that are dealing with the elites where they have already engaged in massive spending,
[42:08.000 --> 42:15.000]  that elite goods are doubling yearly their cost.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  And that means that that inflation will soon be fully passed on.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  It takes a year or two to meet up to where they're at.
[42:21.000 --> 42:34.000]  But inflation is at 100% right now in all the different systems the globalist are involved in.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  So that's another really big, serious note for everybody.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  So I mean, they are assaulting every damn one of us viciously with hate to bankrupt us,
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  to make us poor so they can control us and then kill us.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  They are coming to kill every one of us.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  And it's already begun.
[42:52.000 --> 42:59.000]  They've already let the fuse and only realizing it now and having a huge awakening can put the brakes on it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.000]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[43:07.000 --> 43:13.000]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.000]  it doesn't matter.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  You die in five or six days without water.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  You die in a month without food.
[43:30.000 --> 43:36.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses

[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels,
[44:09.000 --> 44:17.000]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2% per year.
[44:17.000 --> 44:24.000]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[45:30.000 --> 45:37.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[45:46.000 --> 45:55.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarsstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[46:16.000 --> 46:43.000]  If you have not experienced clean, pure iodine and what it does for your body takes about 2 weeks to kick it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.

[47:00.000 --> 47:28.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.000 --> 47:38.000]  I'm going to live forever, I'm going to cross that river, I'm going to catch tomorrow now.
[47:38.000 --> 47:47.000]  You're going to want to hold me just like I always told you, you're going to miss me when I'm gone.
[47:47.000 --> 48:11.000]  Nobody here will ever find me, but I will always be around. Just like the songs I leave behind me, I'm going to live forever now.
[48:11.000 --> 48:22.000]  I understand you fathers, you fathers and you mothers, be good to one another, please try to raise your children.
[48:22.000 --> 48:31.000]  Don't let the darkness take them, don't let the darkness take them, don't make them feel forsaken, just lead them safely to the light.
[48:31.000 --> 48:45.000]  When the whole world is blown asunder and all the stars fall from the sky, remember someone really loves you.
[48:45.000 --> 49:02.000]  We'll live forever, you and I.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  Will they save the world by themselves? No.
[49:05.000 --> 49:18.000]  Can the enemy false flag them and somehow turn it against us? Yes, but inaction is death, resistance is victory, and it's going to be through the process that we'll win some battles, we'll lose some battles,
[49:18.000 --> 49:26.000]  but in the end by engaging and going out and facing down the system, we will become stronger, they will become weaker, we will win.
[49:26.000 --> 49:34.000]  It is in the catatonic state we've been in of sleep, of spiritual sleep that we are being fed on by these vampires.
[49:34.000 --> 49:44.000]  All right, here's the deal. I've got so much really interesting, incredible news, and if we don't cover every facet of each piece, it really doesn't help people.
[49:44.000 --> 49:57.000]  It's not just good enough to report interesting news, people need to know the story behind the story, but from my perspective, here's the top of stuff in the stack today, okay?
[49:57.000 --> 50:07.000]  Russia to close the northern sea route in the Arctic with an electric dome weather control heart system.
[50:07.000 --> 50:16.000]  Now, that's mainstream news, and yes, the Russians have a weather weapon just like we do, it's the same damn thing, that can cause giant Arctic blizzards,
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  and that can send blizzards into as far south as Mexico if they wanted to.
[50:22.000 --> 50:30.000]  And see, that's my frustration, if somebody could just understand this, they'd understand everything.
[50:30.000 --> 50:42.000]  We are in the year 2022. All these major governments have incredibly powerful weather weapons. China has them, the European Union has them, the UK has them,
[50:42.000 --> 50:55.000]  the United States has them, Canada has them, and when we try to talk about this stuff, the media goes, oh no, that doesn't exist, kind of like, hey,
[50:55.000 --> 51:06.000]  the public school, elementary school girl summer camps have biological mints in the rooms with the girls and showering with them.
[51:06.000 --> 51:16.000]  You didn't tell us that. It's the same thing. All this stuff's going on. I mean, they are injecting billions of people with a gene therapy that turns off your white blood cells
[51:16.000 --> 51:26.000]  and makes you more susceptible to COVID on record. I mean, I've got a stack of news on that that I should have made a bigger deal about.
[51:26.000 --> 51:39.000]  I was out with Joe Rogan again last night. He's really awakened on fire and we hung out quite a bit and he was just saying, hey, have you seen where the CDC says they're not going to release COVID data
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.000]  and hospital numbers anymore because it's being used for vaccine hesitancy and so is foreign governments. And I said, yeah, I should cover that more.
[51:46.000 --> 52:01.000]  I mean, we mentioned it the last few days, but that alone is such a massive, massive, massive thing because the numbers are real and it shows a 40 plus percent increase in death, 18 to 65 working age people.
[52:01.000 --> 52:11.000]  It's the biggest ever recorded. We didn't lose this many during the Spanish flu or World War I or World War II. Unbelievable.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  And then they spun it. Oh, we suppressed it because the numbers made it look like the booster shots or the shots didn't help you.
[52:18.000 --> 52:29.000]  No, that's not why they're suppressing it. It's because it shows massive death numbers. The spin by Brit Hume and Fox News is, oh, because it showed the vaccine didn't work.
[52:29.000 --> 52:42.000]  I mean, you think they just opened up on us with these deadly shots and confuse people, send out batches to leftist areas that were barely contaminated and to right wing areas completely.
[52:42.000 --> 52:58.000]  That's called war. You think they just launched that and they're going to stop now? No, they're jacking with the power supplies, turning development, extraction, delivery and taxes on top of it is increasing.
[52:58.000 --> 53:09.000]  At every level of the energy chain, that's real currency. That's real money. That's power. Energy is the power we operate on. How we live.
[53:09.000 --> 53:20.000]  You double somebody's gas prices. You just took food off their table. You just took medicine they need. You just took things from them. Vitamins, entertainment, life, whatever.
[53:20.000 --> 53:29.000]  And in the third world, you just killed a bunch of people and we get lectured by these murderers when they know good and damn well what they're doing.
[53:29.000 --> 53:43.000]  And now they start blocking the export of almost everything out of Russia except fertilizer, but the globalists know that Russia will then, they've got all their systems surveilled, will then cut the fertilizer off.
[53:43.000 --> 53:54.000]  And that's exactly what Klaus Schwab wants. And then when hundreds of millions of people starve to death in the next few years, which is estimated, it's all Vladimir Putin's fault.
[53:54.000 --> 54:07.000]  Putin says he's a Christian now and I think Putin should turn the other cheek. I think the Russians should. I think it's finally took over those Russian hell areas that have always been part of Russia because they were being attacked by the globalists.
[54:07.000 --> 54:14.000]  And I get Ukraine's a puppet state and Putin says if they're going to take it, I'm going to take it. And Trump calls it brilliant and all the rest of this.
[54:14.000 --> 54:22.000]  Well, what would be brilliant Putin is not putting sanctions on the West because the West is not doing this. Our evil elites are.
[54:22.000 --> 54:30.000]  And our people are so brain damaged and so dumbed down on average. They're really going to believe the Russians did this to us.
[54:30.000 --> 54:40.000]  And I understand the Russians are the ones under sanctions for decades and attack and all the rest of it. And I really want Russia to succeed. I'm just saying I don't agree with them responding back with sanctions
[54:40.000 --> 54:49.000]  because the globalists are going to make even more money now on the products they sell while starving and hurting us and killing people in the third world.
[54:49.000 --> 55:04.000]  So I tell Putin to do the right thing and be Christlike and be a real hero and a real champion and maybe have a snap election vote, a referendum to the Russian people of what sanctions do you want and let the Russian people decide
[55:04.000 --> 55:13.000]  if they want to cut the fertilizer off. Because listen, I'll be able to get enough food for my family. But a lot of people around the world are going to starve to death.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  And I understand Russia is like, OK, you're going to shut all our stuff up. We'll shut it off to you. This is.
[55:19.000 --> 55:27.000]  Christ was not the pacifist people say Christ was teaching people lessons of when to hold them, when to fold them, when to walk away, when to run.
[55:27.000 --> 55:35.000]  And the Pharisees were trying to trick him into a fight with him to take a killing there. He hadn't finished his mission yet.
[55:35.000 --> 55:44.000]  So he turned the other cheek, not because he was a wimp, because he was strong. You just slapped me upside the head.
[55:44.000 --> 55:53.000]  Go ahead and slap the other side. You're the fool. You're the one that can't argue with me. That's punching me in the face.
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's what Christ would do. Now, I get a military is attacking you. They're rolling in there killing people. You got to fight. That's biblical as well.
[56:00.000 --> 56:09.000]  I'm saying there's times when Klaus Schwab, the new ruler, think they're smarter than everybody to not play into what they're doing.
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  And I get they push and push and push and Putin cut his defense spending and Putin, you know, did all that stuff.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  And he tried to not have this happen and I get that the NATO is taking over.
[56:17.000 --> 56:28.000]  So he's got to show he's not going to put up with it and begin to escalate. I mean, I think it's a very measured, reasonable thing that's been done.
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.000]  But the sanctions are going to hurt Russians, too, because they're not going to sell these valuable commodities that everybody needs.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  So just as I did one, our Keystone Pipeline shut down right when it was finished.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  That would lower energy prices as much as 30% for the average American.
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  I do not want the Nord Stream to shut down that will help Europeans and Russians together commerce.
[56:51.000 --> 57:00.000]  I want beautiful hypersonic jets flying back and forth and beautiful cities and terraforming deserts and space colonies and all of this.
[57:00.000 --> 57:09.000]  Instead of globalists having us fight over resources by making the resources more scarce because they like to keep us down and control us.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  We have basically unlimited resources, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  I'm going to go to break and come back with the next hour. We got a special guest in the studio and so much more.

[59:49.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  If you are receiving transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  After bombshell news broke over the weekend, tying Hillary Clinton to spying on her opponent and blaming Russia.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Legacy media tried real hard to ignore the latest Durham report findings.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  A Washington Examiner reporter tried to question Hillary Clinton.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  What are you going to comment on the spying allegations, Hillary? Did you pay for the havens spied on?
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  And when MSM finally got around to reporting it, they tried to blow off the findings.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  People are desperately trying to mad. Hillary Clinton with this lawyer giving him money spying on Donald Trump.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  That never happened. I should ask you, how many charges? There's one charge.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And they're saying you lied to the FBI agent.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  But seeing as Russia is always the scapegoat and Tulsi Gabbard was also accused by Hillary of being a Russian agent, here's what Gabbard had to say.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  What's being revealed here, Jesse, is the truth.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  Hillary Clinton and the power elite in this country manufactured this Russian collusion lie, actively undermining our democracy and stoking the fires moving us into this new Cold War with Russia.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  By Wednesday, Hillary finally breaks her silence, sharing a Vanity Fair article, and you'll never believe it, blaming Trump for the latest Durham revelations, calling them lies.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Tri's Vanity Fair and others might. A filing from Durham on Thursday argues that his reasons for making public, findings asserting that a tech exec with whom Sussman was affiliated was working to dig up dirt on Trump were valid,
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  and that any media misinterpretations do not undermine the facts.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Jim Jordan makes this extremely obvious revelation. If they can spy on a sitting United States president, they can spy on anyone.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Where ya been? The ACLU pretends it's breaking news with this tweet. Breaking.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Newly declassified documents reveal that the CIA has been secretly conducting massive surveillance programs that capture Americans' private information.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And truckers keep on truckin' on in Canada, despite it looking more like China every day.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Media gaslights the public into thinking this peaceful protest is dangerous.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  While Canada's Justice Minister brazenly admits the authoritarian reaction is not about health or liberty, but purely political.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  If you are a member of a pro-Trump movement who's donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars to this kind of thing, then you ought to be worried.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Propaganda pushing through media is a global epidemic. This German TV interviewer is pushing for a sooner jab mandate when this poked up woman suddenly starts to collapse.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  But remember folks, correlation doesn't equal causation. Keep on saying that, no matter how often we make this observation.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  And CNN might get an award for most times featured in media malfeasance. Will BS be the next out at CNN?
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Radar Online is reporting Brian Stelter might be up next to get the axe after his boss Jeff Zucker and his mistress Alison Gullist have both stepped down in response to their revealed romance.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  But it seems BS knew all along and failed to report. What else will be unraveled about how Brian Stelter himself broke ethical news standards?
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  And finally, we've seen all kinds of definitions change over the past couple of years, words like vaccine, immunity, racism.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And instead of defending the power and intention of words, the propaganda puppets have followed in lockstep with whatever new meaning the government and its agencies deem a word should now represent.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Is transitory up next? Two weeks to flatten the curve now means two or more years and transitory or temporary inflation now just means rising here to stay inflation.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Here's a sake bomb from May last year.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  They believe the impact will be temporary, transitory, however you want to refer to it, but they're looking at it closely, but I don't have any projections on that to make from here today.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And legacy media ran with that, even spinning it as a good thing. But here we are nearly a year later.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  Price surges that are running at the fastest pace in 40 years.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Bringing you what's ignored, sensationalized, unbalanced, misleading, or just plain false.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  That's your media malfeasance for the third week of February. For K-L-I-M dot news, I'm Christy Lee.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  There you go. And all her great work is brought to you by infowars.com. So thank you so much for supporting our sponsor.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen, you die in five or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there and it funds the M4. 50% off.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  All right, there are incredibly dangerous developments happening around the world for the sanctions, now triggering Russia's own sanctions,
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  cutting off the second largest supply of fertilizer in the world.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  When you do the equations, and I've got the articles right here, we're talking about massive starvation and death.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  This is just incredible. We'll be hitting that next segment. Also, the latest on the new permanent martial law in Canada and Klaus Schwab is in the news saying,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  it is the motto for the world. You must have this app to make sure you are not extreme and we track what you do and control you.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And the UN and GGP has approved it. These are quotes.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  So, I mean, it's all going down. The chains are going on right now, ladies and gentlemen, and the whole future is going to be about the resistance to this,
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  because when you submit to this, you become poor and sick and dead. There's no reason to submit. There's no reason to go along.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  It's not like the Romans, you know, come into Germany 2,000 years ago and give them running water and medicine, and they were brutal.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  I'm not defending that. But, I mean, the Romans just wanted to take over and, you know, run things. These people want to get rid of you.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Okay? So, this is corporate, global, hyper-dominance that's coming up. But I want to hit this now, because this is the type of thing that's a prism or a rosetta stone,
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  as I like to call it, that really educates people about how media lies and deception work.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  And they'll tell lies that are so flagrant, so ridiculous, but then put truth in it so, at least when people go, check it, it's ambiguous whether they're lying or not.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And here's a great example of Joe Rogan and myself. I've known Joe for 23 years, been really good friends with him for a long time,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  and let's just say we've done a lot of wild stuff together. I've never made any lies about the fact that I've been a wild man in my life here and there.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  And he's moved to Austin, and we hang out pretty much every week or so, and go out to dinner, you know, just a lot of fun stuff.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  So, I know Joe very, very well, and also know his security guys from Los Angeles.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  He has the same security guys. He hired some extra ones here in Austin, because he's got a bigger place now, and, you know, he's even more famous, like super, superstar level.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  And so, I know his security guys, I know all of them, have dinner with them, hang out with them all the time.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Here is the sun, and this is in other newspapers, but the reason this is important is that this is the tactic they use on you, and on me, and on Christians, and on conservatives,
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  and on any type of orthodox group that doesn't want to be slaves to the globalists. I don't care if it's Muslims, I don't care if it's Hindus, I don't care if it's Amish, we're all under attack by this.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  So, they have a headline saying he's had to hire a bunch of security because of him criticizing the vaccines, and the great reset, everyone hates him now, and he's in trouble.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  No, I'm not going to give you the inside baseball, but let's just say this, Joe's happier than a pig, and you know what, his show has gotten way bigger, way more profitable.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  He's way more everything, but then they use the lie of he's surrounded, everyone's attacking his house, and they show where he lives.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  There's articles every day. Here's where Joe Rogan lives. Here's where he lives, you know, if you're mad at him.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  So, they're like, here's where he lives in Austin, and here's why he's a bad person. That's the terrorism of these people.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  Rogan hires elite armed bodyguards to protect his family at $14.4 million home amid Spotify controversy.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  No, he has the exact same amount of bodyguards he had when he moved here. It's hard to believe it's already been almost two years.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  He has the same amount of bodyguards, the same people. I'm not going to get into how many.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And yeah, they are a bunch of former Special Forces soldiers and good guys, really nice professional guys.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  But the point is, is that this is a total lie, but you see the multi layers. Here's where he lives. Go get him. Everybody hates him.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  He's under siege. Don't criticize the vaccines. You'll get hurt too.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Same reason they say, Jones is a loser. Jones is a racist. Jones is a demon. Jones is going down to scare everybody else in Congress, particularly, to not stand up to the right thing.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  That's why MGT, MTG, Martin Taylor Green, MTG coming here and saying people shouldn't demonize you. People shouldn't be scared of you.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Tim Poole saying that. Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson. That's important because then it shows other people not to be cowards.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  And more people can now step forward. And it's bigger than Joe Rogan. It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  That's what's happening here. We'll put this photo on screen, but I got to tell you, hanging out with Tim Dillon, Joe Rogan, and Mr. White was really, really fun last night.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  We talked for hours. It was just a great, great time, a great evening. And I was getting in bed at 8.30. I was so tired.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  I didn't know Joe had been texting me, or I'd been out with him earlier, I guess, for dinner or whatever, but I'd still got to the club and hung out with him. And just Joe is just so damn happy.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And it's like any time I want. You just call Joe up, go hang out with him, and he's so awake, he knows exactly what's going on, and he's had this journey of really realizing the new order is real.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And now he's more popular than ever, and he's just the archetypal example of victory. And it's such a blessing in my life to see that happening, and him being an example of courage to other people.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  But he doesn't come out and do victory laps and rub their faces in it. I will do that for him. Okay.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  But it's just, it's just crazy. He's gotten everybody to move to Austin. Tim Dillon, everybody, Tony, Enchcliff, everybody, we had a great time last night.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  And the reason I raised that is not the name drop and go, oh, look, you know, I'm really in the end crowd here. No, the end crowd is Hollywood. It's collapsed. No one wants to be part of it.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  And the new end crowd is populace. You, the end crowd is just hardworking good people that work at a shoe store, work on a farm, or work at a gas station.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  It doesn't matter. It matters if you love God and you're a good person and you take care of your family. That's all that matters. Not all the Nike tennis shoes and all the crap.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  And Joe gets that, but that's why I raised this. And Joe even knows about this and pissed off about it because he knows CNN's a pack of lying scum.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  We're talking about that coming up a little bit later. Remember CNN and remember Rolling Stones saying, oh, it's horse pace.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And thousands of people lined up at Oklahoma hospitals can't get help with their gunshot wounds because of thousands of people that got sick or died of ivermectin.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  There wasn't one sick person. It was all a lie. It was August. They show people in coats with mask on to get into the, you know, 110 degree temperature up in 105 degree temperature.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  It was all lies. It's the same people. And so now they're running every few minutes, I'm told, every break.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  The CNN special report, Megaphone for Conspiracy, the Alex Jones story.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  And all these dumb leftists are all over Twitter saying, why are they going to give him attention? He shouldn't have a story about him.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  I don't want to hear about Alex Jones. I mean, just thousands of these tweets are everywhere.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  I don't want to explain something to the dumbasses over there. Okay. Not just at CNN, but the dumb Twitter people.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  I don't want to be on your CNN. I don't want to be in your fake report.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  I don't need validation by being attacked and demonized by CNN that covers up for pedophilia and every other form of evil satanic crap there is.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  The idea that I want to be on Dateline NBC, the idea that I want to be on CNN. Let me tell the dumb leftist something.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I turned down interview with all these people with HBO, with all of them.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I've turned them all. I've turned Hollywood down for major movie roles, starring roles, two, three, five million dollar paychecks.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  I don't want you. I reject you.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  But I will on my show tell the truth about these people.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  And they sent me this letter weeks ago.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  John Ronson, who is a fiction writer that claims he writes nonfiction.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  That I've known 22 years, no, 24 years, 25 years, excuse me.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Then like in 1998, known as long as I've known Joe Rogan, met him the same year.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  This guy is the biggest snake I've ever seen in the media.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  He goes and gets these fake interviews and people where I went to school a few years in Dallas and claims I would beat up nerds like revenge the nerds.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And that they kidnap me and tied me up and knocked all my teeth out.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  I mean, 100% not true. None of it real. I was beat up as a middle schooler.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I learned to fight back. I fought big people. I fought grown men.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And that's why they talk about one guy that I did, you know, put in the hospital for a couple weeks.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Why was I arrested for that? Because I didn't start that fight.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Literally, they're going back to create a fake origin story, ladies and gentlemen, where Alex Jones is a bully that beats up little kids.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  No, it's the left that wants to abort children. It's the left that wants to sexually mutilate children.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  It's the left that wants to destroy children's minds. It's the left that are censoring. It's the left that are bullies.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Black, white, it doesn't matter. You need what's in winter, sun, and then we have brain force ultra super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Neutropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus, and of course, turbo force.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Thank you all for your support. If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  They're exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.080]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:55.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band of ideal links.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:04.120]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:08.520]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:14.200]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:17.400]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:20.840]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.440]  coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:31.720]  because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:35.160]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:40.040]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:45.480]  Like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.160]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:51.080]  So pray for these folks big time.
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:55.000]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.680]  because truth is absolutely bare mouth.
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:03.240]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:05.720]  both at home and the world at large.
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:10.280]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.120]  our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:19.160]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed
[1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:21.320]  to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:26.600]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout with down and out,
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:32.280]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:37.080]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:41.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:45.080]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:47.720]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:51.400]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:53.880]  because you will be down and out.
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:57.240]  Selling out now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:57.240 --> 1:20:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:38.040]  So my keynote wise was on with Joe Rogan.
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:42.280]  And I mean I don't have time for you to watch the whole 3-4 hour show,
[1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:44.040]  I watch clips of it, I watch the whole thing.
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:47.880]  And he destroys the great reset, he destroys the globalist,
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:52.840]  he makes some really salient points and the way he puts them is the best way I've heard it.
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:55.160]  So this is why they're coming after Joe Rogan,
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:57.800]  that's why they're targeting his house, that's why they're claiming mobs
[1:20:57.800 --> 1:20:59.000]  are going to attack him there.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.920]  So mentally ill people hear that and go do it.
[1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:04.360]  And that's not going on, but they hope it happens.
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:08.040]  And he already had the security there before when he moved there almost two years ago.
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.440]  But again, that's how they terrorize people.
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:14.040]  Very, very powerful interview, here's just a few minutes of it
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:17.800]  where he explains how they create relativity and truth,
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:21.320]  but then tell you you've got to accept their absolute truths.
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:25.720]  Like two men can have a baby and you can't question this vaccine,
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:30.200]  but we can tell you that everything else is relative.
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:33.400]  It's basic cult mind control, he lays it out.
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:39.160]  Not just talking about government, I'm also talking about people that have accepted a
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:43.480]  certain narrative and find that there's a lot of other people that are along with them
[1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:44.840]  in this same narrative.
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:50.520]  And they have these media pylons, like social media pylons where they attack people.
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:55.160]  And like you call you an anti-vaxxer, even though you've been vaccinated.
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:57.000]  The same thing with Eric Clapton.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.720]  They were angry at Eric Clapton because he spoke openly about his very extreme vaccine side effects.
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:07.240]  Just speaking openly as a person who was vaccinated.
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:09.560]  And they called him a vile anti-vaxxer.
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:12.360]  Well, the question is why, right?
[1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:13.880]  And it's to shut debate down.
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:15.480]  Now, why would you want to shut debate down?
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:18.200]  There's, I think there's a deeper point here.
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:24.840]  And that is that we've just, we've just come out of a time where for a long time,
[1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:33.320]  moral and, let's just say, relativism, whether it's moral or otherwise.
[1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:36.600]  Relativism, this idea that truth is relative.
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:41.080]  This idea that, that it's all subjective, that everything is personal experience.
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:42.600]  That's being promoted.
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:44.440]  You know, there's no such thing as reality.
[1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:46.200]  Whether it comes down to defining a man or woman.
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:50.920]  And we spoke about this last time I was here with, with, well, it was there in California,
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:51.720]  but with Sam as well.
[1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.080]  We spoke about the trans debate.
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:53.560]  Yes.
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:59.400]  Whether it's defining a man and a woman, whether it's anything else.
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:02.600]  This idea that actually truth is all personally subjective.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:02.920]  Right.
[1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:06.600]  When you, when you promote the idea that there's no such thing as truth.
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:13.960]  And when you shut down debate that is seeking truth, not that it claims truth, but is seeking it.
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:18.760]  When you shut that debate down in aid of this idea that truth is relative.
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:24.680]  Like those, for example, who now know the science that the COVID vaccination
[1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:29.640]  doesn't stop or, or doesn't stop infection or transmission and doesn't reduce it beyond
[1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:30.440]  12 weeks.
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:32.040]  The booster shot, by the way, is eight weeks.
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:37.240]  But having known that, and they still insist on vaccine passports.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:40.280]  It's, it's no longer about seeking the truth for them.
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:43.080]  The truth is relative and it serves a purpose.
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:44.200]  What happens when you do that?
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:49.000]  When there's no such thing as truth, you can't define reality.
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:52.920]  And when you can't define reality, the only thing that matters is power.
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:55.400]  You're a father.
[1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:59.640]  Now we are child, children who can't reason, like my, my kids five.
[1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:01.800]  I mean, his reasoning abilities are great, but he's five.
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:02.200]  Right.
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.920]  It's why you say to the child, because I said so, do it.
[1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:08.600]  It's good for you because they don't know how to reason yet.
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:09.240]  Yeah.
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:12.760]  And you try and if something's too complex, you say, I'll explain another time.
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:14.360]  But right now you have to listen to your father.
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:15.000]  Don't do this.
[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:18.920]  When you can't, when there's no such thing as truth, because everything's relative,
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:23.480]  the only thing that matters is power, because power gets to define reality.
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.280]  And this brings us to the hybrid war we're in right now.
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:33.560]  And that's why people that are in power, who are seeking a specific outcome from the world
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:35.560]  that we're in, want to shut debate down.
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:37.960]  What they're not interested in is seeking truth.
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.200]  What they're interested in is shutting that debate down,
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:44.200]  because power steps into that void when reason no longer exists,
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:47.080]  and gets to define reality for you from up above.
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:53.000]  And it's why it's so important in a dictatorship that the only thing you have left,
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.880]  when all your power is taken from you, is the truth.
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:02.200]  And if you read Orwell, if you look at 1984, it's why he spends so much time talking about how
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:08.680]  the power he was writing about in that fictional account is attempting to redefine reality,
[1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:14.440]  redefine the past, redefine the future, because if you can't hold on to reality,
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:19.880]  you have no premise to scrutinize the government for whether they're telling you the truth or not.
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:23.240]  And it's really, it is a war in that sense, hybrid war.
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:27.080]  So information in that war becomes your most powerful weapon.
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:32.760]  Now, most people don't have the privilege of researching these debates, foreign policy,
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.840]  war on terror, COVID, whatever it is.
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:37.320]  People don't have the privilege because they're working nine to five,
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:41.640]  a minimum wage, and they're hungry, and they're just busy trying to live and survive.
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:46.600]  What they normally do is they outsource their thinking on where the truth lies
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:48.360]  to trusted voices in the media.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.840]  So it's why it becomes so important to manipulate the media,
[1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:56.840]  so that those trusted voices that people are looking to are no longer giving them
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:59.480]  at least the best understanding of the truth they have,
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:02.280]  but are also peddling the agenda of power.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:07.080]  When you're in a situation like that, it becomes difficult to define reality,
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:11.240]  and therefore difficult to challenge government on whether or not they are
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:14.760]  sticking to their promises, because everything gets shifted.
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:15.640]  Everything's relative.
[1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:17.320]  The overton window keeps moving.
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:18.600]  The goalposts keep shifting.
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:22.440]  Very powerful piece.
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:24.360]  Rogan speechless as guest breaks down.
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:27.400]  Klaus Schwab's great reset infiltration of world governments.
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:34.360]  That's only one of the clips I just played that that guy's dead on about what we're dealing with.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.680]  Dead on. Take away the foundation.
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:40.120]  Take away any mooring.
[1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:41.160]  Take your eyes away.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:41.960]  Take your ears away.
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:43.160]  Take your taste away.
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:46.600]  Take everything away and just tell you now this is what's real.
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.160]  Two women had a baby and then California president.
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:54.840]  No, a man saying they were a woman was allowed into rape a woman.
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:55.480]  They raped her.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.800]  But once you go along with that lie, now you ignore the rape.
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:03.240]  You see, and that's the thing about going along with evil.
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:10.520]  The thing is that it always demands more reality because it can't operate in reality.
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:11.400]  I mean, it's like Biden.
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:13.160]  I can play the clips all day making fun of him.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:15.560]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:18.920]  He's addressing a foreign power that just took over a part of the world.
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:25.480]  You can't string together one coherent sentence.
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:28.680]  And isn't he emblematic of the dying American empire?
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:32.760]  Because the globalists used America to set the empire up.
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:35.000]  But everybody knows it's the American empire.
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:39.720]  And everybody knows it's full of crap and evil and decadent and run by scum.
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:42.920]  Do you want to be represented by scum?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.800]  Do you want to be represented by people like that?
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:48.920]  And no, the answer is no.
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:51.080]  No. So that's what I'm saying.
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:55.560]  It's not a hatred of the Democratic Party or the Republican establishment or Hollywood.
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:58.120]  It's a more of we are not with you.
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:00.200]  We reject you.
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:02.520]  We don't like you.
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:04.040]  We don't believe in you.
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:05.960]  We don't want to be part of you.
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:13.000]  We do not want to be involved in any sort of commerce with you.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:13.960]  It's very simple.
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:18.200]  That's why they're always like trying to demonetize people and censor people and
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:22.040]  bully people and do all this because they want to rape us politically,
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:23.160]  culturally, physically.
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.520]  They want to dominate us.
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:28.600]  They want us to submit to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates's New World Order,
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.400]  like every other empire and every other power mad group.
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:33.080]  And I don't care what group it is.
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:35.240]  You are not going to get me to submit to anything,
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:37.880]  but my inner compass is connected to God.
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:41.480]  We'll be right back with our special guest in studio,
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:43.720]  because I thought about this guest a few weeks ago.
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:47.000]  I wanted to get him back because this is a solution.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.600]  You know, it's not going to save the world,
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:52.040]  but things like this are going to really change the world.
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:54.360]  And with a lot of things like this happening, we will save the world.
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:59.800]  2. Life changing.

[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:07.560]  at infowarstore.com.

[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:16.040]  Critical fear immune system and so much more.

[1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:05.320]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:10.920]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:13.880]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:15.480]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[1:30:15.480 --> 1:30:16.520]  it doesn't matter.
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:20.440]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:21.080]  are out there.
[1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:22.680]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.360]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.840]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:28.440]  You die in a month without food.
[1:30:28.440 --> 1:30:32.600]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins
[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:34.520]  are in the food that you need.
[1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.760]  And one of the most important for your immune system
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:39.000]  and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.360]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K

[1:30:57.320 --> 1:31:00.040]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:02.840]  They're here all over the world from Australia
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:05.240]  to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:08.200]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go
[1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:11.560]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:15.640]  taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:15.640 --> 1:31:19.720]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:22.200]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away
[1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:24.200]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:26.040]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:27.880]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:30.200]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:31:30.200 --> 1:31:33.080]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[1:31:33.080 --> 1:31:37.240]  meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:46.280]  We have special dry bags.
[1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:47.560]  We've got them for cell phones.

[1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:03.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:17.240]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:19.800]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:21.960]  you are the resistance.
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:33.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:35.640]  All right, folks, he was on with us a few months ago
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:41.080]  in the middle of the big upswing in COVID in the United States.
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:42.760]  And we got a lot of great feedback from listeners.
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:44.760]  And so I was thinking about him a few weeks ago.
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:48.520]  I wanted to get him in studio because so much has happened.
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:50.120]  He's Dr. Said Hader.
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:53.960]  He's a doctor who specializes in internal medicine
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:59.080]  who's treated over 35,000 patients, over 4,000 with active COVID infections.
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:01.160]  I think the number is higher now than we had in my last time,
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:04.200]  resulting in zero deaths with only five hospitalizations.
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:07.560]  Over 30,000 were given ongoing preventative ivermectin
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:10.680]  of those who took ivermectin to prevent catching COVID,
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:13.640]  less than 10 returned with active COVID infections.
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:18.600]  But the breaking news of USPS and FDA are colluding to withhold
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.440]  overseas ivermectin shipments to Americans.
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:23.960]  Dr. Said is working to counteract this crisis
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:27.960]  by sourcing the cheapest US mail order pharmacies in each state.
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:31.240]  This bold action will provide Americans with life-saving drugs
[1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:34.520]  before they get sick or once they have already began to get sick
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.280]  with the first day of symptoms, mygotodoc.com.
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:43.320]  And folks know I've had on other doctors and other groups
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:46.360]  and other organizations that are great, Dr. Marble and many others.
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:48.760]  They get overwhelmed, you know, two, three day waits.
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:52.200]  These folks have one of the fastest responses.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:56.840]  And the reason I wanted him on now and of course before
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:59.960]  was we get inundated with calls by listeners
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.600]  and we go through the emails every day and try to respond.
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:05.480]  We can't usually respond to emails, but it's like we're murdering people
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:08.120]  if we don't when they're asking for information.
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:11.080]  And we've gotten really great feedback with these folks,
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:14.440]  you know, a few hours to a day for people to get a response depending on how the
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:16.120]  flood of phone calls are coming in.
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:18.440]  What I think is important and what they're doing is
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:22.360]  preventatively to be able to stockpile, which I've already done before I ever
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:24.840]  met you guys, for family and friends and others.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:26.920]  Because this is not cocaine or something.
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:29.240]  This is ivermectin and other things that are completely
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:31.160]  safe and healthy and right out there on the record.
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:33.720]  And now all these studies are coming out since you were last on
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:36.360]  validating what everybody anecdotally could see.
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.920]  So I want to talk about ivermectin with you and so much more.
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:42.040]  Because if you don't think they're going to have another wave,
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:45.480]  as Bill Gates has said, or a new thing, you know, this month, next month,
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:48.440]  or you know, next fall, next winter, you're crazy folks.
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:51.480]  This is definitely a roll out of a synthetic virus in my view.
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:55.480]  So I really appreciate Dr. Seed, a hater joining us.
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:02.680]  And you can go to mygo2.com, that's M is uppercase, mygo2.com.
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:04.440]  Doc, where's the best place for people to go visit?
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:07.080]  That's it. I mean, upper lower case, it doesn't matter in a web browser.
[1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:11.880]  So it's just mygo2.com, that's mygo2.com.
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.800]  And yeah, I mean, the main thing I think that people need to realize now
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:18.840]  is that this isn't over. It's far from over.
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.360]  And the problem is that it is a bioweapon, right?
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:25.640]  And so the bioweapon is dangerous itself.
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:28.440]  Certainly vaccines are probably more dangerous than the virus,
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:31.160]  certainly more dangerous than the virus itself.
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:35.240]  But to be fooled into thinking that the real payload is the vaccine,
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:36.920]  you know, that's an error, right?
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:40.520]  So the virus itself is also extremely dangerous,
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:43.160]  and it's mutating to become even more dangerous.
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:45.960]  Oh, I got it. I know I had Delta. It was bad.
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:52.360]  So they said, and I agree, Omicron was not as severe, quote unquote,
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.760]  as Delta or some of the earlier variants,
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:57.320]  but not severe doesn't mean it's not bad.
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:01.960]  So the Omicron variant causes pretty severe illness.
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:04.760]  I mean, so by not severe, what's meant medically
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:07.400]  is that it doesn't cause as much hospitalization and death.
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:09.640]  But what we're not talking about here,
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:11.480]  and we haven't really been talking about it since the beginning,
[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:12.200]  is long COVID.
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.880]  So long COVID is very similar to vaccine injuries.
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:20.520]  And anywhere from like 50% to 60% of everyone who gets this virus
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:22.680]  ends up with what they know is long COVID.
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:24.760]  They have the symptoms of long COVID.
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:27.160]  Oh, I know a lot of people it's happened to, including this office.
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.040]  Yeah. And it's not a walk in the park.
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:33.000]  It can be devastating. It can make it hard to work.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.320]  Do we know what's causing it? Is it the spike protein?
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:36.840]  It's the spike protein. Exactly.
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:37.800]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:39.960]  And that's the key thing to realize here,
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:42.200]  that if you get infected, the spike protein,
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:44.520]  which is the real payload here,
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.840]  that's what's causing damage in long COVID.
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:49.320]  And in acute COVID, that gets introduced in your body,
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:52.520]  and it doesn't leave sometimes for months, maybe for years.
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.680]  And it gets stuck inside your immune cells.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:56.600]  And that's what other doctors and studies have said.
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:59.720]  Again, I'm not a doctor like you, but that it's the spike protein.
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:01.320]  The study's now up to a year or longer,
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:02.920]  because it keeps, you know, time keeps going.
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:06.760]  But from the beginning of this, and that what I've heard
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:09.720]  from other doctors is people are now taking cycles of Ivermectin
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:11.160]  and things just to make sure it's cleared out.
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:14.040]  Yeah. So we're doing a lot of long COVID treatments
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:17.080]  and, you know, the most important thing for us
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:19.880]  is to get medication into the hands of patients
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:23.000]  before they get sick so that they have it ready to go on day one,
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.680]  and they can cut short the illness
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:26.360]  and prevent long COVID from happening.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:27.880]  So that's really important.
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:30.600]  You want to minimize the amount of virus in your body,
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:32.440]  and you want to minimize the amount of spike protein
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:33.400]  that ends up in your body.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:35.720]  Do we know, doctor, what Ivermectin does?
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:36.600]  Everybody asked me that.
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:40.200]  Why is it such a miracle drug in all these studies and everywhere?
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:43.640]  Yeah. So basically, it blocks the binding of the virus to your cells.
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:45.960]  That's the really big thing that it does.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:47.880]  So it's got that antiviral effect,
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:51.240]  and then it has anti-inflammatory effects for long COVID specifically.
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.320]  So it prevents certain inner-leukins
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:55.800]  from going up in numbers in your body.
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:58.280]  So the virus, first of all, it's multiplying in your body,
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:38:59.480]  and you've got to stop that.
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:02.120]  Ivermectin does that, you know, because it blocks the entry.
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:03.720]  And then you've got to stop the inflammation
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:04.760]  that the virus causes.
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:06.920]  So you're always going to have some virus that's multiplied,
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:08.440]  it's kicking up inflammation,
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:11.000]  and then Ivermectin targets that specific inflammation.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:12.840]  It stops that inflammation from happening.
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:15.400]  It binds to the spike protein itself,
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:17.560]  helps your body to get rid of it.
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:21.880]  So it really does a tremendous job for COVID-19 specifically.
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:23.480]  It has a number of, you know,
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:26.120]  really important specific effects for COVID-19.
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:27.720]  And then we see all the reports out there
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:30.840]  where people try to get it for their family members and can't,
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:32.680]  or they get a court order, they start it,
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:34.600]  then the court order elapses, and then they die.
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:36.040]  But for everybody I've known,
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:38.280]  including family that was on death's doorstep,
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.680]  within six, seven hours of Ivermectin,
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:42.040]  they were bouncing back.
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:42.920]  It was incredible.
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:44.600]  And I know when I took Ivermectin,
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:46.600]  it was within a day I felt way better.
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:48.520]  Yeah, and we get that a lot.
[1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:51.320]  We get it from people mostly who have the acute infection,
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:53.240]  and especially if you start in the first couple of days.
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:55.720]  So I used to say start in the first, you know,
[1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:57.560]  four or five days and you'll be fine.
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:59.480]  But the problem, you know, that we're seeing here
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.560]  that, again, is not being really talked about a lot
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:04.200]  in the mainstream media, or even the alternative media,
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.200]  is that the virus is getting harder and harder to treat,
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:07.240]  even with Ivermectin.
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:08.760]  You have to use higher doses,
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:09.880]  you have to start earlier,
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.480]  and you have to treat it for longer.
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:12.680]  So you go and look up...
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:14.360]  Coach, evolving to get worse.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.120]  It's evolving, and it may actually be evolving
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:18.600]  because people aren't taking my direction seriously.
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:20.040]  One, you know, first of all,
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:23.160]  and we're not using like the whole protocol.
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:25.080]  A lot of people just want to use Ivermectin.
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:26.840]  You've got to use a number of different drugs.
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:29.240]  Nowadays, we're actually recommending hydroxychloroquine
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:31.240]  and Ivermectin together, right?
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:32.120]  Sure, so it's a cocktail.
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:33.320]  Yeah, that's what other doctors say.
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:33.880]  Yeah, you've got to...
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:35.960]  So what do people need to have?
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:37.720]  So Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine,
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.240]  I recommend for everyone with Omicron and the future variants.
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:43.880]  I highly recommend fluvoxamine or Prozac.
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:45.320]  It works really well for COVID.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:48.360]  It doesn't affect your brain in 99.9% of people
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.280]  who just take it for two weeks for COVID.
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:52.200]  So it's really safe, very effective.
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:52.600]  I mean...
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:53.800]  Well, I don't just believe you, though.
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:54.680]  You're a great guy.
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:55.880]  Everybody knows from literature,
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:58.760]  two, three, four weeks for serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:40:59.560]  to kick in.
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:00.600]  So you're only getting this...
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:02.840]  And so how does the serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:04.120]  how is it blocking it?
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:04.760]  Yeah, so...
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:06.360]  So it's how powerful it is.
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:07.000]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:07.640]  So it has...
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:10.760]  Serotonin is a big part of the pathology
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:11.720]  of this virus.
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:14.760]  And so what happens is that the virus causes your platelets
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:17.320]  to dump serotonin, huge amounts of serotonin
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:18.280]  into your bloodstream.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:20.360]  And this is a really inflammatory neurotransmitter
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:21.240]  when it's in your bloodstream.
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.000]  It's not supposed to be there, okay?
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.760]  Or it's not supposed to be there in that quantity.
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:25.880]  So it caught...
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:28.840]  That itself starts to trigger the cytokine storm.
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:30.840]  And so one of the effects of fluvoxamine
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:33.960]  is it stops the platelets from dumping the serotonin out.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.240]  And then it has other anti-inflammatory effects.
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:38.920]  It also may have some antiviral effects
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:40.920]  for the beginning of the infection.
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:42.280]  But the main thing is it prevents
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:43.960]  that really bad cytokine storm
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:46.600]  that really kicks in in the second week of the infection.
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:48.040]  When we come back...
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:50.680]  A lot of people have long COVID.
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:52.680]  I mean, clearly, it happened to my dad.
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:55.000]  It happened to other people I really care about in this office.
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:57.880]  And I never really felt completely the same after it.
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:41:59.240]  And a lot of doctors I've talked to said,
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:01.240]  well, you should just go on a regimen
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:05.400]  to clean it out of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:07.880]  And I've been told by other doctors other than you,
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.480]  in fact, my family doctor said,
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:12.040]  you might take two weeks of fluvoxamine.
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:13.400]  Could that be done after?
[1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:14.040]  Or how does it work?
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:15.080]  Yeah, you can take it after.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:15.400]  So we...
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:16.600]  It just cleans things out.
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:18.680]  Yeah, so basically it helps your body
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:21.080]  to stop the inflammation that the spike protein is causing.
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:22.920]  I never thought I'd be endorsing prozac.
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:23.960]  Yeah, me neither.
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.080]  Seriously, I'm so anti-psychiatric drugs,
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:30.040]  but I'm just talking about two weeks, two, three weeks.
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:31.240]  That may be a little longer for longer.
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:32.760]  Well, it shows how powerful it is, like I said.
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:33.560]  I mean, wow.
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:34.280]  It really does.
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:37.400]  And that may be one reason that it's used in depression
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:39.080]  because it has an anti-inflammatory effect.
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:41.960]  And some depression is an inflammatory illness anyway.
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:43.880]  But yeah, it's really important.
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:45.960]  And we want people to have it in case
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:47.240]  they get long COVID symptoms.
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.200]  Because some people, they had the virus and they feel fine,
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:51.880]  and then long COVID will suddenly hit them
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:53.080]  if you're not participating.
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:54.280]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:55.960]  This is just fascinating information.
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:42:59.560]  So I did it.
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:01.720]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:04.600]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be,
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:09.240]  but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:13.080]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:15.000]  to give me that energy I need to get going.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.880]  You know, besides the energy, turbo force,
[1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.720]  it is giving me the vitamins I need,
[1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:21.800]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy,
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:24.600]  and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:25.880]  for sustained energy,
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:28.600]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:32.360]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis.
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:33.720]  I have bad joints.
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:34.600]  Thanks, mom.
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:36.520]  So this is great for giving my joints
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:38.120]  the extra support they need right now,
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:41.640]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:44.440]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:46.040]  so I can get back to the training.
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:49.080]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:50.680]  good news, turbo force,
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:53.080]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:55.560]  for every day and Sorilis can keep you moving
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:57.480]  and feeling great at any age.

[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:06.840]  and energy levels,
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.080]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline,
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:15.000]  starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2% per year.
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:19.800]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy,

[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:01.880]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience,
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:04.840]  a symbol of slavery,
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:08.760]  a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:11.960]  controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.440]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:18.360]  from which we will never emerge.
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:21.320]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:24.040]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:26.680]  from the light of the sun.
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:29.960]  It is the symbol of our complete
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:33.480]  and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:41.560]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:43.480]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:45.480]  they're coming out with implantable microchips
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:47.560]  as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:50.760]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:54.120]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:56.760]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:58.360]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.360]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.520]  calling this gain of function research.
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:05.640]  Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation,
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.000]  the US government gain of function deliberative process
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.760]  and research funding pause
[1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:13.000]  on selected gain of function research
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.320]  involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses.
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:17.880]  There's nothing about SARS-like viruses
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:19.640]  and it's a research funding pause.
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:21.880]  It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:23.800]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection,
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:26.200]  there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:27.160]  and then you proceed.
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:30.040]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function,
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:31.720]  just selected gain of function.
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:34.600]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:36.280]  and qualification research.
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:38.200]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know,
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:39.160]  maybe Fauci was right.
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:40.840]  They don't quite know what they're talking about,
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:41.880]  calling it gain of function.
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:43.640]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.160]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:47.880]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:49.400]  that mimic what the viruses do.
[1:46:49.400 --> 1:46:52.520]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:53.640]  They're making something deadly
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:55.080]  that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:56.440]  Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:03.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:03.800 --> 1:47:05.240]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:13.960]  Dr. Syed Haider is our guest.
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:18.520]  He is here in studio and he's a classy guy,
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:20.040]  putting up with me with my Texas draw,
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:21.480]  but you're in his great name.
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:23.640]  But man, just the way you lay it out,
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:25.400]  my audience really liked it when you came on.
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:26.920]  And I've also talked a lot of the listeners
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:28.840]  and other people who have come to see me.
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:30.840]  And I've also talked a lot of the listeners
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:32.840]  and other people who have come to see me.
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:35.480]  And I've also talked a lot of the listeners and other people
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:38.440]  and doctors about one of the best groups out there
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:40.040]  that is actually getting to people,
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:41.400]  getting back with them and helping them.
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:43.560]  Because we are still under siege
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:44.680]  when people calling us saying,
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:46.840]  where do I get ivermectin?
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:48.360]  Where do I get hydroxychloroquine?
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.040]  Where do I get the stuff?
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:51.240]  And that's what I've told listeners is,
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:54.440]  you need to stockpile it.
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:56.440]  And there's a legal, lawful way to do that.
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:47:58.920]  You can call this guy and he knows how to get it done.
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:01.080]  So you've got the floor for the rest of the segment
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:01.640]  in the next hour.
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:02.520]  I know I've been ranting here,
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:05.240]  but how do folks protect themselves?
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:06.280]  What do you recommend they do?
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:08.040]  And what are the other big points you want to make?
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:11.320]  So I think we need to kind of,
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:14.200]  when we see what's going on in the mainstream media,
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:18.760]  from the very beginning, there was a lot of fear porn.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:22.040]  And now they're kind of slowly pivoting
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:25.320]  to starting to minimize actually the pandemic
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:26.840]  and say, okay, it's almost over.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.400]  It's done.
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:29.320]  We don't need lockdowns anymore, stuff like that.
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:30.920]  So why is that?
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:33.240]  And I'm sure Alex has probably talked about it a lot before,
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:36.680]  but I just want to mention it, in my view,
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:40.360]  the fear porn from the start was to attack Donald Trump,
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:42.920]  get Trump out of office, to destroy his presidency
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:43.800]  and get him out.
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:45.000]  That was one reason.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.880]  Another reason was for government to take more power.
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:50.280]  Lockdowns, mass mandates, vaccine mandates.
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:52.200]  I mean, this is all loss of medical freedom,
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:53.640]  loss of autonomy.
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:55.240]  Government is expanding its power.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:56.120]  And number three, obviously,
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:57.880]  big farmers in bed with government,
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:48:58.760]  they make a lot of money.
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:00.760]  So there was a lot of money to be made,
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:02.360]  and media is in bed with big pharma.
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:06.920]  But now, why are they pivoting away from all this fear porn?
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:08.120]  And that's what I'm seeing in the media.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.360]  Now, I'm seeing a lot of articles minimizing things
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:12.360]  and saying, oh, don't worry, it's almost over.
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:13.560]  Because it backfired on them.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:16.440]  Well, also midterms are coming up.
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:17.080]  I agree.
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:18.600]  Yeah, it did backfire.
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:20.520]  So the economies and shambles,
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:22.440]  they want to try to save midterms.
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:23.640]  I don't think they can at this point,
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:24.840]  but they're trying to do their best
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:26.920]  to minimize the damage they're going to have in midterms.
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:30.440]  Number two, what people may not be thinking about
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:34.360]  is I love the trucker-convoy thing here,
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:35.640]  and also in Canada.
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:36.680]  I'm a big supporter of that.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:39.720]  But it could be used to blame the breakdown of society
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:41.560]  on them instead of the lockdowns.
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:42.120]  Exactly.
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:44.120]  So what happened in Canada?
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:45.000]  That's what's going to happen.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:46.760]  That's the playbook they're going to follow here.
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:49.080]  We have martial law in Canada.
[1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:51.480]  So this great movement,
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:54.200]  but it triggered something terrible.
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:58.600]  They didn't have enough of the people behind them.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:49:59.720]  It was just some truckers.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:00.120]  That's right.
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:01.880]  And more people, which they said were going to show up,
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:03.240]  showed up peacefully than it would have,
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:04.280]  we would have had a victory.
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:05.160]  But it wasn't enough.
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:06.680]  It's like the Alamo fell,
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:09.000]  and then Sam Houston never showed up.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:09.400]  Right.
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:10.440]  So what's going to happen?
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:12.280]  Truckers descend on Washington, D.C.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:14.760]  Is martial law in the U.S. next?
[1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:16.040]  Or some version of it?
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:18.280]  They're going to call it something else,
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:19.880]  but it's going to effectively be that.
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:21.960]  Are they going to ratchet up the power grab?
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:23.320]  And what happens then?
[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:24.280]  Frozen bank accounts?
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:25.720]  Is my bank account going to be frozen?
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:26.760]  You know, are you still...
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:28.440]  By the way, I'd like to invite you sometimes
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:29.320]  to host the show.
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:29.960]  You're really smart.
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:31.400]  I'm going to interrupt him.
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:31.960]  You're dead on.
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:32.760]  I agree with everything you're saying.
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:33.240]  I'd love to.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:34.120]  Yeah.
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.320]  So you've got to prepare.
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:37.800]  Right.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:38.920]  So I know a lot of people,
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:40.280]  I've gone through your website,
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:41.560]  I've listened to you before,
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:44.440]  and a lot of your listeners want to be prepared.
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:44.920]  Right.
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:49.320]  You know, they buy food in case the society starts to break down.
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:51.000]  And this is a form of wisdom.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:51.240]  Right.
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:52.360]  Our ancestors used to do this.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:55.240]  Our ancestors used to keep like six months to a year's supply
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:50:57.000]  of food in case of famine.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.520]  And so what is this?
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:01.080]  So like, what am I telling people to do right now?
[1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:02.440]  Is to go and get your meds,
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:04.040]  put them in your medicine cabinet,
[1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:07.320]  and be prepared because it's a form of health insurance
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:09.080]  and you don't have coverage for this.
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:09.880]  Okay.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:10.440]  If you get...
[1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:12.680]  I want a new virus or a similar one pops up
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:14.040]  or this current one,
[1:51:14.040 --> 1:51:15.000]  there's going to be runs on it.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:15.960]  Again, people aren't going to be able to get it.
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:17.720]  People need to use this lull,
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:18.920]  which I agree isn't a real lull.
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:21.240]  They're just trying people to forget about it to get ready.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:23.960]  Yeah. And it's not just that it may not become available.
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:25.960]  The point is that you need to start on day one, right?
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:28.040]  We used to say start in the first five to six days.
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:29.720]  Now I'm saying start on day one.
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:30.600]  Don't wait.
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:31.960]  Don't go and get tested.
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:33.080]  You start feeling the sniffles.
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:34.680]  You start feeling the tickle in the throat.
[1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:35.720]  Throw everything at it.
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:36.840]  Throw the kitchen sink at it.
[1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:38.840]  Yeah, that's key because when they say you're positive,
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:40.760]  then they send you home to wait till you get really sick
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:41.800]  and then kill you.
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:42.040]  Yeah.
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:42.440]  Sick.
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:42.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:43.320]  Totally evil.
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:45.880]  So the pendulum, you know,
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:47.320]  I'm not trying to be a fearmonger here
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:49.160]  because it's easy to deal with, right?
[1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:50.440]  Especially if you treat it on day one.
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:51.880]  Well, the whole enemy of the people
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:53.640]  has been trying to block this information.
[1:51:53.640 --> 1:51:56.520]  And so absolutely, and it's been one good thing Trump did
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:52:00.360]  was I guess make it easier for these online systems,
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:01.400]  the great doctors like yourself,
[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:03.880]  to get things to people and democratize this
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:05.400]  and not have a monopoly.
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:07.720]  That's why it's so important to write this down
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:09.720]  and share it with others and tell others,
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:14.040]  hey, you need to go to my doctor or mygo2.com.
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:16.920]  One word, mygo2.com.
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:18.040]  You need to write that down.
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:18.840]  You need to share that.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:21.560]  And you need to get prepared ahead of time.
[1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:24.680]  And I personally am already planning to do this.
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:31.080]  I'm doing a regimen of the hydroxychloroquine of the ivermectin.
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:31.880]  I've got it in my office.
[1:52:31.880 --> 1:52:34.120]  I'm going to start on it Saturday.
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:35.640]  I'm going to take it again just because of all
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:37.480]  that I've personally seen to make sure
[1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:39.640]  any of this crap is cleared out of me.
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:42.120]  Because again, folks, this is very serious.
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:42.920]  Yeah.
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:45.160]  So along those lines, there's some people
[1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:47.080]  who feel like they're totally normal.
[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:49.720]  And when you check them, when you run an MRI scan or something,
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:51.400]  you find they have heart inflammation
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:53.000]  or there's something going on in their body.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.400]  And there's only one company out there that I work with a lot.
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:57.720]  It's incelDX, it's Bruce Patterson's group.
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:52:59.240]  They have a test to see if you still
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:00.920]  have the spike protein in your body
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:02.680]  and if it's causing the inflammation,
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:04.840]  which you see in long COVID patients.
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:06.760]  So we don't know.
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:09.480]  There's probably a lot of silent long COVID
[1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:10.920]  that's causing disease.
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:12.040]  It's causing heart attacks.
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:13.320]  It's causing strokes.
[1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:15.800]  And we don't know that that's what's causing it.
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:18.840]  Like your parents, your elderly parents had COVID
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:20.760]  and then a year later, they'd die of a stroke.
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:22.360]  Maybe they wouldn't have had that stroke
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:23.880]  if they hadn't had COVID.
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:24.920]  And I totally agree.
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:26.360]  The vaccines are worse and the vaccines
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:27.960]  can also be treated the same way.
[1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:29.800]  You can also check to see if the spike protein
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:30.840]  is still in your body.
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:32.840]  You can check to see if it's causing inflammation.
[1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:34.360]  It does the same thing that long COVID.
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:35.240]  And I got to just back you up.
[1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:37.320]  I've had so many top doctors and scientists on.
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:40.040]  I said, what do you do if you've already had to have it for your job?
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:41.880]  And they said, the way you treat COVID
[1:53:41.880 --> 1:53:44.200]  is the way you treat any potential vaccine damage.
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:46.520]  Yeah. And so if you want to be sure,
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.920]  if you want to make sure you're not wasting your time
[1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:50.280]  taking medications you don't need,
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:52.120]  you can go to covidlonghaulers.com.
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:55.640]  It's a website that's incel.dx's website.
[1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:57.800]  And you can order those tests.
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:53:59.080]  And you can see if you have the inflammation.
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:00.360]  You can see if you have the spike protein.
[1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:03.080]  But people who have a change in their health,
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:04.920]  you just assume that you have long COVID, right?
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:09.320]  If you don't have as much energy as you're used to,
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:10.440]  you can't think straight.
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:11.640]  You start forgetting words.
[1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:12.360]  You can't sleep well.
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:13.240]  You have anxiety.
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:14.440]  I mean, there's so much.
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:15.000]  That happened to my dad.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:18.600]  I mean, he literally, for at least two months,
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:20.040]  was really screwed up.
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:22.200]  And now, eight, nine months later, he's almost back.
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:24.600]  But it's been, I've got him to take ivermectin again
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:26.600]  and other things, and it's really helped him.
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.440]  And most people who have this don't realize they have it.
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:30.040]  They go to their doctor and the doctor just tells them
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:32.040]  you have anxiety or you have insomnia.
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:32.840]  They just name it.
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:36.040]  They name the problem, but they don't tell you why.
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:36.920]  Well, that's the news.
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:41.080]  Hypertension, depression, Alzheimer's is way up.
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:43.160]  Neurological disorders, heart attacks,
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:45.240]  but it's all exploded.
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:45.720]  Yeah.
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:48.680]  And the point, the really important point I want to make
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:50.520]  is that it can be a silent killer,
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:52.520]  and it can crop up later.
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:56.520]  So I've seen people who had asymptomatic COVID infections.
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:58.840]  They didn't even have symptoms end up with long COVID.
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:01.400]  And we're talking about at least 60% of people
[1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:03.560]  will have symptoms of long COVID
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:06.680]  that they see in the next three to six months.
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.480]  But then the other 40% may also have that inflammation
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:11.480]  and it just might be silent and waiting to go off.
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:12.760]  It's like a time bomb.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:14.600]  Well, the doctor answered this question for me,
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:15.640]  because that's so important.
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:18.040]  Three people that work here, I'm not going to get into more
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:22.600]  than that, they got it and were sick for two, three months,
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:25.880]  four months with low oxygen, horrible effects that long.
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:28.120]  I mean, wow, that was Delta, obviously,
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:28.920]  that was going on there.
[1:55:28.920 --> 1:55:31.400]  Well, what's, and then what's happening there?
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:33.320]  So we're seeing the same thing with Omicron.
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:34.680]  I got to tell people, you know,
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:36.760]  you're not seeing as much hospitalization and death,
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:37.960]  but I'm still seeing everything.
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:39.240]  I'm still seeing long COVID.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.760]  I'm still seeing low oxygen levels.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:42.920]  And some people, you know, maybe it's half as much
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:44.680]  as we were seeing before Delta,
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:46.840]  but, you know, twice as many people at least,
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:49.320]  maybe four, maybe 10 times as many people actually got it.
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:51.080]  So there's actually, you know, a lot of people
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:52.840]  who have serious problems with Omicron.
[1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:53.720]  And what's going on?
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:55.000]  It's the spike protein, right?
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.720]  It's the spike protein in your body causing inflammation.
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:55:58.760]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:00.200]  It's not just the replication of the virus.
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:02.360]  The virus coding itself is toxic.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.480]  So yeah, so it's the spike protein that's toxic.
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.880]  But, you know, if you catch it on day one,
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:10.120]  you can stop the replication of the virus.
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:11.720]  Zap it before it ever gets going.
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:12.520]  So many different ways.
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.040]  Hydro, you know, you can use...
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:16.040]  My parents didn't tell me for a week they were sick.
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:17.320]  They were like almost dead when I got up.
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:18.680]  And a lot of people do that, right?
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:20.520]  And so the important thing is that
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:23.640]  if you try to get these meds once you start feeling symptoms,
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:25.320]  or even once you're exposed,
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:27.320]  and think, okay, I have a few days to get the meds,
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:30.040]  sometimes it takes that long for the pharmacy to ship it in.
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:31.160]  You know, who knows?
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:33.400]  There might be, you know, something that happens
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:35.000]  that makes it so that you can start on day one.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:35.880]  I totally agree.
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:38.600]  People need this in their house
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:40.120]  more than either fire extinguisher.
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:43.320]  And I'm talking about, it's like supplemental health insurance.
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:44.120]  Okay?
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:46.200]  And it costs a couple hundred bucks
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:48.520]  to insure yourself against disaster, right?
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:50.840]  And so I think it's well worth it
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:52.600]  to spend the money to buy the ivermectin
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:53.320]  because you can't get,
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:55.320]  even if you have regular health insurance,
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:56:57.080]  the pharmacy at your local, you know,
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:58.120]  your local CVS or whatever
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:56:59.400]  is not going to give you the ivermectin.
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:00.120]  No, I totally agree.
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:03.480]  And I've had a bunch of other doctors on and promoted this.
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:05.800]  But, and they've not paid me to do it.
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:07.400]  I've done it because listeners need this.
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:08.680]  It's great, but because you've got
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:09.800]  one of the best records out there
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:10.600]  and doing a great job.
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:12.760]  I mean, I've asked you down the road
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:15.320]  to become a sponsor with us
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:16.440]  to help support the broadcast.
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:17.400]  So it's symbiotic.
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:19.560]  But I'm telling you folks, these are great people
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:21.800]  and they're getting ready to support the Info War.
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:23.400]  And they are one of the fastest,
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:24.920]  quickest people to get back with you,
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:26.280]  you know, a few hours a day,
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:28.440]  you know, day and a half max of it's the weekend
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:29.480]  and it's high quality.
[1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:31.240]  And I think it's a no brainer.
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:32.760]  Like you need a firearm
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:33.880]  and you need sportable food
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:35.320]  and you need a relationship with God.
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:38.120]  You need to have these things in your house
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.840]  for what's coming and what's going on in the society.
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:44.200]  I would go to mygo2.com right now.
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:58:14.040]  We're right back.
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:41.880]  Thank you all for your support.

[1:58:44.680 --> 1:59:14.280]  And most importantly, your immune system.

[1:59:29.640 --> 1:59:31.720]  clean, pure iodine,
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:32.680]  and what it does for your body,
[1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:34.520]  takes about two weeks to get on average,
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:37.160]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:38.600]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:39.960]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:42.200]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[1:59:42.200 --> 1:59:45.240]  you need it because it's amazing what does for your body,
[1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:46.040]  it's the good halogen,
[1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:47.080]  not the bad halogen,
[1:59:47.080 --> 2:00:14.200]  and it funds them.
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:17.080]  Syed Haider is our guest here in the studio.
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:21.640]  He is a doctor who specializes in internal medicine.
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:24.680]  He treated over 35,000 patients,
[2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:27.720]  over 4,000 with active COVID infections,
[2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:28.920]  resulting in zero deaths
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:30.520]  and only five hospitalizations.
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:31.720]  Over 30,000 were given
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:33.080]  on-going vented of ivermectin.
[2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:35.640]  Of those who took ivermectin
[2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:37.080]  to prevent catching COVID,
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:40.440]  less than 10% returned with active COVID infections.
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:41.400]  With the breaking news
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:43.640]  that the USPS and FDA are colluding
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:46.280]  to withhold overseas ivermectin shipments to Americans,
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:51.000]  Dr. Haider is working to construct
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:53.320]  and counteract the crisis
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:55.720]  by sourcing the cheapest US mail order
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:57.080]  pharmacies in each state.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:00:59.400]  This bold action will provide Americans with life
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:01.240]  saving drugs before they get sick.
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:03.880]  So they are ready for treatment on day one
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:05.480]  of symptoms which is so critical.
[2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:08.200]  My go to doc.com.
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:14.040]  One word or you can call 281-219-7367
[2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:16.920]  and I recommend that people up front
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:20.200]  stockpile this to protect themselves and their family.
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:21.560]  This is a no-brainer
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.280]  like putting your seatbelt on 281-219-7367.
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:28.280]  My go to doc.com.
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.800]  Some stations don't carry the short segment
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:30.760]  but a lot do.
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:32.280]  Doc, you've got big stuff next segment
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.200]  but what else do you want to tell folks
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:36.680]  about the virus and what's happening?
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:39.000]  Yeah, so one thing I want to tell people is how,
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.240]  you know, what is different about my website,
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:42.280]  my go to doc.com.
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:44.520]  And one other thing, you know, that you mentioned
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:47.320]  was that less than 10% of people got COVID
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:49.800]  when they were taking preventative ivermectin
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:51.000]  once or twice a week.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.640]  It's actually less than 0.1%.
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:55.640]  So it's a really vanishingly small number.
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:59.480]  And I've given out like 35,000 prescriptions
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:01.640]  actually for preventative ivermectin at this point.
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:05.320]  And so less than 35 people have come back to me
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:07.000]  saying that they got COVID.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:08.360]  And then what makes us different, right?
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:11.000]  So you can come to us, you can register for free,
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.080]  you can do free medical chat visits, right?
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:15.880]  So you can ask all your questions for free.
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:17.240]  And that's really important because a lot of people
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:19.000]  go and get their meds and then they have questions
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.760]  a couple of weeks later and then they can't get in touch
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:22.440]  with the same doctor, they can't ask their questions,
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:23.160]  they have to pay again.
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:26.440]  So we charge for, if we write you a prescription,
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:27.880]  then there's a doctor's fee.
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:29.240]  And the important thing, like you said,
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:31.320]  we're sourcing the cheapest pharmacies.
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:33.080]  Some pharmacies, we've been told,
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:35.320]  are charging like 700 to $1,000.
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:37.400]  Oh, that happened to one of our crew
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:40.600]  who also lives in North Carolina during Delta.
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:44.120]  He, his girlfriend, he's, and his children,
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.080]  they were trying to charge him $500 for an inhaler.
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:51.560]  They were trying to charge him $1,000 for ivermectin.
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:53.720]  Yeah, so we really work with patients, right?
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:57.880]  So the ivermectin, every pharmacy we use is less than $150.
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:00.760]  It's usually like 80 to $150 for 14 days
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:02.680]  of double dose ivermectin, not just five days,
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:04.280]  which a lot of these pharmacies are giving you
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:05.400]  for a thousand bucks.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:07.480]  And then the inhaler, like the inhaler
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:09.640]  can be from 250 to 500 bucks.
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:12.040]  We'll give you the ampules that you can put into a nebulizer.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:13.960]  So a nebulizer machine is like 30 bucks,
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:15.960]  you know, maybe 15, 20 bucks on Amazon.
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:17.480]  Get a nebulizer machine.
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:18.520]  If you don't want it, if you,
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.600]  if the inhaler is not covered by your insurance,
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.120]  get the ampules instead that you put
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:23.640]  into the nebulizer machine.
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:25.320]  And that's much, much cheaper to do.
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:28.280]  And so we work hand in hand with people with pharmacies.
[2:03:28.280 --> 2:03:30.760]  We'll use your local pharmacies for all the medications
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:33.240]  that we can use them for that they will fill.
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:35.560]  And then we'll, you know, use ivermectin,
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:37.320]  the mail order pharmacy for ivermectin,
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:39.000]  sometimes for hydroxychloroquine.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:40.760]  Sometimes that's actually, you know,
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:42.680]  dispensed by the local pharmacies nowadays.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:44.520]  So if you do have insurance,
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:47.000]  you can actually use your local pharmacy
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.480]  for a lot of the protocol except for the ivermectin
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:51.480]  because they just won't dispense it.
[2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:54.120]  And that's why we need to have a low cost mail order pharmacy
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:56.200]  because oftentimes the mail order pharmacies
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:58.440]  are compounding the ivermectin
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:03:59.960]  and they're not covered by insurance.
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:01.160]  So you want to minimize the cost.
[2:04:01.160 --> 2:04:02.040]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:03.720]  We're trying to help solve the problems
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:05.640]  that people are having who are coming to us.
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:07.080]  And then a big one that you've been talking about
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:08.280]  is the time, right?
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:10.520]  So like we aim for less than 24-hour turnaround.
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:12.920]  And that's if you do everything, right?
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:14.040]  You got to fill out the form.
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:16.200]  You got to, you know, answer all the questions,
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:18.600]  you know, upload ID verification, stuff like that.
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:20.680]  If you do everything that we ask,
[2:04:20.680 --> 2:04:22.760]  then we can usually get you your prescription
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:24.360]  sent out within 24 hours.
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:25.240]  But then you got to wait.
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:27.480]  You got to go pay the pharmacy, the mail order pharmacy.
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:29.160]  You got to wait for them to ship it.
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:31.080]  So you got to do this before you get sick.
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.120]  Okay. Don't wait.
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:34.200]  Dr. Syed, Hyder, stay there.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:36.360]  Because I talk fast, I know.
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:38.760]  But some stations don't care that first five minutes.
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:40.520]  Listers don't mind hearing it again
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:42.280]  because we're saving lives.
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:43.560]  This is important.
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:44.760]  This is a no-brainer.
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:45.800]  Long before I met this guy,
[2:04:45.800 --> 2:04:47.480]  I got an office full ivermectin
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:49.720]  and I've literally saved like 15 people.
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:50.360]  Okay.
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:52.120]  And BUDESIDINE, you name it.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:53.720]  We'll talk about it all when we come back.
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:05:01.400]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:03.240]  And long before I started selling
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:06.440]  high-quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[2:05:06.440 --> 2:05:10.200]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:12.040]  because it is essential.
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:15.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:16.600]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:17.640]  it doesn't matter.
[2:05:17.640 --> 2:05:20.520]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:22.200]  to so many of the threats that are out there.
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:23.800]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[2:05:23.800 --> 2:05:25.480]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:27.960]  You die in five or six days without water.
[2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:29.560]  You die in a month without food.
[2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:32.120]  Well, that's because these key minerals
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:35.640]  and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[2:05:35.640 --> 2:05:37.880]  And one of the most important for your immune system
[2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:40.120]  and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:42.360]  We have the highest quality in winter sun
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:45.720]  with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses

[2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:07.960]  Mainstream media.
[2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:10.680]  Government coverups.
[2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:13.080]  You want answers?
[2:06:13.960 --> 2:06:15.080]  Well, so does he.
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:18.200]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:19.960]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:19.960 --> 2:06:21.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:25.960]  Dr. Syed Haider is in studio with us.
[2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:28.440]  And we've got feedback from other doctors and listeners
[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:32.760]  that of the online and telephone pharmacies and doctors,
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:34.680]  they've been one of the best groups out there
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:37.560]  getting back with people quick and putting them in contact
[2:06:37.560 --> 2:06:41.240]  with the supply chain that's got reasonable prices
[2:06:41.240 --> 2:06:43.240]  and ready to deliver it to people.
[2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:45.560]  So I'm sitting there a few weeks ago and I'm thinking,
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:47.560]  you know, my phones are ringing off the hook
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:51.000]  with people who are wanting to be able
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:54.200]  to preventively get ivermectin, hydroxychloric,
[2:06:54.200 --> 2:06:57.000]  and so many other things that the system's trying to block.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.840]  The studies now are showing are amazing.
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:00.680]  And so I'm like, who will I talk to?
[2:07:00.680 --> 2:07:02.040]  What's the best feedback we've gotten
[2:07:02.040 --> 2:07:03.240]  of a lot of these great groups
[2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:05.800]  and organizations we've had on to do this?
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:08.280]  And so, yeah, we're looking at these folks to be a sponsor
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:09.960]  because we want to bring you good folks.
[2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:12.920]  But really, just as a public service announcement here,
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:14.280]  we're making this announcement
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:16.200]  because you need to understand
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:20.440]  that I had crew that did call other online pharmacies
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:22.360]  who were they would try to charge them $500
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:25.000]  for the Bidesedon inhaler that should cost $50.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:28.760]  That these places would try to charge $1,000
[2:07:28.760 --> 2:07:31.320]  for ivermectin that should have cost $50 to $100.
[2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:33.400]  Okay, and we understand the supply chain's broke down
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:35.880]  and it cost more to get it, so some markup should be there.
[2:07:35.880 --> 2:07:38.040]  They're putting you in contact with folks that don't do that.
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:40.120]  I couldn't imagine, because I'll sell stuff all day
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.240]  that's good for people.
[2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:42.280]  You know, if I'm in the Sahara Desert,
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:44.120]  I'll be selling ice water or, you know,
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:46.760]  a parasol so you don't burn up an umbrella.
[2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:49.080]  But the point is, I'm happy to sell you stuff.
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:51.000]  I'm not going to sell you a boat with holes in it, though.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:54.280]  I don't want the bad mojo back, you know, re-put you so.
[2:07:54.280 --> 2:07:57.720]  And so I just cannot imagine the profiteering we've seen,
[2:07:57.720 --> 2:07:59.960]  not just by Big Pharma and the Rindesivir
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:01.720]  that eats your kidneys, as you know,
[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:03.480]  and blocking the good treatments
[2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:04.440]  with all the studies coming out,
[2:08:04.440 --> 2:08:07.080]  proving they're vindicated you and others,
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:12.760]  but trying to keep people from access to legal, known, safe,
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.600]  super drugs like Ivermectin.
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:17.720]  So spend a few minutes telling folks how they contact you,
[2:08:17.720 --> 2:08:20.520]  what they should do, and how important this is, Doc.
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:22.920]  Yeah, so there's a couple of really important points
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:23.880]  to make today.
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:27.160]  And number one is the pandemic's not over, okay?
[2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:29.480]  The pandemic is going to continue to have, you know,
[2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:32.120]  bigger and bigger waves, probably, actually.
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:34.680]  And this is because we started vaccinating
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:37.160]  in the middle of a pandemic with leaky vaccines
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:39.560]  that are driving the viral evolution, okay?
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:41.560]  They're creating worse and worse variants
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:43.160]  that are more virulent, okay?
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:44.760]  And so what's happening on the ground
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:46.520]  with me and other doctors who are doing this,
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  and I've been doing this for 15 months now,
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:49.720]  that's all I do, okay?
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:51.720]  So I'm an expert on COVID treatment.
[2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:54.120]  What we're seeing on the ground is that every variant
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:55.720]  gets harder and harder to treat,
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:08:57.320]  and it's causing long COVID.
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:08:58.920]  You know, no one's talking about long COVID.
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:00.520]  You got to worry about long COVID.
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:03.080]  We're seeing it in children, we're seeing it in the middle-aged,
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:04.520]  we're seeing it in the elderly.
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.760]  Every age group is getting long COVID.
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.720]  Adults are getting it at like 40 to 60%, okay?
[2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:13.960]  Then after an infection, they'll have symptoms for months.
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:16.680]  It can be life-changing, very difficult to deal with.
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:18.680]  Children are getting it about half the rate,
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:21.160]  but they're still getting it, which is shocking, okay?
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:25.160]  I've had 13-year-olds, 16-year-olds unable to go to school,
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:27.080]  unable to do their homework, okay?
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:29.280]  Unable to go back to soccer practice, right?
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:31.320]  So this is a serious illness,
[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:35.280]  and even if you don't have symptoms, it can strike you later.
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:37.040]  It's like a ticking time bomb, okay?
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:38.400]  If you get re-exposed to COVID,
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:40.200]  if you get exposed to somebody who's vaccinated,
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:43.120]  that can be enough to push you over the edge into long COVID,
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:46.120]  or even a vaccine injury, they're very similar situations.
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:49.360]  Now, so the next thing is, okay, this is a problem,
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:52.120]  it's an ongoing problem, it's not over yet.
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:53.200]  What do you do about it, right?
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:55.760]  You got to get your meds into your medicine cabinet
[2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:57.720]  before you have the symptoms, okay?
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:09:59.640]  And the reason is there's a handful of doctors like me
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:02.200]  who are doing this, there's not enough to go around
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:04.880]  to talk to every single patient the day they get symptoms,
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:05.840]  all right?
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:09.080]  And the ivermectin you got to mail in for a mail-order pharmacy,
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:09.920]  okay?
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:11.800]  We found the cheapest ones,
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:13.760]  and the reason that I'm talking about the price,
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:15.400]  you know, a lot of people have health insurance,
[2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:17.680]  but it doesn't cover ivermectin, okay?
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:18.960]  You can't get it from your local pharmacy,
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.000]  you got to get it from a mail-order compounding pharmacy,
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:22.120]  and the insurance doesn't cover it,
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:23.880]  so you got to look for the cheapest source.
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:26.120]  And again, you know, some pharmacies are charging
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:28.040]  like a thousand bucks for ivermectin, our pharmacies,
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:29.440]  we found them, we did a lot of legwork
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:31.760]  to look for these places, $150 or less,
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.760]  $80 to $150, most of them.
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:37.120]  And then the Bidesneid, hydroxychloroquine, fluvoxamine,
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:38.320]  you know, there's a lot of medications
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:39.560]  you need to have on hand,
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:41.160]  you need to take them all on day one.
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:43.640]  There's no way you're going to get the ivermectin on day one
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:46.440]  if you start looking for the pharmacy and the doctor
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.800]  and getting the prescription the day that you get sick.
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:51.120]  So it's like you need band-aids in your medicine cabinet
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:52.160]  before you cut your finger.
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:53.280]  Yeah, and what this is,
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:55.520]  it's like supplemental health insurance, okay?
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:57.920]  Because your health insurance does not cover
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:00.560]  real treatment for COVID-19, all right?
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:02.120]  No health insurance in this country
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:05.360]  actually gets you what you need to get rid of COVID-19,
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:07.600]  long COVID or a vaccine injury, okay?
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:08.680]  All these things can be treated
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:10.840]  with basically the same medications.
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:13.200]  And so spending a couple of hundred bucks
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:15.680]  to get these medications into your medicine cabinet,
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:17.520]  you know, pay the doctor's fee,
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:20.120]  this is a tiny price to pay
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:22.240]  to prevent what can become a disaster.
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:24.400]  It's a no-brainer, and here's the problem.
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:28.120]  I had like 30 boxes of ivermectin and Bidesneid
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:29.520]  and hydroxychloroquine,
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.360]  I already gave it away to all these people
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:33.960]  and I'm basically down to a couple of boxes for me.
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:35.800]  And I'm intended to now take a regimen
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:38.400]  just to make sure that I've been flushed out.
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:40.800]  Because I think these are totally safe known things.
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:44.160]  Why shouldn't people take it, not just as a preventative,
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:46.080]  how often could you take it as preventative
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:48.120]  or how often to make sure
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:50.720]  you've already had COVID that you flushed it out?
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:53.720]  Yeah, and so you can take this basically indefinitely, right?
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:55.560]  You can take it to prevent catching COVID
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:58.480]  and in my experience, like less than one in a thousand people
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:00.960]  who take it twice a week will catch COVID.
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:04.480]  It's extremely well-tolerated, twice a week, okay?
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:06.760]  It's safer than aspirin, safer than Tylenol.
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:09.160]  It's one of the safest drugs on the planet.
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:12.280]  It's extremely benign and extremely powerful against COVID.
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:14.160]  You can take it, when you get COVID,
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:16.000]  if you start on day one with ivermectin
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:17.800]  and the other medications in the protocol
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:19.080]  and the comprehensive protocol,
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.880]  you'll be over with the infection
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:22.640]  and you won't get long COVID, right?
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:25.160]  You'll be done with it in a couple of days maybe, maybe less.
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:27.640]  So all these people going on getting booster shots and stuff,
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:29.560]  trying to protect themselves,
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.120]  no wonder Big Pharma doesn't want
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:33.680]  a cheap, known, documented super drug.
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:35.320]  And what do you make of all the studies, Doctor,
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:36.880]  that have now come out confirming
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:38.200]  what everybody saw anecdotally?
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:41.080]  And there's so many now, major US studies,
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:43.400]  German studies, Japanese studies,
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:45.680]  that ivermectin is just a miracle drug.
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.680]  So we have hundreds of studies at this point around the world
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:51.480]  and meta-analyses of studies.
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:54.320]  We have very high-level evidence showing that ivermectin works
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:55.200]  and it works great.
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:57.120]  It's a tremendous drug.
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:59.200]  Now they're trying to manufacture studies, right?
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:00.600]  There was just one in JAMA
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:03.080]  and they're trying to say that ivermectin doesn't work
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:04.640]  and they're creating these studies
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:05.840]  where they start treatment late,
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:08.240]  they mix in early treatment with late treatment
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:10.040]  and then they try to show that ivermectin
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:11.040]  doesn't have an effect.
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:13.440]  The JAMA study, if you look into the details of it
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:14.800]  and you look at the data,
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:16.120]  it actually shows ivermectin works
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:17.720]  way better than the vaccines, okay?
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:19.560]  And it nearly reached clinical significance
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:21.640]  and it would have if they had started treatment
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:22.560]  in the first few days
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:25.400]  instead of taking patients within the first seven days.
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:28.840]  So that just shows there are thousands of studies
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:29.680]  showing ivermectin works
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:32.760]  and then there's actually over 1,000 studies at this point
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.800]  showing how dangerous the vaccines are, right?
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:36.080]  I just learned this, I mean,
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:38.120]  you go and do a search on vaccine injuries,
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:39.320]  vaccine side effects,
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:42.160]  over 1,000 studies that you can find in PubMed
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:43.000]  showing the vaccine.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.360]  And they've had to put inserts now finally saying
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:47.840]  it causes massive increases in blood clots,
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:49.360]  heart attacks, and microcarditis.
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:50.600]  They've had to admit that.
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:54.760]  Yeah, and that's just like the tip of the iceberg, okay?
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:57.000]  Vaccine injuries are probably the worst crime
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:57.960]  against humanity.
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:13:59.760]  And what's gonna happen later
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:02.040]  probably with further variants of this virus
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:05.200]  is that ADEs are gonna become a bigger and bigger problem.
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:07.120]  There's gonna become negative vaccine efficacy.
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:07.960]  Okay, you take the vaccine.
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:09.440]  Explain what ADE is for the...
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:12.880]  Yeah, so antibody dependent enhancement of the disease.
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:14.880]  This is something that we knew about, you know,
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:16.400]  for decades when we tried to create
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.680]  coronavirus vaccines in animals,
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:22.040]  you gave them the shots and they died at much higher rates
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:24.040]  because the antibodies that they created
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:25.480]  actually worsened the infection
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:26.880]  when they got the infection.
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:28.640]  And this is what we've been worried about.
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:30.200]  Maybe this is already happening actually.
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:32.160]  Maybe this explains why, you know,
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:34.160]  life insurance companies are showing that, you know,
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:36.840]  there's a 40% rise in deaths in 2021.
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:37.680]  What about making,
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:39.760]  because I've always heard epidemiologists and virologists
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:42.880]  say don't give people a vaccine during a pandemic
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:44.880]  because it'll cause super mutants
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:47.800]  because of the survival of the fittest.
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:49.920]  And then they say that Delta came out of India
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:51.120]  because of their vaccine program.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:53.080]  I don't know if that's true, but...
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:55.040]  I mean, in general, is that an issue?
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:14:56.680]  In general, it's a huge issue.
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:58.800]  And none of the vaccinologists are talking about this.
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:00.880]  There's only one that I know of, Gurt Vandenbosch.
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:02.840]  You know, he's worked at the WHO, I think.
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:04.920]  He's worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:07.120]  I mean, this is a top vaccinologist, okay?
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:08.640]  This is not just a nobody.
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:10.360]  And he's been warning since the beginning
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:12.880]  that vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic with,
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:14.560]  you know, it's important, it's a leaky vaccine.
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:16.200]  It's not actually a vaccine at all, right?
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:17.640]  It doesn't stop the spread.
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:19.880]  It doesn't stop the infection, right, from happening.
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:21.440]  It doesn't stop you from spreading it.
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:22.920]  It doesn't stop you from catching it.
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:24.360]  So, you know, it's not really a vaccine.
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:25.800]  It's more of a therapy, you know,
[2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:27.920]  if at all, if anything.
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:29.760]  And so, yes, he's been saying since the start
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:31.040]  that we're creating super variants
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:32.840]  and this may be why we have Delta
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:34.320]  and why we now have Omicron
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:35.600]  and why we're gonna have another one.
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:37.960]  You know, why we have Stealth Omicron also,
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:39.920]  you know, maybe picking up in the U.S. right now.
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:41.880]  Oh yeah, this thing's just getting started.
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:44.440]  People need to get prepared now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:47.800]  Need to go to mygototoc.com and get ready.
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:50.360]  Mygototoc.com, take action now.
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:51.600]  We'll be right back with a final segment
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:53.200]  with our guest and a special announcement.
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:58.200]  The Globalist Social Engineers always intended
[2:16:01.240 --> 2:16:05.680]  to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:08.840]  until the populations rebelled.
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:11.240]  They would then use that as the pretext
[2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:14.440]  for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:17.800]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:20.040]  But because of so many scientists and engineers
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:22.560]  and researchers and others coming public
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:25.600]  and whistleblowers, now their whole project
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:28.520]  is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:32.680]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:36.040]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:38.160]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:40.280]  are not gonna give up on their takeover.
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:42.920]  Like Canada, where they've now declared
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:46.360]  a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:48.440]  and other areas of the world are following suit
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:49.480]  like Australia.
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:51.400]  So pray for these folks big time.
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:53.280]  It's a very serious situation.
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:55.360]  And stay tuned into infowars.com
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:16:57.840]  because truth is absolutely paramount.
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:00.440]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:02.640]  is still unaware that there's a war
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:06.600]  between free individuals and nation states on one side
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:08.200]  and the globalist on the other
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:11.720]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:13.240]  From the United States to Brazil
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:15.640]  and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK,
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:18.080]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:19.520]  fascist world government.
[2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:22.040]  That's why they launched their great reset
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:24.320]  and their program after collapsing us
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:25.760]  of Build Back Better.
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:31.040]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:32.640]  of the world economy.
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:34.040]  Because they couldn't take our guns
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:35.400]  and because we wouldn't bow.
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:37.880]  Because the left, which is the ideology
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:40.560]  of this world government system couldn't win.
[2:17:40.560 --> 2:17:43.560]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:45.720]  Now we know two years ago,
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:47.920]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:49.880]  It's that simple, they can't beat us because of our
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:51.560]  free speech and our guns.
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:54.320]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:55.720]  and you know the rest is history.
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.480]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:02.040]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:04.520]  with everything that's going on both at home
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.640]  and the world at large.
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:08.880]  If you are having trouble getting to that deep sleep
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:10.640]  we could all use more of,
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.360]  our new sleep support formula down and out
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:15.160]  is just the thing.
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:17.880]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:19.520]  that is specifically designed
[2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:22.240]  to help you get the shut eye you deserve.
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:25.840]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:26.920]  with down and out,
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:29.360]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:32.640]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:35.680]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula
[2:18:35.680 --> 2:18:37.440]  before you even take it.
[2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:39.800]  One of the other sleep support herbs included
[2:18:39.800 --> 2:18:41.400]  is the passion flower,
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:44.160]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:48.040]  like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:49.440]  Be sure to take this product
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:51.640]  when you are completely ready for sleep

[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.920]  and we know everything about you.
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  We process your insurance claims
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  and credit card charges.
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:36.920]  We control every part of your life.
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:38.920]  We are the middle children of history
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.920]  raised by television to believe
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:43.920]  that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:45.920]  But we won't.
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:47.920]  And we're just learning this fact.
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:50.920]  So don't fuck with us.
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:57.920]  Support independentmedia at infoorstore.com.
[2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:00.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:02.920]  of the New World Order,
[2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:32.920]  Dr. Syed Haider is our guest in studio.
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:34.920]  He came here from Puerto Rico
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:36.920]  and we really appreciate him
[2:20:36.920 --> 2:20:38.920]  and all the work he does at mygotodoc.com.
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:40.920]  I told him he doesn't need to fly all the way here to do this.
[2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:42.920]  We really appreciate him.
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:44.920]  He's going to come on Harris and Smith's show
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:46.920]  next week in the morning.
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:48.920]  He'll be on the war room next week as well.
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:50.920]  But I got to tell you,
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:52.920]  we've had a bunch of other great online doctors
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  and telemedicine people.
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:56.920]  But with the best reviews we've gotten
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:20:58.920]  is from mygotodoc.com.
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:00.920]  But I would have him on anyway just because
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  I want to promote people getting prepared
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:04.920]  and getting ready in mygotodoc.com
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  or 281-219-7367.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:10.920]  He's riding a shotgun with us.
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  He'll have some final comments in a moment.
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:14.920]  But I appreciate him on short notice popping in.
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:16.920]  And I want to invite him back on the show tomorrow
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:18.920]  for 30 minutes to an hour.
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:21.920]  Royce White is a former professional NBA player.
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  He's now a professional mixed martial artist.
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:27.920]  He's also the author and political activist.
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:29.920]  And I think he's a great leader and just super smart.
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:32.920]  He's been outspoken on issues such as mental health
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  and the Uyghurs and the CCP,
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:35.920]  cryptocurrency, the Federal Reserve,
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  gain of function and others.
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.920]  So he helped really years ago start
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:40.920]  the awareness of the Uyghurs and got punished for that.
[2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:41.920]  That's the kind of leader we need.
[2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:42.920]  Somebody that doesn't back down
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:44.920]  and stands up for everybody's rights,
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.920]  whether they be an agnostic, a Muslim, a Christian,
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:47.920]  it doesn't matter.
[2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:49.920]  RoyceWhite.substack.com
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  he has got a big announcement for us.
[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:55.920]  And this is very exciting up there
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:21:57.920]  in this hometown of Twin Cities.
[2:21:57.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  So thank you, sir, for popping in.
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:01.920]  Thanks for having me again, Alice.
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:03.920]  I appreciate it.
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:05.920]  Lay it on us. We're excited.
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:07.920]  Yeah, well, I'm running for Congress here
[2:22:07.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  in Minnesota's fifth congressional district,
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  which is now in the,
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:15.920]  that seat is in the possession of Ilhan Omar.
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:19.920]  And yeah, it's a decision that I didn't come by easy.
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:23.920]  I've been encouraged by many of the people around me
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:25.920]  to step into the political arena
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:26.920]  and take this chance in a district
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:28.920]  that's been democratic for a long time.
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:30.920]  But the wind is at our back.
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:31.920]  I think people are starting to wake up
[2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:34.920]  to what's going on in this country.
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  That we've been captured and held captive
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:42.920]  by our elites who have a very global agenda,
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:44.920]  a very blatant global agenda.
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  I notice you point out that the big issue of our time,
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:51.920]  people waking up to corporate governmental capture
[2:22:51.920 --> 2:22:53.920]  and that the real enemy isn't the Russians
[2:22:53.920 --> 2:22:54.920]  or the Chinese or anybody,
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  it's corporations taking the world over.
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:22:58.920]  I know you've been a big critic of the Great Reset.
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:00.920]  And I think you've got a real chance
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:01.920]  of meeting Ilhan Omar.
[2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  How do people support you?
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:05.920]  This is a huge announcement.
[2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:07.920]  They can support me at RoyceWhite.us.
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:09.920]  That's our campaign website.
[2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:11.920]  There you can join, you can volunteer,
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:13.920]  you can donate money.
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:15.920]  And listen, we're in a crisis in this country.
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:17.920]  It's a crisis of leadership.
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:22.920]  But we are in a spiritual war, an economic war,
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:23.920]  a political war.
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:26.920]  And most importantly, we're in a cultural war
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  for the future of this country.
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:31.920]  And Minnesota is near and dear to my heart.
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:32.920]  It's where I was born and raised.
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:34.920]  I have a deep affection for Minnesota
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:36.920]  and Minneapolis and the Twin Cities.
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:39.920]  And look, I'm in for the fight.
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:40.920]  I'm in for the fight.
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:43.920]  We have to push back on the momentum of globalism, right?
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:45.920]  Globalism, the arrogance of globalism
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:48.920]  is undermining the value of country
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  and the grandiosity of our federal government
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:52.920]  is undermining the meaning of community.
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:55.920]  And these globalists, they're behind Ilhan Omar.
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:23:58.920]  No matter how radical she talks about socialism
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:01.920]  and all of these different ideas,
[2:24:01.920 --> 2:24:03.920]  the bottom line is that corporate elites,
[2:24:03.920 --> 2:24:06.920]  the corporatocracy runs the Democratic Party.
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:09.920]  And they run a serious element of the GOP as well.
[2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:11.920]  And I'm here to kind of be a lightning rod
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  and fight against both hands of the hydro.
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:17.920]  Man, I would love to get you into Congress,
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  but you can't lose, even if you lose,
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:22.920]  because imagine the debates.
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  Imagine you up there.
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:27.920]  She's going to be really scared of you.
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  Obviously, you're not a coward.
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:29.920]  You've got a lot of courage,
[2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:31.920]  but I hope you get some bodyguards,
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:35.920]  because she is gangstered up.
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  Yeah, well, I mean, look, the trajectory is clear, right?
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:41.920]  The alliance is clear.
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:43.920]  The trajectory is they want to go
[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  to one government, one currency society, right?
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.920]  Where the population is small enough for them
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  to have any real threat of a populist revolt.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  And whether it's George Soros or Xi Jinping or Klaus Schwab
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  or Mark Zuckerberg or any of these global elitists,
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  they are fully committed to puppets like Ilhan Omar
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  and making sure that people like me
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:10.920]  never have a real platform.
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:12.920]  So I'm very thankful that you've allowed me to come on the show
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.920]  and your audience has been supportive of me already.
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  We had a great first two interviews,
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  and I'm happy to be back here.
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:19.920]  Yes, sir.
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:21.920]  And I'm going to, I am, I told Joe to try to get you on the show.
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:23.920]  He's looking at that.
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:25.920]  So we really appreciate you.
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:27.920]  Join me again tomorrow or the next day,
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:28.920]  whatever you can.
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:29.920]  Roy Swight.
[2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:30.920]  Roy Swight.
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:31.920]  Substack.com.
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:33.920]  And how do people find your congressional site
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:35.920]  and how the listeners share that site?
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:37.920]  Because you're a real contender.
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  You got the gravitas, the background, everything.
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:43.920]  How do people visit the site and get involved?
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:45.920]  Royswight.us.
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:48.920]  Again, that's Royswight.us.
[2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:51.920]  And we're doing smash mouth populism.
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:52.920]  America first.
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:55.920]  We're going to go and decouple ourselves from the dependency on China.
[2:25:55.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  We're going to bring our manufacturing home.
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:25:59.920]  We're going to address the immigration issue.
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:01.920]  And we're going to address the education issue,
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:04.920]  how this corporatocracy has sort of tried to make people dumb
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  and literate, philosophically bankrupt in order to preserve power,
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  to preserve the status quo,
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:14.920]  and keep the wealth constraint in the top 1% of 1%.
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  But we're going to do it in a good Christian way,
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:18.920]  and we're going to do it in an American way,
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:20.920]  a real American way.
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:21.920]  Beautiful.
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:22.920]  All right, Roy.
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:23.920]  Join us as soon as you can.
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:25.920]  Royswight.us.
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:26.920]  Wow.
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:28.920]  Thank you, sir.
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:31.920]  Running against Ilhan Omar in Minnesota.
[2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  Beautiful.
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:33.920]  All right.
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  In closing, Doc, we really appreciate you joining us.
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  There's so many bad things happen in the world,
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:40.920]  but the good news is there's still enough freedom
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:43.920]  for good doctors and good researchers to get the truth out.
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:45.920]  And I don't think we can put a number on it,
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  but do we have any idea how many people got saved
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:51.920]  because of therapeutics despite the system trying to block it?
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:53.920]  I mean, just in my practice, you know,
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:54.920]  there's 5,000 people,
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:57.920]  300 of them, or 5,000 people who were treated,
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:00.920]  and 300 of them would have ended up in the hospital.
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:02.920]  At least five of them would have died, right?
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:03.920]  And that's just my practice.
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:05.920]  You go around the world, you know,
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:07.920]  and a lot of doctors doing this in India,
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:10.920]  you know, all over the place with these off-label drugs
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:11.920]  in the United States as well.
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:13.920]  The Indian news says they eradicated it with it.
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:15.920]  In Urdu Pradesh, they eradicated it, and how did they do that?
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:17.920]  That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:18.920]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:20.920]  You know, they went door-to-door.
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  They gave everyone in the largest state of India
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:25.920]  a box of ivermectin, you know, vitamin C, vitamin D.
[2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  That's right.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:27.920]  It was from India.
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:28.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:30.920]  They went everywhere, you know, and they tried to cover this up.
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:32.920]  They tried to hide the fact that they gave everyone ivermectin.
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  They wouldn't let out this information.
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:35.920]  It was a secret.
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:38.920]  Somebody, you know, online went and talked to somebody in India
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:40.920]  and was like, what was in that packet that you got?
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:41.920]  And they found out, yes, it was ivermectin.
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:43.920]  We bought cases of this from India
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:44.920]  to give out to friends and family.
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:45.920]  Works great.
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:46.920]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:48.920]  The problem with this is, like you were saying before,
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:50.920]  the USPS is sometimes stopping the shipments.
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:52.920]  It takes two to three weeks to get there.
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:53.920]  Oh, yeah.
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:54.920]  No, we had to order three times until we got it.
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:55.920]  Yeah.
[2:27:55.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  And then we only got part of it.
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:58.920]  And sometimes it's actually more expensive
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:00.920]  than just even paying my doctor's fee and paying my overseas.
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:02.920]  Oh, no, we paid more than we get from you.
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:03.920]  Exactly.
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  And so the cost of the Indian stuff is actually higher.
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:07.920]  It takes a lot longer to get here.
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:09.920]  Sometimes it's seized at the border.
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:11.920]  But my point is they eradicated it.
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:12.920]  But they did.
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:13.920]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:28:13.920 --> 2:28:14.920]  One state at 200 million people.
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:15.920]  Yeah, it would have perished.
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:17.920]  And so that's the way to do it.
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:18.920]  You can't wait until these people get sick
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:20.920]  and then try to have them connect to a doctor
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:21.920]  who doesn't know how to do the protocols.
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:23.920]  No, the Indians that arrived just hand it out.
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:24.920]  Exactly.
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:25.920]  That's what we're trying to do.
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:26.920]  We're trying to one-up them, actually, right?
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:29.920]  So we're also going to keep you in contact online with me
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  and my team.
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:31.920]  So if you have questions in the future,
[2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:33.920]  you can ask them as much as you want, right?
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:34.920]  But you should get the directions.
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:36.920]  You should get the medicine in your medicine cabinet,
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:37.920]  and you should be ready to go.
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:39.920]  And like Roy Swight was saying, you know,
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  they're coming after our guns.
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:42.920]  They're coming after our meds, right?
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:44.920]  They don't want us to have stuff to be able to treat ourselves.
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:45.920]  Our communications, everything.
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:46.920]  Yes.
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:51.920]  Dr. Heider, mygo2doc.com, or 281-219-737.
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:52.920]  Come visit us again.
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:53.920]  We love you.
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:28:54.920]  Absolutely.
[2:28:54.920 --> 2:28:56.920]  Doing a great job saving a lot of people.
[2:28:56.920 --> 2:28:59.920]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:03.920]  And long before I started selling high-quality vitamin D3
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:08.920]  eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:10.920]  because it is essential.
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:13.920]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:15.920]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:18.920]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:20.920]  to so many of the threats that are out there.
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:21.920]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:23.920]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:26.920]  You die in five or six days without water.
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:27.920]  You die in a month without food.
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:31.920]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:33.920]  and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:36.920]  And one of the most important for your immune system
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:38.920]  and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.920]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:43.920]  that boosts all your body's offenses,
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:48.920]  available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:48.920 --> 2:29:52.920]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:53.920]  This is the best quality out there,
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:56.920]  and it funds the info war 50% off.
[2:29:56.920 --> 2:29:58.920]  With the world awakening, I think it was important
[2:29:58.920 --> 2:30:00.920]  that we were right to prevent them right now.
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:01.920]  Take advantage of this moment,
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:03.920]  and I have always had an idea that something everybody can do,
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:05.920]  but every listener can do.
[2:30:05.920 --> 2:30:07.920]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, you know,
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:09.920]  hang the banners over highways.
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:11.920]  Imagine a giant bean or a piece of a layup made up.
[2:30:11.920 --> 2:30:14.920]  It says Alex Jones is right, infowarstore.com.
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:15.920]  We stand with the truckers.
[2:30:15.920 --> 2:30:17.920]  We'll rest out or whatever.
[2:30:17.920 --> 2:30:19.920]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this.
[2:30:19.920 --> 2:30:20.920]  Yes.
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:22.920]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:24.920]  to write something on the bathroom wall
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  or to put a sticker on your car,
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:28.920]  or banner hangs over highways,
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:30.920]  and it will be a chain reaction.
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:32.920]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:33.920]  I have a few ideas.
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:36.920]  First of all, Alex Jones is right, infowarstore.com.
[2:30:36.920 --> 2:30:38.920]  Rest out, rest out, swap.
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:39.920]  The vaccine is poison.
[2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:40.920]  There's tons of things.
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:41.920]  I said, keep it short.
[2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:42.920]  Keep it concise.
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:43.920]  Don't agree.
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:44.920]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[2:30:44.920 --> 2:30:46.920]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:47.920]  Beautiful.
[2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:48.920]  Yeah, there's ways that we can all be involved
[2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:49.920]  and we can all be effective.
[2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:51.920]  That's what I'm calling about.
[2:30:51.920 --> 2:30:52.920]  God bless you, Chris.
[2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:54.920]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:30:55.920]  calling us today.
[2:30:55.920 --> 2:30:56.920]  Thank you so much.
[2:30:56.920 --> 2:30:58.920]  Anything of real quality,
[2:30:58.920 --> 2:31:00.920]  anything of lasting durability,
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:02.920]  anything that's really satisfying,
[2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:04.920]  empowering, and fulfilling,
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:06.920]  it's going to be hard to attain.
[2:31:06.920 --> 2:31:08.920]  And when it comes to information,
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:10.920]  boy, is that true today.
[2:31:10.920 --> 2:31:12.920]  We see the entire global corrupt
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:14.920]  interhuman depopulation,
[2:31:14.920 --> 2:31:16.920]  great recent combine
[2:31:16.920 --> 2:31:18.920]  trying to collapse our society
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:20.920]  to build on its ashes.
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:23.920]  Their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[2:31:23.920 --> 2:31:25.920]  suppressing the voices
[2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:27.920]  of good people all around the world
[2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:30.920]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:31:30.920 --> 2:31:32.920]  that are exposing all their lies,
[2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:34.920]  their COVID hysteria,
[2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:36.920]  their world's going to end in 2030,
[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:39.920]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:41.920]  And none of it can succeed.
[2:31:41.920 --> 2:31:43.920]  None of it can actually be carried out
[2:31:43.920 --> 2:31:46.920]  unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[2:31:46.920 --> 2:31:48.920]  And that's why truth comes
[2:31:48.920 --> 2:31:50.920]  with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:52.920]  And that's why it's hard to share
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:54.920]  M4 Wars links and band up video links.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:19.920]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:26.920]  Thank you so much for watching.
[2:32:54.920 --> 2:32:56.920]  I'm Alex Jones, special.
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:26.920]  He's been a big national TV host,
[2:33:26.920 --> 2:33:28.920]  syndicated radio host, best-selling author.
[2:33:28.920 --> 2:33:30.920]  And he's also been taking Trump
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:32.920]  the loving way to the woodshed.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:34.920]  I can tell you, behind the scenes,
[2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:36.920]  I'm going to leave it at that,
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:38.920]  Trump actually listened to him.
[2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:40.920]  I've learned directly from folks at Mar-a-Lago
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:42.920]  that Trump talked to him
[2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:44.920]  and another congresswoman who was here recently.
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:46.920]  I'm not supposed to tell you the details,
[2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:48.920]  but he finally is stopping the pushing of it,
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:50.920]  at least for now.
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:52.920]  He means well, but just amazing information.
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:54.920]  He's got his new book out as well
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:56.920]  about how to have real activism
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:33:58.920]  and actually take the country back.
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:00.920]  But Wayne, great to have you here with us.
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:02.920]  I know you're going to be hosting a lot of stuff
[2:34:02.920 --> 2:34:04.920]  and covering things in the fourth hour today.
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:06.920]  But big picture, what do you make of Russia?
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:08.920]  I know you've been on top of that.
[2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:10.920]  What do you make of Trudeau
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:12.920]  and the martial law and honking of horn
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:14.920]  means hall Hitler now?
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:16.920]  I mean, it's just over the left.
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:18.920]  Every time you think they can't go more insane,
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:20.920]  in spinal tap, they go,
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:22.920]  10, well, it's 11.
[2:34:22.920 --> 2:34:24.920]  Well, they go to 12, 13, 20, a thousand.
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:26.920]  They just keep turning it up.
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:28.920]  Where does this go?
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:30.920]  It's a scary thing, Alex,
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:32.920]  and nobody knows where it's going to end.
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:34.920]  They don't know where it's going to end.
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:36.920]  We don't know. They don't know.
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:38.920]  The question is, can we stop it?
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:40.920]  I didn't know where the Canadian convoy would go.
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:42.920]  I had no idea they'd actually blockade Ottawa.
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:44.920]  I had no idea it would last for three weeks.
[2:34:44.920 --> 2:34:46.920]  I had no idea the incredible success
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:48.920]  that they have with that blockade,
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:50.920]  down so many COVID regulations
[2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:52.920]  in every province in Canada.
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:54.920]  And forced dictator Trudeau out the open.
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:56.920]  The polls are out.
[2:34:56.920 --> 2:34:58.920]  His party has destroyed themselves.
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:00.920]  Right. Well, so America's party
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:02.920]  has destroyed itself, the Democrat party as well.
[2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:04.920]  But the question is,
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:06.920]  do you win if elections are rigged?
[2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:08.920]  Does it matter?
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:10.920]  Because they know now
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:12.920]  that if you fix the election,
[2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:14.920]  you could have 0%.
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:16.920]  The people could hate you.
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:18.920]  There are millions of mail-in ballots,
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:20.920]  and they all come in
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:22.920]  in the hours after
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:24.920]  you've already seen what the totals are.
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:26.920]  Like Pennsylvania,
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:28.920]  not to switch to voter fraud,
[2:35:28.920 --> 2:35:30.920]  but I have to make this point.
[2:35:30.920 --> 2:35:32.920]  That's been proven now.
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:34.920]  You've been writing about that.
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:36.920]  Trump was up by 800,000 votes
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.920]  on election night,
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:40.920]  and it was unbeatable. Trump won Pennsylvania.
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:42.920]  Meanwhile, the week before,
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:44.920]  the Attorney General of Pennsylvania,
[2:35:44.920 --> 2:35:46.920]  named Shapiro,
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:48.920]  he made a comment the week before.
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:50.920]  It doesn't matter what you think.
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:52.920]  It doesn't matter how big Trump wins.
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:54.920]  It doesn't matter how big the lead is at election night.
[2:35:54.920 --> 2:35:56.920]  Trump's not going to win Pennsylvania.
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:58.920]  And I thought, this guy's crazy.
[2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:00.920]  I was naive. I didn't think he knew.
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:02.920]  He knew that no matter what the lead was,
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:04.920]  they would beat it
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:06.920]  with fake ballots.
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:08.920]  So they saw that they had to beat 800,000,
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:10.920]  and they set out over the next few days.
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:12.920]  I'll make a documentary about this,
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:14.920]  they said no matter what he does,
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:16.920]  he's out.
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:18.920]  It'll be a red mirage, but we'll have the vote,
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:20.920]  the mail-ins, we're going to win.
[2:36:20.920 --> 2:36:22.920]  They even telegraphed for their own people.
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:24.920]  Right. And so, you know,
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:26.920]  I think that nothing in the world
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:28.920]  is more important now.
[2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:30.920]  We could discuss Afghanistan
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:32.920]  and leaving the weapons on the ground
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:34.920]  and leaving the Americans behind.
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:36.920]  We could discuss the open borders.
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:38.920]  We could discuss what's happening in Ukraine.
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:40.920]  None of it matters that we don't have
[2:36:40.920 --> 2:36:42.920]  to vote.
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:44.920]  None of it matters that Stalin says
[2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:46.920]  if you're not the one counting the votes.
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:48.920]  It doesn't matter who's voting.
[2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:50.920]  It matters who counts the votes.
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:52.920]  That's what Stalin said.
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:54.920]  And these are Stalin-esque communists.
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:56.920]  And by the way,
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:36:58.920]  if you don't believe Biden's a communist
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:00.920]  and a Stalin-esque Soviet-style communist,
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:02.920]  what is Justin Trudeau?
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:04.920]  I mean, he has unmasked himself.
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:06.920]  The black-faced man
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:08.920]  has unmasked himself
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:10.920]  under his jackboots.
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:12.920]  The country of Canada is done.
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:14.920]  Finished. I totally agree.
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:16.920]  And what do you make of him,
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:18.920]  because I'm not lionizing Putin,
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:20.920]  but him saying we're going to fight
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:22.920]  Putin's authoritarianism
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:24.920]  when Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator?
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:26.920]  Yeah, it's almost as funny
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:28.920]  that he says that as when
[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:30.920]  a Biden spokesman,
[2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:32.920]  I was saying America's spokesman,
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:34.920]  but Biden does represent America.
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:36.920]  You and I both know that.
[2:37:36.920 --> 2:37:38.920]  Sovereignty and the borders
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:40.920]  of Ukraine.
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:42.920]  Wait a minute.
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:44.920]  What about the American border?
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:46.920]  Are you out of your mind?
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:48.920]  You're worried about Ukraine's border?
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:50.920]  So what do you expect to come out of that?
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:52.920]  I want to go back to voting,
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:54.920]  but what are people going to do
[2:37:54.920 --> 2:37:56.920]  when almost 80% of Americans
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:37:58.920]  or actually more
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:00.920]  do not want to be at war with Russia
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:02.920]  and all this is happening?
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:04.920]  Where do you think this goes now?
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:06.920]  Well, there are 17 sons, right?
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:08.920]  One is 21 and actually just turned 22
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:10.920]  and the other is 17
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:12.920]  about to turn 18.
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:14.920]  I'm not giving up my boys to fight Ukraine.
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:16.920]  My sons, I'm not sending them to Ukraine to die.
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:18.920]  I learned my lesson from Vietnam.
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:20.920]  I have no interest in going to a country
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:22.920]  that does not matter
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:24.920]  to the United States of America.
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:26.920]  Exactly. Our country, I think Tucker said last night,
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:28.920]  who's opening your borders?
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:30.920]  Who's devaluing your currency?
[2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:32.920]  Who's treating sexualization of our children?
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:34.920]  Who's causing culture war?
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:36.920]  Who is creating inflation?
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:38.920]  It's the Democrats. It's not Putin.
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:40.920]  The fight is here.
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:42.920]  Right, and the fight is critical race theory.
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:44.920]  By the way, you know what Virginia proved
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:46.920]  with Yonkin, Alex?
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:48.920]  That's the number one issue for Republicans,
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:50.920]  even though I think vaccine mandates
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:52.920]  and I think that open borders
[2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:54.920]  are the two issues that matter above all else
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:38:56.920]  to the average woman in America.
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:38:58.920]  We already have almost all men are Republicans.
[2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:00.920]  Women are the issue.
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:02.920]  We've got to get them over to our side.
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:04.920]  Not every women yet teaching a five-year-old
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:06.920]  they're bad because of what color they are
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:08.920]  is evil.
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:10.920]  Right, right. So we turned
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:12.920]  all the mama bears into Republicans
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  in Virginia and in San Francisco
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:16.920]  a couple weeks ago,
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:18.920]  they threw three liberals out of office
[2:39:18.920 --> 2:39:20.920]  in a completely liberal
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:22.920]  district out of school board
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:24.920]  because they had kept their kids out of school
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:26.920]  and they wanted vaccine mandates
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:28.920]  and they wanted mask mandates
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:30.920]  and they wanted to change the names of every school
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:32.920]  with wonderful names
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:34.920]  George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, that's no good anymore
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:36.920]  and they threw them out
[2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:38.920]  and it was not like 51-49
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:40.920]  it was 75%
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:42.920]  of the vote in a liberal
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:44.920]  district. Exactly, I was going to bring that up.
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:46.920]  So why is the left so obsessed
[2:39:46.920 --> 2:39:48.920]  with literally Hitler stuff
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:50.920]  in reverse that no one's going to buy?
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:52.920]  I mean, no one's going to buy telling five-year-olds
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:54.920]  they're inherently bad because of what color they are.
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:39:56.920]  Right, I mean, the only answer
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:39:58.920]  I could give you Alex is a couple.
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:00.920]  Number one, they are mentally ill.
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:02.920]  And then this was, remember Michael Savage
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.920]  he wrote a book 30 years ago, liberalism
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:06.920]  is a mental illness. It is.
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:08.920]  And he was so right, so right
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:10.920]  and he was so ahead of his time
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:12.920]  it was like Michael Savage. It is a mental disorder.
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:14.920]  I mean, who would even come up with stuff like this?
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:16.920]  So what's wrong with him? What happens?
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  Who would ever teach boys
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:20.920]  that they should be girls and girls they should be boys
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:22.920]  and don't tell your parents but
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:24.920]  you should have a sex change. Who would even think
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:26.920]  of something so mentally disturbing?
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:28.920]  They're just
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:30.920]  weird people and they're trying to convince
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:32.920]  us that the weirder you are
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:34.920]  that's America and the normal
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:36.920]  people especially white
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:38.920]  straight males who actually
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:40.920]  like women are weird
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:42.920]  and we're rapists and we're bad.
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:44.920]  Everyone's normal
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:46.920]  is bad to a liberal and everybody bad
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:48.920]  is supposed to be the norm.
[2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:50.920]  So they're trying to teach the kids
[2:40:50.920 --> 2:40:52.920]  you don't want to be a white straight male
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:54.920]  if you are, you're a bad person
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:56.920]  you're evil, you're responsible
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:58.920]  for everything bad that's ever happened
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:00.920]  in this world. And they do actually teach that
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:02.920]  it's outrageous.
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:04.920]  They do and they're trying to switch men
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:06.920]  to women and women to men
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:08.920]  and it's just sick but look
[2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:10.920]  I think they're mentally ill and I think they realize
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:12.920]  these are the things they really
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:14.920]  believe in Alex. They really do
[2:41:14.920 --> 2:41:16.920]  believe in these things and so the only way
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:18.920]  to impose them they'll never win
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:20.920]  a popularity contest or a vote
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:22.920]  or a poll. So the only way
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:24.920]  to impose them is to
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:26.920]  rig and steal elections
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:28.920]  and to ban and censor
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:30.920]  and burn the books of your opponents
[2:41:30.920 --> 2:41:32.920]  and not let the rest of us speak
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:34.920]  and that way they could convince themselves
[2:41:34.920 --> 2:41:36.920]  and convince... Well that's right
[2:41:36.920 --> 2:41:38.920]  they've lost the argument so the question is
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:40.920]  can they successfully now bring in a tyranny
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:42.920]  worldwide? I'm sure you saw in Canada
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:44.920]  hundreds of people charged not
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:46.920]  given bail including peaceful organizers
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:48.920]  for peaceful protesting facing 10 years
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:50.920]  in jail up to a year till trial
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:52.920]  that's North Korea stuff
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:54.920]  Right that's January 6th
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:56.920]  it's not North Korea it's America
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:41:58.920]  Canada's gone full America and remember
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:00.920]  Justin Trudeau who's
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:02.920]  a little wimpy snowflake
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:04.920]  I won't say more on national TV
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:06.920]  but I have a real word for him but I'm not going to say it
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:08.920]  because you and I would both get taken off the air
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:10.920]  so Justin Trudeau is a wimpy snowflake
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:12.920]  and he was actually
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:14.920]  he didn't know what to do he ran and he hid
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:16.920]  from the convoy and the blockade
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:18.920]  and he heard of those truckers
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:20.920]  and then he got a phone call from Joe Biden
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:22.920]  and right after the phone call
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:24.920]  is when he imposed the emergency powers act
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:26.920]  and basically martial law
[2:42:26.920 --> 2:42:28.920]  and that's when he started arresting
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:30.920]  and beating everybody
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:32.920]  and now he's decided to charge them
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:34.920]  the exact same way
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:36.920]  that we charged people in January 6th
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:38.920]  so it was all... Now you make a great point
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:40.920]  I say it's like North Korea
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:42.920]  January 6th in the tyranny and the no bail
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:44.920]  for a peaceful people is an example
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:46.920]  of the world
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:48.920]  oh America puts people in jail without
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:50.920]  trial we need to do that too
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:52.920]  you're right exported from America
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:43:16.920]  to Canada the January 6th tyranny
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:26.920]  we have brain force ultra
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:28.920]  super fast acting amazing clean
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:30.920]  new tropic system
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:32.920]  that is a compliment to brain force
[2:43:32.920 --> 2:43:34.920]  plus and of course turbo force
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:36.920]  all three of these are different formulas
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:38.920]  but all three of them take your mind
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:40.920]  and take your focus and clarity
[2:43:40.920 --> 2:43:42.920]  and alertness to the next level
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:44.920]  it is 40% off
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:46.920]  at infowarstore.com
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:48.920]  for a limited time

[2:43:54.920 --> 2:44:22.920]  thanks for calling
[2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:24.920]  the XQ does wonders
[2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:26.920]  they recommend it to everybody
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:28.920]  get off the fence
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:30.920]  get the product
[2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:32.920]  Tyler in Maine
[2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:34.920]  thanks for rolling
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:36.920]  it's an honor
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:38.920]  so first thing I wanted to do
[2:44:38.920 --> 2:44:40.920]  was say I love the products
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:42.920]  Alpha Power even at 29
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:44.920]  if you ask my better half
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:46.920]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom
[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:48.920]  so just number one
[2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:50.920]  it definitely works
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:52.920]  absolutely
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:22.920]  just below the pedals
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:24.920]  that contain the rose plant seeds
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:26.920]  natural chemicals found in the hips
[2:45:26.920 --> 2:45:28.920]  may even be helpful for a variety
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:30.920]  of health conditions including those
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:32.920]  with osteoarthritis and for those
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:34.920]  with pain after surgery studies have shown
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:36.920]  as for vitamin C and zinc
[2:45:36.920 --> 2:45:38.920]  themselves you probably already know
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:40.920]  that they play an important role in nutrition
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:42.920]  immune defense and the maintenance
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:44.920]  of your everyday health
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:46.920]  it has been reported that intake of both
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:48.920]  is often inadequate even in affluent
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:50.920]  populations like here in America
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:52.920]  so next time you visit be sure to check it out
[2:45:52.920 --> 2:45:54.920]  at infoorstore.com
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:56.920]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.920]  so I did it
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:00.920]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.920]  I've been training probably
[2:46:02.920 --> 2:46:04.920]  not as much as they should be
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:06.920]  but thank goodness for prayer
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:08.920]  and thank goodness for infoorstore.com
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:10.920]  before I start out on a run
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:12.920]  I throw down some turbo force
[2:46:12.920 --> 2:46:14.920]  to give me that energy I need
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:16.920]  to get going you know besides the energy
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:18.920]  and the bio force
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:20.920]  it is giving me the vitamins I need
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:22.920]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[2:46:22.920 --> 2:46:24.920]  and the essential B vitamins
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:26.920]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[2:46:26.920 --> 2:46:28.920]  giving me the best chance at getting through
[2:46:28.920 --> 2:46:30.920]  the training and then every day now
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:32.920]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:34.920]  I have bad joints thanks mom
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:36.920]  so this is great for giving my joints
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:38.920]  the extra support they need right now
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:40.920]  plus inflammation support
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:42.920]  and extra flexibility
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:44.920]  the quick release capsules help me recover fast
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:46.920]  and get back to the training
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:48.920]  even if you're not crazy enough
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  to take on a marathon
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:52.920]  good news turbo force
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:54.920]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[2:46:54.920 --> 2:46:56.920]  for every day
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:58.920]  and sore list can keep you moving
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:00.920]  and feeling great at NEH
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:02.920]  leading a frontal assault
[2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:04.920]  on the lies of the New World Order
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:24.920]  Music
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:26.920]  Alright it's about to take over
[2:47:26.920 --> 2:47:28.920]  and host the fourth hour
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:30.920]  he's an amazing fox to host
[2:47:30.920 --> 2:47:32.920]  Everybody knows him
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:34.920]  rootforamerica.com
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:36.920]  Music
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:38.920]  Look at some of these articles that are on infowars.com though
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:40.920]  I'm definitely going to shoot some special reports today
[2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:42.920]  because I didn't get to have this
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:44.920]  sticker shop
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:46.920]  this is linked up on Drudge Report
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  Gas climbs over
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:50.920]  $6 per gallon
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:52.920]  in Los Angeles
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:47:54.920]  that's in the Don Salazar article
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:56.920]  that is almost
[2:47:56.920 --> 2:47:58.920]  that's 150% increase in the last 12 months
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:00.920]  13 months
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:02.920]  in the energy department saying
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:04.920]  that
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:06.920]  well this is part of the transition
[2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:08.920]  transition to what?
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:10.920]  Unbelievable
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:12.920]  then we've got this
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:14.920]  CDC is refusing to publish data
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:16.920]  it has collected on booster effectiveness
[2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:18.920]  18 to 49
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:20.920]  I mean case closed
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:22.920]  when they're hiding data
[2:48:22.920 --> 2:48:24.920]  Wayne my problem of the talk show
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:26.920]  I'm sure you have the same ones there's too much to talk about
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:28.920]  there's never a slow news day
[2:48:28.920 --> 2:48:30.920]  before every show of my 3 hour
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:32.920]  national radio show Alex
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:34.920]  and the stack is this thick
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:36.920]  and it's got like 100 articles that I took an hour to download
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:38.920]  that I'm interested in all 100 of them
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:40.920]  and at the end of 3 hours
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:42.920]  I've spoken about 3 to 5
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:44.920]  so 95 are ignored
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:46.920]  and they're all important and it's very scary
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:48.920]  if you're in that 95 pile
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:50.920]  because tomorrow I'll have a new 100
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:52.920]  and then 95 gets thrown out
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:54.920]  in the recycling bin
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:56.920]  hey I'm liberal about one thing
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:48:58.920]  I'm like you I print it
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:00.920]  because they change articles you can't skip or I print
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:02.920]  all of it and exactly
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:04.920]  I cover 10%
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:06.920]  and it's like it's crazy what's going on
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:08.920]  and you know what's funny
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:10.920]  inflation reminds me
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:12.920]  of everything else that liberals do to us
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:14.920]  or I should say socialist
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:16.920]  Marxist and communist do to us
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:18.920]  who are hiding as liberals
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:20.920]  but they do the same thing
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:22.920]  everything they do destroys the middle class
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:24.920]  and destroys small business
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:26.920]  and makes America into Mexico
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:28.920]  or some other country where
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:30.920]  they want dependent pathetic people
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:32.920]  right they want a little group
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:34.920]  of super rich elitists at the top
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:36.920]  that have all the government contracts
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:38.920]  and their wives and husbands are politicians
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:40.920]  and billionaire businessmen or women
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:42.920]  and then almost everybody
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:44.920]  is poor the rest of the country
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:46.920]  is poor they've eliminated the middle
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:48.920]  and when you see you mentioned gas prices
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:50.920]  are $6 in Los Angeles
[2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:52.920]  and soon they're going to be 7
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:54.920]  in Los Angeles what experts say
[2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:56.920]  yeah they're 621, 623
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:49:58.920]  I mean that is insane
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:00.920]  insane and it doesn't hurt rich people
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:02.920]  a rich person couldn't care less
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:04.920]  about a $6 gallon gas
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:06.920]  matter of fact most rich people work at home
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:08.920]  they're not even driving
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:10.920]  and even if they did what's $6 gas
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:12.920]  when you have 10 million in the bank
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:14.920]  it doesn't matter so the rich are fine
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:16.920]  now let's talk about the poor
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:18.920]  the poor are fine they get welfare
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:20.920]  and food stamps and housing
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:22.920]  and women that are screwed by this
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:24.920]  why does Klaus Schwab openly say
[2:50:24.920 --> 2:50:26.920]  Klaus Schwab says they want to get rid of the middle class
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:28.920]  what threatens them about that
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:30.920]  well it's an upwardly mobile group
[2:50:30.920 --> 2:50:32.920]  they don't control
[2:50:32.920 --> 2:50:34.920]  let me give you one more
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:36.920]  my dad was a butcher
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:38.920]  I always joke that I'm an SOB a son of a butcher
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:40.920]  and my dad was a butcher
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:42.920]  who spent 20 years working
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:44.920]  in a butcher store carving meat
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:46.920]  what a miserable life
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:48.920]  by the way I'm not being judgmental
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:50.920]  every day said Wayne this is miserable
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:52.920]  I want you to go to college
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:54.920]  you can't do this this is misery
[2:50:54.920 --> 2:50:56.920]  he hated it but after 20 years
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:50:58.920]  of doing it he saved up enough money
[2:50:58.920 --> 2:51:00.920]  to start his own butcher store
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:02.920]  now he had a little two-man butcher store
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:04.920]  with him and my uncle
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:06.920]  and just with a crappy
[2:51:06.920 --> 2:51:08.920]  two-man butcher store he made enough money
[2:51:08.920 --> 2:51:10.920]  to suddenly buy us a nice house
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:12.920]  and go out to eat once or twice a week
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:14.920]  and a nice new car every two years
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:16.920]  and he paid for me to go to Columbia University
[2:51:16.920 --> 2:51:18.920]  and my sister
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:20.920]  to go to Columbia University
[2:51:20.920 --> 2:51:22.920]  two kids went to Ivy League school
[2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:24.920]  that's what they want to destroy
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:26.920]  they want to destroy that ladder up
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:28.920]  that's it that's what they can't stand
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:30.920]  and what they can't stand about it is
[2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:32.920]  he was very independent
[2:51:32.920 --> 2:51:34.920]  all small business owners
[2:51:34.920 --> 2:51:36.920]  have a message for government
[2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  go screw yourself we don't need you
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:40.920]  we don't want you we just want you out of the way
[2:51:40.920 --> 2:51:42.920]  we don't need any help from you
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:44.920]  we want nothing from you
[2:51:44.920 --> 2:51:46.920]  thanks we're independent thinkers
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:48.920]  well yeah because you don't even want your husband and wife looking over your shoulder
[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:50.920]  or your cousin or your neighbor
[2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:52.920]  much less the government
[2:51:52.920 --> 2:51:54.920]  right and that's what they hate
[2:51:54.920 --> 2:51:56.920]  they can't stand it we're the ones standing in the way
[2:51:56.920 --> 2:51:58.920]  of America becoming communist
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:52:00.920]  or Nazi or whatever it is you want to call it
[2:52:00.920 --> 2:52:02.920]  Stalinesque or
[2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:04.920]  or fascist or authoritarian
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:06.920]  it doesn't matter what the word is
[2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:08.920]  they're all the same
[2:52:08.920 --> 2:52:10.920]  as a matter of fact liberals have lied
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:12.920]  for all these years now 80 years
[2:52:12.920 --> 2:52:14.920]  Nazi was conservative
[2:52:14.920 --> 2:52:16.920]  and Hitler was conservative no he wasn't
[2:52:16.920 --> 2:52:18.920]  he was the socialist party of
[2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:20.920]  Germany he was a socialist
[2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:22.920]  there was nothing conservative about
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:24.920]  Anne of Hitler he was a fascist
[2:52:24.920 --> 2:52:26.920]  and a socialist and this these
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:28.920]  people in office in Canada and America
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:30.920]  the democrat party here
[2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:32.920]  the labor party in almost
[2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:34.920]  every democracy UK
[2:52:34.920 --> 2:52:36.920]  Australia New Zealand Canada
[2:52:36.920 --> 2:52:38.920]  they're all the same
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  and let me add to that though we can laugh
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:42.920]  at it and I laugh at it too but
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:44.920]  when they're teaching 5 year olds this it really screws
[2:52:44.920 --> 2:52:46.920]  their brains up a great psychosis later
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:48.920]  and then you've got Trudeau
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:50.920]  and all the other liberals in Canada
[2:52:50.920 --> 2:52:52.920]  and here saying honking
[2:52:52.920 --> 2:52:54.920]  is how Hitler we need to
[2:52:54.920 --> 2:52:56.920]  confiscate the guns and people say well that's ridiculous
[2:52:56.920 --> 2:52:58.920]  then I have video of them pulling people
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:00.920]  over all over Toronto
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:02.920]  Ottawa that have Canadian flags
[2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:04.920]  and now I have the CBC saying
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:06.920]  is the Canadian flag
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:08.920]  evil now a maple leaf meaning
[2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:10.920]  you know we make maple syrup
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:12.920]  which I had some this morning on my pancakes
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:14.920]  is now racist I mean this is
[2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:16.920]  the left declaring ownership of everything
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:18.920]  here is this crazy woman
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:20.920]  in the parliament saying honk honk means
[2:53:20.920 --> 2:53:22.920]  how Hitler
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:24.920]  how many guns need to be seized
[2:53:26.920 --> 2:53:28.920]  how much vitriol do
[2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:30.920]  we have to see of honk honk
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:32.920]  which is an anacronym for hail Hitler
[2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:34.920]  do we need to see
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:36.920]  by these protestors
[2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:38.920]  on social media
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:40.920]  meanwhile Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:42.920]  Soros worked for Hitler
[2:53:42.920 --> 2:53:44.920]  I mean it doesn't even
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:46.920]  it's ridiculous
[2:53:46.920 --> 2:53:48.920]  well look I'm a firm believer
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:50.920]  and I'm not a bad person
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:52.920]  I've always been a relatively nice person
[2:53:52.920 --> 2:53:54.920]  but I do believe nice guys finish last
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:53:56.920]  I do believe in the business world
[2:53:56.920 --> 2:53:58.920]  if you're super nice
[2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:00.920]  you'll have cleat marks on your face
[2:54:00.920 --> 2:54:02.920]  and I think Canadians are the nicest people in the world
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:04.920]  and look where it just got them
[2:54:04.920 --> 2:54:06.920]  and you're the boot
[2:54:06.920 --> 2:54:08.920]  on their neck of a communist
[2:54:08.920 --> 2:54:10.920]  slash Nazi
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:12.920]  slash fascist authoritarian leader
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:14.920]  slash dictator slash tyrant
[2:54:14.920 --> 2:54:16.920]  that's what being nice got them
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:18.920]  the United States is tough
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:20.920]  and I don't believe we're going to allow this to happen
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:22.920]  and we got to fight Alex
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:24.920]  I agree you know you look at hockey players in Canada
[2:54:24.920 --> 2:54:26.920]  and I know some Canadians they're real nice
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:28.920]  but I wouldn't want to get into fight with them
[2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:30.920]  I think they've awakened the sleeping giant up there
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:32.920]  and I make a prediction I think all this intimidation
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:34.920]  to jail without bail for protesting peacefully
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:36.920]  I predict it backfires Wayne Allen
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:38.920]  what do you think?
[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:40.920]  I hope and pray it does but don't forget
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:42.920]  I'm going to be a little honest here
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:44.920]  there are reasons why they do what they do
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:46.920]  I believe that my fans
[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:48.920]  who came out you know just in Las Vegas
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:50.920]  you know I'm a national host
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:52.920]  but my show is based in Las Vegas
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:54.920]  and when I said let's have a rally
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:56.920]  three times in the last year
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:54:58.920]  10,000 people
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:00.920]  showed up in Las Vegas
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:02.920]  in a non-political town
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:04.920]  it's not like that
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:06.920]  right so I'm telling you
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:08.920]  now all of a sudden everybody's got it in the back of their mind
[2:55:08.920 --> 2:55:10.920]  if I go to a protest
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:12.920]  who's taking down my name
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:14.920]  who's filming my face
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:16.920]  who's taking down my license number
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:18.920]  is the IRS going to come try to destroy my life?
[2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:20.920]  it's definitely a chilling effect and we got a
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:22.920]  block it with a real tyranny happens
[2:55:22.920 --> 2:55:24.920]  people should be afraid of the chilling effect works
[2:55:24.920 --> 2:55:26.920]  you're about to take over next hour
[2:55:26.920 --> 2:55:28.920]  what are you going to be breaking down?
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:30.920]  I'm going to talk about Ukraine
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:32.920]  and I'm going to talk about open borders
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:34.920]  and I'm going to talk about all you know
[2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:36.920]  I call it the root reaction
[2:55:36.920 --> 2:55:38.920]  I react to all the stories I download each day
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:40.920]  in order that I think are the most important
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:42.920]  so I'll give you a countdown to the important stories
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:44.920]  and I'll give you my reaction
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:46.920]  and hopefully my reaction matches
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:48.920]  the reaction of your fans Alex
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:50.920]  absolutely we love Wayne Allen Root
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:52.920]  I've been watching him on TV for decades

[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:04.920]  but this is a war
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:06.920]  they would not be trying to suppress free speech
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:08.920]  if it was futile
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:10.920]  it is not futile it is victory

[2:59:19.920 --> 2:59:21.920]  and engineers
[2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:23.920]  that are exposing all their lies

[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:51.920]  live so root4america.com
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:53.920]  is where it all starts
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:55.920]  that's my website up on the screen right now
[3:00:55.920 --> 3:00:57.920]  and you're also seeing my book up on the screen
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:00:59.920]  The Great Patriot Protest
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:01.920]  and Boycott Book, I think it
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:03.920]  perfectly sums up
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:05.920]  what just happened with the Canadian
[3:01:05.920 --> 3:01:07.920]  truckers who lit a fire
[3:01:07.920 --> 3:01:09.920]  under the entire world
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:11.920]  and if you're wondering why I have a horse voice
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:13.920]  I have the same voice as Alex
[3:01:13.920 --> 3:01:15.920]  we both talk all day long
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:17.920]  on radio and TV
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:19.920]  and my voice becomes hoarse 24 hours a day
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:21.920]  and it sounds just like Alex Jones nowadays
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:23.920]  it just happened
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:25.920]  I guess it's because we all talk and talk and talk
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:27.920]  thank God, God gave me only one gift in life
[3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:29.920]  I'm a good talker but boy can I talk
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:31.920]  so my voice is permanently hoarse
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:33.920]  The Great Patriot Protest
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:35.920]  and Boycott Book
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:37.920]  I think
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:39.920]  is the Canadian truckers
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:41.920]  and now it is the American truckers
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:43.920]  who are on their way with a convoy
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:45.920]  today they started an hour ago
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:47.920]  and they're on their way to Washington DC
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:49.920]  and the point of my book was
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:51.920]  with rigged elections
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:53.920]  and with all the fraud in the world
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:55.920]  and all the banning going on
[3:01:55.920 --> 3:01:57.920]  and all the censorship going on
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:01:59.920]  and the rigging going on
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:01.920]  basically the book burning going on
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:03.920]  it's my opinion that you're not going to win
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:05.920]  you're going to have to strike
[3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:07.920]  you're going to have to protest
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:09.920]  you're going to have to boycott
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:11.920]  you're going to have to blockade
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:13.920]  all versions of civil disobedience
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:15.920]  like Dr. Martin Luther King preached
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:17.920]  but there is no choice
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:19.920]  and my book tells you how to do it
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:21.920]  and talks about this philosophy of civil disobedience
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:23.920]  never violence
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:25.920]  we never want to be the ones to preach violence
[3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:27.920]  on the conservative right
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:29.920]  because look what happened on January 6th
[3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:31.920]  they'll try and destroy us
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:33.920]  they will paint us as evil
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:35.920]  and try to destroy the entire movement
[3:02:35.920 --> 3:02:37.920]  so I don't respond with violence
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:39.920]  but I respond with civil disobedience
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:41.920]  against people who are beating my brains in
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:43.920]  we've got to figure out something other than just voting
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:45.920]  and that's my book The Great Patriot
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:47.920]  protest and boycott book that's the Canadian
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:49.920]  convoy the Canadian blockade
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:51.920]  and this American convoy
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:53.920]  these people are great fighters I love them
[3:02:53.920 --> 3:02:55.920]  alright so I think we've got
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:57.920]  about a minute left let me kind of go over
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:02:59.920]  what I'm going to talk about on today's show
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:01.920]  first of all COVID
[3:03:01.920 --> 3:03:03.920]  and the COVID vaccines are always a big
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:05.920]  topic with me open borders
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:07.920]  a big topic with me
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:09.920]  some information that just came out
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:11.920]  from life insurance companies
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:13.920]  that I've been talking about
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:15.920]  for weeks when I say it just came out
[3:03:15.920 --> 3:03:17.920]  came out about a month ago
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:19.920]  month and a half ago I've talked about it nonstop
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:21.920]  three hours a day on my national radio
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:23.920]  show but
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:25.920]  but the mainstream media has never touched it
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:27.920]  it finally came out today
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:29.920]  I'm not sure if it's on the front page
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:31.920]  of the Wall Street Journal because I don't get the physical
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:33.920]  edition anymore but I get
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:35.920]  the online Wall Street Journal
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:37.920]  it was on the front page at the top
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:39.920]  of the online Wall Street Journal
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:41.920]  a story about how life insurance companies
[3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:43.920]  are being deluged
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:45.920]  by dead people
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:47.920]  people are dropping dead
[3:03:47.920 --> 3:03:49.920]  at a rate that is historic
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:51.920]  and they blame everything in the world
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:53.920]  except the vaccine
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:55.920]  which is a joke I mean it really is a joke
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:57.920]  they don't even seem to understand
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:03:59.920]  that the vaccine is at the root
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:01.920]  excuse the pun from Wayne Root
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:03.920]  at the root of all of this
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:05.920]  is the vaccine induced death
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:07.920]  called Vades
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:09.920]  it's like AIDS with a V
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:11.920]  Vades and it's an induced
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:13.920]  heart attack
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:15.920]  strokes, blood clots
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:17.920]  multi-organ failure and perhaps most importantly
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:19.920]  there's the story on the cover
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:21.920]  of the Wall Street Journal
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:23.920]  Alex has the most crack staff
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:25.920]  you guys are fantastic
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:27.920]  I mentioned it, there it is
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:29.920]  great stuff and the deaths
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:31.920]  are piling up and they blame it on everything
[3:04:31.920 --> 3:04:33.920]  and anything except
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:35.920]  the vaccines and you and I both know
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:37.920]  what's the blame for all these deaths

[3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:09.920]  let me tell you, as a veteran
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:11.920]  for all these years, I'm actually 60
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:13.920]  years old now, can you believe it
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:15.920]  I work out 90 minutes a day
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:17.920]  and I pop 100 vitamin pills a day
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:19.920]  and I feel like a million bucks
[3:06:19.920 --> 3:06:21.920]  and eat healthy by the way
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:23.920]  and so I'm like Alex's philosophy
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:25.920]  vitamins, vitamins, vitamins have kept me alive
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:27.920]  for 40 years, alive and ticking and high energy
[3:06:27.920 --> 3:06:29.920]  but all these years that I've been on TV
[3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:31.920]  as a guest and as a host
[3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:33.920]  40 years and by the way
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:35.920]  I know vitamins work because listen to my track record
[3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:37.920]  I got my first TV show
[3:06:37.920 --> 3:06:39.920]  at the age of 26
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:41.920]  on Financial News Network
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:43.920]  89
[3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:45.920]  I was 26 years old then I turned 27
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:47.920]  a few days after I got the show
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:49.920]  but I was 26 and 27 years old
[3:06:49.920 --> 3:06:51.920]  one of the youngest
[3:06:51.920 --> 3:06:53.920]  anchorman on national TV
[3:06:53.920 --> 3:06:55.920]  hosted all their sports program
[3:06:55.920 --> 3:06:57.920]  and hosted five shows a day
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:06:59.920]  okay, I was the
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:01.920]  ultimate workhorse on TV
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:03.920]  five shows a day
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:05.920]  and then I got my next TV show
[3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:07.920]  when I was 57
[3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:09.920]  years old on Newsmax TV
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:11.920]  and I hosted it for three years
[3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:13.920]  actually I was 56 excuse me
[3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:15.920]  three years and 700 episodes
[3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:17.920]  with the number one prime time
[3:07:17.920 --> 3:07:19.920]  slot on Newsmax TV
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:21.920]  and Bill O'Reilly three times a week
[3:07:21.920 --> 3:07:23.920]  as my co-host I've always been very lucky
[3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:25.920]  in life on the sports programming
[3:07:25.920 --> 3:07:27.920]  on CNBC, Jimmy the Greek
[3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:29.920]  if you remember that name was my partner
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:31.920]  and in politics it was Bill O'Reilly
[3:07:31.920 --> 3:07:33.920]  and now here I am with Alex Jones
[3:07:33.920 --> 3:07:35.920]  I always get around the biggest names and the best people
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:37.920]  and I'm very proud to be
[3:07:37.920 --> 3:07:39.920]  the partners with them
[3:07:39.920 --> 3:07:41.920]  so in the history of American TV
[3:07:41.920 --> 3:07:43.920]  I don't think anybody has ever gotten
[3:07:43.920 --> 3:07:45.920]  their first show when they're 26
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:47.920]  and their next show when they're
[3:07:47.920 --> 3:07:49.920]  56 30 year gap
[3:07:49.920 --> 3:07:51.920]  between me hosting
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:53.920]  television shows one sports
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:55.920]  and the other politics 30
[3:07:55.920 --> 3:07:57.920]  year gap nobody gets hired
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:59.920]  in TV at the age of
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:01.920]  56 and I was
[3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:03.920]  and so my point to you is
[3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:05.920]  vitamins exercise
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:07.920]  has changed my life so thank you Alex
[3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:09.920]  for bringing us some great vitamins so
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:11.920]  some things I want to talk to you about
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:13.920]  some issues that I think are at the top
[3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:15.920]  of my mind how about the scandals
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:17.920]  with Joe Biden you know I've got
[3:08:17.920 --> 3:08:19.920]  a 10 minute run in this segment I'll give you
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:21.920]  some Joe Biden scandals first of all
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:23.920]  what do I think Ukraine is all about
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:25.920]  I think obviously
[3:08:25.920 --> 3:08:27.920]  you know number one Ukraine
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:29.920]  is about flexing muscles you know
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:31.920]  here's Putin he's flexing his muscles
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:33.920]  he thinks he's a he-man
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:35.920]  thinks he's you know the Popeye
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:37.920]  the sailor man he's Tarzan
[3:08:37.920 --> 3:08:39.920]  he's always shirtless and he's
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:41.920]  flexing his muscles and Putin
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:43.920]  wants to prove that
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:45.920]  Biden is an old
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  feeble man with dementia well guess
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:49.920]  what Putin I got news for you I was
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:51.920]  there long before you this guy's
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:53.920]  an old feeble man with dementia and I've been
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:55.920]  saying it for four years okay two years
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:08:57.920]  before he got elected president and
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:08:59.920]  and then the last year so three years
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:01.920]  I've been talking about Biden being a feeble
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:03.920]  man with dementia that cannot possibly
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:05.920]  become the president United States and cannot
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:07.920]  possibly serve a normal term
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:09.920]  so we already
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:11.920]  know he's a feeble old man with dementia
[3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:13.920]  but Putin wants to expose him
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:15.920]  and he wants to win on the grand national
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:17.920]  stage and he has a burning desire
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:19.920]  to prove to the world
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:21.920]  that Russia is the king of the
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:23.920]  hill and America's a has been
[3:09:23.920 --> 3:09:25.920]  right for the last 25
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:27.920]  years 30 years Russia's
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:29.920]  been a has been and America's been the king
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:31.920]  of the hill right Russia was the king
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:33.920]  in the 60s and 70s competing
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:35.920]  with America trying to prove they were
[3:09:35.920 --> 3:09:37.920]  better than us and we beat him and we beat
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:39.920]  him we beat them we beat their brains in
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:41.920]  but now he has a chance to prove it
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:43.920]  all over again and he'll go down
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:45.920]  in history as the guy who does it and by
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:47.920]  evading invading Ukraine
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:49.920]  he's just
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  embarrassing and humiliating Joe Biden
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:53.920]  who he knows is powerless to stop him and
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:55.920]  can't do anything so that's number one
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:09:57.920]  number two I think
[3:09:57.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  so against all the other things
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:01.920]  happening there's a number two
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:03.920]  Ukraine is a country rich
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  with natural resources
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:07.920]  especially oil and gas
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:09.920]  so he covets Putin
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:11.920]  covets the natural resources of Ukraine
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:13.920]  and he's going to go in and pillage and
[3:10:13.920 --> 3:10:15.920]  rape that country excuse that
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:17.920]  term but that's what he's going to do he's going to
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:19.920]  rape it until there's nothing left
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:21.920]  and it all goes to Russia
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:23.920]  those are the two main reasons he's invading
[3:10:23.920 --> 3:10:25.920]  but let me give you a third reason
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:27.920]  that to my knowledge
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:29.920]  nobody else in the American media
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:31.920]  including conservative media has thought
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:33.920]  of or is talking about
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:35.920]  but this is my gut instinct
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:37.920]  and I've asked friends of mine
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:39.920]  who are brilliant military
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:41.920]  strategists retired
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:43.920]  but at one point the top military
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:45.920]  strategists in America
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:47.920]  and they both when I told them this story
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:49.920]  a light bulb went off and they said
[3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:51.920]  Wayne I think you're right
[3:10:51.920 --> 3:10:53.920]  and so all these many months
[3:10:53.920 --> 3:10:55.920]  since Biden has run for president
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:10:57.920]  and been president
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:10:59.920]  he talks a lot about the corruption
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:01.920]  in Russia and the corruption
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:03.920]  in the Ukraine and the corruption around
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:05.920]  the world and I think
[3:11:05.920 --> 3:11:07.920]  Putin is sick and tired
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:09.920]  of hearing and being lectured
[3:11:09.920 --> 3:11:11.920]  about Russia's corruption
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:13.920]  when Putin knows because I'm sure
[3:11:13.920 --> 3:11:15.920]  they've wiretapped so they know
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:17.920]  just like Hillary Clinton tapped
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:19.920]  into Donald Trump
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:21.920]  I guarantee you Russia is tapped into
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:23.920]  a lot of the world leaders
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:25.920]  and they all know that
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:27.920]  Biden is the most corrupt politician
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:29.920]  that's ever lived
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:31.920]  there's never been a more corrupt
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:33.920]  political hack than Joe Biden
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:35.920]  and so they all
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:37.920]  know this he's the biggest hypocrite
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:39.920]  in the world he has no right to lecture
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:41.920]  Russia about the bad things Russia
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:43.920]  does and how corrupt Putin is
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:45.920]  when in reality Joe Biden
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:47.920]  is the big guy
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:49.920]  Joe Biden is taking a 10 to
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:51.920]  20% cut of every
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:53.920]  deal that his brother gets
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:55.920]  and his son Hunter gets he is the most
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:11:57.920]  corrupt person that's ever represented
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:11:59.920]  the United States of America and I'm sure
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:01.920]  that Joe Biden is close to a billionaire
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:03.920]  in offshore bank accounts the Biden
[3:12:03.920 --> 3:12:05.920]  crime family is disgusting
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:07.920]  and they're so corrupt and Putin
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:09.920]  knows that I believe that the secrets
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:11.920]  to Biden's corruption
[3:12:11.920 --> 3:12:13.920]  are located in Ukraine
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:15.920]  all the dirty deals
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:17.920]  were in Ukraine so
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:19.920]  he rolls in with his tanks
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:21.920]  to Ukraine and he starts
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:23.920]  killing and arresting and torturing
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:25.920]  everyone including all the top
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:27.920]  politicians and agency heads
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:29.920]  of their federal agencies and he
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:31.920]  goes out and he finds the people
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:33.920]  who did the dirty business
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:35.920]  with Joe Biden and he knows who they are
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:37.920]  Putin knows everything and guess what
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:39.920]  he tortures them I'm not happy
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:41.920]  about any of this I'm not a Putin side
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:43.920]  I'm not a Russia side I'm
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  on America side I love America
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:47.920]  this is my country but I'm just
[3:12:47.920 --> 3:12:49.920]  telling you what I think is happening in Putin's mind
[3:12:49.920 --> 3:12:51.920]  he's going to go in and capture everyone
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:53.920]  who he believes did dirty deals with Joe
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:12:55.920]  Biden and torture them or torture
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:12:57.920]  their families or arrest them
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:12:59.920]  and just stick them in prison until
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:01.920]  they confess and tell him where
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:03.920]  all the dirty bodies are buried
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:05.920]  and then he's going to either
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:07.920]  choose at that point Putin can choose
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:09.920]  to parade all these dirty
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:11.920]  people on national TV
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:13.920]  or global TV and shock
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:15.920]  the world and prove that Joe Biden
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:17.920]  is a filthy, dirty
[3:13:17.920 --> 3:13:19.920]  corrupt politician and a traitor
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:21.920]  to his don't people and a traitor
[3:13:21.920 --> 3:13:23.920]  to the United States of America who's
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:25.920]  betrayed his offices US senator
[3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:27.920]  vice president now president and then
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:29.920]  he makes them resign in disgrace
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:31.920]  ruins his legacy and
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:33.920]  who's the crusader who cleaned it up
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:35.920]  the moral crusader is going to
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:37.920]  be Vladimir Putin so that's
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:39.920]  one choice and I think
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:41.920]  that's a key reason he's invading Ukraine
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:43.920]  in addition to flexing
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:45.920]  his muscle, making America look bad, make Russia
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:47.920]  look good and also
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:49.920]  making himself look good and also
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:51.920]  literally pillaging the country
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:53.920]  and stealing all their natural resources
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:55.920]  but this is the big bonus that he's
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:13:57.920]  going to destroy and bring down Biden
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:13:59.920]  and embarrass the United States
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:01.920]  and paralyze our government
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:03.920]  because the government, you know, if
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:05.920]  all the corruption
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:07.920]  is exposed and Biden is
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:09.920]  impeached and Biden's kicked out of office
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:11.920]  and Biden goes off to a nursing home
[3:14:11.920 --> 3:14:13.920]  all of a sudden America is very
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:15.920]  psychologically weak and fractured
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:17.920]  and Russia enters
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:19.920]  that hole and takes
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:21.920]  advantage of it and so that's
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:23.920]  option one, you know what option two is
[3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:25.920]  don't tell anybody about this
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:27.920]  don't put it on the national stage, don't embarrass
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:29.920]  Biden nationally and publicly
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:31.920]  but instead hold it over his head
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:33.920]  and blackmail Joe Biden
[3:14:33.920 --> 3:14:35.920]  that's probably what Putin intends
[3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:37.920]  to do, actually just keep it
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:39.920]  to himself and tell Biden I got
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:41.920]  the goods on you and I'm going to blackmail
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:43.920]  you unless you give me
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:45.920]  and Russia everything we want
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:47.920]  in the entire world I'll destroy
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:49.920]  you and ruin your legacy
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:51.920]  and all the secrets are kept
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:53.920]  basically in the vault
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:55.920]  of Ukraine and that's one of the reasons
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:57.920]  he's invading Ukraine
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:14:59.920]  this is my belief, this is
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:01.920]  my gut instinct, this is my
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:03.920]  guess, it's not a fact
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:05.920]  but I'm telling you if I'm Putin
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:07.920]  this is how I'm thinking and I believe
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:09.920]  I know Putin and I understand him
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:11.920]  and I'm telling you Joe Biden
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:13.920]  you better be shaking in your boots
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:15.920]  because Putin's coming
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:17.920]  and I think he's coming to get you
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:19.920]  and destroy your legacy, just my opinion
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:21.920]  we're headed to a break
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:23.920]  losing my voice
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:25.920]  headed to a break
[3:15:25.920 --> 3:15:27.920]  my website rootforamerica.com
[3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:29.920]  my email
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:31.920]  wainroot at gmail.com
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:33.920]  and my book
[3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:35.920]  prochest and boycottbook
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:37.920]  we'll be right back with Alex Chilts
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:15:57.920]  the globalists are bombarding us
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:15:59.920]  with propaganda
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:01.920]  and with spiritual warfare
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:03.920]  and with poisons and chemicals added
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:05.920]  to the food, it's all come out
[3:16:05.920 --> 3:16:07.920]  and they're doing that not because we're weak
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:09.920]  but because we're made the image of God
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:11.920]  the creator and we are
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:13.920]  powerful and the social engineers
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:15.920]  fear that so much
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:17.920]  so that's why I repeat that famous internet
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:19.920]  saying that nobody knows who first came
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:21.920]  up with the boy, is it true
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:25.920]  the propaganda would not be
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:27.920]  necessary if the situation
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:29.920]  was hopeless
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:31.920]  all their propaganda and all their lies
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:33.920]  and all their evil and all their cultural death
[3:16:33.920 --> 3:16:35.920]  because
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:37.920]  they know we are strong
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:39.920]  and they know in the end they signed on
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:41.920]  the God of this world who is a loser
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:43.920]  and that's why it's so important that everybody
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:45.920]  keep in full wars in the air now more than ever
[3:16:45.920 --> 3:16:47.920]  because even if you don't believe in God
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:49.920]  what the globalists are manifesting
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:51.920]  and setting up is safe and
[3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:53.920]  and we are opposing the one world government
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:55.920]  and the mark of the beast they just announced
[3:16:55.920 --> 3:16:57.920]  so I did it
[3:16:57.920 --> 3:16:59.920]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon
[3:16:59.920 --> 3:17:01.920]  I've been training probably
[3:17:01.920 --> 3:17:03.920]  not as much as I should be
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:05.920]  but thank goodness for prayer
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:07.920]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com
[3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:09.920]  before I start out on a run
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:11.920]  I throw down some turbo force
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:13.920]  to give me that energy I need to get going
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:15.920]  besides the energy, turbo force
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:17.920]  it is giving me the vitamins
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:19.920]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:21.920]  and the essential B vitamins
[3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:23.920]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:25.920]  giving me the best chance
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:27.920]  at getting through the training
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:29.920]  and then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:31.920]  Sorilis
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:33.920]  I have bad joints, thanks mom
[3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:35.920]  so this is great for giving my joints
[3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:37.920]  the extra support they need right now
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:39.920]  plus inflammation support
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:41.920]  and extra flexibility
[3:17:41.920 --> 3:17:43.920]  the quick release capsules help me recover fast
[3:17:43.920 --> 3:17:45.920]  so I can get back to the training
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:47.920]  even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:49.920]  good news, turbo force
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:51.920]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:53.920]  every day and Sorilis can keep you moving
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:55.920]  and feeling great at any age
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:57.920]  UN run contact tracers
[3:17:57.920 --> 3:17:59.920]  aren't coming, they're here
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:01.920]  all over the world from Australia
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:03.920]  to the United States from Canada to Germany
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:05.920]  these tyrants are tracking everything you do
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:07.920]  everywhere you go then coming to your house
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:09.920]  and threatening in some cases actually
[3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:11.920]  taking people away into
[3:18:11.920 --> 3:18:13.920]  the night to their facilities
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:15.920]  and they're planning in the next year
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:17.920]  to expand their shield process
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:19.920]  where they come and take quote healthy
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:21.920]  people away and put them in facilities
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:23.920]  for their safety this is nothing less than
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:25.920]  martial law and one big thing you can do
[3:18:25.920 --> 3:18:27.920]  to fight back is to get high quality
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:29.920]  Faraday cages many of which are made here

[3:19:59.920 --> 3:20:01.920]  of the New World Order
[3:20:01.920 --> 3:20:03.920]  it's Alex Jones
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:15.920]  alright welcome back, got my voice back
[3:20:15.920 --> 3:20:17.920]  I can't wait for this afternoon
[3:20:17.920 --> 3:20:19.920]  3 hours of radio
[3:20:19.920 --> 3:20:21.920]  I was going to make a point
[3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:23.920]  in the last segment I never did
[3:20:23.920 --> 3:20:25.920]  that because I've been around for
[3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:27.920]  40 years on TV
[3:20:27.920 --> 3:20:29.920]  literally TV and radio
[3:20:29.920 --> 3:20:31.920]  every time I make an appearance
[3:20:31.920 --> 3:20:33.920]  I know it's a popular show
[3:20:33.920 --> 3:20:35.920]  by how many people contact me
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:37.920]  on my cell phone text me friends
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:39.920]  you know not fans friends
[3:20:39.920 --> 3:20:41.920]  and say I'm watching you right now
[3:20:41.920 --> 3:20:43.920]  and years ago I used to be a lot on Fox News
[3:20:43.920 --> 3:20:45.920]  so I guess Fox News decided
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:47.920]  that I tell the truth too much
[3:20:47.920 --> 3:20:49.920]  I can't have me on anymore and that scares them
[3:20:49.920 --> 3:20:51.920]  and so
[3:20:51.920 --> 3:20:53.920]  when I was on Fox News I would have like
[3:20:53.920 --> 3:20:55.920]  20-25 people contact me
[3:20:55.920 --> 3:20:57.920]  after just a quick segment
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:20:59.920]  on Fox and Friends 25 people would contact me
[3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:01.920]  and say just saw you on Fox
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:03.920]  wow Wayne
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:05.920]  and I've tried a lot of things over the years
[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:07.920]  and never have I gotten
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:09.920]  that kind of response
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:11.920]  it does not sound like a lot but if
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:13.920]  20-25 friends contact you
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:15.920]  you know that's an example that millions
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:17.920]  are watching Fox News
[3:21:17.920 --> 3:21:19.920]  well the most response I ever
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:21.920]  get now of anything I do
[3:21:21.920 --> 3:21:23.920]  is the Alex Jones show every time I come on
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:25.920]  here I have 10, 20
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:27.920]  or more texts
[3:21:27.920 --> 3:21:29.920]  from friends saying
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:31.920]  holy crap I'm watching you now
[3:21:31.920 --> 3:21:33.920]  on the Alex Jones show I didn't
[3:21:33.920 --> 3:21:35.920]  even know that so many of my friends
[3:21:35.920 --> 3:21:37.920]  watch the Alex Jones show
[3:21:37.920 --> 3:21:39.920]  but the numbers are about the same
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:41.920]  as I used to get on Fox News
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:43.920]  so if 20 people contact
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:45.920]  me now and 20 people contact
[3:21:45.920 --> 3:21:47.920]  me in the Fox News days
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:49.920]  Fox always had 3 million watching
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:51.920]  I think Alex Jones has one heck of a
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:53.920]  popular show with millions
[3:21:53.920 --> 3:21:55.920]  online watching all across the world
[3:21:55.920 --> 3:21:57.920]  not just the United States so thank you
[3:21:57.920 --> 3:21:59.920]  for blessing me Alex with this platform
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.920]  so let me continue with my
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:03.920]  Joe Biden story I have a couple stories
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:05.920]  when we get back then I'm going to start to react
[3:22:05.920 --> 3:22:07.920]  with what I call my root reaction
[3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:09.920]  to all the biggest news stories in the news
[3:22:09.920 --> 3:22:11.920]  and the big one to me is still COVID
[3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:13.920]  vaccines and what it's doing to the
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:15.920]  American people which is killing them
[3:22:15.920 --> 3:22:17.920]  and injuring them but
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:19.920]  I told you why I think that
[3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:21.920]  Vladimir Putin is invading
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:23.920]  Ukraine and one of the reasons is to
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:25.920]  go after Biden's corruption
[3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:27.920]  and expose it to the world or
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:29.920]  use it to blackmail Biden
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:31.920]  and by the way who's already doing that China
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:33.920]  it's very clear
[3:22:33.920 --> 3:22:35.920]  I mean even Bill Maher on HBO
[3:22:35.920 --> 3:22:37.920]  will tell you
[3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:39.920]  that China owns Joe Biden
[3:22:39.920 --> 3:22:41.920]  there it is right there
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:43.920]  I guess that's the Russian bear owning Joe Biden
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:45.920]  but I think China
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:47.920]  owns Joe Biden right now
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:49.920]  and I think that Russia
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:51.920]  Vladimir Putin is very jealous
[3:22:51.920 --> 3:22:53.920]  he wants to own the nice little pet
[3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:55.920]  Joe Biden and pet him on the head
[3:22:55.920 --> 3:22:57.920]  and say good boy good boy
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:22:59.920]  he's like my dog Bubba good boy
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:01.920]  good boy whatever I want he Bubba does
[3:23:01.920 --> 3:23:03.920]  well that's what Putin wants
[3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:05.920]  Biden to do just like she
[3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:07.920]  in China has Biden doing right now
[3:23:07.920 --> 3:23:09.920]  his pet his little pet
[3:23:09.920 --> 3:23:11.920]  his pet puppy
[3:23:11.920 --> 3:23:13.920]  and Biden and the Biden White House
[3:23:13.920 --> 3:23:15.920]  are owned by China clearly
[3:23:15.920 --> 3:23:17.920]  so Putin wants to get in on the act
[3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:19.920]  one more thing that comes out of Ukraine
[3:23:19.920 --> 3:23:21.920]  China is watching
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:23.920]  what happens and how
[3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:25.920]  Joe Biden handles this situation
[3:23:25.920 --> 3:23:27.920]  and they already
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:29.920]  own him because I believe they're already blackmailing him
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:31.920]  because he did so many dirty things in China
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:33.920]  and every single bit of dirty corruption
[3:23:33.920 --> 3:23:35.920]  that Joe Biden did in China
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:37.920]  and his son Hunter did dirty things
[3:23:37.920 --> 3:23:39.920]  that have nothing to do with corruption
[3:23:39.920 --> 3:23:41.920]  they have to do with girls
[3:23:41.920 --> 3:23:43.920]  but the end result is
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:45.920]  that every dirty thing done under
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:47.920]  the Biden name in China
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:49.920]  they had videotape so they're blackmailing
[3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:51.920]  the whole Biden family
[3:23:51.920 --> 3:23:53.920]  with all the dirt and all the sex of Hunter
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:55.920]  and all the dirty things they did
[3:23:55.920 --> 3:23:57.920]  but I think they're watching to see how
[3:23:57.920 --> 3:23:59.920]  Joe Biden handles Ukraine
[3:23:59.920 --> 3:24:01.920]  and if it happens
[3:24:01.920 --> 3:24:03.920]  and plays out the way they believe it will
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:05.920]  Joe Biden will be powerless
[3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:07.920]  and Putin will make him look like a pipsqueak
[3:24:07.920 --> 3:24:09.920]  and America will look like a weakling
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:11.920]  then China will take Taiwan
[3:24:11.920 --> 3:24:13.920]  and it's going to happen
[3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:15.920]  and this is not something new I'm saying
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:17.920]  I've said this since the day
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:19.920]  Biden got in office was
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:21.920]  January 20, 2021
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:23.920]  I think it was January 20 that he swore in
[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:25.920]  put his hand on the Bible and swore in
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:27.920]  I said Taiwan's gone
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:29.920]  Taiwan is gone
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:31.920]  and sure enough Taiwan
[3:24:31.920 --> 3:24:33.920]  is going to be gone
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:35.920]  and here's a headline right now
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:37.920]  at Zero Hedge one of my favorite websites
[3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:39.920]  along with Info Wars
[3:24:39.920 --> 3:24:41.920]  and of course some of the other really good ones
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:43.920]  like the Gateway Pundit and Breitbart
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:45.920]  those are some of my favorites
[3:24:45.920 --> 3:24:47.920]  and my website rootforamerica.com
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:49.920]  those are the ones I check in on all day long
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:51.920]  and Zero Hedge is a great
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:53.920]  business site and they have great insights
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:55.920]  and the headline is
[3:24:55.920 --> 3:24:57.920]  China calls the United States
[3:24:57.920 --> 3:24:59.920]  a culprit for the Ukraine
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:01.920]  tensions and vows
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:03.920]  to eradicate
[3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:05.920]  Taiwan's secessionist regime
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:07.920]  they want to eradicate
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:09.920]  Taiwan's regime
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:11.920]  China
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:13.920]  I'm telling you is weeks away
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:15.920]  from taking over Taiwan
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:17.920]  now that could mean two weeks
[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:19.920]  it could mean 50 weeks a year for now
[3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:21.920]  but in the reasonable future
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:23.920]  China will take
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:25.920]  invade and take Taiwan
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:27.920]  just like they've taken Hong Kong
[3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:29.920]  without a shot being fired
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:31.920]  China now has totally taken over
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:33.920]  Hong Kong
[3:25:33.920 --> 3:25:35.920]  and there's only repression
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:37.920]  and there's no political freedom
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:39.920]  there's repression
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:41.920]  and there's persecution
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:43.920]  and there's banning and there's book burning
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:45.920]  all the things going on in Canada and America
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:47.920]  are going on at a much higher level
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:49.920]  because the Chinese take it to such extremes
[3:25:49.920 --> 3:25:51.920]  and send the Uggers
[3:25:51.920 --> 3:25:53.920]  the Muslims
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:55.920]  of China are sent to concentration camps
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:25:57.920]  and Canada does everything
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:25:59.920]  at a Nazi-like old Soviet-like level
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:01.920]  terrible
[3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:03.920]  so China is watching and they're going to take Taiwan
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:05.920]  as soon as we prove weak on Ukraine
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:07.920]  the other Joe Biden
[3:26:07.920 --> 3:26:09.920]  scandal that I want to break
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:11.920]  here on the Alex Jones show
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:13.920]  and I think I mentioned it
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:15.920]  the last time I was on Alex's show
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:17.920]  I mentioned it with his sentence or two
[3:26:17.920 --> 3:26:19.920]  but I want to explain it now
[3:26:19.920 --> 3:26:21.920]  and I explained it to President Trump
[3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:23.920]  when I had him on my show just a couple weeks ago
[3:26:23.920 --> 3:26:25.920]  and he said I can't wait to hear it
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:27.920]  please send me all the details
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:29.920]  as soon as you can and I'm compiling everything right now
[3:26:29.920 --> 3:26:31.920]  so a friend of mine
[3:26:31.920 --> 3:26:33.920]  is in the import-export business
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:35.920]  and he
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:37.920]  one of the things he imports
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:39.920]  is COVID antigen tests from China
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:41.920]  and he knows exactly
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:43.920]  what he pays from the same company
[3:26:43.920 --> 3:26:45.920]  that Joe Biden just bought his antigen test from
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:47.920]  same product
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:49.920]  same exact antigen test
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:51.920]  same exact company
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:53.920]  now this guy buys 100,000 at a time
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:55.920]  Joe Biden just bought I believe
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:26:57.920]  is 300 million
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:26:59.920]  300 million
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:01.920]  300 million COVID antigen test
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:03.920]  and it was published exactly
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:05.920]  what Joe Biden paid
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:07.920]  I think the number I don't have it in front of me
[3:27:07.920 --> 3:27:09.920]  but I've got all my notes and I've got all the newspaper articles
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:11.920]  and all the online articles
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:13.920]  he paid 1.3 billion
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:15.920]  and then he bought a second load
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:17.920]  and that was like another 500 million
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:19.920]  so all together he spent like
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:21.920]  1.8 1.9
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:23.920]  billion dollars on the COVID antigen test
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:25.920]  my buddy
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:27.920]  bought 100,000 now first of all
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:29.920]  common sense
[3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:31.920]  don't you think if you buy 100,000 the price will be higher
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:33.920]  than someone who buys 300 million
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:35.920]  plus once you get a better deal
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:37.920]  if you bought 300 million plus
[3:27:37.920 --> 3:27:39.920]  Joe Biden got a much worse deal
[3:27:39.920 --> 3:27:41.920]  and when you do the math
[3:27:41.920 --> 3:27:43.920]  my buddy paid a dollar a test
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:45.920]  Joe Biden and the American government paid
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:47.920]  I think was either four or five dollars a test
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:49.920]  he was grossly
[3:27:49.920 --> 3:27:51.920]  ripped off by China
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:53.920]  now the question is
[3:27:53.920 --> 3:27:55.920]  is Joe Biden so dumb
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:27:57.920]  and the Biden administration so dumb
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:27:59.920]  that they lost a billion dollars of taxpayer money
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:01.920]  and were a bunch of patsies
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:03.920]  and rubes and fools
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:05.920]  and Joe Biden's an incompetent old
[3:28:05.920 --> 3:28:07.920]  feeble puppet with dementia
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:09.920]  or did the Biden crime family
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:11.920]  grab a kickback
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:13.920]  of several hundred million dollars
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:15.920]  by overpaying China with American
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:17.920]  taxpayers money
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:19.920]  your money by about a billion dollars
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:21.920]  my guess is number two
[3:28:21.920 --> 3:28:23.920]  I believe there should be a massive
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:25.920]  DOJ investigation
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:27.920]  and the Biden crime family
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:29.920]  picked up several hundred million dollars
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:31.920]  in kickback slash bribes
[3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:33.920]  for overpaying with other people's money
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:35.920]  you
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:37.920]  the taxpayers money about
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:39.920]  a billion dollar ripoff
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:41.920]  it's a huge story
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:43.920]  and it's just a fact folks
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:45.920]  they allegedly
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:47.920]  but it's a fact what my friend pays
[3:28:47.920 --> 3:28:49.920]  a dollar a test
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:51.920]  it's a fact what Joe Biden paid
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:29:15.920]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:21.920]  but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:23.920]  now their whole project is falling apart
[3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:25.920]  because the people are aware
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:27.920]  that it is a
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:29.920]  world government corporate takeover
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:31.920]  and so it's pulling back the curtain
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:33.920]  now more than ever
[3:29:33.920 --> 3:29:35.920]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas
[3:29:35.920 --> 3:29:37.920]  are not going to give up on their takeover
[3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:39.920]  like Canada
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:41.920]  they've now declared a civil emergency
[3:29:41.920 --> 3:29:43.920]  in martial law in Ontario
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:45.920]  and other areas of the world
[3:29:45.920 --> 3:29:47.920]  are following suit like Australia
[3:29:47.920 --> 3:29:49.920]  so pray for these folks big time
[3:29:49.920 --> 3:29:51.920]  this is a very serious situation
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:53.920]  and stay tuned into infowars.com
[3:29:53.920 --> 3:29:55.920]  because truth is absolutely paramount
[3:29:55.920 --> 3:29:57.920]  with the world awakening
[3:29:57.920 --> 3:29:59.920]  I think it was important that we were on the momentum right now
[3:29:59.920 --> 3:30:01.920]  take advantage of this moment
[3:30:01.920 --> 3:30:03.920]  and I have an idea that something everybody can do
[3:30:03.920 --> 3:30:05.920]  with every listener can do
[3:30:05.920 --> 3:30:07.920]  I think it would be powerful and effective
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:09.920]  for us to hang the banners over the highway
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:11.920]  to imagine a champion
[3:30:11.920 --> 3:30:13.920]  Alex Jones is right
[3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:15.920]  infowars.com
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:17.920]  brother I'm so glad you called
[3:30:17.920 --> 3:30:19.920]  elaborate on this
[3:30:19.920 --> 3:30:21.920]  yes, now is the time in your small town
[3:30:21.920 --> 3:30:23.920]  or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall
[3:30:23.920 --> 3:30:25.920]  or to put a sticker on your car
[3:30:25.920 --> 3:30:27.920]  or banner hangs over highways
[3:30:27.920 --> 3:30:29.920]  and it will be a chain reaction
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:31.920]  what do you recommend people say on these banner hangs
[3:30:31.920 --> 3:30:33.920]  I have a few ideas
[3:30:33.920 --> 3:30:35.920]  first of all, Alex Jones is right
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:37.920]  you can't farm or rest out
[3:30:37.920 --> 3:30:39.920]  the vaccine is poison
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:41.920]  I said keep it short, keep it concise
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:43.920]  I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates
[3:30:43.920 --> 3:30:45.920]  the COVID-19 vaccine is poison
[3:30:45.920 --> 3:30:47.920]  beautiful, yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[3:30:47.920 --> 3:30:49.920]  that we could all be effective
[3:30:49.920 --> 3:30:51.920]  so that's what I'm calling about
[3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:53.920]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta I really, really appreciate
[3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:55.920]  you calling us today, thank you so much
[3:31:03.920 --> 3:31:05.920]  from the words of Chuck Pollanik's fight club

[3:31:35.920 --> 3:31:37.920]  children of history
[3:31:37.920 --> 3:31:39.920]  raised by television to believe
[3:31:39.920 --> 3:31:41.920]  that someday we'll be millionaires
[3:31:41.920 --> 3:31:43.920]  and movie stars
[3:31:43.920 --> 3:31:45.920]  but we won't
[3:31:45.920 --> 3:31:47.920]  and we're just learning this fact
[3:31:47.920 --> 3:31:49.920]  so don't f*** with us

[3:32:55.920 --> 3:32:57.920]  Leading a frontal assault
[3:32:57.920 --> 3:32:59.920]  on the lies of the New World Order
[3:32:59.920 --> 3:33:01.920]  it's Alex Jones
[3:33:11.920 --> 3:33:13.920]  All right, Wayne Alleroots, welcome back
[3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:15.920]  I'm the guest host for this hour
[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:17.920]  of the Alex Jones show
[3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:19.920]  we'll be doing this on a regular basis
[3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:21.920]  between 12 to 1 p.m. west coast time
[3:33:21.920 --> 3:33:23.920]  so that's 3 to 4 p.m.
[3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:25.920]  east coast time
[3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:27.920]  we'll be trying to do this on a very regular basis
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:29.920]  Wayne Alleroots with this hour
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:31.920]  as the guest host for my great friend Alex Jones
[3:33:31.920 --> 3:33:33.920]  he does a great job
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:35.920]  and I think
[3:33:35.920 --> 3:33:37.920]  I'm going to read his mind now
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:39.920]  I think he does this for the same reason
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:41.920]  that I often have guest hosts on my national radio show
[3:33:41.920 --> 3:33:43.920]  because the stress on our minds
[3:33:43.920 --> 3:33:45.920]  our bodies and our voices
[3:33:45.920 --> 3:33:47.920]  you hear my voice very jagged
[3:33:47.920 --> 3:33:49.920]  very rough
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:51.920]  of course
[3:33:51.920 --> 3:33:53.920]  the stress is enormous
[3:33:53.920 --> 3:33:55.920]  I do this all day long
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:33:57.920]  some days
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:33:59.920]  not only my 3 hours on radio
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:01.920]  and an hour on TV
[3:34:01.920 --> 3:34:03.920]  with Alex Jones
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:05.920]  actually 90 minutes today
[3:34:05.920 --> 3:34:07.920]  first a guest of Alex Jones and then hosting
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:09.920]  but some days I'm also doing 8 or 10
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:11.920]  radio interviews
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:13.920]  and then I'm the CEO of multiple companies
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:15.920]  in multiple meetings
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:17.920]  with my father and a husband
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:19.920]  and 4 kids and crazy life
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:21.920]  so you need a break once in a while
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:23.920]  so I hope I can make your life just a little bit easier
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:25.920]  Alex Jones, good man
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:27.920]  my website again
[3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:29.920]  I'm Wayne Allen Root
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:31.920]  my website's rootforamerica.com
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:33.920]  there it is up on the screen
[3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:35.920]  rootforamerica.com
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:37.920]  and you can find all my information there
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:39.920]  and you can connect to my daily
[3:34:39.920 --> 3:34:41.920]  national radio show there
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:43.920]  and my e-mails
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:45.920]  love to hear from you
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:47.920]  alright
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:49.920]  some of the stories I want to get into
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:34:51.920]  this is what I call my root reaction
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:53.920]  where I get to react to some of the stories in the news
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:55.920]  and tell you what I think of them
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:34:57.920]  I don't know if you noticed but Bill Maher
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:34:59.920]  and I was a guest many times on Bill Maher's shows
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:01.920]  and I'm hoping to be on Bill Maher's show again
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:03.920]  in the very near future
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:05.920]  talking to them about it
[3:35:05.920 --> 3:35:07.920]  Bill Maher lately has sounded like a raving conservative
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:09.920]  and I'm sure that scares the heck out of his
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:11.920]  you know communist
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:13.920]  progressive socialist handlers
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:15.920]  at HBO and in Hollywood
[3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:17.920]  you know if he's not careful to get a show
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:19.920]  canceled he better be careful
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:21.920]  because he's starting to bite back
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:23.920]  at the liberals he sounds a lot like Joe Rogan
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:25.920]  Joe Rogan started out
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:27.920]  as kind of liberal he said he was a
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:29.920]  Bernie Sanders guy
[3:35:29.920 --> 3:35:31.920]  back in 2016
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:33.920]  you don't get more liberal than that I don't even know if Joe realizes
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:35.920]  he may have liked some of the things
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:37.920]  Bernie Sanders said but I don't know if Joe Rogan realizes
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:39.920]  that in 2016
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:41.920]  I analyzed the voting record
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:43.920]  of the United States Senate
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:45.920]  and Bernie Sanders was the
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:47.920]  single most liberal voting record
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:49.920]  in the entire United States Senate
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:51.920]  filled with horrible liberals
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:53.920]  he was the liberal of all liberals of all liberals
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:55.920]  so I mean he is socialist
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:35:57.920]  but I do admit that Bernie
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:35:59.920]  had an appeal back in 2016
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:01.920]  despite his socialism
[3:36:01.920 --> 3:36:03.920]  to the average guy or gal on the street
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:05.920]  and I think Joe Rogan
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:07.920]  who I like a lot by the way
[3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:09.920]  felt that appeal and thought
[3:36:09.920 --> 3:36:11.920]  hey the two party system sucks
[3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:13.920]  both parties suck
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:15.920]  Trump was unproven to him
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:17.920]  so let me go with a Bernie Sanders
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:19.920]  okay fine you're a lot of mulligan
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:21.920]  but Joe Rogan has made this amazing
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:23.920]  metamorphosis
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:25.920]  over the last few years
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:27.920]  and he's gone like a butterfly does
[3:36:27.920 --> 3:36:29.920]  he's turned into this beautiful butterfly
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:31.920]  Joe Rogan is now a very
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:33.920]  conservative guy on topics
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:35.920]  that are near and dear to my heart including
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:37.920]  the vaccine mandate
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:39.920]  and including the feeble dementia laden
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:41.920]  condition of Joe Biden
[3:36:41.920 --> 3:36:43.920]  Joe Rogan understands all that
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:45.920]  he's become very conservative
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:47.920]  I think he's seen the light
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:49.920]  he may not want to admit he's a conservative republican
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:51.920]  but he certainly has seen the light
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:53.920]  and I think he does admit Joe Rogan
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:55.920]  that he's a libertarian and I was the libertarian
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:36:57.920]  vice presidential nominee in 2008
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:36:59.920]  on the libertarian presidential ticket
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:01.920]  so Joe Rogan and I have started to become
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:03.920]  simpatico and I like him a lot
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:05.920]  Bill Maher is starting to go down that road
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:07.920]  of Joe Rogan
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:09.920]  from liberal
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:11.920]  and liking a Bernie Sanders
[3:37:11.920 --> 3:37:13.920]  to sounding more and more like Wayne Allyn Root
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:15.920]  and so Bill Maher said the other day
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:17.920]  that companies and celebrities
[3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:19.920]  have decided to be just a little bit
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:21.920]  evil on China
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:23.920]  and become their bitch
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:25.920]  that was a quote
[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:27.920]  direct quote from Bill Maher
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:29.920]  they've become the bitch of China
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:31.920]  that's what Joe Biden is by the way
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:33.920]  Russia
[3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:35.920]  but there it is
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:37.920]  I love this to work with this crack team
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:39.920]  look at that right away they get it up on the screen
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:41.920]  you guys are great kudos bravo
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:43.920]  Wayne Greer loves you thank you
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:45.920]  so
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:47.920]  Bill Maher is starting to sound like he's seen the light
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:49.920]  and he understands
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:51.920]  and you know what I think of right away
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:53.920]  it's every American corporation
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:55.920]  but it's the NBA
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:57.920]  and it's the NFL I think of right away
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:37:59.920]  they've all sold out to China
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:01.920]  and if China could make them
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:03.920]  an extra billion dollars
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:05.920]  or two billion or four billion
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:07.920]  or ten billion they're willing to
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:09.920]  look the other way
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:11.920]  while China murders people
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:13.920]  and sends them to hard labor camps
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:15.920]  and concentration camps
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:17.920]  and how about this one
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  sends COVID to the world
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:21.920]  and kills millions
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:23.920]  and millions of people
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:25.920]  do you not believe that China
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:27.920]  sent COVID to the United States
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:29.920]  I'll bet you every person watching right now
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:31.920]  agrees with me
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:33.920]  that China sent COVID
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:35.920]  to destroy us
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:37.920]  and to destroy their nemesis
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:39.920]  Donald J. Trump and make sure the American economy
[3:38:39.920 --> 3:38:41.920]  was destroyed and millions are out of work
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:43.920]  and millions were sick
[3:38:43.920 --> 3:38:45.920]  and Trump would get all the blame
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:47.920]  and Trump wouldn't be reelected
[3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:49.920]  because he had his boot on China's neck
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:51.920]  China was screwed
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:53.920]  we were destroying China
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:55.920]  Trump was giving China the middle finger
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:38:57.920]  and it was all over for China
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:38:59.920]  and China suddenly
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:01.920]  sent our way
[3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:03.920]  there's Dr. Fauci in red
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:05.920]  because he's obviously owned by China as well
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:07.920]  what a disgusting man
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:09.920]  remember that movie with Dr. Evil
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:11.920]  Fauci is the Dr. Evil
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  and in the end
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:15.920]  I think someday if we ever have a fair press
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:17.920]  and a fair justice system
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:19.920]  he will be charged with mass murder
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:21.920]  whether it's on the strong scale
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:23.920]  that he woke up one day and said
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:25.920]  let's get rich with big pharma
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:27.920]  and let's push the vaccine
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:29.920]  and let's hide any of the negative side effects
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:31.920]  of the vaccine
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:33.920]  and let's convince people
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:35.920]  to give it to their little children
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:37.920]  and when they all die
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:39.920]  murder
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:41.920]  I don't care if you blame them for mass murder
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:43.920]  or it's manslaughter
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:45.920]  and it's a contributing factor
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:47.920]  it's murder, he's Dr. Evil
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:49.920]  but China is the one
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:51.920]  that sent COVID our way
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:53.920]  and he's in bed with China
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:55.920]  so there you have it
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:39:57.920]  so that's the first story
[3:39:57.920 --> 3:39:59.920]  was Bill Maar admitting
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:01.920]  that there are celebrities out there
[3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:03.920]  and there's the NBA and the NFL
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:05.920]  and all the sports leagues
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:07.920]  and all the companies that want to make billions
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:09.920]  are screwing over America
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:11.920]  and you and me
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:13.920]  and taking the side of China
[3:40:13.920 --> 3:40:15.920]  and then there's this story I told you
[3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:17.920]  that I would talk to you about
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:19.920]  cover of today's Wall Street Journal
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:21.920]  when COVID-19 deaths hit
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:23.920]  life insurers
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:25.920]  companies believe lack of medical
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:27.920]  treatments during the pandemic
[3:40:27.920 --> 3:40:29.920]  has contributed to deaths from other
[3:40:29.920 --> 3:40:31.920]  causes, they don't mention the
[3:40:31.920 --> 3:40:33.920]  vaccine, of course not
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:35.920]  the Wall Street Journal is Rhino
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:37.920]  Republican name only
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:39.920]  the Wall Street Journal is pro-corporatist
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:41.920]  the Wall Street Journal is in bed
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:43.920]  with Big Pharma
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:45.920]  the Wall Street Journal gets lots of money
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:47.920]  from Big Pharma
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:49.920]  but this is the first crack
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:51.920]  the first hole in the dam
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:40:53.920]  you know
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:55.920]  they're trying their best to keep their finger in the dam
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:57.920]  and stop the water from coming out
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:40:59.920]  but all the people in Big Pharma
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:01.920]  and the vaccine manufacturers
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:03.920]  and everybody making money on it
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:05.920]  they're all getting rich on the vaccines
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:07.920]  that are killing people
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:09.920]  and they can't admit to you
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:11.920]  that the vaccines are killing people
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:13.920]  but all the insurance companies are now coming out
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:15.920]  and they're admitting that death rates are up
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:17.920]  40%
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:19.920]  across the board
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:21.920]  non-COVID deaths
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:23.920]  these are not COVID deaths
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:25.920]  these are non-COVID deaths
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:27.920]  heart attacks, strokes, blood clots
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:29.920]  multi-organ failure and get this
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:31.920]  massive increase
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:33.920]  in cancer all over people's bodies
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:35.920]  people who have beaten cancer
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:37.920]  and people who have never had cancer
[3:41:37.920 --> 3:41:39.920]  suddenly have cancer everywhere in their body
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:41.920]  after they've been vaccinated
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:43.920]  specifically after they've been boosted
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:41:45.920]  that booster
[3:41:45.920 --> 3:41:47.920]  is horrible
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:49.920]  and they're trying to convince you to take it
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:51.920]  by blacking out all the facts
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:53.920]  and all the truth
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:55.920]  in the VAERS report
[3:41:55.920 --> 3:41:57.920]  and in reports all around the world
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:41:59.920]  hospitals
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:01.920]  and funeral directors and life insurance companies
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:03.920]  that deaths are skyrocketing
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:05.920]  people are dropping dead
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:07.920]  left and right
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:09.920]  and celebrities are dropping dead
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:11.920]  left and right
[3:42:11.920 --> 3:42:13.920]  40 seconds or so
[3:42:13.920 --> 3:42:15.920]  40 seconds
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:17.920]  I want to read you
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:19.920]  underneath the picture on the cover of the Wall Street Journal
[3:42:19.920 --> 3:42:21.920]  it says
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:23.920]  among other insurance executives
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:25.920]  Hartford financial CEO
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:27.920]  Christopher Swift has noted an outsized
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:29.920]  number of benefit claims
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:31.920]  for non-COVID-19
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:33.920]  specific deaths
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:35.920]  so what they are admitting is
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:37.920]  separate from COVID
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:39.920]  there's an avalanche of deaths
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:41.920]  in states and around the world
[3:42:41.920 --> 3:42:43.920]  and by the way
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:45.920]  it's only people in the working ages
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:47.920]  between 18 and 65
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:42:49.920]  because the corporations
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:51.920]  and Biden mandated
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:43:11.920]  the vaccine.

[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:42.920]  on my phone right now the UK Daily Mail
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:44.920]  and it says breaking news
[3:48:44.920 --> 3:48:46.920]  two prosecutors
[3:48:46.920 --> 3:48:48.920]  leading the Manhattan criminal probe into Donald Trump
[3:48:48.920 --> 3:48:50.920]  resigned
[3:48:50.920 --> 3:48:52.920]  after new DA Alvin Bragg
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:54.920]  raises serious doubts
[3:48:54.920 --> 3:48:56.920]  about the case
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:48:58.920]  the probe grinds to a halt
[3:48:58.920 --> 3:49:00.920]  with no witnesses question for a month
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:02.920]  and I bring it up because I love President Trump
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:04.920]  I'm a fan of President Trump
[3:49:04.920 --> 3:49:06.920]  we disagree on one issue
[3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:08.920]  all of you know that the vaccine
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:10.920]  I'm about as anti-vaccine
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:12.920]  is anyone in America
[3:49:12.920 --> 3:49:14.920]  and I've been on the case about what a death jab this is
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:16.920]  since literally the first moment
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:18.920]  a year and a quarter ago
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:20.920]  so we disagree on that issue
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:22.920]  but putting that aside
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:24.920]  we agree on everything else in life
[3:49:24.920 --> 3:49:26.920]  and I know that this has been a witch hunt against my dear friend
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:28.920]  President Donald J Trump
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:30.920]  and it's disgusting what they've done to him
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:32.920]  and they've tried to destroy every business he's in
[3:49:32.920 --> 3:49:34.920]  and destroy his name
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:36.920]  and destroy his family
[3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:38.920]  and I'm so happy to see that
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:40.920]  he's been the most vicious
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:42.920]  disgusting people ever and those of you
[3:49:42.920 --> 3:49:44.920]  who because of the vaccine or whatever
[3:49:44.920 --> 3:49:46.920]  you don't think Trump didn't do enough
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:48.920]  Trump did everything
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:50.920]  a human being could do
[3:49:50.920 --> 3:49:52.920]  in four years in office
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:54.920]  being haunted, being witch hunted
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:56.920]  being attacked by everyone
[3:49:56.920 --> 3:49:58.920]  by the right, by the left
[3:49:58.920 --> 3:50:00.920]  by republicans, by democrats
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:02.920]  by senators, by congressmen, by governors
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:04.920]  nobody was on Trump's side
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:06.920]  he was a one man army
[3:50:06.920 --> 3:50:08.920]  a wrecking crew
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:10.920]  and he did everything
[3:50:10.920 --> 3:50:12.920]  or I like to call him a bull in a china shop
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:14.920]  and we have a lot in common by the way
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:16.920]  and he did everything a human being could do
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:18.920]  with the entire government
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:20.920]  and every government agency
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:22.920]  that was under him
[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:24.920]  out to destroy him and his family
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:26.920]  it was just incredible
[3:50:26.920 --> 3:50:28.920]  what they did and they fixed the election
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:30.920]  and eventually kicked him out because they were so scared
[3:50:30.920 --> 3:50:32.920]  of what he'd do in the next four years
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:34.920]  don't forget
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:36.920]  that when the White House was under siege
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:38.920]  at one point by Black Lives Matter
[3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:40.920]  and Antifa
[3:50:40.920 --> 3:50:42.920]  Trump had
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:44.920]  law enforcement people and generals
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:46.920]  lying to him and telling him
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:48.920]  he couldn't do what he could do
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:50.920]  and telling him the crowd wasn't as bad as he thought it was
[3:50:50.920 --> 3:50:52.920]  and they lied to him
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:50:54.920]  just every kid a general Millie
[3:50:54.920 --> 3:50:56.920]  who went to China
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:50:58.920]  and behind our backs as a trader
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:00.920]  told him I hate this guy Trump
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:02.920]  and if he attacks you I'll give you an advance warning
[3:51:02.920 --> 3:51:04.920]  Millie should be in Cuba
[3:51:04.920 --> 3:51:06.920]  Guantanamo
[3:51:06.920 --> 3:51:08.920]  on trial for treason
[3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:10.920]  and if found guilty
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:12.920]  life in prisoner death penalty for treason
[3:51:12.920 --> 3:51:14.920]  let alone by a general
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:16.920]  who's the chief of staff, the number one general
[3:51:16.920 --> 3:51:18.920]  in the United States of America
[3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:20.920]  committed treason against the United States
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:22.920]  and against Donald Trump
[3:51:22.920 --> 3:51:24.920]  so it's so disgusting
[3:51:24.920 --> 3:51:26.920]  what Trump had to put up with
[3:51:26.920 --> 3:51:28.920]  so yes he wasn't perfect
[3:51:28.920 --> 3:51:30.920]  he isn't perfect
[3:51:30.920 --> 3:51:32.920]  I would have done differently or better
[3:51:32.920 --> 3:51:34.920]  but it doesn't matter
[3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:36.920]  you don't know the pressure he was under
[3:51:36.920 --> 3:51:38.920]  you don't know what was happening
[3:51:38.920 --> 3:51:40.920]  you don't know, understand
[3:51:40.920 --> 3:51:42.920]  how destructive the left is
[3:51:42.920 --> 3:51:44.920]  and what they did to him and what they said about him
[3:51:44.920 --> 3:51:46.920]  and how many death threats there were
[3:51:46.920 --> 3:51:48.920]  and how many people wanted to murder that poor man
[3:51:48.920 --> 3:51:50.920]  and his family, incredible
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:52.920]  I will always love and appreciate
[3:51:52.920 --> 3:51:54.920]  President Donald Trump and there's another example
[3:51:54.920 --> 3:51:56.920]  of what's happening
[3:51:56.920 --> 3:51:58.920]  they tried another witch hunt
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:00.920]  who got nothing
[3:52:00.920 --> 3:52:02.920]  nothing
[3:52:02.920 --> 3:52:04.920]  onto COVID
[3:52:04.920 --> 3:52:06.920]  which is the one area I disagree with Trump
[3:52:06.920 --> 3:52:08.920]  but you know, he's coming around
[3:52:08.920 --> 3:52:10.920]  you heard Alex open my appearance
[3:52:10.920 --> 3:52:12.920]  in the last hour
[3:52:12.920 --> 3:52:14.920]  of his show, I was a guest on his show
[3:52:14.920 --> 3:52:16.920]  by saying Wayne Root, he knows for a fact
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:18.920]  from insiders at Mar-a-Lago
[3:52:18.920 --> 3:52:20.920]  that Wayne Root had an effect on President Trump
[3:52:20.920 --> 3:52:22.920]  I said you can't discuss
[3:52:22.920 --> 3:52:24.920]  how great the vaccine is ever again
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:26.920]  just discuss how bad the vaccine mandate is
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:28.920]  and ever since then that's exactly
[3:52:28.920 --> 3:52:30.920]  what President Trump did
[3:52:30.920 --> 3:52:32.920]  so, I'm a fan
[3:52:32.920 --> 3:52:34.920]  I'm a big fan
[3:52:34.920 --> 3:52:36.920]  he's not perfect and we can't agree on everything
[3:52:36.920 --> 3:52:38.920]  but the Fire Department of New York
[3:52:38.920 --> 3:52:40.920]  FDNY
[3:52:40.920 --> 3:52:42.920]  Union Head of the FDNY
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:44.920]  seeks investigation into
[3:52:44.920 --> 3:52:46.920]  recent fire department deaths
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:48.920]  from COVID jabs
[3:52:48.920 --> 3:52:50.920]  three people have died
[3:52:50.920 --> 3:52:52.920]  two of them in their early 30s
[3:52:52.920 --> 3:52:54.920]  firemen and one of them in his early
[3:52:54.920 --> 3:52:56.920]  50s
[3:52:56.920 --> 3:52:58.920]  dropped dead for no reason
[3:52:58.920 --> 3:53:00.920]  in the middle of training
[3:53:00.920 --> 3:53:02.920]  and it just doesn't happen
[3:53:02.920 --> 3:53:04.920]  30 year old firemen don't drop
[3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:06.920]  dead in the middle of training
[3:53:06.920 --> 3:53:08.920]  and soccer stars don't drop
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:10.920]  dead on soccer fields
[3:53:10.920 --> 3:53:12.920]  what's happening across this country
[3:53:12.920 --> 3:53:14.920]  is insanity and across this world
[3:53:14.920 --> 3:53:16.920]  insanity
[3:53:16.920 --> 3:53:18.920]  that no one is willing to say out loud
[3:53:18.920 --> 3:53:20.920]  is this from the vaccine
[3:53:20.920 --> 3:53:22.920]  all these people
[3:53:22.920 --> 3:53:24.920]  dropping dead
[3:53:24.920 --> 3:53:26.920]  all these insurance deaths
[3:53:26.920 --> 3:53:28.920]  there you see on the screen
[3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:30.920]  soccer players just dropping
[3:53:30.920 --> 3:53:32.920]  dead
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:34.920]  no one's ever seen anything like this
[3:53:34.920 --> 3:53:36.920]  look at this world
[3:53:36.920 --> 3:53:38.920]  class athletes in the prime
[3:53:38.920 --> 3:53:40.920]  of their lives in their youth
[3:53:40.920 --> 3:53:42.920]  dropping over heart attacks
[3:53:42.920 --> 3:53:44.920]  cardiac arrest
[3:53:44.920 --> 3:53:46.920]  and death
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:48.920]  happening left and right
[3:53:48.920 --> 3:53:50.920]  same thing with airline pilots
[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:52.920]  they're having quite a few medical emergencies
[3:53:52.920 --> 3:53:54.920]  with airline pilots
[3:53:54.920 --> 3:53:56.920]  who are all forced to take the jab
[3:53:56.920 --> 3:53:58.920]  it's the same reason
[3:53:58.920 --> 3:54:00.920]  that the life insurance companies
[3:54:00.920 --> 3:54:02.920]  are saying there's all this death
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:04.920]  that they've never seen before
[3:54:04.920 --> 3:54:06.920]  because people are dropping dead
[3:54:06.920 --> 3:54:08.920]  and they all just happen to be
[3:54:08.920 --> 3:54:10.920]  between 18 and 65
[3:54:10.920 --> 3:54:12.920]  and that effect I heard the biggest numbers
[3:54:12.920 --> 3:54:14.920]  are between 18 and 45
[3:54:14.920 --> 3:54:16.920]  because they were
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:18.920]  forced to take the jab
[3:54:18.920 --> 3:54:20.920]  at their corporation
[3:54:20.920 --> 3:54:22.920]  because of Biden's
[3:54:22.920 --> 3:54:24.920]  corporate mandate through OSHA
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:26.920]  okay and they're all paying
[3:54:26.920 --> 3:54:28.920]  the price disgusting
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:30.920]  disgusting so now the fire department
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:32.920]  of New York union head
[3:54:32.920 --> 3:54:34.920]  seeks an investigation into recent department deaths
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:36.920]  and he says is it
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:38.920]  he's not saying it is the COVID jab
[3:54:38.920 --> 3:54:40.920]  he's asking is it
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:42.920]  the COVID jab
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:44.920]  shouldn't we all be asking
[3:54:44.920 --> 3:54:46.920]  the question
[3:54:46.920 --> 3:54:48.920]  here's another story about autopsies
[3:54:48.920 --> 3:54:50.920]  confirm COVID vaccine
[3:54:50.920 --> 3:54:52.920]  induced deaths
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:54.920]  you never know
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:54:56.920]  why someone drops dead
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:54:58.920]  unless you do an autopsy
[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:00.920]  and there are very few autopsies being done
[3:55:00.920 --> 3:55:02.920]  because they don't want them done
[3:55:02.920 --> 3:55:04.920]  the few autopsies that have been absolutely
[3:55:04.920 --> 3:55:06.920]  demanded and done
[3:55:06.920 --> 3:55:08.920]  and I'd assume perhaps
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:10.920]  the relatives or the spouse of the people who die
[3:55:10.920 --> 3:55:12.920]  pay for it
[3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:14.920]  to force it to be done
[3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:16.920]  they don't want you having an autopsy
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:18.920]  especially if you're 25 years old
[3:55:18.920 --> 3:55:20.920]  and you drop dead of a heart attack
[3:55:20.920 --> 3:55:22.920]  they don't want an autopsy
[3:55:22.920 --> 3:55:24.920]  the autopsies that have been done here
[3:55:24.920 --> 3:55:26.920]  and in Germany it can't be a coincidence
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:28.920]  almost every single person
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:30.920]  that they check
[3:55:30.920 --> 3:55:32.920]  their body is filled with blood clots
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:34.920]  their blood is like cement
[3:55:34.920 --> 3:55:36.920]  their organs have hardened
[3:55:36.920 --> 3:55:38.920]  since they got the vaccine
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:40.920]  it is vaccine induced aids
[3:55:40.920 --> 3:55:42.920]  for all intents and purposes
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:44.920]  it is causing their bodies
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:46.920]  to block
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:48.920]  the blockages are thick
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:50.920]  the blockages are scary
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:52.920]  and it causes heart attacks and strokes
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:55:54.920]  and all kinds of horrible problems
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:55:58.920]  and their bodies are filled with it
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:00.920]  and there was one group that did 15 autopsies
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:02.920]  and all 15, not one of them
[3:56:02.920 --> 3:56:04.920]  was classified as having anything
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:06.920]  to do with the vaccine
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:08.920]  and when they got into the autopsy
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:10.920]  14 out of the 15
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:12.920]  deaths were directly related
[3:56:12.920 --> 3:56:14.920]  to the vaccine
[3:56:14.920 --> 3:56:16.920]  alright, I've talked about the vaccine
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:18.920]  enough in the time I've left
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:20.920]  what do I have left, a minute, two minutes
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:22.920]  what's left?
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:24.920]  about a minute 20
[3:56:24.920 --> 3:56:26.920]  alright, I just want to mention
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:28.920]  Senator Shelby of Alabama
[3:56:28.920 --> 3:56:30.920]  by the way was kind of a rhino
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:32.920]  but it doesn't mean he doesn't have good things to say
[3:56:32.920 --> 3:56:34.920]  from time to time
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:36.920]  he admitted in the last few days
[3:56:36.920 --> 3:56:38.920]  that 42% of the babies
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:40.920]  born in America
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:42.920]  are on Medicaid
[3:56:42.920 --> 3:56:44.920]  in other words, the mom is on Medicaid
[3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:46.920]  42%
[3:56:46.920 --> 3:56:48.920]  of the babies now born in America
[3:56:48.920 --> 3:56:50.920]  Medicaid
[3:56:50.920 --> 3:56:52.920]  my parents taught me I'd rather die
[3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:54.920]  than accept welfare from the government
[3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:56.920]  and now 42%
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:56:58.920]  of the babies born
[3:56:58.920 --> 3:57:00.920]  are born to probably almost all single mothers
[3:57:00.920 --> 3:57:02.920]  who are on Medicaid
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:04.920]  and there you have it, that's why people still vote Democrat
[3:57:04.920 --> 3:57:06.920]  they are bribed
[3:57:06.920 --> 3:57:08.920]  by government
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:10.920]  with welfare checks and Medicaid checks
[3:57:10.920 --> 3:57:12.920]  and then one more stat before we go
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:14.920]  illegal immigration
[3:57:14.920 --> 3:57:16.920]  fuels record 46 million
[3:57:16.920 --> 3:57:18.920]  foreign born people in the United States
[3:57:18.920 --> 3:57:20.920]  so it's a combination of filling this country
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:22.920]  with open borders with millions of new immigrants
[3:57:22.920 --> 3:57:24.920]  and they all want welfare
[3:57:24.920 --> 3:57:26.920]  and their babies are all born on Medicaid
[3:57:26.920 --> 3:57:28.920]  and they'll all vote reliably and loyally Democrat
[3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:30.920]  for the rest of all
[3:57:30.920 --> 3:57:32.920]  time because they want the checks
[3:57:32.920 --> 3:57:34.920]  to keep coming, there you have it
[3:57:34.920 --> 3:57:36.920]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root, WayneRootedGmail.com
[3:57:36.920 --> 3:57:38.920]  my website RootForAmerican.com
[3:57:38.920 --> 3:57:40.920]  my book, The Great Patriot Protest
[3:57:40.920 --> 3:57:42.920]  and boycott book, thank you for letting me host
[3:57:42.920 --> 3:58:06.920]  this hour, bro.
[3:58:12.920 --> 3:58:14.920]  the only tri iodine
[3:58:14.920 --> 3:58:16.920]  on the market, highest grade
[3:58:16.920 --> 3:58:18.920]  is now exclusively available again

[3:58:21.920 --> 3:58:23.920]  if you've not experienced clean, pure iodine
[3:58:23.920 --> 3:58:25.880]  what it does for your body
[3:58:25.880 --> 3:58:27.880]  it takes about two weeks to get on average
[3:58:27.880 --> 3:58:29.880]  you really need to experience X3
[3:58:29.880 --> 3:58:31.880]  those of you that have tried it and used it
[3:58:31.880 --> 3:58:33.880]  I know you're going to be reordering it
[3:58:33.880 --> 3:58:35.880]  but particularly those that have never tried the product
[3:58:35.880 --> 3:58:37.880]  you need it because it's amazing what it does
[3:58:37.880 --> 3:58:39.880]  for your body, it's a good halogen
[3:58:39.880 --> 3:58:41.880]  it's not the bad halogen and it funds the info war
[3:58:41.880 --> 3:58:46.600]  360 win so again x3 back at stock 50% off our limited time I
[3:58:47.560 --> 3:58:52.480]  Have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul. I've ever had in my
[3:58:53.160 --> 3:58:55.640]  47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of lost
[3:58:56.560 --> 3:58:58.160]  everybody else has
[3:58:58.160 --> 3:58:59.760]  and it's because
[3:58:59.760 --> 3:59:02.560]  It's a loss of ancestral
[3:59:04.320 --> 3:59:09.960]  Freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[3:59:09.960 --> 3:59:11.480]  and
[3:59:11.480 --> 3:59:13.480]  Now we're just thrown it all away
[3:59:14.840 --> 3:59:20.920]  I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled
[3:59:22.360 --> 3:59:23.480]  20
[3:59:23.480 --> 3:59:28.440]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist maker under and it's so incredibly sad, but
[3:59:28.880 --> 3:59:30.880]  this is the process of
[3:59:31.120 --> 3:59:33.360]  birth and then growth and then
[3:59:34.080 --> 3:59:38.040]  Falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again
[3:59:38.040 --> 3:59:43.960]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse
[3:59:44.480 --> 3:59:46.480]  to actually end the species
[3:59:46.480 --> 4:00:03.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
