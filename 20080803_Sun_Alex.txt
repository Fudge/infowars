[00:00.000 --> 00:04.240]  The officials say a truck bomb exploded during rush hour today on a busy commercial street
[00:04.240 --> 00:05.640]  to northern Baghdad.
[00:05.640 --> 00:09.400]  At least 12 people are reported dead, dozens are wounded.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.400]  Here's Kim Gamal.
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.520]  The attack occurred just hours before the Iraqi parliament planned to convene a special
[00:15.520 --> 00:21.160]  session in debt-diffusing tension over Kurdish names to incorporate a northern city in an
[00:21.160 --> 00:24.400]  oil-rich area into their autonomous region.
[00:24.400 --> 00:26.680]  There's a major heat wave at the southern plains.
[00:26.680 --> 00:31.920]  Heat advisories are posted from Nebraska to Texas and as far east as Tennessee.
[00:31.920 --> 00:35.080]  Temperatures are expected to be in the triple digits in many areas.
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.600]  In Dallas County, Texas, officials report three heat-related deaths.
[00:39.600 --> 00:41.880]  Mike Eckert is with the National Weather Service.
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.560]  The actual temperatures are going to be in the low 100s.
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.000]  You combine that with the high relative humidity and we're going to see effective temperatures
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  between 105 and 110.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.800]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.880]  Thousands of people across the country are now living at the office and it's partly
[00:57.880 --> 00:58.880]  my fault.
[00:58.880 --> 00:59.880]  Hi.
[00:59.880 --> 01:00.880]  How in the world are you anyway?
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.240]  I'm Andy Willoughby with the Three-Step Plan Home Business System.
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.520]  Yes, I'm guilty.
[01:05.520 --> 01:08.040]  I have lots of people living at the office.
[01:08.040 --> 01:10.520]  Well, they're not really living at the office.
[01:10.520 --> 01:13.440]  They office where they live and there's a big difference.
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.640]  They get to spend more time with their families.
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.480]  They're not fighting traffic or spending lots of money on gas.
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.520]  They don't put up with a cranky boss or depressed co-workers and many of them are making more
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.240]  money than ever before with their own home business.
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.200]  For information, go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.

[01:53.640 --> 01:58.160]  The Olympic Security Chief says protesters who want to speak out against the Beijing
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.200]  Games are required to apply five days in advance and not harm national interests.
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.800]  China says it will allow officially approved demonstrations at three parks in the capital.
[02:09.800 --> 02:14.760]  Meanwhile, International Olympic Committee President Zock Rogat says media will have the
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.080]  fullest access possible to report on the Games.
[02:18.080 --> 02:24.360]  I'm adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions.
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.640]  Al Qaeda is confirming the death a senior commander known as a top explosives and poisons
[02:29.640 --> 02:30.640]  expert.
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.320]  A statement on their terror group's website says Abu Habab Masri and three other commanders
[02:36.320 --> 02:37.320]  have been killed.
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.280]  They are believed to have died in a U.S. airstrike in Pakistan last week.

[02:51.720 --> 02:57.520]  Did you know the average household owes over 25,000 in credit card debt and 65% of those
[02:57.520 --> 02:59.680]  households can only afford the minimum monthly payments?
[02:59.680 --> 03:00.680]  Are you in a debt trap?
[03:00.680 --> 03:01.680]  You can't get out of.
[03:01.680 --> 03:02.680]  I can't keep this up.
[03:02.680 --> 03:03.680]  I need relief.
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.920]  U.S.A. has helped thousands of people just like you if you owe more than $10,000 in credit
[03:07.920 --> 03:08.920]  card debt.
[03:08.920 --> 03:12.920]  Call the debt specialist at Debt Relief U.S.A. 800-425-5601.
[03:12.920 --> 03:16.120]  Debt Relief U.S.A. saved me half of what I owe on my credit card.
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.120]  800-425-5601.
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.640]  That's 800-425-5601 for Debt Relief U.S.A.
[03:23.640 --> 03:28.480]  The military says two U.S. soldiers are facing premeditated murder charges for the shooting
[03:28.480 --> 03:31.480]  of an Iraqi detainee north of Baghdad.
[03:31.480 --> 03:32.480]  Here's Kim Gamal.
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.400]  Sergeant Hal M. Warner and First Lieutenant Michael C. Bajena were accused of shooting
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.120]  a detainee at or near their forward operating base and then lying about it.
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.360]  Both face charges of premeditated murder, assault, making a false official statement
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.200]  and obstruction of justice.
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.520]  Israel is sending Palestine back to Gaza after they fled fighting there.
[03:54.520 --> 04:00.280]  An Israeli welfare and social affairs minister Isaac Herzog says that Israel made a humanitarian
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.080]  gesture by allowing the 180 fatah supporters to flee into Israel.
[04:05.080 --> 04:12.960]  Hamas terrorists are fighting Fatah combatants throughout in the last few days and clearly
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.720]  we have taken a humanitarian gesture in this respect.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.360]  And plans are in place for the presidential debates and they don't include any joint town
[04:22.360 --> 04:23.640]  hall meetings.
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.240]  The presidential candidates will face off three times before the November election.
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.240]  Here's Sandy Cozell.
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.600]  Barack Obama is agreeing to three standard debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential
[04:33.600 --> 04:34.600]  Debates.
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.280]  He's apparently backing away from rival John McCain's suggestion of a series of joint
[04:38.280 --> 04:40.280]  appearances before the conventions.
[04:40.280 --> 04:44.840]  In May, when a McCain advisor proposed a series of pre-convention appearances at town hall
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.560]  meetings, Obama said, I think that's a great idea.
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.680]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[04:53.680 --> 04:58.720]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[04:58.720 --> 05:00.400]  a third world nation.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.520]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[05:04.520 --> 05:05.520]  solutions.
[05:05.520 --> 05:07.720]  Introducing Orgon Products.
[05:07.720 --> 05:11.800]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material
[05:11.800 --> 05:12.800]  planet.
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.240]  Orgon Electromedicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.920]  Will Helmreich Orgon use cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[05:21.920 --> 05:24.520]  energy savings of up to 25 percent?
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.520]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[05:28.520 --> 05:32.160]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can have a device that could lead to the
[05:32.160 --> 05:34.080]  end of all your problems.
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.720]  Health doesn't need to be expensive or complicated.

[06:26.560 --> 06:37.480]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:37.480 --> 06:44.320]  Hello listeners across the country and the planet, it is already the third day of August
[06:44.320 --> 06:45.320]  2008.
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.160]  Today we're joining us on this live Sunday edition, we're here every Sunday, five to
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.680]  seven Eastern, four to six Central.
[06:54.680 --> 06:58.760]  And we have two guests joining us today.
[06:58.760 --> 07:06.200]  Later in the hour, one of the chief investigators that exposed the world, the fact that the
[07:06.200 --> 07:13.360]  Vince Foster Suicide, back in the early days, the Clinton administration, was a hit, a murder.
[07:13.360 --> 07:16.360]  And that's Mike Rivera, investigative journalist.
[07:16.360 --> 07:20.000]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.960]  Then we have a listener who ended up getting PrisonPlanet.com in the news, but not quite
[07:25.960 --> 07:32.200]  the way we'd like, it was on CNN, Fox, it was in more than 20 newspapers, a whole bunch
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.400]  of New England TV stations covered it as well.
[07:36.400 --> 07:41.400]  He went on board an airplane at Boston Logan Airport flying back to college, where he goes
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.960]  to college in Southern California, and he reportedly admits to sticking one of our bumper
[07:45.960 --> 07:50.360]  stickers that we put in all the videotape, all the film orders and book orders that
[07:50.360 --> 07:54.880]  go out from mfowars.com, sticking it in the bathroom.
[07:54.880 --> 07:59.000]  Now we understand he wanted to get the word out, but we do not encourage vandalism, even
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.600]  if it, his borderline vandalism probably didn't damage anything still, it can create fear
[08:04.600 --> 08:10.320]  and the police hyped it up and stopped the airplane and freaked out and put bomb dogs
[08:10.320 --> 08:18.720]  on board and he was arrested and this was last Thursday and he was indicted and then
[08:18.720 --> 08:25.900]  charged Friday, very quick about it, well guess what, he's out on bail and we have this
[08:25.900 --> 08:31.840]  arched thought criminal joining us coming up in an hour and a half against the advice
[08:31.840 --> 08:36.280]  of his lawyers, but might as well come on this show, he's going on all the other shows
[08:36.280 --> 08:37.280]  talking about it.
[08:37.280 --> 08:42.160]  They're also spinning what he had to say, they're saying, oh, the airport police said
[08:42.160 --> 08:47.920]  that he did it as a joke, no, he was saying they're arresting him and canceling the flight
[08:47.920 --> 08:55.600]  for three plus hours, that that was an overt reaction, but that's the whole point, that's
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.960]  why the criminals in government stage the 9-11 attacks was so they could create a culture
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.120]  of fear and take some of the bravest people in the world and turn us into a nation of
[09:04.120 --> 09:09.520]  ninny and cowards where now they've shot I-35 down here in Austin before because of a small
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.080]  box on the side of the road that blew out of a car.
[09:13.080 --> 09:19.160]  Now the media ignores Los Zetas, paramilitary Mexican troops, car bombing in Dallas, machine
[09:19.160 --> 09:28.000]  gunning on the border, rocket attacks on newspapers, more than 600 murders in one year, that's all
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.720]  covered up and kept quiet, I mean a real war, a real drug war, 54 Americans kidnapped
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.440]  in one day by drug games and taken across the border and then a huge firefight where
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.120]  some were killed, that hardly made South Texas papers, but you got a cardboard box on the
[09:43.120 --> 09:48.440]  side of the street, they shut I-35 down, everyone panics and men in black uniforms arrive in
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.560]  black ski masks to be the saviors of everyone, so I'm already digressing, we'll be talking
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.160]  to him coming up in about an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[10:01.160 --> 10:07.280]  Okay, I want to go ahead and get into the top story today, very, very important information,
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.480]  I want everyone to take notes and pay attention to what I'm covering here, all the proof
[10:12.480 --> 10:21.840]  of what I'm saying is up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com right now, Thursday during
[10:21.840 --> 10:28.720]  the radio show I was sent a YouTube clip of Seymour Hirsch, the most respected living
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.600]  journalist today, Pulitzer Prize winner, the greatest living investigative journalist
[10:34.600 --> 10:40.280]  and every report he's put out over the decades since he broke Operation Phoenix and torture
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.760]  camps and the Mealy massacre in Vietnam, everything he's ever reported and I've gone over his
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.720]  major reportage has been very accurate, he has inside sources in the Pentagon, in every
[10:52.720 --> 11:01.760]  major wine house in the FBI and Sy Hirsch a few months ago reported that the wine house
[11:01.760 --> 11:09.640]  was looking for a pretext to start a war with Iran, now we already had White House memos,
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.440]  the famous White House memo that's gotten so much attention with Tony Blair and George
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.520]  Bush where Bush talks about flying our planes low, painted up like Ewan aircraft, hopefully
[11:19.520 --> 11:22.880]  some of Saddam's troops would shoot at him, now that's criminal but that's one thing
[11:22.880 --> 11:33.560]  and we know they did then carry that out, this is even worse, this is even worse and
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.200]  we then put a report out on it Thursday night and Friday and put the call out for the mainstream
[11:38.200 --> 11:45.840]  media to cover it, they did, one outfit did cover it and that was Keith Oberman, here's
[11:45.840 --> 11:50.760]  just a few second snip of it, we have a link to it if you want it up on prisonplanet.com
[11:50.760 --> 11:56.480]  right now but here is a small piece of Keith Oberman talking about it Friday.
[11:56.480 --> 12:00.840]  He told the campus progress journalism conference that in a meeting in the vice president's
[12:00.840 --> 12:06.280]  office members of the administration sat around brainstorming ideas to provoke a war with
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.920]  Iran, quote, the one that interested me the most was why don't we build, we need an hour's
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.000]  shipyard, build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats, put Navy SEALs on them
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.280]  with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes to the straits of Hormuz, start
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.280]  a shoot up, might cost some lives and it was rejected because you can't have Americans
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.880]  killing Americans, that's the kind of, that's the level of stuff we're talking about, provocation
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.360]  but that was rejected, can you see this happening in Cheney's office, sure you can, can you
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.400]  see Cheney getting all happy and worked up and almost smiling, sure you can, can you
[12:40.400 --> 12:43.760]  see when they get to the part about Americans being killed and you can't do that and he
[12:43.760 --> 12:53.600]  just stares at the mall and says, so Vice President Dick Cheney, today's worst person
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.440]  in the world.
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.800]  Now of course there are more than 200 declassified examples of where criminal elements of our
[13:04.800 --> 13:10.120]  government, the CIA, the army, the Marines, that's the main culprits, they're very
[13:10.120 --> 13:13.920]  proud of it, they teach it in war college and how to do it and it's in army manuals
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.640]  and we post them, declassified army manuals, how to stage terror attacks, how to blow up
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.880]  churches, how to blame it on your enemies, oh it's official policy of the criminal government
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.640]  we have and they just got a little bigger and a little better on 9-11, you know okay
[13:30.640 --> 13:36.000]  CIA only killed 160 something, that wasn't enough under the Clinton, so 3,000, that'll
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  sure get the American people hopping mad for these $3 trillion wars we've had, the two
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.520]  wars have cost more than $3 trillion now and of course hundreds of billions of no-bid weapons
[13:46.520 --> 13:55.880]  contracts every year to their cronies, but this is the point, Sy Hirsch published a story
[13:55.880 --> 14:00.720]  but didn't give details in the New Yorker a couple months ago, then two weeks ago at
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.680]  a journalism conference with hundreds in attendance, he goes and speaks and somebody
[14:05.680 --> 14:15.160]  in the audience shoots video of this and Sy Hirsch, we have the tape it's up on infowars.com
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.120]  I played it twice last week, we're not going to play it today because of time constraints,
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.960]  maybe later we will if we have time, it's about five minutes long, where he goes well,
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.960]  you know there were 11 other attacks they wanted to stage but the military didn't like
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.920]  the idea and said we better not do that and so Dick Cheney was basically overruled by
[14:33.920 --> 14:41.880]  the president, okay but why is this not newsworthy that Dick Cheney, the vice president is saying
[14:41.880 --> 14:48.400]  let's paint up some boats, let's manufacture some boats and paint them to look like Iranian
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.080]  boats and then have them go out and if you actually read the transcript and watch the
[14:53.080 --> 15:00.680]  video he says have them have a shootout, so that means both sides shooting at each other,
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.640]  now that's operation north woods, that's the declassified government plan to hijack
[15:05.640 --> 15:11.080]  jets by remote control and crash them, bomb DC, bomb Miami, attack US military bases,
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.400]  blame it on foreign enemies, blow our ships up, blame it on enemies, so I'm going to come
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.640]  back and finish up with this, the point here is you the listeners are the reason this ended
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.880]  up being on MSNBC, as I said Thursday and Friday, get it out to everybody, make sure
[15:25.880 --> 15:33.080]  the mainstream media is forced to cover it and one station did MSNBC but we need an investigation,

[15:54.560 --> 16:13.280]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the US hinting
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.080]  liquidation of its vast holdings of US treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions

[16:22.320 --> 16:27.480]  1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the

[20:02.960 --> 20:06.480]  Join the...
[20:06.480 --> 20:17.960]  There are several huge facets to this story that you, my great listeners, the visitors
[20:17.960 --> 20:22.840]  of infoawards.com, took the challenge I put out Thursday and Friday.
[20:22.840 --> 20:29.600]  They took that YouTube video of Sy Hersh admitting what he didn't put in the article from his
[20:29.600 --> 20:30.920]  sources inside the White House.
[20:30.920 --> 20:38.240]  He admitted they were planning some provocation, but Hila gave us in that news conference one
[20:38.240 --> 20:39.920]  of the points.
[20:39.920 --> 20:40.920]  What about the other 11?
[20:40.920 --> 20:42.880]  See, that's the big issue here.
[20:42.880 --> 20:50.280]  So Dick Cheney is pitching and discussing making dummy or false flag boats.
[20:50.280 --> 20:54.400]  This is the original definition, the British and the French during their innumerable wars
[20:54.400 --> 20:58.080]  would address their ships up if they were English like the French or if they were French
[20:58.080 --> 21:02.120]  like the English or if they were Spanish like the French, depending who was fighting
[21:02.120 --> 21:03.360]  with each other.
[21:03.360 --> 21:10.360]  They would dress it up like the enemy's ship, fly its flag, go commit massacres, pull up
[21:10.360 --> 21:15.040]  beside merchant ships of neutral countries, there were some famous cases of this and
[21:15.040 --> 21:22.200]  just open fire and sink the ship, but make sure that a few people were able to get in
[21:22.200 --> 21:24.600]  escape boats, life boats and get away.
[21:24.600 --> 21:27.720]  You can read some of the naval annals of the French and the British.
[21:27.720 --> 21:33.360]  I can't put them down, it's one of the things in my off time I'm into the last 300 years
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.440]  of naval warfare, very interesting stuff and they would even give them the orders, in fact
[21:38.440 --> 21:41.960]  the French were some of the first with this type of espionage or black propaganda as they
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.920]  called it or false flag as the British called it.
[21:44.920 --> 21:50.360]  They would even pick a small merchant ship that was near land in good weather so they
[21:50.360 --> 21:58.320]  could pull up flying the flag of their enemy, blow the ship to kingdom come in neutral waters
[21:58.320 --> 22:03.200]  and then the survivors would get home, say in the case of the Dutch and say my gosh the
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.160]  evil French pulled up and they opened fire on us and then they'd say that's it, we're
[22:07.160 --> 22:12.040]  going to war with France on the side of England or if it was one of the other cases, we're
[22:12.040 --> 22:20.080]  going to war with England on the side of France, that's false flag, that's self inflicted wound,
[22:20.080 --> 22:26.680]  that's inside job, that's government sponsored terrorism, in fact there were even some things
[22:26.680 --> 22:30.960]  like this that were done during World War II by the US, of course Hitler became dictator
[22:30.960 --> 22:35.240]  through firebombing his own Reichstag, the capital and then to start war with Poland,
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.120]  we're taught in our main line history books that Hitler just attacked Poland one day in
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.400]  1939, no, they attacked their own military base, a radio relay station, dressed up concentration
[22:43.400 --> 22:51.680]  camp victims in the uniforms of Polish soldiers, shot film of it for the newsreels and said
[22:51.680 --> 22:54.400]  that's it, we're attacking Poland.
[22:54.400 --> 22:58.760]  This is done over and over and over, Putin's been caught doing it, blowing up stuff and
[22:58.760 --> 23:03.520]  blaming it on the Chechnyans, that's even come out, in Russia it's over and over and
[23:03.520 --> 23:08.920]  over, this is their favorite trick and as long as we continue to buy it, they will continue
[23:08.920 --> 23:13.520]  to do it and yes criminal elements of our government killed 3,000 of us on 9-11 and
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.400]  we even have their own documents where they planned it, they even wrote public ones saying
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.960]  we need a huge terror attack, boy it'll be great, I mean that's how arrogant they are,
[23:21.960 --> 23:28.720]  Gary Hart earlier this year put out a public letter in a newspaper to Iran saying our government
[23:28.720 --> 23:33.520]  will stage terror attacks, Senator Gary Hart, he's part of the CFR homeland security board
[23:33.520 --> 23:37.280]  that came up with a plan for it beforehand, he said you better do what we say, don't think
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.600]  because 80% of Americans and Poles don't want to attack you, we won't, go read it, just
[23:42.600 --> 23:49.080]  type Gary Hart letter to Ahmed Denizhid or letter to Iran and then we went and interviewed
[23:49.080 --> 23:53.280]  him, it's in truth rising, we are changed when interviewed him and said did you really
[23:53.280 --> 23:57.120]  say this, our government stages attacks and he said yes, our government wants to stage
[23:57.120 --> 24:04.560]  attacks in the Gulf, why was he saying this 5.5 almost 6 months ago because that's the
[24:04.560 --> 24:11.480]  very time these meetings were going on in government and Sy Hirsch, the most respected
[24:11.480 --> 24:19.120]  reporter in this country, his activity is outrageous, he said they decided not to publish
[24:19.120 --> 24:31.040]  the 12 plans that were proposed by Dick Cheney and the Neocons in a White House pow wow to
[24:31.040 --> 24:37.200]  create fake Iranian patrol boats, put our Navy SEALs in them and then have them pull
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.040]  up alongside a destroyer and open fire and have them have a shoot out and they said well
[24:42.040 --> 24:52.320]  people will probably get killed and this happened the week after they had the botched
[24:52.320 --> 24:59.040]  Philippine monkey as he's known, that's the nickname of the pirate radio ham operator
[24:59.040 --> 25:05.080]  in the Strait of Hormuz who is always trying to get the US and Iran to shoot at each other
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.400]  and the media says oh it's just some radio pirate, isn't he funny, no it's the government
[25:09.400 --> 25:16.320]  folks and Sy Hirsch needs to release the other 11 ways they plan to start a war because I
[25:16.320 --> 25:19.680]  guarantee you they're getting ready to do it, now stories like this coming out in the
[25:19.680 --> 25:26.840]  media may stop them but let me explain something, the New Yorker reported two months ago that
[25:26.840 --> 25:34.040]  they did have a meeting and are looking for ways and decided on some to stage a provocation,
[25:34.040 --> 25:38.040]  Keith Oberman just reported on that Friday but they are not telling us what the other
[25:38.040 --> 25:47.080]  11 targets are, this is absolutely incredible, the story you need to look at is Cheney Neocons
[25:47.080 --> 25:54.520]  considered killing Americans and pretext to attack Iran, in the video here taped the campus
[25:54.520 --> 25:58.760]  progress journalism conference earlier this month, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist
[25:58.760 --> 26:04.320]  Seymour Hirsch reveals how the Neocons convened around Dick Cheney and brainstorm ways to
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.240]  kick off World War 4, everybody's confused by that, the Neocons call World War 3 the
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.120]  Cold War, we're just being technical here, we may change that to World War 3 because
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.520]  the public just doesn't know that, as they finally call their pet project to take out
[26:20.520 --> 26:27.320]  Muslims and foment they can try quote class of civilizations, according to Hirsch the
[26:27.320 --> 26:32.440]  meeting occurred after the Neocons failed miserably to stage a rehash version of the
[26:32.440 --> 26:38.120]  Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the Strait of Hormuz mostly because it is no longer 1964 and such
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.640]  big lies thanks to the internet and bloggers are far more difficult to float, for all I
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.960]  know our Navy was shooting at whales out there equipped LBJ about the imaginary act of North
[26:47.960 --> 26:52.960]  Vietnamese patrol boats attacking US ships leading to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.000]  undeclared war in Southeast Asia ultimately resulting in the death of nearly 60,000 Americans
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.040]  and around 3 million Southeast Asians and it was declassified now three years ago that
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.480]  it was staged, completely staged as the USS Liberty was staged, that was declassified
[27:07.480 --> 27:10.600]  three months ago, Chicago Tribune.
[27:10.600 --> 27:15.560]  In an exclusive think progress story we learned the meeting took place in Cheney's office
[27:15.560 --> 27:23.360]  and the subject on the table was how to create a Qasas-Beli between Tehran and Washington
[27:23.360 --> 27:26.800]  part of an ongoing effort to provide an excuse to attack Iran.
[27:26.800 --> 27:31.840]  There was a dozen ideas proffered, this is quoting Sy Hirsh, about how to trigger a war,
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.840]  Hirsh explains, the one that interested me the most was why don't we build, this is
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.840]  a quote, in our own shipyard, this is Cheney speaking, build four or five boats that look
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.360]  like Iranian PT boats, put Navy SEALs on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our
[27:46.360 --> 27:52.840]  boats goes the Strait of Hormuz, start a shoot up, let's take Cheney quote.
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.760]  This is the guy that five years ago reported that US Special Forces were inside Iran staging
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.560]  terror attacks, the White House declassified that and said it was a good thing last year.
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.000]  Hirsh would have us believe the scenario did not play out because you can't have Americans
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.880]  killing Americans, an absurd explanation considering the fact that the attacks of September 11th
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.880]  were just that, Americans killing Americans, a calculated and cold blooded act of mass
[28:12.880 --> 28:17.520]  murder carried out by elements of the US government as the new Pearl Harbor, a cynical pretext
[28:17.520 --> 28:23.000]  to launch a war on terror now grinding into its seventh year.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.240]  Commonously these ideas are back to Operation Northwoods, the JCS plan to stage a false
[28:27.240 --> 28:32.320]  flag terror event, we're going to come back ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get into
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.520]  this more later, I want to get into the anthrax case which we have the real prime suspect,

[33:13.080 --> 33:18.240]  Mike Rivera had one of the very first alternative investigative news journal websites, what
[33:18.240 --> 33:21.640]  really happened.com in the mid-1990s.
[33:21.640 --> 33:28.360]  He was instrumental more than anybody else, including Christopher Ruddy, who also deserves
[33:28.360 --> 33:38.120]  a lot of the credit for successfully exposing the fact that Vince Foster was murdered.
[33:38.120 --> 33:45.160]  He's broken a lot of other major investigations.
[33:45.160 --> 33:50.040]  And before he leaves us early in the next hour, I do want to get his analysis of this
[33:50.040 --> 33:54.920]  huge report, now picked up by Keith Oberman after we pushed for it Thursday and Friday,
[33:54.920 --> 34:01.760]  you the listeners did, about Dick Cheney wanting to have fake Iranian boats made in U.S. shipyards
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.680]  attack U.S. naval craft.
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.160]  Yes ladies and gentlemen, and there's 11 other terrorist attacks that Dick Cheney is planning.
[34:12.160 --> 34:17.560]  And Sy Hersh just at a media conference just kind of, oh, just jokingly talks about it
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.440]  and says, yeah, we wrote an article about how they were planning to stage something,
[34:20.440 --> 34:23.440]  but we didn't want to say what.
[34:23.440 --> 34:24.920]  That's a big issue right there.
[34:24.920 --> 34:27.280]  This isn't a joke or a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.920]  There's over 200 declassified examples of criminal elements of our government.
[34:31.920 --> 34:35.600]  This is admitted where they did stage attacks.
[34:35.600 --> 34:36.920]  We're in a lot of danger here.
[34:36.920 --> 34:37.920]  It's bipartisan.
[34:37.920 --> 34:43.560]  And don't think when George Bush flies off into the sunset, all this ends, I'm not defending
[34:43.560 --> 34:46.160]  George Bush, but the guy runs nothing.
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.120]  And the evidence says he didn't even exactly know what was going on on 9 11 from his activities.
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.360]  But I'll tell you who did Dick Cheney in control at the bunker, according to transportation
[34:54.360 --> 34:57.600]  secretary Norman Manetta in control of the stand down.
[34:57.600 --> 35:04.320]  We'll talk about all that later with Mike Rivera, who's also an expert on 9 11.
[35:04.320 --> 35:11.080]  Now in my film, Matrix of Evil, we cover who the main suspect in the anthrax attacks are.
[35:11.080 --> 35:16.720]  He's a dual massage slash US government bio weapons expert.
[35:16.720 --> 35:23.600]  The papers on the East Coast and news stations TV did report that he broke into Fort Detrick
[35:23.600 --> 35:25.800]  Maryland after he'd been fired.
[35:25.800 --> 35:31.200]  He did break into the level four bio weapons lab where the US grade weapons super weaponized
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.040]  anthrax was stored.
[35:34.040 --> 35:36.120]  But he was never the suspect.
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.800]  First it was Hatfield, who's now won a huge multimillion dollar lawsuit, totally innocent.
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.600]  Just like when the feds bombed in the Olympic Park, they tried to blame Richard Jewel.
[35:45.600 --> 35:48.200]  Now they've set up Eric Rudolph.
[35:48.200 --> 35:53.280]  It's the same thing here, remember, and they told you it was non weaponized turned out when
[35:53.280 --> 35:54.280]  samples came out.
[35:54.280 --> 36:00.360]  It was the most weaponized, ever designed, patented US, just the process of miniaturizing
[36:00.360 --> 36:07.480]  it takes over a hundred million dollars of equipment in a giant factory and is so deadly
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.320]  that it is in containment units and robotic arms are used to manufacture it and these
[36:13.320 --> 36:16.400]  giant cylinders.
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.120]  Remember the FBI lied to us about that.
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.280]  They lied and said that it was Mr. Hatfield.
[36:22.280 --> 36:32.120]  Now they have found a classic Patsy who even after they claim he'd been visiting his shrink,
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.440]  his government shrink and saying he wanted to go into the lab and shoot everybody and
[36:36.440 --> 36:39.640]  he was involved in the vaccines not in the weapons side and that's in the Washington
[36:39.640 --> 36:40.640]  Post today.
[36:40.640 --> 36:44.720]  Even the Washington Post says scientists question FBI probe on anthrax because they're the experts.
[36:44.720 --> 36:46.520]  They say he didn't have access to it.
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.520]  He couldn't get in there.
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.320]  Well, why are you well, no doubt folks, he didn't commit suicide.
[36:51.320 --> 36:52.920]  That's a 99% chance.
[36:52.920 --> 36:56.080]  So they murder somebody out of thousands of scientists.
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.040]  They find one who's mentally ill, one they can have a psychiatrist say he didn't talk
[37:01.040 --> 37:02.600]  about anthrax attacks.
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.160]  We talked about shooting people, but they didn't do anything.
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.520]  In fact, they continue to let him work in and around non weaponized anthrax for the last
[37:11.520 --> 37:12.520]  few years.
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.200]  So that's some of the basic facts here, but we do know who the main suspect is and we've
[37:17.200 --> 37:19.200]  known this for five years.
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.960]  I made matrix of evil five years ago and briefly covered it.
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.680]  Michael Vero has done the original research and put it all together and this is amazing
[37:28.680 --> 37:29.680]  info.
[37:29.680 --> 37:30.680]  We're going to have him with us into the next hour.
[37:30.680 --> 37:34.680]  And then I want to get into Dick Cheney wanting to attack us ships.
[37:34.680 --> 37:35.680]  This is public.
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.280]  Cy Hirsch most respected investigative journalist living and now Keith Oberman has covered it.
[37:41.280 --> 37:44.900]  Thank God because I knew people would say when we talked about it or played the video
[37:44.900 --> 37:48.980]  clip of Cy Hirsch saying this that they wouldn't believe it.
[37:48.980 --> 37:53.200]  We can now push this further out in the light and demand Hirsch be drug in and tell us the
[37:53.200 --> 37:54.200]  other 11 targets.
[37:54.200 --> 37:58.600]  I demand to know those other 11 targets, but again, we're going to that later.
[37:58.600 --> 38:00.920]  I rarely have two such huge stories.
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.840]  I don't know which one to get to first, but they all deal with government sponsored terror.
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.600]  We haven't even gotten into how the White House was on Cypro, the anthrax fighting antibiotic
[38:09.600 --> 38:11.960]  September 10th, four weeks before it shows up.
[38:11.960 --> 38:16.120]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is bombshell information.
[38:16.120 --> 38:19.200]  Let's go to Mike Rivera right now.
[38:19.200 --> 38:20.760]  Mike, I've set the table with some facts.
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.440]  Can you in a chronological order roll out what happened with the anthrax people forgotten?
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.640]  It's been almost seven years.
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.480]  Go through all of that and then bring us up to speed with this new Patsy and then who
[38:32.480 --> 38:34.120]  the main suspect is.
[38:34.120 --> 38:35.120]  Okay.
[38:35.120 --> 38:39.520]  Well, basically shortly after 9-11 at the time when President Bush was trying to get
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.640]  the USA Patriot Act ramrodded through Congress, these letters started showing up.
[38:44.640 --> 38:46.760]  They were filled with this weaponized anthrax.
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.040]  The letters themselves and envelopes were deliberately written to place the blame for
[38:51.040 --> 38:53.340]  these attacks on Arab Muslims.
[38:53.340 --> 38:58.640]  Very crude writing, very poor spelling, references to Allah, death to Israel and all the rest
[38:58.640 --> 38:59.640]  of it.
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.120]  So it was very obviously an attempt to point the finger of blame for the anthrax letters
[39:04.120 --> 39:05.120]  on some Arab Muslims.
[39:05.120 --> 39:06.560]  And this is the same government.
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.240]  I've got to add this because we can't forget this, that planted two fake passports on the
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.120]  scene of the towers in 9-11 and then later admitted they were fake but wouldn't say where
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.120]  they came from.
[39:18.120 --> 39:21.680]  The same government that planted the bags of the hijackers everywhere, only their bags
[39:21.680 --> 39:22.680]  didn't go through security.
[39:22.680 --> 39:23.680]  But go ahead.
[39:23.680 --> 39:29.680]  Yeah, basically, yeah, it was a very obvious setup and because of the fear of the anthrax
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.960]  letters, the Congress passed the USA Patriot Act without even looking at it.
[39:33.960 --> 39:35.720]  And it was a big, big, scary deal.
[39:35.720 --> 39:38.360]  Now, fortunately, not that many people were killed.
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.480]  It was a relatively minor incident, but of course the media played it up.
[39:41.480 --> 39:42.720]  We were all in danger.
[39:42.720 --> 39:48.000]  People were afraid of opening their envelopes and it was a very scary time.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.320]  Now, as we all know, it became apparent very quickly that this anthrax, in fact, had come
[39:55.320 --> 39:57.240]  from within the United States.
[39:57.240 --> 40:01.320]  There were foreign labs who had requested samples of it and they quickly identified
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.360]  the genetic structure as identical to a strain kept at Fort Detrick.
[40:05.360 --> 40:10.720]  So it became more and more obvious that this was beyond the capacity of al-Qaeda to produce
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.760]  and they started to look for somebody inside the US government.
[40:14.760 --> 40:19.960]  Now, according to the Hartford Courant and other sources who are quoting from apparently
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.440]  now classified US government documents, there was a scientist working at Fort Detrick by
[40:24.440 --> 40:32.480]  the name of Dr. Philip Zach and he was caught on the security system going into the lab
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.720]  where the anthrax used in the letters was kept and he did this after he did not have
[40:37.720 --> 40:43.440]  authorization to be there because he'd been fired over a racially motivated attack against
[40:43.440 --> 40:44.440]  an Egyptian coworker.
[40:44.440 --> 40:45.440]  Now, let's be clear.
[40:45.440 --> 40:51.240]  We got somebody breaking a bio weapons scientist, breaking into a level four lab international
[40:51.240 --> 40:55.040]  incident right there alone, it's covered up.
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.160]  And basically a lot of people are convinced that it was the same Dr. Philip Zach who sent
[41:00.160 --> 41:05.280]  letters to the FBI attempting to frame the Egyptian scientist for the anthrax letters
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.280]  as well.
[41:06.280 --> 41:09.040]  And they investigated him briefly and let him go.
[41:09.040 --> 41:13.200]  Then all of a sudden Zach, you know, he's moved out to, I believe he's currently at
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.600]  Dugway Proving Grounds, he still has the security clearance, he still has his job, he's still
[41:17.600 --> 41:20.400]  working on these things that kill a lot of people.
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.920]  Meanwhile, apparently at the urging of Dr. Barbara Rosenberg, the FBI focuses on Dr.
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.320]  Stephen Hackfield and they proceed to destroy his life bit by bit.
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.960]  They point him out to the media, they call him a person of interest which is a null term
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.240]  with no legal validity and the media hounds him and they just, they turn his life into
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.840]  a fishbowl, he can't get work, he is losing everything he's ever worked for.
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.040]  I'm glad he sued, I'm glad he won, I'm glad he got his settlement.
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.960]  Then the FBI which of course is having to deal with this question of why can't you guys
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.160]  find out who did this, apparently they focused on some other scientists except for Dr. Zach,
[41:59.160 --> 42:03.960]  the man caught going into the lab where the anthrax was kept.
[42:03.960 --> 42:09.080]  In this, Bruce Ivins was apparently being harassed and hounded much the same way that
[42:09.080 --> 42:14.200]  Stephen Hackfield was, it was not allowed into the press to forestall a potential lawsuit
[42:14.200 --> 42:19.240]  but from his associates it is clear that the FBI simply harassed this man to death.
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.040]  Now that's the Patsy, stay there, we're going to come back and analyze the Patsy, analyze
[42:24.040 --> 42:27.320]  the real suspect here.
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're getting information, the establishment is on what you to have.
[42:32.800 --> 42:37.040]  They launched those attacks to create more fear, they launched it against Democrats,
[42:37.040 --> 42:42.720]  they launched it against American media that had done hit pieces on the bushes and the White
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.120]  House was on Cipro, multiple smoking guns in triplicate will cover it all on the other
[42:48.120 --> 42:57.840]  side with Mike Rivera of whatreallyhappened.com, my website'sprisonplina.com.
[42:57.840 --> 43:03.520]  You've been there, have a few drinks and you wake up feeling a bit fuzzy, so keep your body

[43:32.600 --> 43:37.280]  Now, scientific research shows taken Drink and Mate before, during, or immediately after
[43:37.280 --> 43:41.400]  drinking helps prevent queasy stomach, headache, and dehydration.
[43:41.400 --> 43:46.480]  So keep your body in tune and still have fun while having a few drinks with all-natural

[46:00.520 --> 46:01.520]  He's in a dive.
[46:01.520 --> 46:04.760]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  Let's go look.
[46:05.760 --> 46:09.880]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.680]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[46:11.680 --> 46:12.680]  Take them out.
[46:12.680 --> 46:13.680]  Let's see them.
[46:13.680 --> 46:18.120]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[46:18.120 --> 46:19.120]  Don't worry.
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.920]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.200]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[46:25.200 --> 46:28.000]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  Great.
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.160]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[46:34.160 --> 46:37.240]  Don't let Non-X-Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[46:37.240 --> 46:41.280]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X nail gel.
[46:41.280 --> 46:48.640]  In the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Lawns, Meyer, Giant Eagle, Card Drug,
[46:48.640 --> 46:57.560]  Sniders, Dwayne Reed, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[46:57.560 --> 47:09.040]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.520]  I wanted to plug something before we go back to Mike Rivera.
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.880]  The affiliate that we bring you, this Sunday show, and syndicate to a lot of great M&M's
[47:16.880 --> 47:22.200]  across the country, put out on satellite and the internet, at infowars.com, News Radio
[47:22.200 --> 47:28.320]  590KLBJ, their website is 590KLBJ.com.
[47:28.320 --> 47:34.440]  I just love it when our affiliates, like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years ago, would be
[47:34.440 --> 47:35.440]  ashamed of us.
[47:35.440 --> 47:40.560]  But a lot of our affiliates, especially this one, are proud of the show.
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.240]  And they've got big links all over their main page, and links to our own little subpage
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.240]  on there.
[47:45.240 --> 47:50.360]  And they are now asking us every week for clips from the video we shoot in here on local
[47:50.360 --> 47:52.080]  TV in Austin.
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.480]  We shoot it on Sundays, then air it Wednesday nights on the TV show.
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.800]  We're now putting little select clips every week up there on their site, and the video
[48:00.800 --> 48:03.120]  quality is just unbelievably good.
[48:03.120 --> 48:06.120]  I'm kind of afraid to plug it though, it'll probably crash your servers.
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.840]  I don't know how big this show is, I think they have an idea.
[48:09.840 --> 48:10.840]  But that's up there.
[48:10.840 --> 48:21.920]  Okay, so Mike, I want to go back here, and then get into how they're setting up this
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.480]  Patsy who they probably murdered or may have driven the suicide, but I think they murdered
[48:25.480 --> 48:26.480]  him.
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.840]  They like to murder their Patsies, like Lee Harvey Oswald, McVeigh, and others.
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.640]  The big issue here that I want you to give us your expertise on, there's a bunch of big
[48:36.640 --> 48:44.080]  issues, is that the FBI out of the gate said this is not weaponized, this was probably
[48:44.080 --> 48:46.640]  made to basement in a bucket, that's a quote.
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.640]  And then we went on air day one, and said, folks, I've looked it up, I've looked at
[48:52.640 --> 48:58.280]  Jane's weapons quarterly, and what the bio weapons experts say, regular anthrax doesn't
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.880]  even kill most people it comes in contact with, this stuff's killing people in a day
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.840]  or two who just get a whiff of it, and it's obviously weaponized, and I was called a conspiracy
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.280]  theorist by the national media, and then within months it did come out that it was super weaponized,
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.560]  was the U.S., and they had to go try to find a Patsy.
[49:14.560 --> 49:17.680]  But the FBI knew that day one.
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.960]  And so we have them covering up, and then we have them ignoring somebody breaking in
[49:22.960 --> 49:26.920]  with foreign intelligence ties into a level four bio weapons lab, and for those that don't
[49:26.920 --> 49:32.240]  know, inside Fort Dietrich, these are underground in their own pressurized sub-facilities.
[49:32.240 --> 49:39.160]  There are three layers of barbed wire, 15-foot fences around it, mine fields, men in machine
[49:39.160 --> 49:40.160]  gun nest.
[49:40.160 --> 49:47.640]  Oh, but he just breaks in, steals it, but then, you know, that's okay, he's not a suspect.
[49:47.640 --> 49:50.640]  I mean, Mike Rivera, this is insane.
[49:50.640 --> 49:57.160]  It's from new information that is breaking that removes any doubt about this being a
[49:57.160 --> 49:58.680]  murder and a smear job.
[49:58.680 --> 50:06.600]  First of all, the timeline about Dr. Bruce Ivins, apparently on July 9th, a social worker
[50:06.600 --> 50:14.480]  by the name of Gene C. Dully filed court papers in which all of these claims about how dangerous
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.880]  he was is, and if you go and look carefully, every quote in every news report about how
[50:19.880 --> 50:24.520]  he's homicidal, he was talking about killing people, he's crazy going back to his college
[50:24.520 --> 50:25.520]  days.
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.320]  It's all from this one court document.
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.200]  There is no corroborating evidence about it at all.
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.720]  Now the interesting thing is, Smoking Gun has put up Gene Dully's original handwritten
[50:36.720 --> 50:43.880]  note about all of this, and in it, it says quite clearly that the FBI was in communication
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.120]  with her before she filed these court documents.
[50:48.120 --> 50:53.000]  Now the interesting thing is, on the basis of her court filing, Bruce Ivins was committed
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.680]  to the Frederick Memorial Mental Hospital.
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.280]  The hospital turned around and scheduled him for release, which means they didn't think
[51:01.280 --> 51:02.280]  he was a problem.
[51:02.280 --> 51:03.280]  Let me stop you.
[51:03.280 --> 51:07.080]  Now, they're saying for years, it was known that he was a nut, why was he given access
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.920]  to bio-weapon labs?
[51:09.920 --> 51:11.160]  That's exactly the point.
[51:11.160 --> 51:15.000]  They do background on this, I mean, they go back and find out about your great grandma.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.440]  I mean, I went up for security clearance myself, and they gave me heck because my father was
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.160]  born in Shanghai, China, and I wasn't dealing with any weapons systems or anything.
[51:24.160 --> 51:31.360]  I was dealing with satellite data, and this Gene Dully, the only person who's saying that
[51:31.360 --> 51:35.720]  he was showing all these symptoms all throughout his life is this Gene Dully.
[51:35.720 --> 51:41.000]  Now they're trying to claim that she is a therapist, she isn't, she is a social worker,
[51:41.000 --> 51:46.880]  and her only certification is that she is a substance abuse counselor, which takes just
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.800]  an associate's degree.
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.960]  She's not a doctor, she is not a therapist.
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.080]  But the way the media has framed it is that his psychiatrist said this, and then you read
[51:55.080 --> 51:57.080]  deeper, it's clearly a bunch of bull.
[51:57.080 --> 51:59.400]  Yeah, there is no psychiatrist involved.
[51:59.400 --> 52:03.120]  This woman is not a psychiatrist, she is a substance abuse counselor.
[52:03.120 --> 52:08.480]  And then magically, he kills himself, case closed, and I guess if they would have killed
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.480]  Stephen Hadfield, he wouldn't have won a $15.6 million lawsuit by proving that they
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.480]  were liars.
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.240]  Okay, but I'm still getting to the punchline here, okay?
[52:18.240 --> 52:24.200]  The LA Times is reporting that Bruce Ivins was still in the Frederick Mental Hospital
[52:24.200 --> 52:25.200]  when he died.
[52:25.200 --> 52:30.760]  Now, he didn't walk around a mental hospital and pick up handfuls of Tylenol number three
[52:30.760 --> 52:31.760]  to take.
[52:31.760 --> 52:37.000]  Oh my God, he died in government custody, and I read a bunch of news articles and didn't
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.600]  find that, the fact that they're burying that, that's even bigger.
[52:40.600 --> 52:48.080]  Yeah, he was still in the mental hospital when he died, and you know, this stuff is
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.080]  locked up, he's supposed to be on homicide, suicide watch, he's in a mental hospital,
[52:53.080 --> 52:58.200]  and oh my goodness, he overdoses on Tylenol three, I mean, come on people.
[52:58.200 --> 53:02.800]  Well let's recap it all, we have these anthrax attacks against democratic targets and media
[53:02.800 --> 53:06.120]  targets that are against the neocons.
[53:06.120 --> 53:09.800]  Now let's get into the big smoking gun, because we can bring in all the old evidence, Mike.
[53:09.800 --> 53:12.960]  Tell them who was on Cipro, and by the way, I have Ari Fleischer on tape, we're making
[53:12.960 --> 53:15.640]  a new film, You're In, Fabled Enemies, covering it all.
[53:15.640 --> 53:19.680]  We have the press conference where the White House, not just an AP article, admits that
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.880]  the White House went on Cipro the day before 9-11, weeks and weeks and weeks before the
[53:23.880 --> 53:25.360]  anthrax letters are mailed.
[53:25.360 --> 53:27.840]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[53:27.840 --> 53:33.280]  The White House staff, the president, all of his key people, they were all put on a program
[53:33.280 --> 53:40.760]  of Cipro, which is the medicine that you take to prevent being infected by airborne inhaled
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.680]  anthrax, and they were on this medication to build it up in their body for weeks before
[53:45.680 --> 53:48.520]  the anthrax letters were mailed.
[53:48.520 --> 53:49.600]  How did they know?
[53:49.600 --> 53:52.720]  It's like the people who say we had to get out of Building 7 because we were told it
[53:52.720 --> 53:53.720]  was going to come down.
[53:53.720 --> 53:54.720]  Okay, who told you?
[53:54.720 --> 53:59.200]  Well, we weren't told after all, that was just conspiracy theory stuff, and it's the
[53:59.200 --> 54:00.200]  same thing.
[54:00.200 --> 54:06.320]  And our top governmental people were being given the very medication for anthrax four
[54:06.320 --> 54:08.280]  weeks before the anthrax letters came out.
[54:08.280 --> 54:11.920]  And then the debunkers say, but wait a minute, if they were launching the attack, they would
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.220]  know the letters weren't coming to them, it was going to go through the DC special post
[54:17.220 --> 54:21.520]  office for the White House and the Capitol, and it killed some workers there and made
[54:21.520 --> 54:22.520]  others sick.
[54:22.520 --> 54:23.760]  So that's why they knew.
[54:23.760 --> 54:29.280]  In their threat assessment, turns out the CIA in 1999 did what, a $3 million study of
[54:29.280 --> 54:37.080]  how to mail weaponize anthrax through the mail and who else was behind that study.
[54:37.080 --> 54:38.080]  This is just incredible.
[54:38.080 --> 54:41.840]  And now, Mike, give us your take on that.
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.800]  Well, yeah, we see a continuing pattern of the government literally practicing and rehearsing
[54:46.800 --> 54:48.560]  these events that happened.
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.360]  We know that in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing, the BATF had a special unit
[54:53.360 --> 54:58.240]  out in New Mexico, making truck bombs and blowing them up, and they did about a dozen
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.200]  of them, and the guy who was in charge of that program just kind of happened, sorted
[55:02.200 --> 55:07.000]  a B in Oklahoma City, one block away from the Murrah building when it went up.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.680]  And Terrence Yakey, who became cop of the year, big linebacker, big black guy who carried
[55:11.680 --> 55:18.040]  a bunch of people out on his back, they were there telling a doctor, suture me up, take
[55:18.040 --> 55:22.200]  care of me, do all this stuff for me, and they said, why are you in full bomb gear one
[55:22.200 --> 55:26.120]  minute after this went off, and they were told to shut up, and then Terrence Yakey called
[55:26.120 --> 55:30.080]  his partner and said, I got feds pulling me over, and then they took him and tortured
[55:30.080 --> 55:31.080]  him to death.
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.360]  Cop of the year, that's what you get for seeing the BATF on scene.
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.720]  Well, I mean, there were all kinds of things like that.
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.640]  You probably know the newscaster Connie Chung, she's actually a friend of mine from way back
[55:44.640 --> 55:45.960]  in Los Angeles.
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.440]  She was out there at Oklahoma City, she asked one question, why the fire trucks were parked
[55:50.440 --> 55:55.080]  in the blocks around the Oklahoma City bombing just before it went off, and she was immediately
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.120]  fired, thrown right off the air, just gone.
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.120]  That's right, and for those that don't know, Mike Rivera is kind of like Batman.
[56:02.120 --> 56:07.280]  He has one life he leads, and the other is this, Mike's a big Hollywood guy, we're not
[56:07.280 --> 56:08.600]  going to get into all the stuff he does.
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.240]  I look terrible in black tights, I look terrible in black tights, you don't want to see me,
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.880]  trust me on this one.
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.240]  When the criminals see me in my costume, they laugh, they don't run away scared.
[56:17.240 --> 56:22.760]  I understand what you're doing, Mike's done loss in a bunch of other big TV shows, but
[56:22.760 --> 56:27.960]  Mike getting back to, I mean, any other points you want to say on this, and we have so many
[56:27.960 --> 56:30.240]  smoking guns, it's just mind-numbing.
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.680]  Well, I think the point I want to make here is that we used to see in the old Soviet Union
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.720]  when they wanted to destroy somebody and get rid of them, they would claim they were insane,
[56:39.720 --> 56:42.840]  they'd gin up a case against them, throw them in the mental home, and that was the last
[56:42.840 --> 56:44.440]  anybody would see of them.
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.320]  Very obviously we're looking at that here, this duly, this Jean C. Dooley, looking at
[56:51.320 --> 56:57.360]  their actual CV, you know, she's a minor, minor flunky, she's not even allowed to treat
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.000]  people without a doctor being in attendance or a real psychiatrist or psychologist being
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  in attendance.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  She cannot do that kind of work with anybody.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.240]  And the FBI is well known for going out and getting minions to testify for them.
[57:09.240 --> 57:10.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[57:10.240 --> 57:14.600]  I got to tell you, I think this Jean C. Dooley is the social workers equivalent of Gerald
[57:14.600 --> 57:15.600]  Posner.
[57:15.600 --> 57:21.280]  All right, stay there, Mike, you can stay with us and finish up on the anthrax, development
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.200]  and then get into this new Gulf of Tonkin Dick Cheney, wanting to stage terror attacks
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.680]  on our own ships.
[57:26.680 --> 57:31.720]  Fantastic, we'll be right back with Mike Rivera after this quick break and news.

[1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:07.920]  the anthrax attacks in 2001, says the suicide of the government's main suspect doesn't
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:09.640]  mean the case is over.
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:14.120]  He says he wants the FBI to go public with details from its probe.
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:17.920]  Therapist Jean Dooley says Bruce Ivins described a plan to kill co-workers.
[1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:27.920]  The respondent was in a group, one of our group sessions, and he was extremely agitated
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:31.040]  out of control.
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:37.280]  The therapist, working with a late microbiologist, says she was scared to death of him.
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:42.680]  According to court testimony, she says Bruce Ivins had tried to poison people as far back
[1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.320]  as 2000.
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:47.720]  He committed suicide before being charged.

[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:56.480]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can

[1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:01.520]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.160]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is.
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.520]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:08.120]  I don't want people knowing I have this to bear a sin.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.960]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.

[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:16.760]  psoriasis.

[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:16.400]  parties are back on track.
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.720]  Negotiations between the government and the opposition broke off Monday after President
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:26.560]  Robert Mugabe's insistence that he lead any unity government.
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.600]  And pilgrims are gathered at a mountaintop temple in northern India for a festival to
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.360]  celebrate a Hindu goddess.
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:39.600]  But there are mourning the loss of 68 people, all women and children, who were killed in

[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:29.200]  Here's Keith St. Clair.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:34.320]  Christina Applegate's publicist says the actress has been diagnosed with an early form of breast
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  cancer.
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:40.440]  They detected it early through an MRI and the cancer is not life threatening.
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.760]  The 36-year-old has earned Emmy in Golden Globe nominations for her starring role in
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:49.080]  ABC's comedy, Samantha Who.
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:53.240]  Israel is sending Palestinians back to Gaza after they fled fighting there.
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:58.760]  Now, the Palestinian Minister for Political Detainees Affairs says the Palestinian president
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:00.560]  must stand up to Hamas.
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:10.880]  I think that the president, Mahmoud Abbas, must decide in this situation to act against
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  what Hamas did in Gaza Strip.
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:15.320]  And in Arizona, a 34-year-old woman has been shot to death.
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:18.480]  The suspect, her 12-year-old son.

[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:35.360]  house, the 12-year-old was outside with a small caliber handgun.
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:39.440]  He fired multiple rounds at the mother, striking her several times.
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:44.940]  Al-Qaeda is confirming the death of senior commander, top explosive and poison expert

[1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:55.840]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:57.520]  a third world nation.

[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.080]  Wilhelm Reich Orgon used cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic

[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:35.080]  We're going to be getting to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:40.120]  We have another guest popping in.
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:46.840]  Mike Rivera, I want to get into Dick Cheney, New Yorker Magazine reporter, Cy Hirsch, getting
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:51.280]  into the fact that they wanted to stage terror attacks against our ships and blaming on Iran.
[1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:54.800]  Before we do that, what should be done about this anthrax case?
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:59.960]  We have someone breaking in with ties to a foreign intelligence agency into the level
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:03.880]  four weapons lab that had this very anthrax with the FBI covering that up.
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:05.960]  They already tried to frame Stephen Hatfield.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:09.080]  That's been proven and admitted and they've lost in court.
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:10.080]  They're embarrassed.
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:12.520]  They grab a patsy, throw him in a mental institution.
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.240]  He pops up dead.
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:17.440]  The media is not even really reporting on that, it's in the bottom of the story in the
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:19.440]  LA Times.
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:23.600]  You got the White House on the drug that fights the anthrax four weeks before it shows up.
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:25.280]  They admit that arrogantly.
[1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:28.600]  The White House's enemies get mailed the anthrax.
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:29.600]  Where do you see this going?
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:30.600]  I guess case closed.
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.520]  They murdered the patsy.
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:36.760]  They absolutely did and of course, I'm not expecting the government or even the corporate
[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:40.880]  media to ever do anything about it, but we just put the word out there.
[1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:41.880]  We show the proof.
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:48.040]  We make our case that and especially after the Hatfield fiasco, the FBI's credibility
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.840]  is zilch to begin with and this is just going to crater it.
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:56.680]  We have really become the former Soviet Union because this was a common tactic by the Soviets.
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.960]  If somebody had something that was embarrassing to the government, throw them in a mental
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:00.960]  hospital.
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:04.600]  Say he's crazy so nobody will talk to him anymore and just get rid of him that way.
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:06.960]  That's exactly what they did to this Ivan.
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:10.280]  The government is desperate to close off this investigation.
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:12.080]  It's a tremendous embarrassment.
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:16.120]  It is leading towards the real culprits because of public pressure and what the public can
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.920]  do right now is just say, I don't care what the government says anymore.
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:20.440]  I'm going to keep investigating.
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:21.520]  I'm going to keep digging.
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:25.280]  I'm going to keep bringing up these facts because if the government wants to marginalize
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:31.560]  itself by continuing to lie, go ahead and let them because we're not listening anymore.
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:32.560]  Speak of the devil.
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:33.560]  Go ahead.
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:40.960]  I said the government has rendered itself irrelevant to the mainstream of American life now.
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:46.120]  Speaking of the devil, speaking of continuing to investigate, there's over 200 declassified
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  examples.
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.400]  We list many of them in terror storm, other films.
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:56.120]  The CIA's own website admits they staged terror attacks, Operation Ajax and others.
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:58.240]  The public is learning about that now.
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:03.200]  Psy Hirsch comes out, writes an article two months ago saying, yeah, Cheney is looking
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:05.520]  for pre-Texas staged events.
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:08.800]  All these other big wigs go before Congress and say that.
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:12.840]  Even Zbigniew Brzezinski comes out and warns because they all know in Washington and I
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:16.000]  guess some of them don't want World War III right now or World War IV depending on how
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.400]  you look at it.
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:22.280]  Then Psy Hirsch, a YouTube video services of him at a journalism conference, two weeks
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:27.320]  ago saying, well, we didn't put in the article that my White House source, again, he's impeccable
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:33.280]  folks, but it's disgusting now that I think this Mars, his record, he says there's 11
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:38.760]  other staged terror attacks they want, but the one he would talk about was, listen, this
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:39.760]  is huge.
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:44.680]  I keep talking about it because it's so big, but the response is even more incredible.
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:49.880]  The Dick Cheney wanted to manufacture fake Iranian blue PT boats, have Navy SEALs pull
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:56.560]  up and quote, have a shootout with the naval vessels, the larger vessels, the missile cruisers
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:01.200]  and destroyers and aircraft carriers that don't know that it's not Iranians, then then
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.120]  kill the Navy SEALs.
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:05.080]  It said kill them.
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:09.640]  This is incredible and this is just calmly reported like they're talking about the price
[1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.840]  of cheese or something in Sheffield.
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:18.400]  Well, I mean, if you go back and you look at the Art of War by Sun Tzu, he says right
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:20.600]  in there, all war is based on deception.
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:25.520]  If you go back and you study the history of any war, the country that starts it has to
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:31.680]  start it with a lie or a deception in order to get that war going, whether it's blaming
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:37.480]  a coal bunker explosion on USS Maine, on the Spanish or claiming that there were torpedoes
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:43.520]  in the Gulf of Tonkin or goading the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor and then acting
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:49.760]  like a surprise attack, all wars start with the initiating government deceiving their
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:52.600]  own people to get them into that war.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.440]  Hitler did it at Gliwitz, Bush did it at New York.
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  Here's an example.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:58.440]  Nobody ever hears about it.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:02.640]  It's in my film, The Masters of Terror and we just spent three minutes on it.
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:11.160]  As a child living in Texas, I remember being very little and going to the Pacific War Museum.
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:15.200]  Now the George H.W., it's the main national museum in Fredericksburg, Texas, it's where
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.920]  Admiral Nimitz is from.
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:22.560]  They owned a hotel that looked like a ship and of course he was the head of the Navy
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:26.000]  in the Pacific during World War II.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  So it's there.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:33.120]  And I remember going and reading and going and seeing the midget sub that said attacked
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.680]  Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7th and it was hidden in plain view and then years
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:45.480]  later CNN comes out and with the headline US actually attacked Japan, I'm not defending
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:48.760]  that all governments are bad folks, the point is it was a setup.
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:53.440]  Before midget subs attacked, they got their times off and attacked an hour early and then
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.080]  it came out, the Navy was ordered to stand down.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:01.400]  So there were submarines attacking, coming in, being sunk out at the opening to Pearl
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:05.720]  Harbor, a submarine crashing on the reef, another crashing into the side of another
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:12.800]  island, four subs trying to attack, midget subs and then there was still a stand down.
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:15.240]  Absolute open and shut fact, right there Mike.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:21.680]  Well, you know, the midget submarine that the USS Ward sunk was discovered by oceanographers
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:26.080]  off the mouth of Pearl Harbor just a couple of years ago and it was a vindication for
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:31.040]  the crew of the ward who basically spent their entire lives being told they just hallucinated
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:32.040]  the thing.
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.200]  But there were other subs, there was another that crashed that they had for 50 something
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.480]  years in Fredericksburg.
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:43.480]  Absolutely, absolutely and it came up on shore right over on Connie O'hey Bay side.
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.680]  That's where you live, Yam.
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:49.840]  Well that's where I used to live, I'm over on Pearl Harbor side now but yeah and absolutely
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.480]  and walking around, you know, O'ahu, you get to see the artifacts of a lot of the things.
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:00.320]  I've been out to Haia State Park, you can still see the foundations of the antenna system
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:05.320]  from the shortwave listening station that was there during World War II that intercepted
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:12.000]  Yamamoto's order to the fleet to sail to Hawaiian waters a week before the attack.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.600]  And you know, it's all still there if you know where to look for it.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:20.320]  In closing with this Dick Cheney story, to me it isn't even that it's come out there
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:24.040]  planning to blow up our own ships and use Navy SEALs to do it.
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:28.240]  The story is the media other than Keith Oberman and even Keith Oberman just kind of spent
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:31.240]  a minute and a half on it.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.960]  I mean to me that's a huge cover up, what do we do to get this out?
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:40.720]  Well again, we just have to stand up every time and it's like they used to say in network,
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:43.600]  I'm mad as heck and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.360]  We just have to tell the government and the media.
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:46.760]  We don't believe you anymore.
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:49.880]  We don't believe you when you say it's Arab Muslims doing this.
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:52.160]  We don't believe you when you say it's terrorism.
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:55.920]  We don't believe you when you say the nation is under threat from the Iranians.
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:56.920]  We don't believe you.
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:57.920]  You are lying.
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:01.880]  And there's another word I'd throw in there but it would shut down this year radio station.
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:05.520]  Well look, the US has more than 10,000 working nukes.
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:07.640]  Our government's owned by foreign banks now.
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:12.480]  Iran and they got one nuke is not a threat, Israel has 400, Pakistan we gave nukes to
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:14.280]  is running around threatening India.
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:17.440]  The globalists are in the business of destabilizing.
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:20.800]  America is only under threat by the people running our government.
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:24.200]  And I demand that all the neocons out there listening.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:25.520]  The country's almost gone already.
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:27.600]  They've killed our dollar and so much more.
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.960]  It's time for you to stop living in denial about the fact that George Bush is a good
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:32.960]  guy.
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.280]  We're not saying Barack Obama's good either.
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:35.280]  It's only going to get worse.
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  The point is they own both parties.
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.640]  It's time to wake up and defend the republic.
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:42.000]  We're real patriots folks.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.600]  Patriotism isn't buying into evil.
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:45.480]  Mike Rivera, you got 45 seconds.
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.640]  Well, all I can say is you need to get angry out there.
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:51.400]  I know a lot of people I talk to and I say, do you know what's going on?
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.520]  They say, yes I do but I'm afraid to do anything.
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:57.640]  Well get angry because anger kills fear and it is time to get angry.
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:14:59.960]  It is time to hate what makes you afraid.
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:04.240]  And you better realize folks, being afraid and cowering is going to make these people
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:05.240]  win.
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:06.360]  Okay, you understand?
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:08.120]  You better be afraid of not standing up.
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:10.960]  Why can't they understand that, Mike?
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:14.520]  Because the TV and the media have been telling them, you know, you really can't do anything.
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.320]  You're just part of the massive crowd and your government loves you and God wants you
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:21.320]  to sit there quietly and just let it happen.
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:22.320]  You're right, Mike.
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:23.920]  We're finishing fabled enemies in three days.
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:28.920]  If tonight you can take a one two minute deal, because you're in the film yourself and overnight
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:32.840]  it to us, talking about the new development in anthrax, we'll cut it in.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:34.360]  We only have 48 hours.
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:35.360]  Can you do that?
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:36.360]  I can do that.
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:37.360]  All right.
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:38.360]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:39.840]  He's in the new film, fabled enemies coming out September 1st.

[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:10.200]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S. hinting
[1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:15.000]  liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.080]  forcing the Yen Revolution.
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:21.800]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:26.360]  weapon causing barn yields to spike, hammering the U.S. housing market and throwing the economy
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:27.560]  into a recession.
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:31.320]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:36.600]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:37.960]  of Dollar Sales.

[1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:00.560]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:06.880]  I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:09.280]  and soups and desserts and breakfast.
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:10.520]  I love that stuff.
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:13.800]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:18.000]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.680]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:26.800]  I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of

[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:10.080]  Okay I'm going to jam in a bunch of your phone calls, always a great grab bag here right
[1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:11.080]  now.
[1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:14.240]  We're going to have a brief guest on for about 10 minutes and then phone calls for
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:18.720]  the rest of the transmission, some other important news as well as we just, oh ho hum
[1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:19.720]  mainstream news.
[1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:23.960]  We pushed it out into MSNBC, that Dick Channing was planning to blow up our own ships and
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:24.960]  blame it on Iran.
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:29.280]  Oh I guess that's pro America, that's good, we're bad because we don't want to kill our
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:30.280]  own people.
[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:34.920]  You know sort of those crazy people that keep warning and this is what's really going on.
[1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:38.480]  Then all the anthrax attacks of the government, but that's okay, the government loves us.
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:41.880]  Those founding fathers were wrong telling us don't trust them.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:46.080]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air than Mike and others.
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:47.240]  Go ahead Steve.
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:50.320]  I hate to switch subjects but I'm going to do it.
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:54.400]  This is in reference to Obama's visit to Berlin, the truth didn't come down.
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:56.600]  Recalled for a new world order, that one?
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:58.100]  Yes sir.
[1:20:58.100 --> 1:21:03.200]  The situation was that there was a protest ban and anybody who protested was summarily
[1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:04.200]  arrested.
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:05.200]  Yeah that's freedom.
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:10.720]  It's the same way at the DNC and the RNC, banning protests is what America is all about.
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:15.280]  And the situation is that the police would come in, they had to hide their signs, their
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:17.440]  banners under their clothes that they couldn't bring in.
[1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.440]  Because Lord Obama said no signs allowed, that's freedom.
[1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:23.960]  See everything George Bush has done is everything Bill Clinton did and it's going to continue
[1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:25.600]  under Barack Obama.
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:28.840]  Right, but you're not mentioning the clacks that were hired.
[1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:38.400]  They have pictures of German actors and actresses dressed up as U.S. Army personnel, supporting
[1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:41.240]  enthusiastically supporting Mr. Obama.
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:43.240]  Now the situation is where they get the uniform.
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:48.520]  By the way the BBC reported five years ago, the Queen of England claims she goes to Africa
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:54.160]  but really she gets on sound sets with fake Africans and then says, oh look I'm in Africa
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:57.520]  on her tour to Africa, I'm not, that's how dumb they think you are.
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:21:58.520]  But sorry.
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:01.160]  Now what's your proof that the troops were fake?
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:02.160]  The troops were fake.
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:05.760]  Go to the Spiegel online, there's a photo series there.
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:06.760]  There's also...
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:08.480]  Is there a Spiegel saying I was fake?
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:10.080]  Yes sir, that's an English, that's for you.
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:12.360]  No, that's their biggest magazine, I know.
[1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:17.600]  Yeah right, but they originally, they lifted the photos from their target Spiegel.
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:22.640]  That's the Berlin newspaper, but it's the exact same paper, pictures from the paper.
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:27.040]  And this situation here, the protest is...
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.440]  No, he's going to save you.
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:31.440]  No, no, they were protested.
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.360]  Barack Obama called for a world government, that's good.
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:35.360]  That doesn't exist.
[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.040]  No, no, no, no world order.
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:44.800]  These protestors, they were protesting against the use of uranium shells in Afghanistan.
[1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:47.440]  How dare them, they're terrorists, arrest them all.
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:49.880]  How dare them think they've got free speech?
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:53.720]  I'm glad they've banned protest, period, at the RNC and are restricting them to free
[1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:54.720]  speech zones.
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:57.800]  Nobody can see at the DNC, that's where I'm going to cover it live here.
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:03.440]  That's America, our veterans fought and died so there wouldn't be free speech, it's good.
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.160]  How dare you say it's not, unbelievable.
[1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:09.160]  Arrest that man immediately, Mike and Denver.
[1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:11.280]  Hey, how's it going, Alec?
[1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:12.280]  Pretty good.
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:14.240]  What do you think of the last hour and a half, power packed info?
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:16.920]  Wow, just craziness going on.
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.320]  You know, my brother and I, I just want to let you know, we do everything we can here
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:24.400]  out in Colorado, spread the word and get out DVDs.
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:26.800]  Her brother's got his own truth channel going on.
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:27.800]  Well done.
[1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:31.320]  Hey, I had a question for you, it's just hypothetical.
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:38.200]  You know, let's say the dollar crashes and everything goes to handbasket in America.
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:40.760]  Well, it's already crashed because that's the policy.
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.560]  Already down by over 60% overseas.
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:48.360]  It's going down by 15% a year here compounded, but it's freedom, you know, it's good.
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:50.720]  It doesn't exist, everything's fine.
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:53.360]  No one knows why gas prices went up and are still up.
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:54.600]  That's for sure.
[1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:56.000]  We know why, but hey, so what?
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.080]  We know basically all the basics, but why listen to us?
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:00.080]  We're always right.
[1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:05.600]  But anyways, it's say they do a commercial law here in America, no, no, it'll be emergency
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:06.600]  for your safety.
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  Yeah, emergency.
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:09.400]  They declare emergency for your safety.
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:13.000]  Do you think they already have it all planned out where they're going to shut everything
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  down roadblocks?
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.080]  Well, I feel they get somewhere you think no, no, it's going to be slow motion, just
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:21.960]  like they first confiscate guns in New Orleans, now in Illinois, there's an actual guard to
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:24.280]  confiscate guns and put it on NBC News.
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.480]  It's just as though it's good.
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:27.080]  Oh, we take your kids for no reason.
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:28.360]  Oh, we put cameras up.
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:29.760]  Oh, we're tripling in the cops.
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:32.880]  Oh, we're running domestic checkpoints everywhere under with federal grants.
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:34.360]  Oh, we're taking your blood at checkpoints.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:35.360]  Oh, it's freedom.
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:40.080]  Oh, so all of a sudden it'll be like, oh, why can't I get here without one ID?
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:43.480]  Well, they're already scanning your, your, your, your plates, tracking everywhere you
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:44.480]  go.
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.880]  Use your cell phone tracker everywhere you go.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:49.280]  Google admits they dial into any computer they want, watch you with the video cameras
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:51.240]  built in in the audio and brag about it.
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:52.960]  Oh, I see it happening everywhere.
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.760]  Now that you bring it up, I see it everywhere.
[1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:55.760]  It's all freedom, sir.
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:56.760]  That's freedom.
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.760]  Yeah.
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:00.200]  It's all good to hear from you.
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:04.080]  I mean, a little sarcastic and I apologize right now, Carla in Florida, you're on the
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:05.080]  air.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.280]  Go ahead, Carla.
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  Hello, madam.
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:10.080]  Hi, this is me.
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:11.080]  Hello, Carla.
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:12.080]  Yeah, hi.
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:17.760]  I want to speak to you about Nancy Pelosi and the stuff she pulled Friday in the house.
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:18.760]  Okay.
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:20.760]  I'll tell you what, the representatives were furious.
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:21.760]  Oh, she's saving us.
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:22.760]  What is she doing?
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:24.560]  Well, she shut down the whole house.
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:26.760]  They were trying to vote on the all situation.
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:29.760]  Well, we're not allowed to drill for our own oil.
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:36.640]  I mean, listen, listen, listen, Bush could have opened that oil up back when he had the
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:38.200]  control of the House and Senate.
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.160]  The oil companies don't want it opened up.
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:44.560]  They want select areas for them or there'll be too much oil and they won't make big profits.
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:47.840]  It's called two words, artificial scarcity.
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:52.160]  There's more than double discovered oil in Alaska that is in Saudi Arabia.
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:53.960]  We're not getting it.
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:57.320]  Just someone like Congressman baggage tries to get it open up, his plane's going to blow
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:25:58.320]  up.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:25:59.320]  Okay.
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:03.240]  I'm going to be interviewing his son about to beat Ted Stevens for Senate tomorrow.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:06.960]  Anyways, and it's all a big scam.
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:10.520]  The first thing Bush did when he got into office was give thousands of square miles
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:14.160]  of our coastline to Mexico and allows them to drill.
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:19.920]  Pemex can drill because, see, the Mexicans have got to pay 50, 60, 70 cents a gallon.
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:23.600]  Only Schmuck Americans are supposed to pay $4 a gallon.
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.240]  It's all a staged event.
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:26.640]  Let's jam in one more.
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:29.520]  Ryan in Austin, you're on the air.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:31.120]  Ron Caller, sorry, call back.
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.440]  Ryan in Austin, you're on the air.
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:33.440]  Go ahead.
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:34.920]  Hey, I got a question for you.
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:41.600]  So if there's a provocation of war with Iran, does the United States government have the
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:46.960]  power to put the elections on hold and just keep Bush in office?
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.840]  Yeah, but why should they do that?
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.680]  Because they can fool the public into believing in the government again by giving you a Barack
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:54.480]  Obama or a John McCain.
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:55.480]  They're puppets.
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.480]  They run nothing.
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:57.480]  They're nobodies.
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:26:59.880]  They're there to make you think that you're electing somebody.
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:01.920]  It's all a big curtain.
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:07.760]  The elections, the DNC, the RNC is all a big distraction, fly paper, that the American
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:10.760]  people get stuck in and never looking behind the curtain.
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:12.760]  It's all a big diversion.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:13.760]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:14.760]  Thank you so much.
[1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.880]  Oh, let's jam one more.
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:19.560]  And Stephen, you're on the air worldwide from New York.
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:25.920]  I'd like to inform you about a special style that they call an anti-terrorism in New York.
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:26.920]  Oh, yeah.
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:27.920]  Were they run checkpoints at the top of everybody?
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  No.
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:29.920]  It's something totally different.
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:34.960]  So last week, I was walking down the street, and then I see one of these officers all
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:41.880]  rambled out, you know, the body armor, gigantic gun, I don't know, the sub machine on the
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:45.200]  automatic outside the Bloomberg building in New York.
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:49.680]  So I walk in the building, and I ask one of the guards, like, what's going on?
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:52.960]  What are these guys doing all rambled out with a gun?
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:58.200]  And then he was like, just like, it's some sort of just seagull that just pops out.
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:03.440]  He's like, oh, yeah, they just do it every week, every week.
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.840]  And then after that, I just step outside, and then it's like, you know, like in sci-fi,
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.760]  they do that commercial thing where the crowds are walking around, and the guy just turns
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:16.480]  into an angel, and everybody's just like, like it's nothing.
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:17.920]  I'm just looking around.
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.440]  These guys are just on the corner in front of buildings with gigantic guns, and they're
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  like, just doing nothing.
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:28.240]  All of the, I hear you, all of the anti-terror drills are to train you for martial law and
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.400]  to see guys in black uniforms with machine guns and checkpoints.
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:33.080]  It's to train you how to be a slave.
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:34.880]  We'll be right back with our next guest.
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:50.920]  He got arrested for sticking to prisonplanet.com sticker inside an airplane.
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:52.440]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:56.140]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[1:28:56.140 --> 1:29:00.400]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:02.160]  huge political voting block.
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:06.160]  Our agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:09.960]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:10.960]  of conscience.
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:14.520]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:15.600]  be kept separate.
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:19.760]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:22.320]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:26.200]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:27.620]  intolerance resulted.
[1:29:27.620 --> 1:29:31.520]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:33.960]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.760]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:38.600]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.

[1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:05.600]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world

[1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:10.160]  Robo, a Worster native, has been charged with interfering with aircraft operation and disorder
[1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:11.160]  of conduct.
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:17.040]  He allegedly left a politically charged message on a sticker inside a Delta Plains bathroom.
[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:21.640]  According to the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, after Robo left the bathroom, a flight
[1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:23.120]  attendant went in.
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:29.480]  She found an adhesive address label that read 9-11 was an inside job, prisonplanet.com.
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:33.640]  After he was seen running off the flight before takeoff, he was found by state police and
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:39.040]  upon being taken into custody, made statements indicating that the stickers were a joke.
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:44.960]  The only truth to any of this is the half truth that I said this is a joke.
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:48.040]  Them arresting me is why I referred to as a joke.
[1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:52.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and again, I want to tell my listeners, and I'm not personally
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:59.840]  mad at Jason Robo, you know, he's been one of the heads of his college and student government.
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:01.320]  He doesn't have a record.
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:04.200]  He writes a lot of great blogs and news stories since we learned of him.
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:05.760]  We checked into him.
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:11.920]  We found out about this Friday morning, but basically he ran off the plane from what I've
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:15.600]  seen in the news after they started freaking out about it and questioning him.
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:19.680]  And still in this heightened system where they have all these drills and alerts to scare
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:25.000]  the public into submission, and he's there trying to expose, they're the ones that stage
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.360]  the attacks at Boston Logan Airport, by the way.
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:31.160]  That's where some of the operatives that thought they were taking part in drills got on the
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:35.400]  planes that were then taken over by remote control, all the evidence shows, and we cover
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:39.320]  that in my film, Marshall Law, 9-1-1 Rise the Police State.
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:46.160]  But he's now been charged with this, and so we go to Jason Robo.
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:50.000]  Jason, I'm really sorry you're getting a lot of trouble here.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.320]  They are going overboard, but at the same time, they can at least try to claim that
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:34:58.040]  it's vandalism.
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:03.240]  The exaggeration here is that, you know, they're trying to slap all these other charges on
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:04.240]  you.
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:07.320]  The reason why is for my listeners to get in trouble.
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:09.800]  And I hope that you get out of this thing.
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:14.840]  But this is a world where an old lady won't take a drink out of her, you know, or a mother
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.040]  won't take a drink out of her own breast milk to prove it's breast milk.
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:19.040]  They beat her up.
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.760]  I mean, they kill people at the TSA all the time, beat them to death in the back hall.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:28.280]  So I'm just worried about you, my friend, you're lucky you got out of there in one piece.
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:32.120]  But directly from the horse's mouth, we have Jason Robo.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:33.760]  Jason, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:35.240]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:36.240]  Okay.
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:39.040]  What really happened versus what we're hearing in the media?
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:45.040]  Well, just to go with the main things that they're distorting and lying about is I never
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.440]  ran off of the plane.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:47.880]  Everybody was ordered off the plane.
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:50.160]  Also, I never said the stickers were a joke.
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:52.280]  I take the truth moving and incredibly serious.
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  Oh, stop.
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:54.280]  My goodness.
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:55.280]  We just got a hold of you today.
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:36:00.640]  That is huge news that they ordered people off the plane, but they claimed you ran off
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:02.360]  and scared everybody.
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:04.480]  That is a huge issue when you go to court.
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  Go ahead.
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:06.480]  Yeah.
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:10.000]  So, and then they, you know, they're putting words on my mouth saying that I said the stickers
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  were a joke.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:16.080]  And they also, you know, say that I had nervous behavior and such, and I was perfectly calm.
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:17.080]  I was just reading a book.
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:21.000]  I chatted a little bit with my neighbors about, like, they read something about in Time magazine,
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.200]  Michael Savage's opinion on autism, start talking about the thymus roll and the vaccines,
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:27.800]  the mercury, which they're familiar with.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:30.760]  And then I know we're told the flight was delayed for non-threatening stickers.
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:37.360]  The captain read aloud what the sticker said, and it was a 9-11 was an inside job, PrismPlanet.com.
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:40.280]  And the captain assured passengers it was just political.
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:41.280]  Nobody fretted.
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:45.960]  There's a couple near me that got a kick out of it being read out loud, you know, good
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:48.000]  advertising, I suppose.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.400]  Some passengers started pulling out cameras to actually record what the captain was saying.
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:56.160]  And they let us know that bag sweep would be conducted shortly, and that we were still
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.160]  clear to take off.
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:00.880]  And anybody uncomfortable could get on another flight, but nobody cared.
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:03.000]  I didn't see anybody get up and exit the flight.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.480]  People just, you know, started conversing with each other, just trying to kill time.
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:10.160]  And I guess, apparently, after they'd conducted the sweep or during it, they found a couple
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:12.040]  more of these stickers.
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:16.680]  So they gone, you know, the PA instead of they do a second sweep, and our delay would
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:19.920]  now add up to about an hour and 15 minutes plus.
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:24.160]  So some passengers' concern, like myself, about missing connections, you know, started
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:27.200]  the wonder what was going on with their own travel plans.
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:30.520]  And then the captain said, you know, we could make up for lost time, but didn't elaborate
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:32.120]  on exactly how much.
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:34.400]  So the only concern I've seen was regarding connections.
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:35.400]  No danger.
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:37.040]  People didn't seem scared at all.
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:41.800]  And assurances started to escalate concern by the captain, but still people were relaxed.
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:46.360]  I called a stewardess who became immediately concerned with my T-shirt.
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:52.440]  My T-shirt was a double-faced shirt, I think Bullish and Hitler were on it, and the shirt
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:57.400]  said, oil, wellion, double-speak, you know, a playoff of Orwell, oil, wellion.
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:00.280]  And then she just disappeared, wouldn't even let me ask a question.
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:03.800]  So I pushed the button again to ask about the ETA.
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:08.200]  Just before the captain began to ask the passengers to get off for a full sweep of the craft.
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:10.600]  So then everybody exited in orderly fashion.
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:14.000]  So as I get out, you know, I'm in the, you know, two-thirds of the way in the back of
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.960]  the plane, so a ton of people got out before me.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:19.920]  It was impossible that I could have ran off the plane, and like I said, they completely
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:22.040]  fabricated my behavior.
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.240]  Like I said, there was 30 people at the gate, and I logically went to another one, not one
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:27.240]  of the sheeple.
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:30.360]  I think for myself, I went and I asked somebody how I could arrange another flight, got a
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:34.000]  morning flight arranged for the next day, comped the hotel room, and told to pick up
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.520]  the papers at a ticket counter.
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:40.960]  I was told to pick up my bag at claim four after I got my papers for the hotel room.
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:45.640]  And then the belt started moving, the conveyor, as it suddenly abruptly stopped, and all
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:47.920]  the lights around kind of started to turn off.
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:52.440]  And then I was surrounded by more than a dozen TSA and state police as I was just sitting
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:54.720]  minding around business on an empty baggage cart.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:59.280]  And without giving any cause, they grabbed me, daring me to resist arrest, and the police
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.560]  brutality that you cover, like the 16-year-old who magically fell 30 feet and was tased with
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:07.600]  a broken neck 19 times, you know, I thought about that, and you know, I cooperated to avoid
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:11.200]  being beaten or tased to death in front of all these strangers waiting to get their bags.
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:14.960]  So being dragged away, I said that the actions that they were taking, arresting me without
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:17.280]  any due process, was a joke.
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:22.120]  So in the cruiser, as they, you know, were taking me to an unknown location, the cop
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:23.120]  wouldn't explain anything.
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:24.760]  They repeatedly yelled to shut up.
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:27.760]  Well, the reason, let me stop you, let's go back and then finish the second part of
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:28.760]  the story.
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:29.760]  Yeah.
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:30.760]  The reason they want to say it is a joke.
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:34.920]  They want to claim you did a prank to do that to the planes, they have something to
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:35.920]  charge you with.
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:40.680]  If not, if there's no damage from the sticker, they really have nothing here.
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:44.480]  And so they're going to try to make you plea bargain, you know, by the time this is all
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:45.480]  done.
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.560]  And another example, like when they shut I-35 down over a small cardboard box that blew
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:51.840]  out of a car north of Austin.
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:54.400]  This is the land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:56.240]  I mean, this is unbuttoned.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:00.040]  Now that I hear your story, we got to get an article out on InfoWords and Prison Planet
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:01.040]  tomorrow morning.
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:06.280]  As soon as my writers can do this, this is a story of a media hoax, them taking a Prison
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.000]  Planet dot com sticker.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.600]  Now was it handmade like they said?
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:10.600]  Or was it?
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:12.000]  It was a handwritten sticker.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Okay.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Handwritten.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  And what exactly did it say?
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.600]  It said 9-Eleven was an inside job, PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  Okay.
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:21.640]  Because we actually put out a sticker that says that as well.
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:24.480]  And so, so let's go back.
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:25.600]  Now they've had their hysteria.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.040]  Now they've put it on national news.
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:29.200]  They get to have some fear.
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:31.200]  Scores of newspapers attacking.
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:32.400]  They get to scare everybody.
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:34.040]  These 9-Eleven truthers are evil.
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:38.360]  They've exaggerated it all, absconded with the truth, engaged in a lie.
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:39.360]  You're in the car.
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  He's screaming, shut up.
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:41.360]  Yeah.
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:42.360]  He's yelling at me to shut up.
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:46.160]  There's some questions about what the heck's going on, and I was trying to be polite despite
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.960]  the situation, dressing him as sir, even though he was treating me incredibly rudely and
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:50.960]  with absolute disrespect.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:51.960]  Well, don't worry.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  They're going to get his pension fund.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:53.960]  His bosses are going to get him.
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  Yeah.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.880]  And so I responded to him because he was basically threatening me with the meaner that he treated
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:40:59.880]  me.
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:01.600]  And I couldn't help but say, you know, what are you going to do?
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:03.480]  Pull me over and tease me.
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:07.160]  And so they get me into this barracks and they throw me in this holding cage and they
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:11.080]  start searching my carry-on bag saying that I deserved this without explaining what this
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:12.080]  was.
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:17.160]  I was refused access to a lawyer despite numerous times I requested that or a phone call.
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:18.840]  They didn't read me my rights.
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:24.160]  One cop yelled saying that I have to get off this plane right now and I ran off the plane
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:25.160]  by myself.
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:26.800]  So they're the liars.
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:27.800]  That's what they do.
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:28.800]  I mean, it's congenital.
[1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:29.800]  Lying.
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:30.800]  I just like it.
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  Just came out in New York.
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:32.800]  Bike riders.
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:33.800]  The cop runs 15 feet.
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:34.800]  Tackles a guy.
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:35.800]  Bus is head open.
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:36.800]  Charges him with the tack on the cop.
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:37.800]  Now the cop's fired.
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:38.800]  It's come out alive.
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  The lying has got to stop.
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:43.360]  I had a critical mass and actually happened up in Humboldt County in Northern California
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:48.240]  where I go to school there as a student I knew that was slammed, picked up off of her
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:49.800]  bike and slammed on the ground.
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:50.800]  A young woman actually.
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:52.320]  Was she then charged with attacking them?
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:53.320]  Yes, of course.
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:54.320]  That's how they op.
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.320]  Okay.
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:56.320]  That's how they get it all on videos.
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:41:57.320]  We can fire each and every one of these criminals.
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:41:59.960]  Now let's go back here and find out exactly.
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  So you're in there.
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:04.280]  They're saying you ran off the plane by yourself trying to create more false crimes, which
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:05.280]  they've now charged you with.
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  Please continue.
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:09.320]  And then they start telling me that I said the stickers were a joke.
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.320]  I never did so.
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:11.320]  Twisting my words.
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:15.920]  Well, and then they started frisking me and they joked actually that TSA was pointless.
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:18.640]  They said, oh, like we trust those guys.
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.720]  And which just confirms that the whole, you know, security screening is just a psychological
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:23.720]  thing.
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:24.720]  We're not staying there.
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:25.720]  I want to finish with your reigning and indictment.

[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:53.080]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:56.720]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:57.720]  been robbed.
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:44:58.720]  How so, Clyde?
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:01.920]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:05.560]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your card is
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:06.720]  still in your purse.
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:07.720]  Just watch.
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:09.880]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:11.320]  You gotta be kidding me.
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:15.960]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:18.440]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:19.440]  Why?
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:20.920]  What's identity stronghold?
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:22.520]  They make the secure sleeve.
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:26.040]  When people keep their credit cards in the shield at secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.160]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:30.160]  No way.
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:33.560]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:36.200]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:37.200]  I already got some.
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:39.560]  I also got some to fit our passports.

[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:53.200]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:57.720]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Nonixman.
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:45:58.720]  He's in a dive.
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:02.000]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Let's go look.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:07.120]  I'm Nonixman, and your toenails need Nonixnail gel.
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:08.880]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:09.880]  Take them out.
[1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:10.880]  Let's see them.
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:15.320]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:16.320]  Don't worry.
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:18.080]  Now there's Nonixnail gel.
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.440]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:25.360]  Oh, I will, Nonixman.
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:26.360]  Great.
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:29.640]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:34.480]  Don't let Nonixman find you with unsightly toenails.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:38.480]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed, Nonixnail gel.
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:45.000]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Longs, Meyer, Giant Eagle,
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  Car Drug, Sniders, Dwayne Reed, Milo, and Ride Aid.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.480]  Are you tired of searching for Crick Talk Radio?
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:57.720]  Well, search no more.
[1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:04.720]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:17.640]  Okay, we've got some questions for Jason Robo, the PrisonPlanet.com bumper sticker thought
[1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:18.640]  criminal.
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:23.640]  From Forest in California, we'll get to Lisa and others, 877-590-5525.
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:31.640]  We've got a few open lines here out of the show, 877-590-5525, or 836-590.
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:37.760]  We're listening to our flagship that we come to you from, is Radio 590KLBJ.
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:46.960]  Jason, so now you're in there being interrogated, they're setting you up, they're lying, claiming
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:52.120]  you've done all these things, and again, folks, in my new film, I have Newark cops saying
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:56.440]  they're going to say that bombs are on 9-11 truthers to charge us for terrorism.
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:01.000]  I mean, that's criminal, not saying all police are like that, but when cops start trying
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.600]  to frame people on video, it shows the criminality has gotten so, so widespread that they just
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  think it's normal.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:11.720]  So that's what we were talking about, all this footage coming out of police beating
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:13.960]  people up for no reason and then charging them with a salt.
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:18.200]  I mean, it's not enough, you beat us up and you charge us, but the tapes are coming out.
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:22.040]  But so they start setting you up lying, showing you did things you didn't do that I bought
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  into, leaving the mainstream media.
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:25.040]  Finish up, Jason.
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:29.320]  Yeah, and like I said, they were joking, the TSA was a joke, they were not safe, it's
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:33.880]  just to get us to pay theme park prices for these businesses beyond security.
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.760]  Anyways, after asking for a lawyer repeatedly, I lost count on how many times they remember
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:43.880]  that pesky habeas corpus thing, and they read me my rights, I was booked without charges
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:49.680]  being explained, and then a detective came in, apparently part of a private firm, and
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:53.960]  he shook the stickers in my face, telling me to look in his eyes while he was waving
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:55.920]  things in my face, asking if they were mine.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:59.520]  I told him I wouldn't speak to him since my words were already being manipulated, saying
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:05.360]  you know, they said I said the stickers were a joke, and so I asked for a lawyer again.
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:09.560]  And so the detective got even more rude than anyone I dealt with, wouldn't answer any of
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:13.680]  my questions since I wouldn't answer any of his acting like a kid, and despite the fact
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:15.640]  that he wasn't being charged with anything.
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:20.440]  So he said that I wasn't actually booked properly, so then he rebooked me, started out reading
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:23.720]  charges, listing them off, flipping through his little booklet, and like it was a game
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:26.520]  laughing to himself as he picked out of the charges.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:29.560]  Yeah, it's fun ruining people's lives, but don't worry, it's going to happen to them,
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:32.440]  not by our hands, the system they love.
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:36.280]  When you're down at 45 of those vaccines you took, full of cancer viruses, you won't be
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:37.280]  laughing anymore.
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.800]  Yeah, and so I was told I couldn't speak to a lawyer, I was first told I couldn't speak
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:44.480]  to a lawyer until after they booked me, and now they're telling me I couldn't speak to
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:46.360]  a lawyer until I had a bail hearing that night.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:47.360]  I think it's important that...
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  Oh, by the way, I want to stop you.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:53.160]  A big mainstream news article, a newscast admitting that the vaccines are killing the
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:54.160]  troops.
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:55.160]  I mean, killing them.
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:56.160]  They bleed out like a bola.
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:58.120]  I'm going to be talking about that Monday.
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:00.480]  We're not joking when we say that.
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:01.480]  Go ahead.
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:06.360]  And so I was told I couldn't have a lawyer until they scheduled a bail hearing, and I
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:09.880]  finished the bail hearing now, and it's important to note that actually I was on video
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:12.240]  audio surveillance this whole time.
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:18.280]  So I should be able to acquire this evidence as proof of the way they handled me.
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:23.800]  So my check-in bag, they started searching that, as the detective told the cop under
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:25.600]  him to put me into a holding cell.
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:29.400]  They finally let me make a phone call so I could let my girlfriend know what was going
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.280]  on, and then they dragged me into a cell while I was being dragged into a cell, a cop joked
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:36.920]  that I could have called a lawyer, and then I'm being taunted by this phone that's right
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:41.000]  outside my cell, he places me in, and told that he'll let me call eventually and give
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  me a number.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.480]  So they literally took the shirt off of my back, Alex, as evidence, and then they conduct
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:49.480]  that degrading cavity search and dehumanize you to make you feel like an animal.
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:51.320]  Oh, so they did the pervert thing they like.
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:53.760]  Yeah, yeah, sick stuff.
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:58.440]  And so hours later, I'm sitting in a cell pacing and getting stir crazy.
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:02.120]  Without talking to a lawyer, I had my bail hearing finally, the only reasonable person
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:07.360]  I dealt with, he gave me $40 bail, I had $118 to my name, I don't use banks, I don't know
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  anybody really in Boston.
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:09.360]  So how did it all end?
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:10.360]  We're almost out of time.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:11.360]  I want to take some calls.
[1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:14.800]  I don't have my own recognizance, they told me they didn't take anything else except for
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:15.800]  my t-shirt.
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:18.440]  Now, what are all the arts crimes you're charged with?
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:22.280]  They charged me with disorderly conduct, disorderly conduct on public conveyance and interference
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:23.280]  with a flight crew.
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:24.880]  But let me just get one thing in.
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:28.840]  But you did not interfere with the flight crew, and boy, that's the big charge.
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:33.000]  Yeah, they blew that proportion, they interfered with themselves, which is very interesting
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  paradox.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.800]  But when I got back to the hotel, I couldn't go through all my belongings, they told me
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:37.800]  I only took my shirt.
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:39.720]  I found out they took my phone book.
[1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:44.760]  So the next day when I went to my bail hearing, or yeah, my arraignment, I went to that, and
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:50.480]  I got back to the airport area, and when I went to the troopers office or the barracks,
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:54.120]  and I asked, you know, I can't find my phone book, and they said, oh yeah, we kept that,
[1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:55.880]  and the FBI picked it up while I was there.
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:00.160]  So that means everybody that I know has all been, you know, put in some kind of a database,
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:03.200]  of course, and I'm really outraged with that, especially.
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:06.280]  Don't worry, the government they love is destroying the dollar, the country's about
[1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:10.120]  to completely implode, everything they love, everything they've worshipped, they think they
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:14.280]  can just dish evil out on us, evil's going to be dished back by their lovers, and that's
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:15.280]  their loving government.
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:19.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Forest in California, you're on the air with the thought criminal
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:20.440]  Jason Robo.
[1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:21.440]  Howdy Alex.
[1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:22.440]  Hello.
[1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:23.440]  And Jason, are you from Boston?
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:24.440]  I was born in Worcester.
[1:52:24.440 --> 1:52:35.440]  Oh, cool, yeah, I'm originally from East Boston, and the South, but yeah, man, I'm
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:40.960]  moved back to California because things were getting rough out there in Boston, man, with
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.460]  the tyranny and socialism.
[1:52:42.460 --> 1:52:48.240]  Well, on your taxes, they come in and count your socks, your watches, for the income taxes,
[1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:53.240]  they tax you and you own each year, and I made fun of Massachusetts, but now in Austin
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:57.400]  if you own a business in Texas, they come as a new taxing authority and look at all
[1:52:57.400 --> 1:52:59.800]  your goods and charge you for them each year.
[1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:01.200]  Man, yeah, so no.
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:04.160]  No judge, no warrant, just total cesspit, third world.
[1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:05.160]  Right.
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:11.240]  So I believe all of us in the truth movement, if we just stick to the story that we believe
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:16.400]  in the beauty of nationalism, that it transcends like all races because of the beauty of America,
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:21.320]  it's not about any race, it's about like all these beautiful people who, so all it's
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:26.840]  about with these stickers and wearing these shirts, I mean, I believe that our first
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:28.480]  amendment rights should be protected.
[1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:32.080]  Well, not to, I'm going to be clear here, I think you ought to get a ticket or something,
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:35.480]  I think you weren't thinking and sticking a sticker in there, it would have been okay
[1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:40.640]  for you to leave some stickers, you know, in the area where the magazines go or something
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:44.080]  like that, they probably would have made something up with that too, but we just, I don't want,
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:48.200]  I don't want our listeners getting in trouble, so I would say, Jason, that, you know, this
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:52.680]  can be an example for others, I mean, I get calls from New Zealand and Canada going, how
[1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:56.960]  dare you put DVDs on everybody's car and I love it as an inside job, how dare you spray
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:01.680]  paint government buildings, infowars.com, you know, it's my listeners doing it, and
[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:05.480]  I've said, I don't want you guys getting in trouble, so be careful.
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:07.840]  Thank you for the call, I appreciate it.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:11.200]  We'll talk to you in the future, you're welcome to call in sometime during the show tomorrow,
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:15.400]  in fact, we'll try to call you and set you up to pop back in with new developments tomorrow
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:20.920]  on the weekday show from 11 to 3, and we'll be praying for you, Jason Robo, as this develops.
[1:54:20.920 --> 1:54:23.560]  You want to give out a website or something or some of your articles you write are?
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:29.120]  Yeah, I want MySpace, you can just look my name up, Jason Robo, R-O-B-O, and I got an
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:32.560]  email I set up for anybody who wishes to support me, I saw some people who wanted to maybe
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:36.960]  help me with the fence, or it knows if there's any pro bono lawyers or anybody wants to help
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:40.880]  me, trying to get someone to fight this and the injustice that occurred, and an email
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:46.880]  that I have is innocent until proven guilty, one word, at live.com.
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:48.680]  Innocent until proven guilty at live.com.
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:50.200]  Thank you so much, and we'll talk to you soon.
[1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:51.680]  All right, thanks, Alex.
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:55.080]  And again, I don't like seeing my people getting caught in the jaws of this, don't do stupid
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.440]  things that let them throw the book at you, okay, don't worry.
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:00.760]  They're going to get hurt bad enough by their own system.
[1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:05.280]  Their own masters are going to hurt them real bad, and I feel sorry for them, okay?
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.600]  Don't worry, you're going to get your new world order, boys, and you're going to wish
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:11.760]  to God you'd have woken up earlier.
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:15.880]  Again, today we documented the government launched the anthrax attacks, and it's now
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:20.080]  come out mainstream news, thanks to my listeners, that Dick Cheney planned to attack naval vessels
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:22.600]  with Navy SEALs and blame it on Iran.
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:26.360]  That's who you're working for, this government's bankrupt.
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:28.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lisa and Austin.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:29.520]  Lisa, you're on the air.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:30.520]  Last caller we have time for.
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:31.520]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:36.680]  I drive a cab in Austin, Texas, and this week I was parked at 6th and San Jack waiting
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:37.680]  on a fare.
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:40.080]  This is, I mean, sorry, 6th and Congress.
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:44.720]  They're in front of the Starbucks waiting for a fare, and a cop car goes down the street
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.960]  heading down Congress, stops in front of, at 6th and Congress, in front of the metro
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:53.160]  bus stop there, and he's got his window down.
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:56.080]  There's two officers in the car, and they've got their window down, which I thought was
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:03.360]  a little unusual, but not terribly, so they slow down real slow, like they're stopping
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:08.080]  under red light, and the cop stick his arm out, the window, and I see a flash, and I'm
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:09.080]  thinking, was that a camera?
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:13.160]  So I'm looking in, if I can see anything, and sure enough, it happens again.
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:18.960]  There's a cop taking pictures of the people at the bus stop, and he just continues on
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:19.960]  like nothing's happening.
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.200]  To put us all in files, it's all about secret policing.
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:24.200]  They're all being federalized.
[1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:25.200]  Thank you for the call.
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:29.920]  Meme all the borders wide open, rocket attacks, truck bombs going off in Dallas, Mexican troops
[1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:36.000]  hired by the CIA, and a drug war killing their competition, oh God help us.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.760]  And so you've all lived in denial, it's just going to get worse and worse until we turn
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:41.880]  around and admit this country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:45.720]  Boston Globe, since Alex Jones' the memory hole, I noticed the Boston Globe and other
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:50.560]  New England papers mentioned the bumper sticker, and said it was the website of syndicated
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.840]  radio columnist Alex Jones.
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:57.080]  And then I noticed yesterday that they'd taken my name and the website out of a bunch of
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  news stories.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:02.400]  Well, we were able to get a Google cache of the article and show that they're going
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:08.200]  in the memory hole out of 1984 and cutting us out of it.
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:12.040]  So another example, hey, cat's out of the bag, you're not going to stop us establishing
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:13.040]  media.
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:16.320]  That's what the newspaper circulates down on more than 60 percent, why TV viewership's
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:18.800]  plunging and alternative media is exploding.
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:22.200]  You can even try to shut the web down with internet too, but it's too late for you.
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:23.200]  You are failing.
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:27.960]  You can even kill people like me individually, but you can't kill ideas because they're bullet
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:28.960]  proof.
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:29.960]  God bless you all.
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:30.960]  Have a great week.
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:35.320]  Now get out there and take on tyranny and stand up for the red, white, and blue and Liberty
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:36.320]  Worldwide.
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:37.320]  God bless you all.
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:38.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:14.520]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:17.080]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:20.280]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:26.280]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:28.240]  purchasing power.
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:34.440]  Find your answer at Midas Resources, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:40.720]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:42.200]  Why should we fire Congress?
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:45.640]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:48.120]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[1:58:48.120 --> 1:58:50.760]  That was their employment document.
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:51.760]  They haven't followed it.
[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:53.760]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired.
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:55.480]  Washington, you're fired.
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:57.960]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[1:58:57.960 --> 1:59:01.040]  Washington, you're fired, was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:04.520]  political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:09.000]  Washington, you're fired, examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster,
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:13.680]  the President's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court, the illegal
[1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:18.120]  wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills,
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:20.920]  how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:24.920]  Washington, you're fired, captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:28.840]  Kim Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:30.760]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:32.280]  Help take back our government now.
[1:59:32.280 --> 1:59:36.560]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.
[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:38.320]  We have a plan to take back our government.
