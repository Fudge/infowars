[01:11.960 --> 01:18.560]  really break down the absolute complete and total takeover of the United
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.640]  States and the the breaking of the back of the Republic the fall of the Republic
[01:23.640 --> 01:28.680]  and the amnesty bill they're gonna ram through the global warming bill global

[01:32.760 --> 01:38.880]  total federalization of all water supplies under the Clean Water Restoration
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.720]  Act the banking takeover the federal reserve to be given power over anything
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.520]  that affects any financial dealings or actions from as even Fox News reported
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.280]  anything from a restaurant to a car dealership from a hospital to a golf
[01:56.280 --> 02:00.480]  course will be under their control with no oversight see the feds already allowed
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.480]  to steal whatever money they want not be audited Bloomberg reports 14.8
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.200]  trillion in the last eight months since the bailout really the banking takeover
[02:09.200 --> 02:13.880]  but they didn't get full dictatorial power over everything so we have that
[02:13.880 --> 02:18.880]  going on as well but the counter strike against the global crime syndicate is
[02:18.880 --> 02:28.600]  continuing with HR 1207 now over 245 sponsors that gets up to 290 they're
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.800]  gonna have a big problem shooting it down and then even if they defeat it in
[02:32.800 --> 02:39.800]  the Senate the public's gonna ask why can't we audit the Fed I get audited no
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.240]  agencies above the law well they're a private corporation that has a treaty
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.880]  that's basically what the 1913 fellow reserve act is a treaty with the
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.320]  Congress that they ratified but Congress can unratify that treaty with the Bank
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.360]  of England with the House of Rothschild and we are going to do it we are going
[03:00.360 --> 03:05.400]  to defeat the New World Order and we are going to defeat their new system of
[03:05.400 --> 03:09.400]  global slavery speaking of the Rothschilds the Financial Times of London is
[03:09.400 --> 03:14.080]  supposedly breaking something that's in every major work of the last 200 years
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.440]  on the transatlantic slave trade kicking off big time in the 1600s was going on
[03:19.440 --> 03:27.720]  before that with some of the biggest families in Portugal Spain England the
[03:27.720 --> 03:32.520]  Dutch as well and the Rothschilds of course as every other major British
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.080]  family are knee-deep in it but they are also pushing as we've had the air the
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.360]  Rothschild fortune here on pushing the global carbon tax will be paid to the
[03:41.360 --> 03:49.920]  New World Order system so that is coming up today in fact Pat Buchanan on MSNBC
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.800]  with Mika Brzezinski brought up how this is really a tax to world government
[03:54.800 --> 04:01.280]  and then she kind of poo-poo's it hey lady the Club of Rome the CFR the Financial
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.600]  Times of London Newsweek Time Magazine are all bragging this is a world
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.680]  government and a tax paid to the world government so please continue to deny
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.720]  this is going on because everyone then knows that you are engaged in deception

[08:22.800 --> 08:31.520]  all right we are now eight minutes 30 seconds into the first hour of this
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.400]  worldwide transmission as we attempt to set bushfires in the minds of men and
[08:35.400 --> 08:40.640]  women everywhere to alert them to the growing tyranny that is descending like
[08:40.640 --> 08:46.280]  an iron curtain over every nation of the planet directed by the upper echelons of
[08:46.280 --> 08:52.840]  the corporatocracy known as the New World Order coming up in the second hour
[08:52.840 --> 08:59.560]  Emily Ample and Val Swain these ladies are part of an organization that simply
[08:59.560 --> 09:04.280]  goes out to protest and videotapes the police this is similar to another group
[09:04.280 --> 09:07.640]  that caught the police at the g20 meeting beating the man delivering
[09:07.640 --> 09:11.880]  newspapers to death and then saying he died of a heart attack and they've just
[09:11.880 --> 09:16.160]  said on record nothing's gonna happen to the cops come like that cop that the
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.240]  woman won't serve him anymore alcohol because he's too drunk so he climbs over
[09:19.240 --> 09:24.200]  the bar and beats her half to death the judge said hey you don't get any trouble
[09:24.200 --> 09:27.920]  how about a two years probation you're allowed to knock a woman's teeth out and
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.000]  beat her for ten minutes stomping on her head basically just absolutely amazing
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.840]  but the issue is the police come over and systematically choke this woman who's
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.760]  very polite doesn't get in their godlike way and they just come over like it's the
[09:41.760 --> 09:45.880]  Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Maoist China and they just start choking her
[09:45.880 --> 09:50.480]  with pleasure kind of like that to squad car video the state police officer
[09:50.480 --> 09:55.640]  driving about 90 miles an hour down windy country roads in Oklahoma there is a
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.640]  ambulance he drives up on it 90 miles an hour the ambulance instantly gets over
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.760]  instantly the cop savagely pulls him over begins assaulting him saying they
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.760]  didn't pull over quick enough just an insane road rage and the state police
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.200]  said we're gonna charge the EMT until there was national outcry and they backed
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.760]  off but the point is this is the cult of power the priest of power always
[10:20.760 --> 10:26.040]  pressing on the nerve of power for power for power's sake the raw exercise the
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.000]  pimp game training you to completely and totally accepting slapped around having
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.960]  your spirit broken being cowed until you capitulate to anything and everything
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.960]  until you're a completely broken servant of the New World Order well not me
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.000]  you're not pimping me and my family New World Order we're gonna bring you scum
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.200]  to justice then we got Wayne Madsen popping in because I remember him day
[10:52.200 --> 10:56.440]  one we actually sent news cameras up there last week and a half ago to
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.360]  interview him for the upcoming second film I'm working on I'll soon announce
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.160]  the name of it dealing with Barack Obama and his treacherous lying as his
[11:04.160 --> 11:10.520]  congenital lying and his kleptocracy of government that's stealing all our
[11:10.520 --> 11:16.240]  liberties and freedoms and looting the Treasury but Wayne Madsen we were up
[11:16.240 --> 11:19.360]  there with him at the Washington Press Club interviewing some folks running
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.680]  down the trail of the Von Brun case and it tied into special forces it tied into
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.640]  FBI and white supremacist but I didn't go with the story because it was so
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.840]  shocking I couldn't document at all and then this weekend it ended up being on
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.680]  C-SPAN at the press club so we'll get him to talk about that and he also was
[11:40.680 --> 11:46.560]  predicting that it was a man-made weaponized bird flu slash swine flu and
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.360]  then all these laboratories have come out and said indeed it is engineered and
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.880]  then then now it's becoming more and more mainstream news that it's some type
[11:54.880 --> 12:01.240]  of manufactured mutagen that they plan on fear mongering and hyping up in the
[12:01.240 --> 12:04.760]  fall for forced inoculations so we're going to talk to him about those two
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.120]  subjects Von Brun tied him with some type of government black op and we're
[12:10.120 --> 12:13.760]  also going I'm not sure about that but you remember the good old boy roundup
[12:13.760 --> 12:21.080]  when the militia infiltrated thousands of FBI and BATF meeting in the south back
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.520]  into 2000 back in 1992 and they were selling inward hunting licenses and
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.520]  burning blacks and effigy and Highling Hitler a very sick group of people not
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.840]  saying the whole BATF and FBI are a bunch of Nazis but see they don't just
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.080]  infiltrate and lead the Nazi groups more often than not they're actually
[12:41.080 --> 12:49.520]  commanding them with pleasure so we'll break that down as well and then Richard
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.040]  Reeves the last 30 minutes of studio he does camera work for us sometimes he
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.320]  also leads some of the groups fighting the entire infrastructure of the roads
[12:58.320 --> 13:05.080]  and water supplies reservoirs power plants infrastructure being handed over
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.400]  to foreign corporations part of the corporate looting just like the IMF and
[13:08.400 --> 13:12.360]  World Bank loot third world countries that's ongoing here big battle coming up
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.560]  with the seizure of property for the toll roads and 10 miles of land on either
[13:17.560 --> 13:21.520]  side of the road part of the Napa superhighway control grid that's coming
[13:21.520 --> 13:27.400]  out in the last 30 minutes of the transmission today okay here is just
[13:27.400 --> 13:33.840]  some of the news and I'll be going over troops oust Honduras president so I
[13:33.840 --> 13:37.360]  did some research on him and found out he is a guy who wanted to decriminalize
[13:37.360 --> 13:43.640]  all drugs and legalize it so that the drug cartels would collapse and it does
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.640]  turned out that mainstream news is reporting that the troops that ousted
[13:47.640 --> 13:54.520]  them were trained by the CIA in the school of america's and so that's just
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.280]  part of the course you're not gonna let the cocaine and heroin flow into the
[13:57.280 --> 14:00.600]  United States well you you're gonna be picked up and have a gun put to your
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.840]  head you're gonna be flown out to Costa Rica if you ever try to come back
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.560]  you're dead we're gonna ship the drugs into the American people just like that
[14:08.560 --> 14:12.720]  CIA aircraft crash in Mexico last year with three and a half tons of pure
[14:12.720 --> 14:17.480]  cocaine coming from the source you never saw that in US news though it was
[14:17.480 --> 14:23.520]  in Reuters you think that's news the CIA aircraft registered to actually a plan
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.640]  that takes people for torture a rendition aircraft crashes of all that pure
[14:27.640 --> 14:32.440]  cocaine you think that'd be newsworthy but it's not as newsworthy as Michael
[14:32.440 --> 14:42.680]  Jackson feeds you on a steady diet of baloney and petty issues CIA topples
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.560]  Honduran president protect drug trade we'll go over that report coming up also
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.080]  key leaders of Honduran military coup trained in the United States another
[14:53.080 --> 15:00.960]  report on that for everybody we'll let you know what's happening and of you
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.400]  can in climate bill is transfer of wealth to world government we'll go over
[15:05.400 --> 15:11.000]  that also day of reckoning comes for Bernard Madoff yes he acted alone he
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.200]  stole fifty to a hundred billion all by himself but they're now saying that the
[15:15.200 --> 15:21.680]  forfeiture ruling is more than the fifty billion one hundred and seventy one
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.560]  billion who's getting that money who are these shareholders that we're getting
[15:26.560 --> 15:36.240]  it oh he acted alone this is a giant scam this guy is a front he's taking the
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.640]  fall like can lay remember he's the founder of the Nasdaq these are the type
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.480]  of swindlers and crooks that run the inside job casino that is Wall Street
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.560]  in the Chicago mercantile it's all their little private cash machine with the
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.240]  plunge protection change team manipulating markets and the insiders
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.800]  know every day if it's going up or if it's going down and they always burn a
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.760]  few little nobodies to try to sell the public on the fact that they're out
[16:03.760 --> 16:06.080]  there doing something but this time they're actually burning a big fish
[16:06.080 --> 16:11.000]  because they got to let you know at least one or two big guys fall oh there
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.200]  might be a revolution in this country where all your pension funds and teacher
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.800]  retirement funds and police retirement funds went offshore they're seizing a
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.000]  few million from Madoff of the of the hundred and seventy plus billion they're
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.880]  not discussing where that's going because the government's here to take good care
[16:28.880 --> 16:35.320]  of you they care about you dollar falls most in month as China urges new
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.200]  reserve currency more drum beating of course they'll run the dollar up run it
[16:39.200 --> 16:43.000]  back down a few more times but overall there's a flight from the dollar by
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.720]  design dollars got to die have the new global sdr currency which won't even be
[16:48.720 --> 16:54.120]  a physical currency you'll still have your regional currencies North America
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.440]  South America be dollar rise Europe Africa will be under a euro system and
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.440]  then under an Asian currency three global currencies peg the manipulated for
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.400]  the profits of the insider that are engaging in currency speculation that
[17:07.400 --> 17:11.320]  will all be controlled by the OECD and the Bank of International settlements
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.120]  and it will all be accessed and tracked with biometric face scan and thumb print
[17:16.120 --> 17:21.280]  tied into your new carbon credit ID cards you're already carrying standardized
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.160]  under a UN treaty in 2000 everything you do is Nancy Pelosi said chronicle

[24:20.840 --> 24:42.560]  we're back live thank you for joining us let me just go ahead and get into what
[24:42.560 --> 24:45.600]  happened last Friday obviously a lot of you are tuning in to hear what I have to
[24:45.600 --> 24:52.960]  say about that up on info wars.com first off we have a list of the eight
[24:52.960 --> 25:01.080]  Republicans that voted for it and the measure passed by seven so they needed
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.480]  eight to cross over so that they would have one extra and then of course you
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.440]  have the even if it would have been a tie that could have had the vice-president
[25:11.440 --> 25:22.160]  break that but the issue is it's going to the Senate and if there's a tie there
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.840]  the vice-president would break it but we have the list of eight Republicans who
[25:27.840 --> 25:35.880]  voted for the carbon tax bill but it's more than just a carbon tax bill it was
[25:35.880 --> 25:41.720]  a thousand plus pages and then in the early morning hours of last Friday they
[25:41.720 --> 25:49.760]  introduced 200 and 300 pages for a total of 1200 plus pages it was over 1500 at
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.840]  one time we now learn but then they're always pulling some of it out behind the
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.960]  scenes so it ended up to be close to 1300 pages and congressman Durbin he
[25:58.960 --> 26:04.320]  read out of it because he didn't get it till 20 30 minutes before the vote and
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.400]  he got a copy of it we have those videos upon infowars.com and
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.520]  prisonplanet.com from C-span and he read through it and it's exactly what we knew
[26:15.520 --> 26:23.120]  was already in there in the earlier version but even worse just not just a
[26:23.120 --> 26:29.160]  carbon tax on cars or a carbon tax on your home or a carbon tax on all plastic
[26:29.160 --> 26:37.440]  or paper or food it creates boards federal boards scores of agencies
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.720]  Durbin showed a big map of it that all will have independent power under a
[26:41.720 --> 26:45.960]  blank check to just come out and interpret whatever they want come like
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.560]  the wetlands act they would use a rain puddle as an excuse to take your property
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.520]  or restrict it or not let you use it or build on it and then that got beaten in
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.080]  the courts so now they're back with the clean water restoration act that says
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.320]  they federalize all water in the United States above ground below ground doesn't
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.680]  even non-navigable waters that means rainwater that means tanks streams ponds
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.080]  and then buffer zones on either side or water below the ground it's the entire
[27:13.080 --> 27:19.080]  country being federalized that's racing through the congress right now and
[27:19.080 --> 27:21.960]  throughout the week I'm gonna have a bunch of climatologists and experts on
[27:21.960 --> 27:28.640]  to break it down CBS News reported EPA may have suppressed reports skeptical of
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.840]  global warming that's right and again 37,000 scientists last month sent a
[27:34.840 --> 27:40.680]  letter saying that it was just all complete fraud the Sun drives global
[27:40.680 --> 27:44.800]  warming and cooling just like the ice caps of Mars were getting small the last
[27:44.800 --> 27:50.120]  decade when the Sun was at record output of heat of different forms of
[27:50.120 --> 27:54.120]  radiation and then now that the Sun is at record cool in the last hundred years
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.440]  of being recorded by the different instruments that suddenly the ice caps of
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.040]  Mars are exploding and so are our ice caps I assure you that giant ball of
[28:02.040 --> 28:09.040]  superheated gas that fires off Coriolis flares thousands of times the size of
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.720]  the earth every day I will assure you it's what's heating the planet just walk
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.480]  outside right now it's a summer day and I assure you that's not your SUV that'll
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.080]  give you a sunburn that is a beautiful gorgeous star we're orbiting I'll assure
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.160]  you that's what's doing everything now there's some vents in the underwater
[28:30.160 --> 28:36.680]  ocean that are putting out to superheated water and gases that are by the
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.480]  way life-giving absolutely that's another thermal vents volcanoes are
[28:40.480 --> 28:47.280]  heating and the gases do have something to do with it thank God we're 14 times
[28:47.280 --> 28:52.320]  lower carbon dioxide according to ice core samples then we were just 2200
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.760]  thousand years ago carbon dioxide of plants to grow faster live longer or
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.320]  healthier every climatologist that also studies archaeology and biology is out
[29:02.320 --> 29:05.920]  there saying that we're oxygen and carbon starved right now you can just
[29:05.920 --> 29:09.760]  Google that earth carbon starved and you'll see literally hundreds of major
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.960]  university studies but see the globalists know that this is a big sick
[29:13.960 --> 29:19.840]  diversion and distraction off of cross species genetic engineering and real
[29:19.840 --> 29:24.640]  environmental crises we face classic overfishing toxic waste dumping
[29:24.640 --> 29:28.400]  deforestation there are a few things that really are serious issues and are
[29:28.400 --> 29:32.520]  threatening life on this planet but carbon dioxide in one of them but
[29:32.520 --> 29:37.840]  everything produces carbon and so if you can tax it you rule and the system of
[29:37.840 --> 29:41.160]  feudalism was used to control populations and keep them at a
[29:41.160 --> 29:47.160]  subsistence starvation level it's total control it's siege so you're all being
[29:47.160 --> 29:53.280]  put under siege now by the globalist we're on the march the empires on the

[33:29.960 --> 33:34.360]  some of the news Buchanan says climate bill is a transfer of wealth to world
[33:34.360 --> 33:40.680]  government and Zabigny Brzezinski's daughter starts making jokes about it
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.800]  but that's what the mainstream news is reporting in fact I printed up some more
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.800]  of these headlines like the one out of Financial Times of London by Gideon
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.960]  Reikman and now for world government and he says there we need a world
[33:57.960 --> 34:01.360]  government to carry out the carbon tax yes it's authoritarian but that's
[34:01.360 --> 34:07.480]  because basically you're too stupid to know what's good for you and that this
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.760]  is being set up news week time magazine headlines new world order a global
[34:11.760 --> 34:15.600]  financial order to crack the heads of bad nations like the US when it's the
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.120]  very banks that are setting up this new world order this private corporate
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.800]  dictatorship this private corporate takeover of our country they are the
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.920]  ones that engineered this entire financial collapse but the good news is
[34:30.920 --> 34:37.600]  we've got the 245 cosponsors sailing towards 290 bulletproof passage in the
[34:37.600 --> 34:41.680]  house if that continues and even if they shoot it down people will say why can't
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.760]  we audit the Fed but there's a very important story up on prisonplanet.com
[34:46.760 --> 34:53.560]  right now that everybody's got to read Buchanan climate bill is transfer of
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.760]  wealth to world government and why why would the elites want a world government
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.400]  because they get to set up the new rules they get to rule the new system the
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.800]  World Trade Organization is a private body it has more authority over trade
[35:07.800 --> 35:11.560]  than our Congress because our Congress through treaty with it voted away its
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.360]  rights that's what these agreements are it's basically treaties it's illegitimate
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.120]  it's fraud the IMF the World Bank they take our tax money and then go loan it
[35:20.120 --> 35:23.480]  at 20 30 percent interest compounded the third world nations that are never
[35:23.480 --> 35:26.560]  intended to pay it off if they try to pay it off there's a coup d'etat over
[35:26.560 --> 35:32.880]  throwing them the Peruvian leader was just on the news talking about how he
[35:32.880 --> 35:35.400]  tried to pay it off and try to do free market reforms and they threatened him
[35:35.400 --> 35:39.640]  this is how they operate they go take the money keep it but sign away your
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.760]  people to us and if you say no you get killed or you get thrown out you get
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.280]  demonized you try to decriminalize drugs in a third world country where they're
[35:49.280 --> 35:52.640]  shipping it up to the United States like Honduras you get overthrown because
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.160]  this is the business you know not only are narcotics four hundred billion
[35:56.160 --> 35:59.120]  dollars a year in the United States they get to launder that through the banks
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.960]  and then fractionally reserve loan out on average ten times those deposits so
[36:03.960 --> 36:09.600]  what's ten times four hundred billion what is that jaren ten times four hundred
[36:09.600 --> 36:14.000]  billion I don't have my calculator ten times four hundred billion that's a lot
[36:14.000 --> 36:28.480]  of laundered money isn't it see the bet no ten times four hundred billion one
[36:28.480 --> 36:35.600]  trillion do it with a cow four trillion yes I'm drinking too much sodium
[36:35.600 --> 36:40.800]  fluoride none of us can count so four trillion a year but no wonder they like
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.000]  narcotics trafficking and put it in all those derivatives then they put in
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.760]  derivatives and build the Ponzi schemes on top of other Ponzi schemes and
[36:47.760 --> 36:54.520]  leverage it out to over a thousand trillion or one quadrillion but how are
[36:54.520 --> 36:58.280]  they going to use all that fiat currency and made up debt to buy your farm your
[36:58.280 --> 37:00.880]  ranch your home they're going to use carbon taxes they're going to squeeze
[37:00.880 --> 37:04.880]  you with taxes so much that basically everybody goes bankrupt in waves and they
[37:04.880 --> 37:08.320]  consolidate it all to your feudal slaves they don't like you being an uppity
[37:08.320 --> 37:16.320]  they don't like you having a nice house or nice car they want to control you but
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.280]  here's Pat Buchanan telling it like it is with Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC her
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.760]  daddy one of the grand architects of this at the trial lateral commission let's go
[37:26.760 --> 37:30.920]  ahead and roll it here it is a lot from Washington by MSNBC political analyst
[37:30.920 --> 37:34.560]  Pat Buchanan so with another good morning Pat we've got the president calling
[37:34.560 --> 37:37.920]  this new climate bill a jobs bill because he says it's going to create clean
[37:37.920 --> 37:41.360]  energy jobs you have House minority leader John Bader saying it's a tax
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.640]  bill why doesn't anyone want to call it a climate bill well because the science
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.760]  is suggesting that maybe all of this isn't really happening or it's not
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.960]  really dangerous or it's not really man-made Barack Obama the president was
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.640]  right when he said we shouldn't be afraid of the future that is how this bill
[37:59.640 --> 38:04.000]  got passed through fear we're all gonna change the climate's gonna change the
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.760]  oceans are gonna rise our cities are gonna be underwater but more and more
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.040]  science is coming forward to say this is a hoax and a scam which is designed to
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.160]  transfer wealth and power from the private sector to the government sector
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.800]  and from the government of the United States to a world government which is
[38:20.800 --> 38:26.120]  what we're gonna get in Copenhagen when we get to Kyoto to agreement okay here
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.480]  come the emails anyway I'm Pat you know when the bill passed Republicans broke
[38:30.480 --> 38:33.400]  into a sort of sarcastic kind of applause because they think the votes
[38:33.400 --> 38:39.640]  gonna be unpopular with Americans are they right well I mean here's the thing
[38:39.640 --> 38:42.600]  you shouldn't applaud because it could go through but they're certainly right on
[38:42.600 --> 38:48.880]  this it is a tax bill it is gonna raise the price of energy electricity lighting
[38:48.880 --> 38:53.400]  everything you do in your home heating it's gonna raise the price of that the
[38:53.400 --> 38:56.640]  cost of that it's gonna hammer the middle class and the working class
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.920]  especially for a for a danger all right don't even know for sure all right you
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.360]  can find out more watch the rest of that clip at info wars.com and
[39:05.360 --> 39:09.600]  prisonplanet.com in the article that Paul Watson wrote about it Buchanan
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.400]  climate bill is transfer of wealth to world government it has been openly
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.720]  announced in literally it's got to be over a thousand articles I mean some
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.840]  weeks I might see 200 articles in the Financial Times BBC New York Times
[39:22.840 --> 39:27.600]  saying that the climate money will be a percentage of it will be paid
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.800]  internationally to the new bank of the world that we will pay our carbon tax
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.040]  is to and it looks like right now that bank of the world is going to be built
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.280]  around the IMF so Buchanan is just stating something that is all over the
[39:40.280 --> 39:44.560]  news I just read you one of the headlines out of the Financial Times of
[39:44.560 --> 39:49.760]  London which by the way is owned by a Bilderberg group member throwing in your
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.640]  face saying it's a good idea but when Buchanan says it's a bad idea oh it's
[39:53.640 --> 39:59.680]  kooky we got a laugh thing I have the Wall Street Journal article here in my
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.200]  hands I'll show it to you when we go live on TV later from Monday June 15 it's
[40:03.200 --> 40:06.160]  time to cool off the planet cutting greenhouse gases is no longer enough
[40:06.160 --> 40:11.760]  the global warming says the scientists he argues that we also have to do
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.080]  something more direct and risky and and look chemtrails I've been covering this
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.680]  for over a decade there's a Nobel Prize winner for it they say they're gonna
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.600]  fly around with aircraft mix it in with the jet fuel have it dispersed spray
[40:26.600 --> 40:30.560]  out aluminum dioxide barium salts and manipulate the atmosphere the
[40:30.560 --> 40:38.080]  climatologists meteorologists and scientists we've had on have reported
[40:38.080 --> 40:44.240]  that the chemtrailing they're witnessing on a in planetary scale will
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.640]  actually heat the planet now we knew this was going on they said we were
[40:48.640 --> 40:52.320]  coaxing it didn't exist and then suddenly the last three months Obama comes
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.360]  out and says we may have to spray the atmosphere to cool the earth and to make
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.960]  sun rays bounce back into space and then meanwhile you go look at all the
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.160]  university studies they don't call it chemtrails they call it high altitude
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.640]  aerosol spraying passive aerosol spraying department of energy they're all up
[41:11.640 --> 41:15.480]  there calling it testing and Obama's like yes we're testing manipulating the
[41:15.480 --> 41:18.840]  atmosphere no they're not they're already doing it so I think more and more
[41:18.840 --> 41:22.680]  around it's clear they are going to cause massive weather problems with the
[41:22.680 --> 41:26.680]  weather control they've had I've had been limits and the father of weather
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.840]  weapons meteorologist head of the Stanford research laboratory for the
[41:30.840 --> 41:36.520]  Navy over the naval war laboratory I saw it was declassified four years ago
[41:36.520 --> 41:43.600]  got him on and he talked about how in the 1960s the Stanford Research Institute
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.960]  certified they could create hurricanes kill hurricanes accelerate hurricanes
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.440]  steer hurricanes and then now Congress has a bill to create a weather control
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.000]  Bureau folks they're already manipulating the weather they're spraying
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.960]  aluminum dioxide and barium salts even that local news reports that have tested
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.280]  it confirming it you could see it on satellite where whole areas of the
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.440]  country are blacked out by this NASA reports the earth's 20% darker and then
[42:09.440 --> 42:13.440]  now that we're exposing this they come out in the news in the AP Reuters Wall
[42:13.440 --> 42:17.280]  Street Journal and say oh yeah we're getting ready to do this we've just been
[42:17.280 --> 42:25.200]  testing it but that's classified the Kim trails are real and they're toxic jet
[42:25.200 --> 42:29.480]  trails until the mid 90s disappeared in minutes or seconds now many of them hang
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.840]  there for hours they're spraying us in plain view they're terraforming and we
[42:35.840 --> 42:39.800]  don't know what they're trying to do the atmosphere but the climatologist and top
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.600]  experts we interview say that it appears that in some areas they're
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.440]  blocking weather systems that are bringing rain in other areas they're
[42:47.440 --> 42:53.480]  intensifying rain they are trying to heat the earth up it the way these are
[42:53.480 --> 42:58.400]  being dispersed it actually goes through the clouds the man-made nuclei
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.920]  they're putting out and then bounces back up and is contained so they're
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.040]  spraying greenhouse particulate and then we why are they trying to heat the
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.040]  earth are we going into an ice age and then the sick joke with them as they
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.000]  terraform to try to heat us up is that greenhouse gases bad I don't know folks
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.840]  I don't know but there's this whole shadow government this whole black op
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.480]  admits they're doing this we start exposing an anhash we talked to their
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.200]  office with the film toxic sky she's gonna be on soon it's a film already
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.320]  aired in Australia I'm hearing here soon you know Hollywood movies are coming on
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.200]  about it called toxic sky so what do they do oh yeah we've been doing some tests
[43:36.200 --> 43:40.320]  to spray you to save you from global warming and then the evidence is they're
[43:40.320 --> 43:43.640]  manipulating the weather because we know they had this back in the 50s and 60s
[43:43.640 --> 43:50.240]  been living students in Vietnam led squadrons he was in World War two what
[43:50.240 --> 43:53.560]  an amazing individual led he was the first guy to fly into hurricanes and
[43:53.560 --> 44:03.280]  typhoons he did that in prop planes the hurricane hunters he's it an icon after
[44:03.280 --> 44:06.760]  we interviewed him it was in Fox News CNN everywhere but then suddenly I called
[44:06.760 --> 44:09.800]  him back to come back on he said I can't talk to you anymore and I said why
[44:09.800 --> 44:13.280]  because you run a company that's doing government work already in the weather
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.720]  manipulation he said I can't talk to you gotta be 90 something years old what an
[44:18.720 --> 44:23.680]  incredible World War two that that guy is led squadrons in Vietnam he could
[44:23.680 --> 44:29.280]  take a tiny cloud and turn it into 10 feet of rain on the north Vietnamese on
[44:29.280 --> 44:35.240]  the Ho Chi Minh trail oh but they could do that in Vietnam but they're not doing
[44:35.240 --> 44:41.400]  anything now it's normal to have 2,000 feet above my office giant jet trails
[44:41.400 --> 44:46.000]  that sit there for an hour and turn into huge cloud banks yeah that's normal no
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.080]  they're mixing in with the jet fuel it perfectly compartmentalized just like
[44:49.080 --> 44:52.960]  they stick sodium fluoride in the water gives you dental phorosis bone cancer and
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.640]  people are just like well what are you gonna do the government just does it in
[44:57.640 --> 45:04.520]  your face world government with a bunch of eugenics sickos attacking each and
[45:04.520 --> 45:09.960]  every one of us in our face
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.360]  jaren's out there talking to one of the biggest newspapers in the United States
[45:20.360 --> 45:26.680]  I just hope these are good quotes when this article comes out jaren I know
[45:26.680 --> 45:30.760]  she's a nice lady has a very nice demeanor seems to be good-natured but
[45:30.760 --> 45:38.120]  you never know with these people after all she was sent here by Sauron Sauron of
[45:38.120 --> 45:47.880]  media I'm just joking around okay yeah I'm trying to have a good attitude I was
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.240]  overwrought with anger Friday I normally eat dinner with my family and
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.040]  hang out for at least a few hours and play my son at chess and you know spray
[45:57.040 --> 46:00.880]  the water hose in the backyard and on the slip and we get on the slip and slide
[46:00.880 --> 46:06.280]  but I had a laptop with me in the backyard at dinner table watching the
[46:06.280 --> 46:10.320]  vote and I saw Pelosi right before the vote come up with just satisfied like
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.640]  like like she was a pig and you know what and just just with relish saying I
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.720]  knew a lot of you don't like this but we're going to do it we're going forward
[46:21.720 --> 46:28.160]  with jobs yeah just like napkin get how that do for your jobs folks and the
[46:28.160 --> 46:35.640]  rust belt now spanning the entire country and wicked Lloyd dogged from out
[46:35.640 --> 46:38.840]  here in Texas got up and said I don't care I'm getting a bunch of calls
[46:38.840 --> 46:46.080]  against it I'm gonna do it because these control freaks are gonna shut the
[46:46.080 --> 46:49.960]  middle class down and by the way I keep explaining it this is it they're moving
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.880]  on everything they're gonna pass the total amnesty bill and Obama's crowing
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.960]  that he's gonna do it so that thing to totally legalize the 20 plus million
[46:57.960 --> 47:03.440]  legal aliens it in 14 million allow felons to sign a waiver so they can
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.400]  stay I'm not kidding it's like illegal aliens they won't arrest them when they
[47:06.400 --> 47:09.480]  pull them over at checkpoints drunk or without insurance but citizens get
[47:09.480 --> 47:13.480]  arrested on record they're gonna I've got made they're allowed to get the
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.680]  stimulus money without ID but citizens have to illegal aliens are building the
[47:17.680 --> 47:22.760]  little tinker toy border fence you I mean it's insane they're gonna do that
[47:22.760 --> 47:27.440]  they're gonna pass the water takeover bill they're gonna pass the Federal
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.280]  Reserve Banker takeover bill the Senate's gonna pass the climate bill all
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.600]  1300 pages of it where it says blank check to do whatever they want with
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.960]  these bureaucrats home inspections just hell is being released animal ID is
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.240]  gonna pass premises ID for waving all your rights $2,000 a day fines of a
[47:46.240 --> 47:48.960]  chicken dies you don't tell the government got to have expensive
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.360]  computers $20 tags per chicken when the chickens worth $5 SWAT teams rating
[47:54.360 --> 47:57.840]  Amish selling milk and cheese SWAT teams rating people selling eggs on the
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.600]  side of the road SWAT teams rating people selling firewood nothing but
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.340]  giant federal bureaucracies spilling out like the black plague of satanic
[48:06.340 --> 48:11.400]  locust chewing the flesh off the body of this country right down to the bones
[48:11.400 --> 48:21.680]  knowing it right down to ashes the entire economy is being converted right
[48:21.680 --> 48:28.920]  now the entire economy is being converted to a plan control economy with
[48:28.920 --> 48:32.680]  a fascist system sitting above a social system they socialize all the wealth
[48:32.680 --> 48:35.720]  create global corporations that have government contracts and you work for
[48:35.720 --> 48:38.880]  the corporations of the government and that's the only jobs there are everybody
[48:38.880 --> 48:42.160]  else is fed into the prison system we're already the most in prison country in
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.720]  the world we're already the most dumb down lowest IQ not just education our
[48:46.720 --> 48:52.680]  IQ is one of the lowest in the world now the only other regions or areas in
[48:52.680 --> 48:55.600]  India and China where people from malnutrition didn't have good brain
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.760]  development it's the fluoride the mercury we are literally lobotomized
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.360]  chemical lobotomized zombies now who watch on average four hours of TV a day
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.040]  we don't communicate with each other anymore we don't have neighborhood
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.360]  friends we don't go out on the front porch and barbecue we don't know our
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.200]  neighbors we don't play volleyball in the backyard anymore we sit there
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.200]  watching glowing televisions and watch shows like friends and they become our
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.040]  friends are our people are spending and paying thousands of dollars with these
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.840]  different simulated reality games to buy a Ferrari and they imagine they have a
[49:27.840 --> 49:31.440]  Ferrari and make believe internet land as we're sucked in and integrated into
[49:31.440 --> 49:40.200]  the matrix meanwhile there's a giant tarot farming project going on the
[49:40.200 --> 49:44.680]  university's all admit it hidden in plain view that they have high school
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.240]  textbooks saying the government's spraying to give you sunscreen from the
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.480]  sun in government textbooks for high school students but then you talk about
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.400]  they go you're crazy oh but here's the Wall Street Journal we need to spray we
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.840]  need to spray to save the earth just a whole cover section brainwashing the
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.280]  public hey why didn't this do a report about how they're already doing it and
[50:06.280 --> 50:14.640]  what the hell are they doing since 1947 the narcotic running OSS turned into the
[50:14.640 --> 50:20.560]  CIA founded by the Yale skull and bones criminals all these punk Ivy League
[50:20.560 --> 50:26.480]  Eddie Haskell type individuals can do whatever they want white slavery drugs

[54:47.760 --> 54:55.000]  joining us today I wanted to tell you about some of the other news that's
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.560]  coming up after these other guests leave us they're coming up for 30 minutes in
[54:59.560 --> 55:02.360]  the next hour and also want to add that we're gonna be
[55:02.360 --> 55:11.520]  simulcasting live at prisonplanet.tv we got Wayne Madson coming up in the
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.760]  third hour to talk about swine flibbing manufactured by a lab but that's now
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.200]  been basically confirmed by mainstream media we've got Richard Reeves in
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.160]  studio getting into the massive NAFTA superhighway toll roads and that fight
[55:24.160 --> 55:28.280]  heating back up again in Texas you know they always say oh we're canceling that
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.640]  or it doesn't exist then oh well now we're canceling it they're not canceling
[55:31.640 --> 55:36.000]  any of it so we've got to continue to keep the heat on these criminals but
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.200]  each step they become more and more discredited more and more exposed so we'll
[55:40.200 --> 55:43.760]  be going over that coming up and I'll break down more of what's happening with
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.520]  the global warming carbon tax and we'll take your calls in the next hour at
[55:48.520 --> 55:57.320]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 before I go any further and in this hour I do
[55:57.320 --> 56:02.080]  want to encourage listeners Obama's approval ratings are starting to plunge
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.160]  and a lot of the Obama zombies just like Bush zombies that wouldn't listen at
[56:06.160 --> 56:09.320]  first or starting to realize that he's a liar and later I've got some video
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.960]  clips of him saying that he would never raise taxes on people that make under
[56:13.960 --> 56:18.880]  $250,000 a year now he had Axelrod on national news saying well we may have
[56:18.880 --> 56:22.720]  to now he also said he wouldn't do signing statements he just did this with
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.280]  the hunt 100 plus billion dollar defense supplement bill so I want to go over
[56:27.280 --> 56:30.640]  that but but that's what the Obama deception covers that everything he
[56:30.640 --> 56:34.720]  says is a lie it's like he said I want to be friends with you Iran and then he
[56:34.720 --> 56:37.920]  launched destabilization campaigns and triggered that operation that's now been
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.840]  confirmed via CIA slash MI6 op I mean the White House admits that it's official
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.000]  CIA policy and then they get on TV in line say it isn't thinking you're a
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.400]  bunch of idiots that's how much they just just absolutely detest you and have
[56:52.400 --> 56:58.080]  nothing but contempt for you it's it's it's the pimp game I mean it's it's more
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.480]  more realize it is the pimp game Google the pimp game and just find me some
[57:03.480 --> 57:06.800]  text about the pimp game I want to explain how the pimp game works for
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.960]  people tyranny gets a facelift the Obama deception is a hard hitting film
[57:10.960 --> 57:13.760]  that completely destroys the myth that we're not Obama's working for the best
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.920]  interest the American people the Obama phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted
[57:17.920 --> 57:23.040]  hoax by the captain's the new world order he is being pushed as savior and an
[57:23.040 --> 57:26.800]  attempt to con the American people into accepting global slavery we have reached
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.040]  a critical juncture in the new world order plans it's not about left and
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.600]  right it's about one world government the international banks plan to loot the
[57:33.600 --> 57:37.120]  people of the United States and turn them into slaves on the global plantation
[57:37.120 --> 57:42.040]  covered in this film who Obama works for the lies he is told and what his real
[57:42.040 --> 57:45.640]  agenda is if you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype this is the
[57:45.640 --> 57:50.040]  film for you and if you watch the film you will learn how Obama is continuing
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.160]  the process of transforming America and is something that resembles Nazi Germany
[57:53.160 --> 57:58.320]  with forced national service domestic civilian spies warrantless wiretaps the
[57:58.320 --> 58:01.440]  destruction of the second amendment FEMA camps and martial law Obama's
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.320]  handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new bank of the world
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.040]  that will dominate every nation on earth through carbon taxes and military
[58:08.040 --> 58:11.920]  force international banks purposely engineered the world financial meltdown
[58:11.920 --> 58:16.520]  to bankrupt the nation's the planet and bring in world government Obama plans
[58:16.520 --> 58:19.920]  to loot the middle class destroy pensions and federalize the states so the

[58:58.680 --> 59:02.880]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.800]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.800 --> 59:10.800]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.800 --> 59:14.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.720 --> 59:18.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[59:18.360 --> 59:21.680]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[59:21.680 --> 59:25.680]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[59:25.680 --> 59:29.480]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:29.480 --> 59:32.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:23.080]  Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:30.600]  all right ladies and gentlemen we've just completed the first hour of the
[1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:36.600]  syndicated radio transmission we are now simulcasting the final three hours on
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:43.880]  this June 29th 2009 Monday edition at prisonplanet.tv so for all the
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:49.920]  prisonplanet.tv viewers we are now live simulcasting we always do at least the
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:53.960]  second the third and fourth hour the third and fourth hour simulcast but
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.320]  today we're doing the second third and fourth hour simulcast at prisonplanet.tv
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:03.880]  Wayne Madsen on the manufactured swine flu hysteria now admitted that it is
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.840]  manufactured in a lab the question is manufactured where he first broke that
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:13.280]  during the first few days of the frenzy hysteria generated by the corporate
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:18.920]  controlled CIA controlled media the globalist directed media and it's now
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:22.160]  been confirmed so he'll be joining us talk about that and also a story he's
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:28.480]  been working on about white supremacist and Nazis in the FBI military BATF and
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.840]  how that tied into von brun we sent news cameras up there for a film we're
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:35.400]  working on to talk to him at the national press club a week and a half ago
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:39.880]  we met with some of the reporters I was still vetting the story I believed
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:43.680]  Wayne and believe the other reporter but I just wasn't gonna go with it yet but
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:49.520]  ended up on the national press club over the weekend on c-span and names quite a
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:55.040]  few high-level military people so I'm very very shocking so we'll go ahead and
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.920]  talk about that now that somebody else has reported on it I didn't want to touch
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:01.800]  it quite yet I told you we were working on the von brun situation him being
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:06.440]  handled out of the Pentagon and then you kind of a mentally ill patsy but notice
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:10.320]  how that came right on time for the hate crime laws they have that openly ban free
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:14.280]  speech and by the way I got hit with a fast one I kept saying folks why is
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:19.440]  everybody obsessed with the hate crimes law why is everybody so scared of the
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:23.280]  hate crimes law that just says that if you attack somebody who has a certain
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:27.840]  gender or certain sexual preference you get basically more charges on you and
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.680]  are treated differently but which I think is wrong if you murder a black guy or a
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:35.040]  white guy should get the same thing or if you beat a gay guy or straight guys be
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:38.640]  the same thing but that's a form of discrimination in saying some crimes are
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:43.080]  worse than others but it's not still the big threat to the cyber bullying act was
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:46.600]  I'm gonna read the subsections that say if someone says you hurt their feelings
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:52.200]  you're gonna get a federal indictment a federal felony and go to prison that
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:56.560]  wasn't in the original hate bill it's not just in the cyber bullying it passed
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:00.800]  the house in the hate bill they added that so the exact same language I'm gonna
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:06.760]  show it to you later coming up at the bottom of the hour very scary stuff you
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:10.640]  know the left always talks about how they want free speech the rights I guess
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:14.000]  openly wants to get rid of it many cases until a Democrat gets in the point is
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.840]  it isn't about left and right it's about both parties being controlled by off
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:21.640]  shore corporate interest just like the Tories and Labor are controlled in
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.960]  England by the same interest you know they fight with each other over power
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:27.680]  but they're bought and paid for by the same interest so that's coming up we're
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:32.360]  about to go to break and come back with Emily Apple and Val Swain really
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:35.600]  courageous ladies I say courageous because I've done the same type of work
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:39.760]  for many years so I guess you could say we're a fellow travelers when it comes
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:47.400]  to that and well again we're gonna break in one minute and come back to them we're
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:51.120]  gonna show you some of this video this is a police video and they're a group that
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:54.760]  goes out to protest and shows the police videotaping the citizens and putting
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:57.920]  them in these terror databases I've been in London and had the police come up and
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:01.600]  say you can't videotape you can't ask citizens questions we're putting you in
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.000]  a terror database that's in my film terror storm and then I have two riders
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.080]  that live in England they've been approached by police and they've been
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:11.520]  and they've been told you're not allowed to you know videotape in London you're
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.160]  not allowed to I mean they're putting terror databases this is happening even
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:19.120]  mainstream reporters now and they passed a law saying it's up to police
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:22.920]  discretion to say whether videotaping is an act of terror so they want to put
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.280]  cameras on us they want to surveil us they want to control us but then you
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:30.440]  don't videotape them well there was a guy a few weeks ago caught on footage
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:34.080]  of the police beating a guy half the death and they've gone in charge and
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.560]  arrested the guy that shot video of that I guess soon like the guy that the cop
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:42.320]  that shoots the guy in the back at the dark facility in Oakland I guess they're
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:46.000]  gonna go after the folks that shot video of that this is the new system and the
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:54.520]  police start choking this lady it's just amazing how they torture us with with
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:58.440]  paying compliance and it's a big deal that happens at Abu Ghraib but not if
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:02.320]  it happens to citizens of the US and this is Alex Jones have you heard of the
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.920]  millionaire patriot well you should he has a free handgun and five days of

[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:14.360]  when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:18.600]  appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:22.680]  losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own

[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.840]  radio network
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:23.160]  Emily Apple, Val Swain both join us from the United Kingdom it'll make Emily
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:28.000]  Apple is a single mom from Cornwall down the coast they're arrested by police
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:34.160]  August 8 2008 along with her photographer Val Swain mother of three for
[1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:37.240]  asking police officers their badge numbers as they were up videotaping the
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.680]  citizens to put them in that in the databases the reason we have this now
[1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:47.320]  is the Guardian has obtained the police footage of fit watch members Emily
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:50.920]  Apple and Val Swain being arrested by surveillance officers from the forward
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:55.160]  intelligence team fit after asking for their badge numbers at the King's North
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:58.440]  climate camp last year they're supposed to wear their badge numbers just like we
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:02.760]  have laws here that say that we don't have secret police in England and the
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:07.720]  United States supposedly but I've seen this in the US before when people ask
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:11.160]  for their badge numbers you get beat down quite a bit now we've all seen the
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:15.560]  footage of the EMT being choked and normally when you choke somebody it's
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:20.120]  like waterboarding it creates a panic response because the oxygen stops going
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.760]  you see are really really choking her and this is what they do now they call it
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:29.120]  paying compliance in fact I forgot to tell you guys queue up to the extras from
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:33.040]  Marshall law where they're actually breaking the arms of protesters and
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.520]  choking them I want to show people torture to see this is its official
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:42.520]  policy and federal courts have ruled in the US that they can torture you they
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:46.560]  call it paying compliance so when they come out on the news and say torture
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:52.120]  Abu Ghraib people or torture people at Camp X-ray this is policy in fact
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:56.320]  federal courts have ruled state courts have ruled they can taser you to answer
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.480]  questions or taser you to give a urine sample remember that two weeks ago we'll
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:06.120]  show people that article coming up but I want to go ahead and go to our guests
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.960]  to tell folks the story of what happened and we also have the links of the full
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:12.800]  video up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com you can go to their
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:16.960]  website it's fit watch dot blog spot dot com they also have the video from
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.240]  YouTube of their arrest from the police we're going to show you a little bit of
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:28.680]  that coming up so again from fit watch dot blog spot dot com I appreciate Emily
[1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:33.960]  Apple and Val Swain for coming on the show with us today ladies you have a
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:37.280]  lot of courage putting up with your secret police and being tortured by them
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:43.280]  thank you hello you bet it's good to have you so so which one is Emily I'm
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:48.840]  Emily okay and then Val Swain were you both tortured and choked or was it just
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:54.960]  Emily well I think Emily had a bit of a of a rougher deal than I did on that
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:00.560]  particular occasion but we have the form of the of the police on a few
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:04.240]  occasions that's what I'm getting in the way of this okay okay describe for folks
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:07.600]  then what your group does because we do something similar it's a cop watch but
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.880]  you specifically watch the surveillance cops the secret police so you were
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:16.080]  tortured for that and arrested last year again tell folks what happened but break
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:22.200]  it down you got the floor okay well you know we have a secret police these are
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:26.200]  these are over please stand around with with in full uniform they're very
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:31.120]  obvious but I mean not wearing their ID is secret but go ahead well sure but I
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.760]  mean my secret secret police generally are it's not just the secretness they're
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:38.720]  called secret is it is it they're going after people that aren't committing
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.680]  crimes they're the thought police the commissariat well that's right I mean
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:46.800]  what they mean we know that they they take photographs they film demonstrations
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.960]  and we know that that information ends up on police databases and databases we've
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:56.520]  got no no one has any access to and no one has any ability to check and nobody
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:01.480]  knows quite what is done with that this is like the savoc or the Gestapo or the
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:09.400]  NKVD please continue we set up the big watch a couple years ago just to keep an
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:17.520]  eye on it and to do what we can to stop them doing what they're doing I think
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:24.080]  also I mean one of the things that they do a lot of is very overt harassment
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.160]  intimidation of anyone attending protests and certainly people they know
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:33.720]  attending process the way they take photography is very much in the face
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:39.840]  with big flashes they're designed so that people know that they're there and
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:45.760]  they they want people to be scared of of them you know they if you want an
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:48.880]  activist you know they follow people around I've been followed home on
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:55.920]  various occasions and things like that absolutely I mean I want to get into your
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:00.600]  story but later I want to talk about my experience of being 200 yards from
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.120]  parliament the public square and the police were already over there saying
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.960]  no protest allowed this was three days before the law went into effect banning
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:13.600]  protests anywhere around parliament and the police came over and said what's
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:16.920]  your name I'm putting you in a database and then I learned that I have two guys
[1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:20.600]  that work for me Paul Watson Steve Watson live in England that this happened
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:24.440]  to them and basically everybody they know that everybody's being trained that
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:27.080]  if you're even walking your dog they come over and question you put you in a
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:31.040]  database and if you question them you get tortured like you're being tortured
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.920]  here on the video but but tell us what happened that day and also notice the
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:39.800]  guardian got the police footage but they show you the thought criminal and by
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:45.800]  secret police they don't show the supposed public officers faces
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:52.400]  no they don't they're very worried about the latest amendment to the
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:58.400]  terrorism act which potentially makes it an offense to publish information about
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.120]  police officers that's right the guardian has now buckled the once-free home of
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:05.120]  the Magna Carta they said oh we're gonna because for years they would arrest you
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:09.080]  for photographing police at protest at they're trying to arrest the people as
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:12.560]  you know that beat the guy to death at the G20 he's delivering newspapers they
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:15.200]  beat him to death the cops are saying you know you're a terrorist if you
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:20.760]  released us murdering him and so they would always falsely arrest you and so
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.200]  now they passed a law and go over that code for folks if you have it or we
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:30.440]  can pull it up saying if you photograph police will decide of its terrorism so
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:34.240]  now the guardian one of the biggest papers in the world is scared to show
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:44.280]  the cops that tortured two housewives they won't show the God's faces I
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:47.920]  listen you send me the video I'll show their stinking faces these thugs need
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:52.760]  to be shown these thugs are bullies and they torture women and I got a wife and
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:55.840]  two daughters and I don't like it and it's time we start getting angry at this
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:01.040]  scum are you angry at them choking you I'm very angry I mean all all their
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.600]  names and links to photographs of them are on our blog so if people want to
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:11.160]  identify them and see them properly then they're there for everyone to see on the
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:17.560]  guardian point I raised this in a piece I wrote about the guardian being scared
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:22.960]  of the terrorism laws and apparently according to the guardian they're not
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:26.720]  and there are other reasons why they wouldn't show the faces of the police
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:29.960]  officers on that video but they refuse to say what they are so as anyone's
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.680]  guess whether they're telling the truth or not but you're saying at your blog
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:37.160]  spot you have them I'm gonna put them up on screen put them up on screen and
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:41.160]  thank you I apologize I have a tendency I'm gonna I have a tendency to get mad
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:45.040]  okay when I see a woman getting getting beat up and tortured by a thug tell us
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:49.120]  what happened that day I'm gonna try to shut up here and not to get too hot well
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.880]  we were there first I don't think it makes any difference that I was a woman I
[1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:55.240]  think what happened to us would have been just as bad if I was a man or a
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:16:01.120]  woman I think our gender is irrelevant to it but what when I was there we were
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:05.800]  there to monitor the policing operation we knew that there was going to be a
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:09.840]  large amount of surveillance and we've been around the perimeter of the camp
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:14.800]  taking photographs and making notes of the police officers there so when we
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:19.560]  came to the main gate we came out to camp and start taking photographs I was
[1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:26.360]  making notes of numbers and I came up to a police officer who wasn't just saying
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:31.760]  his number I asked him to provide it to me and he refused at which point I
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:34.840]  called Val over and said can you take a photograph of this guy please because I
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:40.480]  want to make a complaint and her first up was blocked and then within seconds
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.600]  she was being dragged across the road and I was being thrown on the floor
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:52.000]  along with her third friend of mine now I was looking at his hand I mean and I've
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:55.120]  seen this up close with other demonstrators and peaceful people looks
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:58.360]  like he's really working it really squeezing on those arteries can you
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.480]  describe what that was like and how did you control yourself because usually
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:06.240]  people buck against that because the panic reflex comes in and then they get
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:10.680]  to really slam your head in the ground break some ribs and and and and I
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:17.240]  really get the state of mastic pleasure they join the force for it was it was
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:23.840]  very nasty but I've experienced far worse than the police so in terms it
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:27.440]  wasn't shocked to me at all that I've been treated like that thank you. What was he
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:31.160]  doing? It looked like he was whispering you know kind of like a
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:34.840]  Jeffrey Dahmer would whisper to his prey you know that he's saying something to
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:39.320]  you while he does it. He was telling me to walk off it down or whatever he
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:45.640]  wanted me to do at the time. Okay how hard was he squeezing your arteries? Oh very
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:51.720]  hard it was very painful. So have you filed on him for for assaulting you? Yeah we
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:58.160]  the complaints that we've made to the IPCC and the independent complaints
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:04.480]  complaints is to do with the assault and also to do with the
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:08.960]  imprisonment because we were refused bail and kept in prison for days. Now you
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:13.520]  weren't even resisting him but but but he still did that to you and then when
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:16.440]  and then when they have you you're on the ground they're kind of slamming you
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:21.440]  and mistreating you and it I mean I'm so embarrassed for them I mean
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:25.560]  this is now just normal I guess in the US and England to just do this to people.
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:32.720]  I think it is normal for them to do that to people. We had lots of
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:37.040]  comments regarding the incident about what for what did you expect? Well I
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:40.280]  didn't expect any different doesn't make it right and it doesn't mean that I'm
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.840]  not going to do everything I can to try and help them to account for what they
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:47.720]  did. Well it's sickening that this has now become commonplace that we just think
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:52.520]  this is the normal. You say you've seen far worse or had far worse what else have
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:57.640]  you suffered at the hands of these hooligans? I just lost the violence the
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:02.200]  last time I was arrested when they tried to take me to court I was asking them to
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:07.080]  get me numbers from my phone in case I got sent to prison so I would have to
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:13.240]  go out to healthcare and because I wouldn't get into the prison van to go
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:17.560]  to court I got repeatedly kicked and punched and then I had my hands slammed
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:22.960]  in the door about four times. Oh so that's pretty hardcore torture imagine
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:26.080]  of Abu Ghraib they were slamming people's hands and doors there'd be an

[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:15.080]  not going to say anything about it till it comes out in the newspaper but one of
[1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:19.360]  the biggest newspapers in the country is here and I was explaining to her that in
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:22.560]  England and now in the U.S. taking your shoes off at the airports is about an
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:26.880]  active submission, an act of you're a criminal you're bad and how Paul Watson
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:30.040]  Steve Watson get questioned by police when they go out to eat dinner. I've been
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:34.080]  there and been questioned. It's in the news that if you're at a park walking a
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:37.760]  dog the police come up and take photos of you and say are you a child molester or
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:41.960]  they come up and say you're a terrorist. Tourist now in DC everywhere we go we'd
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:44.640]  be a hundred yards from the Washington Monument they come up and say you can't
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:49.960]  videotape that and I go what's the law all right buddy we're gonna arrest you you
[1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:55.560]  got a problem and this is about them bullying us and cowing us and she's
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:58.920]  goes oh I know I was in England last week they came up and told me I couldn't
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:03.160]  take photos at public places because of a child molestation law so you're a
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:07.680]  terrorist your child molester you know we're all criminals basically now this
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:11.800]  is about their good their God all the billboards about click at her ticket and
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:15.920]  the cops are watching you they have big signs all over London that say safe under
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:21.280]  the watchful eyes and it shows it a big brother one eye looking at you this is I
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:24.240]  mean they know what they're doing this is a criminal row government going back
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.800]  to Emily Apple and Val Swain ladies you heard me just talk about that I mean what
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  is going on in England in the United States
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:42.000]  well we can't talk about the United States I don't know anything about it and
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.680]  you write in terms of surveillance and control has increased enormously and we
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:53.840]  were concerned about it is particularly on practice where you days at such a large
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:26:00.760]  scale documentation of people that are involved well the misconduct of the
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:04.160]  police is being caught on video cameras everywhere and they're scared and they
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:08.320]  know it's beating them and their attempt to say it's terrorism or pedophilia to
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:11.240]  have a camera and take a picture of the Washington Monument he didn't go to work
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:17.080]  I mean I don't see this working for them I don't think it will ultimately because
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:23.680]  I think people are really beginning to realize what's going on but I don't think
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:28.040]  the police are really that different I think what's changed is that there's so
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:33.040]  much more technology around for people to capture what they're doing and also the
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:38.080]  arrogant that for example the video of our arrest you know that they thought it
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:42.840]  was okay to video that and exactly that's what I was gonna ask you why are
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.560]  they so arrogant to torture women slam their hands and car doors and laugh
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.960]  about it on video I mean we have New York cops coming up to 9-11 activists
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:55.600]  truth activists in New York saying I'm gonna say your camera's a gun your
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:59.000]  backpacks a bomb I know you're not a terrorist it's on video but I'm gonna
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:04.080]  say you are I mean I mean I mean and then the police grab Luke Radowski I
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:11.880]  mean they are framing people on video proudly I'm sorry go ahead but they
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:17.080]  think they're very arrogant they they they are not easily held to account I
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:20.760]  mean if they they do this little thing what happens they're not an awful lot
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:24.400]  even if it goes through the press even if we go through the complaint that we
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:29.000]  go through the calls the end of the day there's not a lot that's gonna happen to
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.960]  them as a result of it so you know they pretty much feel that they can do what
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:36.360]  we want what they want did you hear about army and Marine Corps recruiters in
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:40.840]  Texas and in Colorado other states lie to kids and say you'll be arrested if you
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:44.520]  don't sign and join the military and then when the tapes get released those
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:54.160]  guys get promoted I mean I mean is the state going completely criminal
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:00.960]  I think the state's always been a bit criminal I'm not sure it's going that
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:06.160]  way I think it is that way the state's always worked in the interest of the
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:09.840]  rich and the powerful I for everyone else and in that sense I think it's
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:13.920]  always been criminal and they'll always devise laws and strategies to keep the
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:19.280]  rich and powerful in power so where does it go from here with this case are
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:22.120]  these cops gonna get in trouble are they gonna end up being chief constables
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:24.360]  for this the more people they torture
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:30.800]  oh my money is on the chief constable I can't see them I can't see them getting
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.640]  into trouble particularly so they're gonna end up probably being prime
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:44.120]  minister and deputy prime minister and so where does it end them all wearing
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:49.560]  little gold crowns and being worshipped or it ends when enough people stand up
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:52.080]  to them and say we're not going to take this anymore and we're going to do
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:56.080]  something about it it doesn't come through politicians saying this is bad
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:28:59.160]  it comes from people on the street actually doing something about it and
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:04.560]  just saying no yeah because it just bullies at the end of the day and my
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.200]  cool bullies you know you just have to stand up for a minute well you ladies
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:11.520]  are just amazing I want to do a few more minutes with the other side then
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:14.800]  we'll let you go and also plug your great site but I want to ask when we get
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:21.120]  back how you got involved with this why the police torture you for it and if
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:24.280]  more people are joining you I mean I would love to see sort of two women out
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:29.280]  there videotaping them a hundred men and women so that they can't arrest
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:36.960]  everybody for videotaping the supposed Kings doesn't mean folks men and women
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:41.320]  in black uniforms choking and torturing women it's tyranny and if they can do
[1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:44.720]  this they can do anything like take your pension funds and bankrupt everything
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:48.480]  and set up a world government which is exactly what they're doing but hey drink

[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:28.520]  in there doing a big story and she's like no don't say it no we're not gonna put
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:32.720]  you on TV ma'am and she was just she just got back from England and she was
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:36.000]  telling me how she was also doing while she was there visiting family she was
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:40.360]  doing a story on travel and she was at the big beautiful canals taking pictures
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:44.120]  and citizens would come over and go man you're not allowed to take photos of the
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:49.720]  canal or anything it is the Family Protection Act pedophilia and then she
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:53.320]  would go on and she said other citizens would come up a man excuse me what
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:59.280]  title tells now secret police files a we do it worse than East Germany so she
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:03.400]  just told me the whole story and and now here in Austin it's in my film road
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:07.800]  to tyranny made seven years ago they give credit cards that they put money on
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:11.680]  for turning in neighbors parents you get the biggest amounts of money it's just
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:16.960]  total Soviet Union East Germany Communist China isn't even this bad and the
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:20.920]  British supposedly not the average folks but a lot of them they just love it and
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:24.680]  so now if you try to photograph anything I'll act of terrorism I call
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:30.560]  please me that I don't take a feather and I dare you to go to DC you could just
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:34.880]  set up anywhere in a city park and try to aim at a building the police come
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:37.680]  running over private security guards you'll say what's the law and they'll
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:43.120]  just go it's gonna get real you saw Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson it made the
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.400]  Kansas City Star they're at the World War one Memorial run by the city
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:54.280]  videotaping open park and the Federal Reserve is across the street they're
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:58.200]  videotaping that and the police the private security guards come with guns
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:01.840]  and they say you will be arrested if you don't stop taping and tell me your
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:06.800]  name and then they go get out of here leave and they turn they start getting
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:12.160]  their hands on them they go look you go ahead and try me they had no law no
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:16.360]  nothing but in England they do now and you know and then we're actually Rob and
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:19.000]  Aaron's and there were actually some public enjoying it like get him get him
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.760]  yeah get him because you know the it's it's gladiatorial just like in the old
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:28.000]  gladiator system you would watch your neighbor being torn apart and cheer and
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.480]  the next week it probably be you getting torn apart for whatever petty crime or
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:36.200]  not paying your taxes so see it's all good I mean just the groveling to police
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:39.560]  I hear on the radio and no matter what they do they taser an old woman they
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.680]  taser a baby they taser somebody to make them you know urinate in a cup in
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:48.400]  fact Google that guy's a search engine that x quick that as another good
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:53.440]  search engine pull it up for people because it was two weeks ago headline in
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:37:00.160]  New York court rules suspects may be tasered to get DNA and then you'll see
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:03.920]  England rule two weeks ago and so did the US because it's all integrated
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:08.480]  simultaneously and then you'll find the Miami cases where if you can't urinate at
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:12.040]  the hospital they want a drug test they just taser you and taser you until you
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:17.440]  die I mean the torture content but now I'm sorry Emily Apple and Val Swain what
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:20.960]  makes you want to do this to go out and stand up against the humanization tell
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:24.840]  us about yourselves how you got involved in this
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:54.760]  well I've been involved in anti-war environmental protest stuff like that for 15 or years and over the years I've been more and more repressed in a protest and especially with the forward intelligence teams it's just been so much intimidation so much harassment and it's been forcing people off the streets and it's meant we've got to the point where we can no longer have an effective life or what's
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:06.200]  getting to that point and so it just seems that if we want to have any kind of protest movement in the UK that we need to tackle the forward intelligence teams in order to do that
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:19.400]  I'm looking at these cops enjoying abusing you what what slime what the humanizing filth they'll be remembered though like the creatures they are for what they are so so so how long have you been doing this
[1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:39.400]  we've been doing fit watch for about two years now just over two years and you've you've certainly had some battles I would imagine yeah I think I think we worked out that we've been arrested 11 times between us I think that's right and make evictions in the last two years just for doing fit watch stuff
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:52.400]  amazing now there are lots of other groups standing up I've been seeing reports of work people will be filming a birthday party in their front garden a front yard for folks in the US and the police will often go excuse me
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:39:02.400]  count is often allowed to and the citizens are going no no I'm not a slave I mean are the how many Brits that you talked to are really starting to see what this is and say no
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:12.400]  I think a lot of people I mean it just gets ridiculous some of the things that they say you can't fail film and photograph I think it just hits them
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:20.400]  I mean the police just appear to have some real paranoia about what you can and can't take photographs of it's just got plain staffed
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:33.400]  and there was a couple of holidaymakers in in Cardiff who got taken to prison because they they were taking photographs of each other in the park and they just happened to be the football stadium in in the background which was a
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:51.400]  public terrorist attack I was taking photographs of the Welsh assembly when the government buildings here mostly public building and the security comes out you can't take photographs here well yeah I can but they notice this is them
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:40:03.400]  up and the police police jump out the van they want to know my name and address I don't want to give my name and address and then they they threaten they threaten a lot to arrest you they will they will have you against the wall they will
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:16.400]  scare the life out of you they will make you believe that you know that they're going to drag you off and arrest you but 99 times out of 100 they don't they just they just use the threat they like to throw this threat around that you know you do as we
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:31.400]  tell you all we're going to arrest you but you know that they still can't get away with we're locking everybody up well that's the answer is that everybody go out and do this did you hear me talk about the Wall Street Journal writer trying to do a story on
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:47.400]  travel and they just if the citizens come over like I mean they were I mean what percentage are on average how many of your fellow brits just revel in the tattle tailing and bossing
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:41:02.400]  I don't know quite what you mean well I mean in any police state you also have the cheerleaders for the police state the citizen tattle tail squads what are you saying on that front in the UK
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:20.400]  cheerleaders I mean everyone I speak to is based that has a lot less trust in the place and I think everyone the people had before even you know people with good jobs with good standing in society to turn around and say no we just don't trust them
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:33.400]  well the Wall Street Journal reporter said she had multiple people come up and say she couldn't photograph parks or rivers or anything I mean if you try to photograph flowers it's some type of al-qaeda but I mean again they're
[1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:46.400]  surveilling us they're watching us they're tracking us they're controlling everything we do illegally but then we go out with our cameras and they act like it's the end of the world through color of law I mean this is just absolutely incredible
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:52.400]  what it is they're the ones who always say you know you've got nothing to hide you know
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:42:05.400]  well ladies I just want to salute you Emily Ample and Val Swain the website for folks that want to check it out it's fitwatch.blogspot.com anything else you'd like to add
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:22.400]  thank you for having us on anything else Val or Emily about both of you I know it's good of you to take the time to tell our story and where you are that's brilliant cheers to that
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:29.400]  okay we're on your site and closing fitwatch.blogspot.com where are the where the images of these guys I want to I want to put them up
[1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:40.400]  you have to go to the link there's a post which has the names of the cops says identity of police officers and guarding in fitwatch video and there's a link in that article
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:47.400]  I see the green link right there yeah halfway halfway to third paragraph last line and third paragraph
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:43:01.400]  Val is blog and that has pictures of them good we're going to punch that up on screen and show that to the viewers do you ever talk to these guys when they're abusing you
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:09.400]  or violate your rights and say I'm a human why do you want to do this don't you know you're destroying England or is it even pointless to talk to them
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:19.400]  I find it pretty pointless to talk to them really to be honest there's Alan Palfrey who was choking you
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:29.400]  that is the bloke with all the tattoos on his arm and he is Nicholas Fisher
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:39.400]  okay we'll show you Fisher is Fisher on there is he in the first video G20 meltdown
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:49.400]  no but he's on the photo on the link you can see him quite clearly with all the tattoos on his arm
[1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:59.400]  I know what I wanted to ask you has this hurt the establishment or do they just say so what they that they beat to death the poor newspaper man at the G20
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:08.400]  because obviously they've been trying to cover up that they killed him then the video came out how was I mean is it just now yeah we murder whoever we want and that's the way it is
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:17.400]  oh no they're saying now that they're doing a big review of placing and it'll all be different and everything is going to change
[1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:25.400]  and it turns out that they'll actually only encourage it that's what they want is attack dogs that they lied and had a fake coroner say that he died of a heart attack
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:31.400]  but then they had a second autopsy done and it wasn't what they said
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:51.400]  pretty much that I mean yeah the first autopsy didn't didn't didn't wasn't full enough didn't didn't come out with the full facts of the case of the second one then clearly showed that he didn't have a heart attack at all but died of internal bleeding
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:45:00.400]  they also lied about whether they'd had contact with him they lied about whether they'd hit him and eventually it came out that they did they did all those things
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:08.400]  well he was delivering newspapers and they beat him from behind it's reported and they killed him and that's what you get trying to deliver newspapers you die
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:18.400]  and according to I guess that you know you make mistakes people die hail the police how dare you ladies even question them
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:30.400]  all right well we'll stay in contact with you and keep a stiff upper lip God bless you we appreciate that that British steel against the tyranny of the EU taking your country over and we'll talk to you again soon
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:32.400]  thank you thanks a lot
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  you better take care ladies all right Mark, John, Josh, Dave and others we're going to go to you here in just a minute or two
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:49.400]  like we'll just go to you right now then I'll get into all this massive news open world government takeover I cannot say this enough I've asked Paul Watson to write an article
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:46:01.400]  explaining to people that this is it this is the takeover of society right now that we're witnessing this is all the tyranny all the corruption of the past
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:12.400]  they would try to claim they weren't violating our rights of the Bill of Rights they would try to claim they weren't engaged in tyranny now it's just yeah we're going to secretly arrest whoever we want and torture you
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:21.400]  yeah we're going to taser you to give DNA samples yeah we're going to have warrantless checkpoints you have the army on the streets yeah we're going to take your private property yeah we're going to tax everything
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:31.400]  I mean it is really happening right now and yes Paul Watson got the article written red alert the total takeover of America enters its final phase the hot coot
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:39.400]  not just seizing government that already happened by the offshore banks corporations the National Security Council and that whole National Security Act umbrella
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:47.400]  now they're grabbing GM and hacking it up and giving pieces of it to who they want and Chrysler and grabbing what dealerships they want and giving it to who they want
[1:46:47.400 --> 1:46:57.400]  they're grabbing the infrastructure the power plants the land the lakes the roads the schools they're openly announcing every major states federalizing their police
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:05.400]  Arizona just announced they're merging the state police with the feds I mean it is just off the charts and that's coming up later in the next hour
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:13.400]  full frontal assault on every aspect of freedom takes into high gear as the elite twist the knife into the rotting carcass of the United States
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:21.400]  and that's what it is I mean this is just and now they got the bills to openly ban everything I'm saying and arrest me under felony charges
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:29.400]  and people will see me arrested just be well we better shut up I mean this is hardcore bullying they decided to run a Nazi Germany level takeover
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:38.400]  they're just hammering it in high gear they're going for broke and I hope you realize that folks I'm going to cover the hate crimes bill
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:45.400]  pass the house total ban on free speech now if all of us stand up and say no they're not going to get away with it
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:52.400]  let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls here let's talk to mark in Florida mark you're on the air welcome
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:48:02.400]  hi Alex good to talk with you again look I was just wondering how did they do these folks ever consider the constitutionality of the laws that they pass
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:12.400]  you know and all because this this latest thing they passed in the house seems like it it's a complete invasion of privacy it may be against the 9th and 10th
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:20.400]  amendment to know it's home it listen listen it's home inspections 10th amendment violation the everything regulated anything that has carbon it creates
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:27.400]  boards with unlimited power to take over whatever they want just like they got gun bills let the attorney general ban whatever he wants
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  just like I got water bills let the EPA take over whatever they want everything they're doing now is about total corporate dictatorship and then
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:43.400]  Obama creates corporate boards that sit above the government agencies and tell them what to do this is corporate government
[1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:53.400]  so it's not it's not just unconstitutional it's like they're dancing on the casket of the of the bill of right sir sir the clean water restoration act states word for word
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:49:01.400]  that the feds can do whatever they want to take anything that's got even water under it and and and all you know all the crust of the earth has
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:07.400]  water you know in it I mean there's there's underground water everywhere you can dig for water anywhere on the planet and find water
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:17.400]  and it just it's total control I mean they're moving they're openly announcing a bank of the world and the Federal Reserve will be the
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:25.400]  ownership of the U.S. and that no one can review it no one can touch it and any financial transaction or anything that affects the economy is
[1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:33.400]  under their regulation with no oversight a private corporation through treaty that's what this congressional law is it's a treaty with a
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:44.400]  corporation will rule America completely they already use the money power to buy everything up now they want to force you to sell this is just
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  a mafia this is just hammering everything I I I don't know what to say I'd like to know what I could what what what I can do I mean I
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:04.400]  could I can do a few things but you know people tell people abolish the Fed they're the enemy they're the usurper they're the false
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:11.400]  government this is corporate tyranny the corporate they all brag that oh Hitler did this Stalin did that Peter the great did this this
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:17.400]  that they say we're not going to do that we're going to have a corporate tyranny kind of a British imperial model behind the scenes
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:25.400]  corporate model where they create this web of international laws where they're above them and then all of us are ensnared in them and so you
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:33.400]  just reveal how ridiculous it is to have a foreign offshore banks openly buying off our governments and having our government
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:42.400]  illegally seed and and and advocate their power falsely over to them it's a corporate takeover just like corporations take over other

[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:53.400]  here hi mr jones i want to thank you for taking my call one quick comment real quick about your guest earlier um you know i think it's great what they're doing with fit um and i think more people now are waking up to you know police brutality in that
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:57:04.400]  because of you take a look at youtube even from a year ago to now the number of police brutality videos and people that are documenting police misactions have exploded online and so i i
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:13.400]  well the incredible part about it is is that the emt's in oklahoma a month ago said this crazy cop came up almost hit us in the back end we pulled right over
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:21.400]  and then he chased us he went to his his call was nothing came back chased us down through a neighborhood started screaming at us started pushing on us
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:27.400]  the cop story was they they wouldn't get out of my way on purpose and then they assaulted me
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:36.400]  then the squad car videos released in the emt's told the truth and the cops are on the news saying that exonerates them this lunatic we've shown you the video
[1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:45.400]  comes up on the ambulance at 90 miles an hour the ambulance pulls over almost hits a car in the in the breakdown ditch i mean instantly gets over
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:58.400]  and this cops on a roid rage or ptsd's back from iraq and the cops can't admit they're wrong and that's what's making them to get discreet i know most cops aren't nuts like this guy why are the higher ups protecting
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:08.400]  them is the question and and because they want the good guys to get disillusioned and leave they want a bunch of clockwork orange type thugs go ahead
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:21.400]  and well my main concern was the cap and trade bill today i'm watching msnbc because i watch a lot of multiple news sources and i'm not just going to get my news for one place because that's how you get dumbed down
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:35.400]  and obama sitting there talking about how energy legislation in california during the seventies has led to you know job creation and that stay there we're back to you in seventy seconds yeah i want to talk cap and trade

[1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:10.400]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:20.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:29.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:41.400]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:55.400]  who is here very devilish newspaper reporter i should add nonsense joking
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:01:00.400]  i'm just teasing you she doesn't like being teased
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  hey i'm the one that's gonna end up i'm the one under the microscope not you i'm not even gonna talk about who's who's here exactly
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:10.400]  okay ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:13.400]  i'm at devilish in a good way
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:21.400]  wane madson i'm just teasing her a bit wane madson is she'll get me back don't worry i know that see that's karma
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:26.400]  wane madson is our guest for the next 30 minutes but i wanted to finish up with uh...
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:32.400]  john in texas was bringing up the cap and trade what's happening with that and we'll go right to wane madson finish your point sir
[2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:39.400]  well he's saying that he's using california and he's saying that the the climate change reform that happened in the 70s
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:51.400]  has helped keep california's uh... you know uh... economy up to par with the rest of the nation but i don't think he knows that california's bankrupt because
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:02:00.400]  he's out there touting california as you know that they're at the beginning of their uh... cap and trade reform led to them creating jobs
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:04.400]  but now california's bankrupt so it's really not the best example
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:12.400]  he could be giving you know it for economic reform is to say hey look at the bankrupt state and let's let's well look look
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:19.400]  it's going to completely shut down the economy and the only parts of the economy they're going to survive are the ones that get government funding
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:26.400]  and that's what the big monopoly corporations aren't free market they they like their monopoly capitalist and so you're going to see a vertical integration
[2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:33.400]  of the economy big time it says nothing to do with the environment there are some serious issues with the environment like toxic waste
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:40.400]  or genetic engineering that have to be looked at and dealt with this is a total takeover of all human activity industrial activity on the planet
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:48.400]  just like obama publicly if you give big campaign contributions to democrats your fifteen million dollar minnesota dealership gets to stay with your family
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:55.400]  but if not they just come and take it because the government runs gm now and now ladies and gentlemen wane madson i wanted to get him on because
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:03:03.400]  he's just always spot on this guy's scary right but i guess he's up there at the national press club every day hooked in with all these people
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:10.400]  he formerly worked with the nsa and a security consultant for other unnamed government agencies he's written for some of the biggest publications
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:19.400]  in the country and a lot of times when i'm watching nsa or cia hearings in congress i'll see wane madson there in the audience reporting
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:26.400]  wane madson the former u.s. naval officer who assigned the national security agency he's also some twenty years experience in computer security
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:33.400]  and data privacy he's also worked the naval data automation command department of state rca corporation and computer science corporation

[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:48.400]  and a lot of other major publications wane madson we're about to break but i want to get you on about the flu you're right about that big manufacturer
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:56.400]  to laugh from your source now they admit it and i wanted to get into the economy and a lot more but first off what do you think of the cap and trade
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:06.400]  well you know they say the road to hell is paid with good intentions and you know certainly trying to save the planet as a good intention
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:16.400]  but it's the mechanics we see you know this whole thing with the carbon credit trading it looks like it's just another one of these scans is being perpetrated
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:27.400]  carbon exchanges you know i mean it looks like people are making money and you know today burning made up with sentenced to 150 years in prison
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:33.400]  for running a Ponzi scheme but i think there's a lot more Ponzi schemes out there that have yet to be uncovered
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:41.400]  well we know Madoff acted alone and now the 170 plus billion that they're now saying they've seized is going into a black hole
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:49.400]  but come on can lay came up with carbon trading can lays a fine-upstanding person when that's an engaging conspiracy theories
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:56.400]  we'll come back with more you know come on can lay i think it's great that algore owns the carbon trading company i'm gonna be paying taxes directly to him

[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:37.400]  I forgot to tell you guys go to the Alex Jones channel on youtube that's where it's posted top story of Wayne Madsen on rusher today I want to play a clip of that later before he leaves us because I want to give credit where credit's due
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:54.400]  of the reporters I know out there I would interview Wayne Madsen five six seven years ago and I know he was a credible reporter but you know sometimes that he kept breaking big news I would you know think man this guy be for real and he just continues to be right about everything
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:09.400]  and he just is always telling us when I call him up come on a few weeks about other big stories he's working on he put us on to a reporter about white supremacist in the army and FBI and BATF and tied into von brun and I looked at it and found some news reports and from the
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:25.400]  decade ago about it but I was still vetting it before I named a bunch of top army officers and people and then suddenly it's on the national press club this weekend you know big news so maybe we'll get him to talk a little bit about that as well he's really got his ear to the ground and of course he worked in intelligence
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:42.400]  as the U.S. government reports on intelligence but but but but bird flu the first person I said it's obviously manufactured just as a layman interviewing scientist because I knew you don't get a suddenly new me mutation strain that's part pig part bird part human
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:56.400]  with no lineage a normally occurring you know nature developed flu strain from all the scientists and virologists we talked to has a pedigree you know it's like if I have a my wife is a French bulldog we know it comes from French bulldogs we know those were
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:12.400]  developed 300 years ago in England and then the French got them and they have a certain characteristics same thing but it's like a purple poodle with yellow eyes shows up you know that was genetically engineered somebody manipulated the dog DNA to get that they have glowing
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:28.400]  jellyfish dogs that's Washington Post people won't believe that Google glowing jellyfish dogs will put it on screen but the point is with the analogy here is that this this this flu just came out of nowhere and then Madsen said he had sources
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:43.400]  he had sources in government sources and media scientist and exactly what he said then a month later came out and mainstream news BBC and others reported yeah it was made in a lab but they won't say where the scientists know who makes these they know the pedigree of
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:58.400]  even manufacturer ones why won't they say and now Baxter pharmaceutical tied in with putting live bird flu in with vaccine production labs and that gets covered up and then homeless die in Europe and secret vaccine trial just absolute
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:13.400]  yeah there is glow in the dark dogs that's just the idea in the San Francisco Chronicle they actually made them I have glow in the dark monkeys put up glow in the dark monkeys that they have those part jellyfish people won't believe me unless they say it okay going back to
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:20.400]  going back to Wayne Madsen Wayne go ahead tell us how did you know about the flu and what's your latest intel
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  you know the whole thing with this so-called twine flu which is really a hybrid flu the Centers for Disease Control even called it a novel flu even they're saying this is new because of the appellation they gave it they've given us this particular virus
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:56.400]  I first heard about this from a researcher who's a virologist who's looking at this in a laboratory and this is researcher at what a compelling story I'd love to identify this person but it would you know identity away and then and right now
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  this individual is conducting the research and everything this person has told me has come to pass I heard in in late April early May the prediction of this researcher was this thing was going to multiply around the world and in a couple months every country on the planet would have infections
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:29.400]  and that that is turned out to be true now we're now level six and and then you went further that they were this researcher told you they were planning a big hyped fear pandemic or maybe even a mutated real one in the fall you said this three months ago when it
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:47.400]  for and now they're saying that on the news forced to knock him in the forced inoculations this is getting scary Wayne well right now that the other prediction of the researcher was that it would begin to mutate and and that any vaccine that would be created to handle the new mutated
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  well be present by right now the H1N1 if it mutates that vaccine would be would not work against that that particular form of the flu now we know from Brazil and Germany that the this blue is now mutating so that that prediction has come true and now we know that
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:30.400]  it came out in the news today that that the this mutated version of the flu is now the vaccine and help it's resistant to the vaccine so all this has come to pass and I just believe that this individual who's working very closely with the person who created
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:47.400]  this virus in the laboratory was was right on the money and the fact is it was made it was a Jurassic Park type thing that some scientists backed by the U.S. Army 40 trick in the National Institute to help dug up the
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:14:05.400]  a very obese Eskimo woman who died of this the night of the 1918 pandemic found some tissue they could use took it back to the armed forces pathology Institute in Rockville, Maryland which is just down the highway from Fort Dietrich and recreated this and then began to
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:28.400]  gene spliced it and that's what we have today with the H1N1 what they call swine flu I called hybrid flu CDC calls it novel flu but it is it is a flu that was created in a Petrie dish and and the question is why and as I suggested today I think the FBI should start
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:41.400]  investigating this they should ease the record start interviewing these people and there's also a lab in Canada called the Winnipeg the National Microbiology Lab and the RCMP should do the same thing there but so far we see nothing
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:59.400]  absolutely this is this is scary because they're hyping it the media saying it's going to get bad in the fall when it's only kill less than 3040 people depending on what numbers you look at they and then you got all these scientists saying yeah it's been manipulated genetically from a lab somewhere
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:15.400]  then there's no big debate about the mystery of where it came from instead of it's a mystery about you know did Jaco Michael Jackson commit suicide I mean you know I don't care about Michael Jackson I care about my kids dying of some weaponized flu and I care about forced
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  inoculations for a flu vaccine they admit it's already mutated it won't even help you I mean I'm worried about the imploding economy I'm worried about North com the police state and instead it's all about Michael Jackson while all of this is happening
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:47.400]  what are your inside sources of any saying I mean can you tell us then that this person said this source is the scientist you talked to it says they know who produced it do they know why it was produced do they know this was done in research and somebody took it from them anything else Wayne
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:16:02.400]  I've gotten from the researcher is that one thing that these researchers do they try to eliminate every other possibility not the one thing that has been eliminated is this did not come from any animal so this this is that you can lay that one to rest
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:18.400]  the pigs are getting paid rap on this remember when it first started in Mexico they tried to blame it on some pig farm down there that was run by Smithfield and that's not true that it didn't come from there the media tried to hide that that's now admitted by the way you said that day one that's
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:40.400]  now admitted right right and then this is this researcher is now stating that the feeling is that it was engineered to sell back and then that's that's the you know there's the there's the profit motive the individual who created this actually had a financial interest in a company that
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:53.400]  manufactures a laboratory that manufactures the vaccine or trying to admit find the vaccine to manufacture for this particular strain and maybe future mutated strain so it looks like this is a situation where
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:17:14.400]  there's a there was a criminal intent here along and I'm surprised at the FBI the RCMP and other law enforcement agencies are looking at that because now it was reported that over a million people are infected in the United States and some 34,000 in New York City alone
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  now that's USA today and Reuters now now again it's perfect it's novel so normal biologists look at it and get scared but it's not that bad acting so it's perfect to spread create fear but not actually kill a lot of people is that what they're
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:39.400]  planning just to sell vaccines or is it cold bloodedly designs I know they have these that mutate to then become airborne a more airborne and kill more people
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:54.400]  well I think I think all all possibilities are on the table as far as this is concerned I you know it's just that it's just the amazing thing is how the media you know hype it when it was in Mexico and what we had a you know about 70 people infected
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:18:09.400]  there now we have a over a million in this country and and only a thousand in Europe are being reported so it's clear that the United States is ground zero for this every time that we just had the first reported case from Nepal today
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:24.400]  back where from the United States if you look at all these countries they're experiencing infections at nine times out of ten the people have just traveled from the United States rather now saying the epicenters either China or the United States but you're saying China that's a red herring
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:33.400]  that would make sense because we're more healthy here and so we're not dying of it but Mexico is the perfect incubator Mexico City because they're so run down
[2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  and the other there's another interesting factor here to back in the early May there was an individual who's traveling up from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg to take up a new job at the National Institutes of Health here in Bethesda, Maryland
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:19:03.400]  this individual was a native of the Ivory Coast in Africa at the border the North Dakota Manitoba border bringing in vials with a virus genetic material and HIV genetic material I saw that in the news yeah
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:18.400]  yeah and you know what the guy said the guy was put in jail he went to he went to trial the U.S. District the U.S. District Court I believe it was in Fargo or maybe Grand Fork I don't remember that but the person was given a fine as small fine and
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:39.400]  this sentence was the 17 days in jail he had already served so that's what somebody gets for trying to bring virulent streams of Ebola of all things into the United States you know you try to travel with some shampoo in a plane you're going to get a year in jail
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:57.400]  well we got Dr. Pianca we got Dr. Pianca running around Dr. Eric Pianca running around the countryside you know saying he can't wait for airborne Ebola to kill 90% of us Wayne Madsen let's finish up with this and then get into the white supremacist in the U.S. government
[2:19:57.400 --> 2:20:11.400]  that story you were telling about behind the scenes has now come out mainstreamish Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world and for the first time in their lives they are feeling the need for preparedness

[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:13.400]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:19.400]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:24.400]  well Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:37.400]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:47.400]  it's not about left to right it's about a one world government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:15.400]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[2:22:15.400 --> 2:22:21.400]  is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[2:22:21.400 --> 2:22:28.400]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the creature from Jekyll Island

[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:28.400]  okay let's go right back to Wayne Madsen Wayne anything else on this flu situation
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:41.400]  yeah I would just say that watch for this thing now that the mutations to be reported we've got some initial reports from Brazil the German scientists have looked at it
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:58.400]  I'm not complaining it's undergoing mutation rapid mutation I would note that the day I talked about this virus mutating I was on Russia today that was on a 12th noon Moscow time
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:15.400]  the same day Margaret Chan at director the World Health Organization was in Moscow and there was a news conference and she was pointedly asked if this virus mutating and she denied that it was so we're not getting the straight scoop from the World Health Organization
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:40.400]  even though they declared it's a level 6 pandemic and certainly the Centers for Disease Control which were inferred for weeks saying that they were undercounting the number of infections in this country now we find out that over a million people are infected here so there's a real problem with getting good information from these so-called public health international and national public health organization
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:26:04.400]  well Wayne that was the question I wanted to ask you three or four days into the panic a city official I know I'll just leave it at that came to the office and brought the internal memorandum from a CDC meeting with state and city officials in San Antonio where they didn't shut down some schools just north of San Antonio
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  and it said we're telling the public we're at level 4 we're already level 5 in 90 hours 92 hours or is it 96 points is 90 plus hours we're really going to level 6 but no one's going to be told and I went on air and posted you know the document and people didn't believe me and then later it came out over at level 6 we've been under it a while
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:36.400]  so it's almost like they're drilling for when there really is a level 6 someday it's like they're saying it's a level 6 in name only for worldwide pandemic but I mean I have that document
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:49.400]  and the document says there have been many more deaths and many more illnesses and I kept getting that chatter from other state and federal people I know so is this is this like a fire drill or is this the real deal
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:27:05.400]  well we don't know how to mutate as a matter of fact the news today is in the mainstream media anyway that this may mutate into a more virulent strain so we may not have seen the worst yet the worst may be coming but certainly we haven't seen
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:20.400]  you know the health minister of India criticized this country for not screening people leaving the United States because we are the point of infection for many of these countries now they're experiencing their first cases whether it's one individual in the case of
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:38.400]  the family of three traveled from New York back there same reports from many many different countries around the world that the first cases are from the United States but there seems to be no no interest by our public health officials here to try to stop the spread of this overseas we've got
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:55.400]  him over a million cases but the you know we're seeing a huge spike today reported in England Australia is a very bad situation Australia and the worst case scenario is those countries that have no public health infrastructure and now we have the first cases now reported in
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  Sub-Saharan Africa India and the word you know bang or dash everywhere how many people live there and how easily that will be spread in a country like that why secretly have a level six months ago and then announced it a few weeks ago what
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:17.400]  I mean what's your angle on that or any of the intel people you know you know any of the press people you talk to me what are they saying
[2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:30.400]  well you would think that this would be very transparent you know a public health issue why why sit on information that would be like sitting on weather reports but the way they're dealing with this you might might well be dealing with
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:46.400]  meetings at the Federal Reserve a lot of this stuff is just being it's just being held very close you would think you would want to inform the public about a pandemic but we see information being withheld on a daily basis and it makes no sense and I have to think that there's
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  some you know criminal predicates to all this and it would be nice to see them investigate it but I'm not holding my breath because it would have been nice to see the FBI really investigate the anthrax attacks on the media in Congress and they blame this poor
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  Dr. Ivan who was actually trying to find the perpetrator they said you know it was him after of course you know he committed you know he committed and now it's coming out that his DNA at the mailbox doesn't match and that he's basically innocent and nobody wants to talk about how he died in the
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:31.400]  government mental institution they just say he took his own life yeah locked up in a mental institution when they secretly grabbed him Wayne I know you're a busy guy if you go in a meeting do five more minutes on the racist angle if you can on the other side of this quick break can you do that

[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:23.400]  you know the term twittering around is kind of ruined now because I would always use that term he was twittering about you know who knitting it's kind of a knitting chirping
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:38.400]  but now Twitter kind of like sort of saying a search engine you got to say Google people want me to use the names of other systems and not plug Google but that's now the universal term I've got to use the semantical lexicon to communicate with people
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:51.400]  Anna Montana is on her twitter account asking who I am and then they say Heidi's boyfriend Spencer Pratt is a big info where it's fan and post to his twitter account and then it's all these people talking about me
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:34:02.400]  what's interesting about this is is that when you when I go to Hollywood literally there aren't really any stars I've ever met or run into that aren't already fans of the show
[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:15.400]  and of course Rick Linklater talked about how he gave my films to Bruce Willis and that woke him up and people didn't believe it and then Vanity Fair asked him about it and it kind of left me out of it but then he that's where the quote came from
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:30.400]  and Vanity Fair of him saying yeah the people that killed Kennedy still run the government and I'm not left or right anymore and that's what Rick Linklater I mean the point is all these people Keanu Reeves I didn't wake up Charlie Sheen
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:41.400]  Charlie Sheen was already very very awake but we're really good friends but the exciting thing is when Hannah Montana starts to ask who I am you know we're having an effect
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:53.400]  I'm going to shove about that and go back to Wayne Madsen but Wayne before we get into the white supremacist riddling the government according to some of the reports some of your colleagues have been putting out in your own research you've written some articles on it
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:35:07.400]  now coming out mainstream news as usual you're kind of over the horizon side Liberty freedom waking up to the corporate structure it is really exploding exponentially do you agree with that
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:27.400]  Oh certainly and I think you know the fact is more people are now going to the internet for their news and they're getting off those George Orwell telescreens the you know the 324x7 cable news networks which is nothing more than propaganda and you know now here in Washington we have under construction
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:40.400]  a place called the Institute of the U.S. Institute for Peace which is really the U.S. Institute for War that's right out of Orwell but this is going to be the big meal constable here in Washington and they're going to be talking
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:48.400]  about all kinds of you know U.S. intervention in other countries you know latest one of course is Honduras where it looks like our fingerprints are all over that coop
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  Well I want to ask you about that because it's coming out the generals as you know people may not want to talk about it you were in intelligence that they are
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:06.400]  were trained in school of America's he was going to legalize drugs he was actually fighting the cartels CIA didn't let that happen that's their main business but getting into the racist we saw von Brun
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:21.400]  he attacks in 8081 or 82 with fake dynamite and a gun they disarming easily he's held for six years he's then released he's got all these weird southern property law center connections you know they got caught running the white supremacist compound
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:33.400]  in L.A. city with it with McVeigh according to FBI documents declassified and suddenly von Brun right when they're trying to pass all these hate crimes laws and it got it passed through the house it happened right as that vote was
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:45.400]  happening now going to the Senate von Brun pops up and it turns out when we were at the National Press Club interviewing you and others that that some of the reporters you introduced us to and now it's been national news
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  interviewing von Brun was tied into special forces colonels commanders connections of white supremacist the good old boy round up from 92 on 60 minutes with the with the VATF and FBI selling in inward hunting licenses break that down
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  the number one person on this is a fellow by the name of John Edward Hurley and we actually had a forum at the press club on Friday about Justice Department malfeasance and some political prosecutions notably against Governor Segelman of Alabama
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  and a few other high-ranking Democrats in the southern states but one of the things that Hurley was a longtime colleague of the White House press correspondent Sarah McClendon who actually was more senior than Helen Thomas.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:44.400]  She died a few years ago but John Hurley was on to this back during Iran Contra where he noted that a lot of the people involved with these white supremacist clan, neo-Nazi organization.
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:49.400]  That's like G. Gordon-Liddy with Nixon thought that he was like a German general but go ahead.
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:58.400]  Right. Well he found out that many of these people were involved in Iran Contra. They were in the Reagan administration. They were in the Bush 1 administration.
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:13.400]  More recently they were in the George W. Bush administration. A lot of these individuals were also paid informants of the FBI and we know that one person whose name was mentioned as a guy who worked with von Brun.
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:19.400]  That was guy Todd Blodgett. He came right out and said he was a paid informant.
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:24.400]  But these people all were in the Bush 1 administration. A lot of them were in the Bush 1 administration.
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:35.400]  And I remember my days at Ole Miss where my history professors, southern history professors were telling me back during the days of the clan that there were so many FBI infiltrators.
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:43.400]  One FBI agent who had infiltrated the clan would be reporting on other clan members who turned out to also be FBI agents.
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  In fact there were some meetings where there'd be five people and four of them would be FBI.
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:53.400]  You didn't know about the fifth. But anyway, yeah, this is a big problem.
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:39:05.400]  And now many of these people had climbed onto this anti-terrorism counterterrorism thing after 9-11. But they're there. They've infiltrated, as you say.
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:14.400]  There are many, many different parts of the government, both as political appointees, as we saw under the Reagan and Bush administration, but others are senior civil service.
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:22.400]  But you have to wonder about just what is the FBI up to when they're running these people and then they commit these acts.
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:34.400]  Elaine, that's my question, is I'm sure you remember 60 Minutes of 92 where the militia guys went in and they were hanging black people in effigy, BATF, FBI, close to a thousand, I think at the meeting was in Alabama or South Carolina.
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  In fact, pull up good ol' boy roundup for me. They were selling, you know, inward hunting licenses and all this.
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:53.400]  I researched it more and it's not just that the FBI and BATF and CIA are running the white supremacist groups, getting them to stage attacks and then take our rights, but they really are Nazis.
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:40:01.400]  So, I mean, what is going on? And then, meanwhile, the ADL is like over them somehow, very bizarre mixture of people.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  Well, I have to point out, I live in Arlington, Virginia, and this is where George Lincoln Rockwell had his American Nazi Party headquarters, and here's a guy who was a commander in the Navy during World War II.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:25.400]  Can you imagine? We lose over 600,000 people fighting the Axis in that war. This guy Rockwell is running a ladies magazine in Manhattan, but decides all of a sudden to come to the Washington area to start the American Nazi Party.
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:37.400]  I heard from an old friend of mine now deceased who investigated Rockwell for Reader's Digest magazine and found out that a lot of his money was actually coming from the ADL.
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  George Lincoln Rockwell, when he ran that magazine in New York, his biggest advertisers for U.S. Lady were Bergdorf Goodman, Macy Sacks, Gimbalz, all these Jewish owned department stores.
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:58.400]  Why in the world would he just then turn around, come to Washington, and start the American Nazi Party?
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:08.400]  Well, it's obvious that he was part of this idea. We've got to keep our thing going, so we start this guy up, and we can point to him and say, look, there's still a threat.
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:15.400]  I think this has been going on for decades in this country, and the FBI is perfectly content to work with some of these people.
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:24.400]  I think it's part of this Galilean dialectic where you have two sides playing off against one another.
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:29.400]  They've got to have an enemy to take the general public's liberties and freedoms and spy on us.
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:38.400]  Every time I research Nazis, I find out they're joined to the hip with the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and the FBI, and they're just a bunch of whacked out freaks.
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:57.400]  What do you think about this hate crimes bill? I was reading the subsection and found out, it's past the House, that it has the same subsection as the other act, the cyber bullying, where it says, if you criticize someone and it hurts their feelings, the feds will charge you with a felony.
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:10.400]  Wayne, it seems on every front, federal government takeover, private fellow reserve takeover, a water bill takeover of all water in the country. Everything's happening right now.
[2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  This wall may not survive the Supreme Court, because I would note today that the Supreme Court ruled against Missouri, which wanted to bring a charge against Westboro Baptist Church, where they picket the funals of guys coming back from Iraq.
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  Guys that got killed over there, the Supreme Court upheld the rate of that Westboro as muddy as they are. They said they had every right to picket these funals.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:51.400]  For those that don't know, the First Amendment is to protect nuts like that, who are really, I think, very distasteful, but it's there for distasteful speech, not for speech you like.
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:43:04.400]  Right, so I would say, based on the Supreme Court's ruling today, that that hate crime legislation may not pass muster, because somebody obviously is going to bring suit against that if they're ever charged under that.
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:11.400]  The Supreme Court, we've already gotten out of the Supreme Court ruling in that particular area, so I don't think it'll pass.
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:21.400]  Well, Wayne, I've got to say the Supreme Court, you know, a lower federal court had said they could strip-search little girls, because she gave a friend an Advil, and they strip-searched her.
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:26.400]  And a lower court said they could do that. The higher court, as you know, last Friday, said they couldn't.
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:31.400]  Except for Clarence Pormont Thomas, he said it was perfectly okay.
[2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:39.400]  Yeah, but I mean, I have to say, we've been seeing some half-decent rulings out of the Supreme Court. What's going on up there?
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  Well, you know, we've got David Souter, who turned out to be, you know, the worst nightmare for the neocons and their whole agenda.
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:44:02.400]  He's being replaced. My take on Sotomayor, even though she, you know, the court ruled against her ruling on that New Haven firefighters deal where they said that they were subject to reverse discrimination exam.
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:13.400]  I have a feeling that Sotomayor is going to be very much like Judge Souter. The word is that she's very big on privacy issues, although there's not a whole lot of cases all there.
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:18.400]  But people who know her, read her decisions, feel that she's really going to be another Souter.
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:26.400]  So we may see the court not move at all, especially in the area of, you know, cracking down on free speech.
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  Hey, Wayne, I was just on WayneMadsReport.com, and I'm sorry I'm ignorant. You know, I missed so many things. None of us are omnipresent here.
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:36.400]  You have a legal defense fund. What happened with that?
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  Well, I was arrested in Alexandria back in March while interviewing a source. The source was arrested by the local John Darms, and I asked what the charges were.
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:56.400]  I said they weren't going to tell me. I gave them a bunch of grief, and the next thing I knew, I was under arrest, charged with this.
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  It was a beef in England law. It's still in the book here in Commonwealth of Virginia. It's drunk in public, but it also means that disorderly conduct, a failure to obey a police officer.
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:07.400]  That's one of their favorites.
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:20.400]  Yeah. They decided not to prosecute that, but it's a fair other thing now. I've got to get the record expunged, and that's actually done by a higher court where there's really no rate of appeal.
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:26.400]  So I just found out Friday that the Commonwealth is not going to contest the expungement, but it continues.
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  What's going on in Virginia and D.C.? I was there for Bilderberg last year, and everywhere I went, I would try to videotape from Parks, the Washington Monument,
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:45.400]  from 100 yards away, and cops would run up and threaten to arrest me, and they told me I couldn't videotape the White House, but they weren't just doing it to me.
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:58.400]  Old ladies, families, Boy Scout groups, and they'd say, we don't care. No, it's not terrorism, it's terrorism, and this happened in Kansas City to my camera guys. What is going on?
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:09.400]  Well, that has been a problem since 9-11. I have a friend who was trying to take a picture of the D.C. Superior Court of all places, and he was threatened with arrest, and they threatened to seize his camera.
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:15.400]  But this is all part of the whole post-9-11 thing. You can't take pictures of anything.
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:18.400]  But it's all color law. They don't even have a law.
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:27.400]  There's no law. Whatever the cop feels at the time, and nine times out of ten, the judge will go along with whatever the cop says.
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  Wayne Madsen, you've given us a lot of time in closing. Honduras, obviously we hear, oh, he wasn't supposed to run again. He's evil.
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:41.400]  He was trying to have a referendum, and then we know the West had been targeting him for overthrow.
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  He had called for the decriminalization of drugs, saying that it was basically a CIA operation, and the drug dealers didn't like him.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:57.400]  And so I guess because he wanted to end the drug war, again, the drug dealers want to keep it illegal out there for folks who don't understand this. That's how they make their profits.
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:00.400]  Key leaders of Honduran military coup were trained in the U.S.
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:04.400]  Wayne, what are you hearing up there on the hill or up there at the press club on this?
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  Well, what I'm hearing is that the foreign minister of Honduras, Patricia Rodas, tried to call the American ambassador in Teguccia, Galpa. She got no answer.
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:21.400]  Obama's saying that he's urging calmly. He said he's only going to recognize President Goliath, the guy who was out there, this is true later.
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:29.400]  But I say, you know, talk is cheap. Let's look at the actions. I see no effort to sever relations with that military junta.
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:34.400]  No effort to impose economic sanctions. We see nothing.
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:44.400]  We have 600 U.S. troops stationed at both O'Connell air base in Honduras. What was their role? What did they know? What did the NSA know?
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:52.400]  They're eavesdropping out of actually NSAID Texas, which is up in San Antonio at the Medina annex. They knew what was coming down. Our troops down there know what was happening.
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:58.400]  We had a U.S. southern command team arrive at another Honduran air force base.
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  Conveniently, at the same time, the coup was underway. It looked like it was the same thing that was going on against Hugo Chavez and his coup turned out to be an aborted coup in 2007.
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:15.400]  Yeah, they grabbed him and put him on an airplane, and then something happened when his troops rebelled and took the capital back over.
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:18.400]  They turned around and flew him back in 2002. That was in March.
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:26.400]  Exactly. And whoever planned this coup did want to make that same mistake, so they made sure that the Honduran military was on side.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:32.400]  I think this is a textbook case of what they teach at the School of the Americas at Fort Benning.
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:39.400]  And they also assassinated the only leftist candidate for president in the elections in November.
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:45.400]  Cesar Ham was assassinated when the Honduran troops showed up to arrest him. He was killed.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:55.400]  So this is much more than a constitutional crisis. This is a class book, a military coup, the kind of things they teach at Fort Benning, Georgia, at the School of the Americas.
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:49:02.400]  Well, since, yeah, where his top military brass were trained, who just overthrew him, the Iran situation.
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:10.400]  I have Obama saying we're not involved when the CIA officially, for at least two and a half years, as you know, publicly says they were funding a student revolution.
[2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:22.400]  The guy that claims he's been cheated announced two hours before polls closed that he'd been cheated when even U.S. polling companies said two to one for Ahmed Denizide,
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:28.400]  who only won by 65% instead. I'm no defender of Ahmed Denizide. The point is, reality is reality.
[2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:36.400]  And it seems like whatever Obama says, it's always the opposite. He says, oh, I want to be your friend right as they launch the attempted overthrow. Do you agree with that?
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:44.400]  Yes, and I would also note that a neocon named Kenneth Zimmerman, the day before the election, started talking about the Green Revolution.
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:54.400]  Here we go with another Soros colored thematic revolution. I think Soros' fingerprints are all over this. I would note that Ahmed Denizide today said that this girl who was shot,
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:50:02.400]  he wants to investigate that. She was shot in the back, and they say there were no Iranian security forces around there.
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:09.400]  Exactly. It looks completely staged. And in her poor family, they have no idea. I mean, that thing looks staged 100%.
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  Not that they don't shoot people, but that's certainly staged. I mean, that's what my gut said day one.
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:22.400]  Right, they needed a martyr, and they have one in her. Whether she was willing or unwilling, she's the martyr, but Ahmed Denizide is calling for an investigation.
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:29.400]  Wayne, I'm going to let you go, but I've got to have you up again. The San Antonio current paper went out to photograph the Cybersecurity Building,
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:39.400]  NSA San Antonio. I know you work for the NSA, so you can speak to this. And they came out and arrested them and grabbed their tape off base.
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:44.400]  They're the ones violating the law down there. Spying on everybody, Wayne.
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:47.400]  Absolutely, and they don't like the attention.
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:52.400]  Well, they're going to get a lot more of it here. Wayne Madsen, God bless you. We're going to beat these people with great patriots like you.
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:59.400]  WayneMadsenReport.com. Thank you. Thank you, Wayne. Infowars.com's our side. Stay with us. I'm going to get into a bunch of news when we get back.

[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:33.400]  Well, we're already coming up on the final hour. Time flies when you're fighting tyranny and thuggery.
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:40.400]  I want to take calls in this segment and the next and continuing up to Richard Reeves joining us in studio. Is he in studio today or is he going to be on the phone?
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:51.400]  He's already here? Okay, he's in studio. So that's coming up on the land grabbing and stuff. I want to take your calls on a host of issues coming up here.
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:55:00.400]  And then I want to get into thought crime bills, threat and talk radio, and cyber bullying, not about protecting kids. It's about shutting down the internet.
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:10.400]  Now that's CurtNemoInfoWars.com. But don't believe me. Here is ABC7 News, anti-bullying legislation, threat to free speech.
[2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  Proponents say bullying can be stopped while preserving freedoms. They say this is for kids, but the way it reads is for everybody.
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:24.400]  And then we have the hate crime bill that's actually passed the House and I want to read this to you what it says.
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  And if this doesn't kill the First Amendment, our beloved republic's First Amendment, the first of all rights, the right for free speech, I don't know what does.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:40.400]  So that is coming up after I take some calls. And look, Watson says this is a big deal and I guess he's right.
[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:46.400]  We've been critical of Hannah Montana on this same subject. We don't think she's a bad person. We think she's talented.
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:58.400]  It is brain rot for the young girls out there to kind of suck them into the deeper estuaries of the corporate mind control to make them feel inadequate so the new order can sell them Gardasil.
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:08.400]  But other than that, you know, we don't think Hannah Montana herself is a bad person.
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:23.400]  But we have been critical of her for supporting the end of the First Amendment. You know, she has her right to put out this 20 stuff that I am trying to protect my daughters from.
[2:56:23.400 --> 2:56:31.400]  Everybody likes Hannah Montana. Paul Hartman there was saying he got a CD for his daughter.
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:43.400]  And look, I mean, it's pretty wholesome stuff overall. It just I just I think girls grow up too quick. Boys grow up too quick and it kind of just is a vortex off into a whole another dimension.
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:49.400]  And I just don't like anything that, you know, tries to take over the life of my family and I see it with other girls.
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:54.400]  But again, my criticism of her is not supporting the First Amendment.
[2:56:54.400 --> 2:57:03.400]  And so I hope people go and Twitter her more and ask her questions about why she supports this language here.
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:08.400]  But I'm going to cover that starting in the next hour. I'm going to go to your calls up for a while before I get into all of that.
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:15.400]  And then more on this key article that's up on prisonplanet.com. This is a maximum red alert.
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:22.400]  We only put these out every month or so. I'm asking listeners to hammer this through the mainstream media, post this on every blog message board everywhere.
[2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:29.400]  This is an info war imperative attack request if you should choose to take this mission.
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:33.400]  We're asking you to red alert the total takeover America enters final phase.
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:37.400]  It's kind of a boil down master article about the enemy's operation.
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:43.400]  They're clearly going for everything, including a hot police state after they've got this legislation done.
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  This is again equivalent of a Soviet slash Nazi purge that we're facing. This is highest level red alert info warriors, man the guns, smash the enemy, overrun them in the cyber domains immediately.
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:06.400]  In the info war countdown 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, engage.
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:11.400]  Let's blast it out there and expose these bastards, making their criminal move on us right now.
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:20.400]  Let's blast down their climate change garbage with their global surf tax to the IMF and World Bank for World Government, even as MSNBC is admitting.
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  Let's blast the enemy on their water takeover. Let's blast them on their hate crimes takeover of the First Amendment.
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:33.400]  Their attempt to totally gut the borders with the North American Union and the hemispheric travel ID pass and legalizing the illegal aliens.
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:42.400]  Let's stop them on all of their criminal activities. Let's defend the Republic, engage the enemy.

[2:59:53.400 --> 3:00:10.400]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:21.400]  This is your chance to go toe-to-toe with the New World Order propaganda masters. For this article, red alert, total takeover of America enters its final phase. The people need to see the full picture.
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:29.400]  Obama's approval rating of the next session of Congress is probably going to be 45. He won't be able to push anything through. Everybody's going to know he's a criminal liar.
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  I'm going to play some more of the lies that he's now gone back on from the campaign. I think the final two promises he hadn't broken are now being broken.
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  Not to raise taxes on people below $300,000 a year. That's the couple. So people below $125,000 a year. And not to have signing statements.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:51.400]  He is the greatest liar this country's ever seen. He makes slick willy look like an honest schoolboy.
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:01:02.400]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls. Let us now go ahead and punch up the calls. And let's talk to Josh in Washington. Josh, you're on the air.
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:10.400]  Hey, Alex. I just want to thank you for what you're doing. And first time caller. I've been listening for a while. I had a couple things I wanted to touch on.
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:19.400]  First one was cap and trade. And I wish I could fight these thugs the way you do. I wrote a strongly word letter to Jim McDermott, our representative in the seventh year today.
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  I told him he couldn't tax me a little bit. I reminded him he had until the second to change his vote and threatened to run against him.
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:38.400]  Well, you need to physically go to the Democrats that voted for it and the eight Republicans offices as a constituent. This is worth people flying to D.C. to get in and see your congressman.
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:47.400]  I mean, they need to have, you know, notes. If you're the next door neighbor, leave a note on their car in a friendly way saying please don't destroy the economy.
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:59.400]  Please don't give us a vertically integrated crony capitalist, monopoly capitalist slave system. Please don't be like the Chinese generals that own the Chinese, you know, companies, you know, for God's sakes, you know, have some humanity.
[3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:07.400]  And I mean, I mean, they need to physically like Google the name of your congressman that voted for it and see when they're having events. You know, they have the motion to reconsider.
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  In fact, guys go to info wars.com and pull it up. There's a story that we posted from the Daily Paul titled climate tax traders have four days to reconsider.
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:33.400]  It's now like two and a half. We have a counter. We added to the story at info wars and prison planet that shows the countdown. We, they have a few days to reconsider their vote left.
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:41.400]  So we need to call right now. Go ahead, sir. Okay. Um, I guess the second thing I wanted to touch on, um, I had heard about this bill.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:51.400]  I don't remember the exact name of it, but it was the one for, you know, compassionately allowing patients to, uh, you know, put their terminal sickness to an end.
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:58.400]  And I mean, I watched my mom die of cancer and I know that the slippery slope to allow doctors to stray from the Hippocratic oath.
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:06.400]  But on the other hand, to deny someone their personal choices and very patriotic. Um, am I missing something here? I just, I kind of wanted your input on that.
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:17.400]  Say that again. I'm sorry. I wasn't ignoring you, but I was looking at the screen. We have two days, nine hours, 56 minutes and 56 seconds to defeat it out of the house with a motion to reconsider.
[3:03:17.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  Go ahead and finish your point. You're saying exactly what about the healthcare and cancer?
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:33.400]  Um, well, um, there are certain bills that are allowed or that they're putting forward to allow terminal patients to, uh, you know, euthanize themselves in their life, you know.
[3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:39.400]  And I mean, I watched my mom die of cancer and I wouldn't want to have to not have the choice if I want to.
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:45.400]  Here's the problem. Nobody can stop you if you want to go buy a gun or hang yourself or take a bunch of pain pills.
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:58.400]  And, and, and, and, and, and, but hold on the gun. I don't think that's a decision you make. The whole point here is the government, the eugenicist running things, the bioethicist boards, they want to ration care.
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:14.400]  They have openly on record said that the government is basically going to, they're already euthanizing people in China and in Europe who don't want it.
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  And some of the countries, like the Netherlands, they have to put tattoos on themselves or bracelets saying, don't, don't, don't euthanize me.
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  So the issue is they're already euthanizing the old and infirm. The Wall Street Journal had a whole series of articles written by Mr. White.
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:35.400]  We had him on years ago, uh, about how they, uh, Robert Wendland and people who would beg for food and water and be chained down and die of the rewards of the state.
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:41.400]  When the government's the guardian, they kill you. So it's already going on. That's why we're against those bills.
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  Okay. They don't want to pay for you. It's eugenics. It's like carousel, carousel from Logan's run.
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:53.400]  And so that's my position on that more call straight ahead to a Barack Obama's latest lies and betrayals.
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:05:00.400]  And he goes, Oh, it's just politics. I just lied to you. So much fun.

[3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:06.400]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[3:06:06.400 --> 3:06:12.400]  Inner Health Botanicals, this company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.

[3:06:47.400 --> 3:07:00.400]  This is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:21.400]  When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:26.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:07:26.400 --> 3:07:31.400]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:35.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:41.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:44.400]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:44.400 --> 3:07:51.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:07:51.400 --> 3:08:15.400]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:25.400]  David Illinois, you're on the air.
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:27.400]  Can you hear me?
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:28.400]  Yes, sir.
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  I'm actually injured marine and I'm an Iraq war veteran and my brother called in April about my house getting GPS right after I went to the tea party.
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:50.400]  The main reason I was calling was my mother is a nurse and she was invited to a symposium at a big hospital in the Chicago land area.
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:59.400]  It was about post-traumatic stress. The main speaker was a retired lieutenant general, Andre.
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:03.400]  The whole thing was supposed to be about post-traumatic stress.
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:06.400]  It was all really about how we got to take the guns from the veterans.
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:19.400]  Well, it actually wasn't that. You started talking about how we need to prepare for the next terrorist attack or the next natural disaster and how all these people need to get emergency kits ready soon.
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:29.400]  They're going around all the federal and state agencies. We've confirmed in Indiana they're saying get ready for millions to be buried dead out of Chicago mass graves.
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:36.400]  I've gotten the internal state reports where they're going around surveying for mass graves all over the country for flu.
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:44.400]  This was before the flu hyping started and then I saw these dark winter drills and other drills dealing with it.
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:53.400]  They may be using it as a cover for setting up their martial law grid and telling locals to scare them to go along with it or they could be planning it.
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:59.400]  These are the guys that let black men die as syphilis and radiated children to death, foster children.
[3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:03.400]  They admittedly do all this in eugenics to our entire population.
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:09.400]  Basically, our neighbor gets grabbed, our cousin gets grabbed, all these young people are dying of cancer all around us.
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:13.400]  The mercury's in the shots, all of it. People are just dying everywhere.
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:23.400]  Just slowly they turn the ambient background up. The corruption, the tyranny, the dehumanization just keeps fading up and up and up.
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:32.400]  And yes, they are going around GPSing everybody for phase one in the census and then phase two is some people get a 200 question, some get a 60 question, some get a 40 question.
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:35.400]  Do you own guns? How much money do you have in the bank?
[3:10:35.400 --> 3:10:46.400]  The bureaucrats show up with a little badge. This happened to me in 2000. Threatening to arrest you if you don't answer what your stocks and bonds are in the American survey.
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:52.400]  You have a Fourth Amendment. You don't have to do that. And they don't care. It's just all about training us to be slaves.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:11:02.400]  And I read that, you know, it was in the London Telegraph about how in Afghanistan and Iraq, they pay the local tattletales to like $5 a house.
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:13.400]  It's $40 a house. In fact, pull that up. I actually found the article the other day when I was going through it. I'm trying to remember the exact headline where the drones then bomb innocent houses.
[3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:26.400]  But the troops and the intelligence officers say, we don't care. We just want to show higher ups that we're hitting targets because that's used then for the kill list and the death counts.
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:37.400]  They can say, we killed this many. That's why they bomb innocent people. And then the Pentagon likes it because then it also makes the domestic population fight.
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:50.400]  And then they can say, see, there's an enemy. So they actually want to go out and kill innocent people to then generate a Taliban resistance or a Shiite resistance in Iraq or a Sunni resistance.
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:58.400]  And it's just totally diabolical. So they go and pay the locals to go throw a GPS in your house. It's the size of a of a penny.
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:10.400]  And then they fire cruise missiles into the house, killing the family. And meanwhile, kids that were playing video games five years ago are playing video games of killing people.
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:20.400]  And now they admit they're using Xbox controllers for tanks and drones. And the kids, they're running TV ads advertising. You like video games? Fly one for real.
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:26.400]  And they're in simulators targeting with the predators and grim reaper drones, just blowing whole families apart. I mean, they admit it.
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  In fact, I'm going to go dig it out of my file here in just a moment. Anything else, sir?
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:40.400]  Well, it was weird enough that he talked about being ready for the next terrorist attack or whatever during a post-traumatic threat symposium.
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:48.400]  But halfway through the speech, he asked the audience, he goes, how many of you have microchips in your dog? A couple of people raised their hands.
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:56.400]  And then he goes ahead and says, well, do you care more about your animals than you do about your kids? And it's like, yeah, it's for the children.
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:01.400]  So he was pushing implantable chips for the kids at a government symposium.
[3:13:01.400 --> 3:13:07.400]  It wasn't government, it was at a hospital with a bunch of medical professionals there.
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:21.400]  Yeah, well, let me tell you, just people that just joined us. My cousin, who's been in the Army for 20 years plus now, he shows up, he calls us, I want to come over and have coffee.
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:33.400]  And he wasn't even stationed in Austin at the time. And he comes over and he says, I went to a symposium at Fort Sam Houston.
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:39.400]  And they told over 200 officers in attendance that within two years we're all going to get chips.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:43.400]  And he goes, my God, I heard you talk about that and got in your face about it at a family reunion.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  Then a couple of years later, I asked him about it. He said, I'm not going to talk to you about it, national security.
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.400]  So he's probably got a chip and they got these guys taking.
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:55.400]  But remember the Mexican attorney general made his employees take chips.
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:59.400]  Google that. They won't believe it. Mexican attorney general's employees take chips. ABC News.
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:08.400]  And so then what's happening is, remember Tommy Thompson next to Tommy Thompson.
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:14.400]  Tommy Thompson went to schools nationwide and told the kids they all need to take implantable chips.
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:21.400]  Next do that. First do, Mexican attorney general makes employees take chips and then do Tommy Thompson tells kids take chips.
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:27.400]  And he was on the payroll of applied digital solutions, the microchip company, a subgroup of IBM.
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:35.400]  It's a front company. There it is. Microchips and planted Mexican officials, MSNBC attorney general, prosecutors carry security pass under skin.
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:42.400]  Now hit them with the next one. Hit them with the next one. Google, what was the next one I was telling you?
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:48.400]  What was the other headline I wanted about, about implantable chips?
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  But anyways, so what else was said? So get ready for martial law, basically it's for your safety and take implantable chips.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:55.400]  What was next?
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:59.400]  Well, I actually emailed him. I went on the internet and I found his email address.
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  This is a general who's in charge of a joint task force Katrina. I use it all involved in that.
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:09.400]  And I asked him about the, how he felt about the gun confiscation that happened there in Katrina.
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:14.400]  And I also asked him not to encourage people to get microchip because it's something you do.
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:18.400]  He's the take charge. He's a black guy, right?
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:20.400]  Yes, I believe so.
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:22.400]  Okay, so tell me what happened next.
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:29.400]  All right, so I emailed him asking about that. And so almost instantaneously, I get this response back and he goes,
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:39.400]  I didn't call for babies to get microchipped or anything, just some tact or maybe some bracelets for the elderly, which is a lie.
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:40.400]  He openly called for microchips.
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:44.400]  See, that's a pentagon off. They always say they're doing it, but the minute you resist, they go, ooh, you're crazy.
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:48.400]  It's like Waco when the tanks are smashing in and shooting the people.
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:52.400]  They were saying, this is not an assault. Come out with your hands up and they came out and they shot them.
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:57.400]  It's just like Tokyo Rose going, GIs, you're losing. You're not going to win.
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:04.400]  You know, broadcast, even as Japan was falling a month before they dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War One,
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:08.400]  the Germans and the French at each other would say, you're losing. You've lost the war.
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:12.400]  Did you hear the Kaiser gave up? Did you hear the French command gave up?
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:16.400]  And people would believe it. So again, the pentagon op is it never exists.
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:20.400]  You can have them saying they want to put chips in all Americans.
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:25.400]  When you say you don't want it, they go, well, I had psychology today on the phone with me repeatedly.
[3:16:25.400 --> 3:16:30.400]  And I will say, are they calling for a new world order? And he would just go, you feel thereafter you.
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:34.400]  And I would say, no, I mean, I've got all these articles. It's a new world order.
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:40.400]  Well, huh? And then you feel you're persecuted. And, and you know, again, I, and I just told the guy from psychology today,
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:45.400]  I said, buddy, go ahead and say I'm making it all up. It only discredits you. Okay.
[3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:50.400]  Listen to the game. You're drinking soda. Hey, hold on. He's drinking sodium fluoride too.
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:57.400]  He's got his kids getting shot up with mercury. This eugenics situation run by these Nazis in the game.
[3:16:57.400 --> 3:17:03.400]  And all of us are under attack from it. And it's time to wake up and stop these bastards. God almighty.
[3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:05.400]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:10.400]  I agree with a hundred percent, Alex. And then so, and he was asked for guns.
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:14.400]  It was American laws allow us to own guns. And I was like, okay, well,
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  But the law allows us to restrict the guns you will add.
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:23.400]  There's a second amendment that we have a right to restrict it. That's what they say. Go ahead.
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:28.400]  I sent back. I was like, well, if our laws allow us to own guns, why would they confiscate during Katrina?
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  And then he sends back people, local or state and federal laws don't allow people to go into the shelter's arm.
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:40.400]  And by shelter, he obviously means FEMA camps. So I sent them back an email that I got in a response to get.
[3:17:40.400 --> 3:17:45.400]  And I said, well, what if people don't want to go into the FEMA camps because they don't want to turn their guns?
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:48.400]  What happens then? Do they get arrested? I mean, come on.
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:55.400]  Look, they're getting ready when they implode the economy to release flu to scare everybody to go along with it or stage terror attacks.
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:59.400]  And they'll put us under their wings. Oh, we're the bankers. We love you.
[3:17:59.400 --> 3:18:05.400]  It's a sickening degenerate Psyop in the NSA and the CIA and defense intelligence.
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  You all work for foreign banks. You're running a coup on America just like you did the third world country just in slow motion.
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:17.400]  Because you want to make sure when you take us down, you win. You are destroying your own nest.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:22.400]  You're burning down your own bed, you idiots. My God, you're traitors.
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:24.400]  I appreciate your call. God bless you.
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:31.400]  You want to write an article about that and write and your and your mom and the story and all of it to writers and info wars dot com.
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:36.400]  Okay, everybody or articles and info wars dot com, either one of those.
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:40.400]  More and more, we're getting great listener content and we posted up there in the op ed section.
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:45.400]  Okay, I want to come back and get into hate crimes and then we'll continue with calls and come up about 15 minutes.
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:49.400]  We got Richard Reeves and hear about land grabbing is going on and how to fight that.
[3:18:49.400 --> 3:18:59.400]  But I wanted to get into this. Plus, I've got Obama lies here that we really need to go over with everybody.
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:06.400]  Two different lies. First off, they're saying, hey, we may go ahead and tax everybody now.
[3:19:06.400 --> 3:19:10.400]  We may go ahead and put taxes on everybody increases. Sorry.
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:14.400]  It's not just if you make 125,000 individually or 250 grand together.
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:21.400]  And oh, we're doing signing statements on the hundred and eight million dollar defense supplemental.
[3:19:21.400 --> 3:19:24.400]  And he's saying he's going to ignore what Congress said. Oh, I'm sorry.
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:30.400]  He's doing everything Cheney did. And then actual rod on TV just goes, this is what you do in politics.
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:33.400]  And I talked to Obama supporters and they go, lying's what you do.
[3:19:33.400 --> 3:19:40.400]  See, he's now their liar. Like Republicans didn't care of Bush lied about WMDs because he's our liar and we're conservative.
[3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:44.400]  And now they're like, oh, Bob was lying. That's evil. And the Democrats are that's right.
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:46.400]  And we're running things and you're just jealous.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:52.400]  Meanwhile, the idiot Republicans, the idiot Democrats are all losing their houses, losing their jobs, losing their future
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:58.400]  because they identified with the two political parties like a brand of soft drink or football team or automobile.
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:01.400]  Wake up. You're not part of the establishment. Wake up.
[3:20:01.400 --> 3:20:06.400]  We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes
[3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:10.400]  and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.

[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:10.400]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:21:10.400 --> 3:21:16.400]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:19.400]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:29.400]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:35.400]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:39.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:42.400]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[3:21:42.400 --> 3:21:45.400]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[3:21:45.400 --> 3:21:47.400]  They're not after power. Yes, they're after music.

[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:35.400]  White House opens to new tax on health benefits of all Americans.
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:41.400]  That's out of MSNBC.
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:44.400]  And they campaign against raising it on middle-class families.
[3:24:44.400 --> 3:24:46.400]  He's raising that tobacco tax.
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:47.400]  They're not getting rid of cigarettes.
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:48.400]  It's like gambling.
[3:24:48.400 --> 3:24:49.400]  The government's just grabbing it.
[3:24:49.400 --> 3:24:51.400]  It's like Nevada taxing hookers.
[3:24:51.400 --> 3:24:53.400]  It's a pimp game, folks.
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:55.400]  They're taking everything over.
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:25:00.400]  You're going to pay 110% and you're going to get your teeth knocked out and you're going to thank them for it.
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  And you're going to drink some brain num and fluoride because the pimp game is to keep your whores drugged out of their mind.
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:08.400]  And where are the government's whores?
[3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:10.400]  Well, I'm telling you, I'm not your whore.
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:13.400]  I'm getting off the pimp game reservation here.
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:16.400]  Let's go ahead and play him with signing statements first, though.
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:29.400]  This is Obama and then I have AP and several other articles where he's now doing signing statements on the $108 billion Pentagon Supplemental.
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:31.400]  So it's like a trillion plus now they get.
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:34.400]  So let's go ahead and roll that.
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:42.400]  When Congress offers you a bill, do you promise not to use presidential signage to get your way?
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:44.400]  Yes.
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:46.400]  I promise. Hold on. Back that up.
[3:25:46.400 --> 3:25:56.400]  Play it again because all the lies we have in the Obama deception and we have a viewer's guide to biography at the Obama deception.net are all on record.
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:25:57.400]  He lied about everything.
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:02.400]  Not hiring lobbyists, not expanding the wars, bring the troops home immediately, not keep any there.
[3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:04.400]  Just on and on and on.
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:09.400]  You've got to get rid of the Patriot Act, going to get rid of indefinite detention, going to prosecute Bush and Cheney.
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  All lies.
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:11.400]  People deny he said that.
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:17.400]  Here he is during the campaign saying, I promise no signing statements.
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:18.400]  Play it again.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:22.400]  Do you promise not to use presidential signage to get your way?
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:24.400]  Yes.
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:27.400]  You hear that? He's a liar. Play it again.
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:30.400]  Let's see him lie to you again and now it's like, well, they all lie.
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:32.400]  That's right. And that's why they're going to take everything you got.
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:39.400]  As soon as they figured out you'll roll over, you're broke back, you've capitulated, then they're going to run a pimp game on you.
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:43.400]  And look, and Obama is the pimp daddy president, folks.
[3:26:43.400 --> 3:26:47.400]  And he's running a pimp game, just like George Bush did, just like Bill Clinton did.
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  Now here he is running the pimp game lying to his bitches.
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:52.400]  Baby, you come with me over here in my harem.
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:53.400]  Hold on, back it up.
[3:26:53.400 --> 3:26:55.400]  You come over here with me and my little brothel.
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:26:57.400]  I'm going to take good care of you, baby.
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:27:00.400]  And now, six months later, he's beating her with a coat hanger.
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:02.400]  They're at the pimp crib.
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:04.400]  And she's saying, you promised me it was going to be nice.
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:05.400]  He said, I did.
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:07.400]  Bam, right in the face.
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:10.400]  Now here he is pimp game, the pimp game president.
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:12.400]  Here he is pimping the hose.
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:16.400]  Do you promise not to use presidential signage to get your way?
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:18.400]  Yes.
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:20.400]  Let's hit pause.
[3:27:20.400 --> 3:27:25.400]  And of course, the CIA was also not involved in Iran, even though they admit they're running the whole operation.
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:29.400]  But see, the pimp game says a lot of the dumbest people on earth.
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:31.400]  Are you the dumbest people on earth?
[3:27:31.400 --> 3:27:32.400]  Play the pimp game again.
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:34.400]  Play them again.
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:37.400]  And you'll signage to get your way.
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:39.400]  Yes.
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:44.400]  Oh, now he goes further than a lie.
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:46.400]  Let me show you how you lie to somebody.
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  Here we go.
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:48.400]  Let me just explain.
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:50.400]  See that little tick?
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:52.400]  I'm going to run a scam on the bitch.
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:54.400]  He just starts like patting on the microphone.
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:56.400]  Oh, yeah, here we go, baby.
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:27:57.400]  Watch this.
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:27:58.400]  He's easy to all those people.
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:27:59.400]  Watch me lie to him.
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  Watch me play the Pied Piper.
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:03.400]  Watch these rats following me right into the river.
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:04.400]  Watch this.
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:05.400]  Here we go.
[3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:06.400]  Here we go.
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:07.400]  Come on.
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:08.400]  Drum beat.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:09.400]  Here he is lying.
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:10.400]  Here we go.
[3:28:10.400 --> 3:28:11.400]  Play it.
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.400]  I'm familiar with this issue.
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:13.400]  Now, back it up.
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:14.400]  I want you to see him.
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:16.400]  Just, you know, because he just, before he lies, liars always have a tick.
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:17.400]  He gets lost.
[3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:18.400]  Here we go.
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:19.400]  All right.
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:20.400]  Here we go.
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:21.400]  Here goes the lie.
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:22.400]  Here goes the pimp game.
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:25.400]  Let me just explain for those who are unfamiliar with this issue.
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:33.400]  We've got a government designed by the founders so that there'd be checks and balances.
[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:36.400]  You don't want a president who's too powerful, or a congress who's too powerful, or a court
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:38.400]  who's too powerful.
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:40.400]  Everybody's got their own role.
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:43.400]  Congress's job is to pass legislation.
[3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:46.400]  The president can veto it, or he can sign it.
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:51.400]  But what George Bush has been trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:59.400]  in the presidency is he's been saying, well, I can basically change what Congress passed
[3:28:59.400 --> 3:29:03.400]  by attaching a letter saying, I don't agree with this part, or I don't agree with that
[3:29:03.400 --> 3:29:04.400]  part.
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:08.400]  I'm going to choose to interpret it this way or that way.
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:10.400]  That's not part of his power.
[3:29:10.400 --> 3:29:15.400]  But this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he's going along.
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:17.400]  I disagree with that.
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:19.400]  I taught the Constitution for 10 years.
[3:29:19.400 --> 3:29:23.400]  I believe in the Constitution, and I will obey the Constitution of the United States.
[3:29:23.400 --> 3:29:27.400]  We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing it.
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:28.400]  Yay!
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:29.400]  You my pimp!
[3:29:29.400 --> 3:29:30.400]  All right.
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:34.400]  And they got on board, and they'll get on board for the next Republican pimp, Daddy,
[3:29:34.400 --> 3:29:39.400]  because they like being suckers, and they're out of their minds on fluoride, alcohol, prozac,
[3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:40.400]  and red land.
[3:29:40.400 --> 3:29:45.400]  Well, I'm not your slave just because you got all those cowardly sheep to go along with
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:46.400]  you.
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:51.400]  Keepin' me and Conn and me, Buster.
[3:29:51.400 --> 3:29:53.400]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.400 --> 3:29:55.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:30:01.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.400 --> 3:30:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[3:30:05.400 --> 3:30:06.400]  generator this summer.
[3:30:06.400 --> 3:30:10.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:15.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:16.400]  allows you to have.
[3:30:16.400 --> 3:30:17.400]  It's true.
[3:30:17.400 --> 3:30:21.400]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:25.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:30:25.400 --> 3:30:28.400]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.

[3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:35.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:44.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:45.400]  long-time sponsor of ours.

[3:32:01.400 --> 3:32:04.400]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water

[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:11.400]  Music
[3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:16.400]  There's a man going around taking names
[3:33:16.400 --> 3:33:21.400]  and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:26.400]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:32.400]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down

[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:46.400]  at the terror in each sip.
[3:33:46.400 --> 3:33:49.400]  When my shaving cuts open up, that never happens.
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:53.400]  Will you partake of that last offered cup?
[3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:55.400]  All right, we are back live.
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:57.400]  Thank you so much for joining us.

[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:01.400]  And I want to, as promised, get to Auntie Eliminati, Nevada,
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:05.400]  Michael, Joseph, Stuart, Leah in Kentucky,
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:08.400]  and others before the show ends.
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:11.400]  And Richard, I appreciate you coming into the studio.
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:13.400]  Talking about mind control.
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:15.400]  Talk about the Pimp Game.
[3:34:15.400 --> 3:34:17.400]  I want to just show a clip.
[3:34:17.400 --> 3:34:20.400]  You can watch it on Mfoulwars.com or prismplanet.com.
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:25.400]  You can see Axelrod, one of the White House operators,
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:28.400]  one of the strategists, on there telling Stephanophilus,
[3:34:28.400 --> 3:34:31.400]  another Clinton operative, basically one of his colleagues,
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:34.400]  that, yeah, we're probably going to go ahead
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:37.400]  and look at raising taxes on people's health care
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:41.400]  and a bunch of other stuff below $125,000 a year,
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:44.400]  a piece or $250,000 as a couple.
[3:34:44.400 --> 3:34:46.400]  And they've already raised a bunch of other taxes.
[3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:54.400]  taxes. So the point is, is that Obama is lying about that. Do you guys have that clip? Trying
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:59.400]  to pull it up, we had it earlier here. I sent you at the start of the show in the IAM. Well,
[3:34:59.400 --> 3:35:03.400]  it doesn't matter. At the end of the show, we'll just show people the article so that
[3:35:03.400 --> 3:35:10.400]  they can at least be aware of that and know what is going on with that report. Here it
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:15.400]  is. Top White House advisor. Obama won't rule out middle class tax hike. I could just do
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:19.400]  this way, good old fashioned way, right here on screen for people. Folks can just zoom in
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:25.400]  on that, give you a source on that. And you can see a clip of Obama saying we're not going
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:33.400]  to raise taxes on anybody, but over $250,000 a year in any way. You have my pledge, an absolute pledge
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:37.400]  from him. And then it cuts to the White House now saying, oh, get ready, we're going to raise
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:42.400]  your taxes probably on those below it. So top White House advisor, Obama won't rule out
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:50.400]  middle class tax hike. Okay, going to Richard Reeves. Richard, speaking of lying, 10 years
[3:35:50.400 --> 3:35:54.400]  ago, they started announcing we're going to build a NAFTA superhighway all over the country,
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:01.400]  34 major interstate highways, I-35 from the Pacific Ocean side of southern Mexico, all
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:08.400]  the way up through Texas, Minnesota, up into Canada. And it's going to be an international
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:13.400]  zone. You'll pay taxes to use it. And people said they didn't want it. So they said, okay,
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:17.400]  it doesn't exist. You're crazy. Don't talk about those news articles we said. So the
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:21.400]  Pentagon sighed, oh, you don't like it? Oh, well, I didn't just announce on the news we're
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:26.400]  doing that. It's crazy. You're schizophrenic. But then they came back and said, okay, it's
[3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:30.400]  NAFTA superhighways, transit discord or it's going to be great and it's going to be wonderful
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:34.400]  and we learned it was going to be $165 to drive the Dallas and back to Austin, according
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:37.400]  to their own documents and all their maps. Then we said we don't want it and they said
[3:36:37.400 --> 3:36:40.400]  it doesn't exist again. Then they started building the roads, putting the toll roads
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:45.400]  in saying it didn't exist as you were paying the tolls. CNN was saying Ron Paul is insane.
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:49.400]  There's no Texas corridor. No, no, no, no, I mean, I had those clips. It doesn't exist
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:54.400]  as I'm sticking money in it with giant billboards saying trans Texas corridor. So now they
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:36:59.400]  said, okay, we're canceling it and pull up the AP trans Texas corridor canceled AP. But
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:04.400]  then paragraph three said, oh, we're keeping it all. We're just not going to call it that
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:10.400]  anymore. So it's all semantical psi ops CIA black ops. Just, just we're not assaulting
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:15.400]  Waco. You know, there's WMD's in Iraq, but the good news is we've got them cornered
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:19.400]  now into lying. They've canceled it as it continues. Now they're really discredited.
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:23.400]  Richard Reeves, there's a big fight coming up tomorrow in Tejas, the first big leg of
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:27.400]  the takeover of the US by the UN through these corporate systems.
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:31.400]  That's right, Alex. And I tell you, I want to thank you for having me on because this
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.400]  is a clutch show, an absolutely clutch show. You covered it real well that we have put
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:43.400]  them into Psi op mode. We put them into Psi op mode since somewhere around 2004, 2005
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:47.400]  when it comes to this trans Texas corridor issue and toll road issue. And I want to kind
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:50.400]  of broaden it a little bit. It's not just trans Texas corridor, but it's also about taking
[3:37:50.400 --> 3:37:55.400]  over existing roads and putting tolls on 8,000 miles of roads, 10 miles on each side of
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:37:59.400]  the road for private corporate interest. That's why they have the new London kilo decision
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:03.400]  saying private interest can take your profit. I mean, I mean, I take your property for
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:08.400]  profit, not even for imminent domain. And my dad got letters and so did I as a landowner
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:13.400]  saying, oh, here's the Texas landowners bill of rights. And it said, you have no rights.
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:17.400]  You got six weeks when we make an offer to take it or we take it and you don't get anything.
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:22.400]  So you have a right to begin the pimp game to be a slave. You have a right to be burned
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:24.400]  with cigarettes and beaten with a tire.
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:28.400]  Well, that's right. Well, absolutely. And you just broaden the subject even further that
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:34.400]  not even mention it is big a big deal about property rights. Huge issue of property rights
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:38.400]  involving these toll roads involving taking existing roads and putting tolls on them and
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:42.900]  involving the trans Texas corridor and after highway, whatever semantical words you want
[3:38:42.900 --> 3:38:44.400]  to use to call them.
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:49.400]  But we've got a chance tomorrow. We are calling for a huge rally here at the state capital
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:54.400]  and we're going to have Robert Morrow and Texas turf dot org, Terry Hall's organization,
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:59.400]  Texas turf dot org and a bunch of people are going to be here in the state capital tomorrow
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:05.400]  at 10 a.m. We're going to meet at the cafeteria. That's in on floor e one of the state capital
[3:39:05.400 --> 3:39:09.400]  and we're going to lobby all these state reps. We're going to lobby all these state reps
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:14.400]  and we need everybody around Texas to call their state reps because one of the things,
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:20.900]  you know, as well as imminent domain issues and as well as all these projects to crush
[3:39:20.900 --> 3:39:26.400]  the sovereignty of the United States. They're also talking about now that to use the pension
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:28.900]  funds of teachers and other government entities.
[3:39:28.900 --> 3:39:33.400]  Yeah, the cops out there swapping minutes for for booty are not going to lose their pension
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:34.400]  fund.
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:35.400]  Exactly.
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:36.400]  Just what they want.
[3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:37.400]  And a great example of us.
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:39.900]  See, that's the pimp game. The big pimps are going to hurt the little pimps.
[3:39:39.900 --> 3:39:45.160]  Right. And you know, as George Soros said, let no crisis go unused. Well, we can kind
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:48.520]  of say the same thing because it seems like every time we get to a little clutch pinch
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:53.160]  point like this, we just happen to have a news story break in our favor. And one of
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:58.480]  them is is about S H 121. And I know you're familiar with S H 121 because you're from
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:03.860]  the Fort Worth Dallas Metroplex area. I spent three decades up in that area myself many
[3:40:03.860 --> 3:40:10.920]  years ago and S H 121 is a very key piece of road. It's a bypass for traffic traveling
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:13.000]  east or west on I 30 and I 20.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:18.840]  You can go S H 121 up to McKinney, Texas and then go on up into Chicago towards the Midwest,
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:24.240]  Oklahoma, Kansas City, Missouri, et cetera. And you can take that route and avoid one
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:30.240]  of the worst most heinous bottlenecks of all time. And that's LBJ freeway I 635 up there
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:33.480]  in Dallas, Fort Worth, which is gridlocked from three third in the afternoon till eight
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  at night.
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:37.040]  It's absolutely gridlocked. And I want to appeal to the folks in Dallas, Fort Worth
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:42.720]  area right now, call your state reps because this is the beta test where it's like an
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:47.960]  amoeba. We expose it to heat so it splits up into a bunch of other little pieces are
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:50.800]  kind of like in the movie, the thing where it, you know, look like even the blood runs
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.320]  into the corners, you know, has a mind of its own. When you cut the head off, it just,
[3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:59.640]  you know, they are now just doing it each one piecemeal, you know, and you just bring
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:03.600]  that up about the amoebas and how they work. And I've been to many of these house committee
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:07.360]  hearings here at the state level at state capital. I've been to Senate committee hearings
[3:41:07.360 --> 3:41:10.800]  and the majority of people to show up, I want to let the audience know the majority of people
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:14.360]  that are showing up to these hearings are wearing suits. They're lobbyists. They're
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:18.040]  not regular people like Richard Reeves and other people, and they're lobbyists from
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:21.680]  foreign governments. Exactly. America is the big whorehouse where they can buy anything
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:26.760]  they want and they buy it from these little creatures, you know, uh, that they call representatives.
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:30.880]  That's right. That's right. And going back to this, I say 121, I got to tell you a little
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:35.200]  story. I'll try to cut it as short as possible because you're indirectly very involved in
[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:40.520]  what happened in S H 121 up in Dallas, Fort Worth area. Here's what happened in January,
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:46.680]  February of 2007, Cintra got the contract for S H 121, which is Spanish on and the Chronicle
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:50.640]  said it was not Spanish owned, but here's what about deception. Here's what happened.
[3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:54.680]  Here's what happened. The N TTA, the North Texas Turnpike Authority, the outfit that
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:59.520]  runs, it's a government outfit, public outfit that runs the North Dallas tollway and they've
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:04.360]  got other toll roads that they're generating all kinds of revenue with. They wanted a crack
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:10.120]  at S H 121 and they were wanting to pony up. And in fact, as far as I know, did pony up
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:16.000]  the $2 billion to take over S H 121. And the way that happened was that yours truly Bob
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:20.720]  Dacey and many other great local activists that you ignited, you're responsible for this
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:26.080]  indirectly because it was our group of local Austin activists and San Antonio activists
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:31.720]  that went to the Texas Transportation Commission in 2007, the summer of 2007. And when they
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:36.640]  were fighting over the N TTA, getting the contract for S H 121 or Cintra getting the
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:43.520]  contract for N Sage S H 121, we were the ones, we were arguing for a freeway, but knowing
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:48.280]  that freeway wasn't necessarily a viable option. We were also saying, look, we don't want it
[3:42:48.280 --> 3:42:53.400]  to be a toll road, but give it to the N TTA. It's a public corporation that way. When Texans
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:57.480]  get mad enough to get their road back, they can get it back. Don't give it to Cintra.
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:02.480]  That's a 52 year agreement that the N TTA. So you're using factions divide and conquer
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:07.760]  against them. Now, now, now expanding if somebody's in Indiana or Florida or New Jersey or California,
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:12.160]  this is happening everywhere. And now Obama wants to put satellite tracker boxes in all
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:17.000]  the cars to tax you by the mile. I saw the federal documents on that 12 years ago. Now
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:19.960]  it's openly happening. So tell folks about this meeting tomorrow. We're going to take
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:24.600]  some calls. Well, the meeting tomorrow is at 10 a.m. at the cafeteria in the state capital.
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:28.800]  That's on floor E one. Basically, you can ask anybody at the capital when you once you
[3:43:28.800 --> 3:43:33.120]  walk in and ask them where the cafeteria is on floor E one, go there at 10 a.m. Robert
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:45.760]  Morrow has given me permission to put a cell phone out on the air. 512-496-1293. 512-496-1293.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:51.520]  If you have any questions, call him. But for sure, go to TexasTurf.org and there's a function
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:55.760]  on there where you can find your rep on that website. TexasTurf. And again, this is happening
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:43:59.200]  and going on everywhere. People bottom line get involved in the fight. Let's take some
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:02.960]  calls, Richard. Anti-aluminati in Nevada. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:05.960]  Good afternoon, Alex. How are you doing? Good. Go ahead.
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:11.800]  We're going to stab the New World Order in the heart today. In referencing what you were
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:18.080]  talking about earlier with the Xbox controllers and the UAVs and so forth, what that is is
[3:44:18.080 --> 3:44:25.280]  the culmination of what P-TECH was used for to engineer the Global Command and Control
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:33.000]  System. And that's headed up by General James E. Cartwright. And all that stuff is tied
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:39.440]  into the global information grid infrastructure. And this is what they've been working on this
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:43.400]  stuff for at least since 1995. And by the way, I promise to show this. This
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:49.480]  is at Wired.com. Spiceships guiding CIA drone skies, locals say. It sounds like a tinfoil
[3:44:49.480 --> 3:44:53.920]  hat nightmare come to life. Tiny electronic homing beacons guide CIA killer drones to
[3:44:53.920 --> 3:44:58.800]  their targets. But local residents in Taliban militants in Pakistan's tribal wetlands,
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:03.040]  wildlands say that that's exactly what's happening. And then I actually had another
[3:45:03.040 --> 3:45:07.680]  article, like with London telegraphs, the one I want. This is just one about that.
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:12.080]  The London telegraph headline on this talks about how they throw the transmitters in innocent
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:15.680]  people's houses. That's the one I want, folks, not this one. And it goes on to say, ever
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:19.440]  since 9-1-1 locals in Central Asia and the Middle East have spread tales about American
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:23.240]  super technology. Soldiers with X-ray glasses, satellites they can see into homes, tanks
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:27.560]  with magnetic grenade repelling armor. But small radio frequency and GPS emitters have
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:32.120]  been commercially available for years. And it goes, a veteran spy tells Danger Room that
[3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:36.520]  the use of Taliban tracking devices is entirely plausible. Yeah, no, it's a London telegraph
[3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:43.080]  on drones, RFID chips target wrong houses. I want that. I want to show people how they
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:46.120]  throw them in innocent people's houses. I've done a show on it, but I don't want to just
[3:45:46.120 --> 3:45:49.800]  make the claim. But real fast, Annie Illuminati, you post a lot of great stuff on the Prison
[3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:58.160]  Planet forum about this whole control grid and how Microsoft, IBM, these are all just
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:03.880]  military industrial complex fronts. Google obviously is. That's even come out out of
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:09.680]  the MIT CIA works with technological DARPA skunks works. And so you have this grid. But
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:15.600]  yes, they now admit that they are using the video games as interfaces to program and get
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:19.960]  a generation who want to actually pilot real ones remotely to go out and slaughter people.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:23.520]  Go ahead. Right. What I want to add is there's some really
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:27.800]  like hidden companies behind all this stuff too. I want to I want to mention something
[3:46:27.800 --> 3:46:32.920]  about Northern Command. The official appearance of Northern Command is actually referenced
[3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:36.840]  in a Council on Foreign Relations document titled Building a North American Community
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:43.440]  where they call for, you know, the creation of it. But the underpinnings of Northern Command's
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:50.440]  global grid to control everything. What that's about is about it's all the different militaries
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:54.240]  in the world. They all have different systems. They all have different computer systems.
[3:46:54.240 --> 3:46:58.840]  So that that was the key with P tech, which stands for process technology, which incidentally,
[3:46:58.840 --> 3:47:02.160]  by the way, was used to engineer to carry out the
[3:47:02.160 --> 3:47:05.120]  Yeah, listen, what I need you to do because we're running out of time. Why don't you ride
[3:47:05.120 --> 3:47:08.520]  a blurb or an article or take some of the stuff you read in the Prison Planet forum
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:13.040]  and send it to writers and info wars and we'll look over it and try to get it up. But what
[3:47:13.040 --> 3:47:18.320]  is your point specifically about using the Xbox and other interfaces as Pentagon controller
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:24.120]  boxes? Well, that was that's how they the idea behind
[3:47:24.120 --> 3:47:28.600]  that is they know that people aren't going to, you know, particularly Americans, they're
[3:47:28.600 --> 3:47:33.320]  not going to willingly kill their own people. So they have to what they've done. For example,
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:36.680]  they can take Google Earth imagery. They've done this and then they overlay that into
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:41.320]  something like second life, for example, to have like a virtual world on on wargaming
[3:47:41.320 --> 3:47:46.560]  in the US. And then they can just make people make the people using this cult C for ISR.
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:50.760]  Yeah, no, I understand. And then in a Pavlovian fashion, they practice murdering American
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:54.040]  citizens and become acclimated. Yeah, write an article, send it to us. Now, I'm aware
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:47:58.040]  of that, that doom was originally developed for the Pentagon. It wasn't called doom where
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:03.040]  you just kill people all day. It creates instinctive killing. So you don't not want to kill somebody
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:07.640]  up close. And so they've gone from over half the troops not killing people up close to
[3:48:07.640 --> 3:48:13.160]  99% killing, honing killer instincts. And then in most of the video games now you practice
[3:48:13.160 --> 3:48:18.640]  murdering the militias, taking their guns. And that's a lot of the games. Your comments
[3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:23.120]  on that Richard Riff's was definitely another mind control project to program these young
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:27.000]  folks to do whatever they're ordered to do. By the way, I know a high level individual
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:30.920]  who worked at Microsoft. He also produces Hollywood films. And he worked for a couple
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:35.720]  years for Microsoft. And he said that it's definitely mind control. Xbox is supposed
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:40.160]  to become like your Facebook, the center of your life. But this before Facebook was even
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:43.320]  this like five years ago, told me about it actually, that it would all be your photos,
[3:48:43.320 --> 3:48:46.680]  your face, your identity, that they would add shockers and would shock you and cause
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:49.800]  pain when you're playing. It's like in that James Bond movie when they're playing global
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:55.960]  domination, danger, danger, danger. And so the kids now are paying money to buy Ferraris
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:00.440]  and you know, houses in the game. They don't care about reality. This is the insertion
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:04.320]  into the matrix. Right. I've heard you talk about that before where people have a virtual
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:08.800]  life and they're trading their lives for cash, et cetera. And it's just the mind control
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:13.480]  is just so out there. Anybody that can deny that just is probably mind control victim.
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:17.400]  That's the only this is mass mind control. Right. There's this is really happening. Let's
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:20.800]  go to Joseph in Texas. Joseph, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:49:20.800 --> 3:49:29.080]  I want to listen to our first time caller. And I actually was calling back about the
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:35.760]  Obama stuff he talked about. I've listened to you for years and I recently read the book
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:47.480]  Audacity of Hope by Obama. Yeah, you are 100% right. And if one discrepancy, it's very interesting
[3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:52.440]  is if you listen to the audio book version, then you've got Chuck. And in the book, if
[3:49:52.440 --> 3:49:56.880]  you read chapter eight, it's called the world beyond our borders. And in there, he defined
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:02.680]  each and every one of us as a terrorist. He actually says that a terror network is any
[3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:09.080]  group that is against globalization. And in that chapter, he actually think the globalization
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:13.320]  is the new world order. So I don't know if you read that.
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:16.480]  Now, why don't you scan that page? And I have to admit, I almost bought it as a book on
[3:50:16.480 --> 3:50:20.080]  tape because when I jog, I'll listen to books on tape. But I just can't hear. I can't stand
[3:50:20.080 --> 3:50:25.120]  his voice. And I can't stand, but I can't stand these lying con artists that it's just
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:29.200]  so sick. But no, it's a global tyranny. I appreciate your call. You know, the good news
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:32.880]  is, Richard, we really are reaching people. Absolutely. There's no doubt about it. I mean,
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:38.440]  looking 2007, 2008, the Ron Paul campaign, how we grew and grew. And you asked me that
[3:50:38.440 --> 3:50:42.080]  question, how does this affect somebody in Indiana about the toll roads, etc. The victories
[3:50:42.080 --> 3:50:47.240]  we have here in stopping these toll roads and these tracker boxes, etc. are victories
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:51.080]  that'll make it that much easier to stop in other states. They plan to use the parasite
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:55.920]  op here to fund the rest of their it's like a cancer gets a blood supply and the test
[3:50:55.920 --> 3:51:00.280]  is nice. We're a major metastasization center here. Final second with Richard Reeves straight
[3:51:00.280 --> 3:51:05.280]  ahead. There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate
[3:51:05.280 --> 3:51:09.840]  radio stations. He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated,
[3:51:09.840 --> 3:51:14.200]  but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:18.640]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security. You
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:23.720]  are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own
[3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:28.960]  your own business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own
[3:51:28.960 --> 3:51:34.200]  boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys
[3:51:34.200 --> 3:51:39.040]  and benefits of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to tell you about
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:43.600]  a low cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that
[3:51:43.600 --> 3:51:48.400]  can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:55.720]  chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very
[3:51:55.720 --> 3:52:02.680]  little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:08.800]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[3:52:08.800 --> 3:52:13.480]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.480 --> 3:52:18.960]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:52:18.960 --> 3:52:23.520]  the best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[3:52:23.520 --> 3:52:28.240]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:34.200]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[3:52:34.200 --> 3:52:40.920]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one
[3:52:40.920 --> 3:52:47.280]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:54.240]  his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download
[3:52:54.240 --> 3:53:02.120]  it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:06.040]  This is Alex Jones with important news. I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:10.280]  fast approaching a storm that will affect you and everybody you know. Here's the story.
[3:53:10.280 --> 3:53:13.840]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:18.000]  new people free care. Now here's the bad news. The current system will almost be immediately
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:22.320]  overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures. Medicare and Medicaid
[3:53:22.320 --> 3:53:26.160]  are already bankrupt. Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the
[3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:30.760]  prospect of forced procedures. All this is creating a perfect storm which could create
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:35.840]  unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services. Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[3:53:35.840 --> 3:53:39.640]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness
[3:53:39.640 --> 3:53:44.520]  course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:48.920]  home. It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best
[3:53:48.920 --> 3:53:54.240]  course of its kind. I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[3:53:54.240 --> 3:54:10.720]  Or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[3:54:24.240 --> 3:54:29.920]  We're out of time. I wanted to jam in a few final calls here. I also have some sponsors
[3:54:29.920 --> 3:54:37.720]  that have made the show possible today. One of them is something we need to protect ourselves
[3:54:37.720 --> 3:54:40.720]  from the establishment. You know, the police don't want you to videotape them. They always
[3:54:40.720 --> 3:54:44.320]  announce that, oh there were no footage of the guy getting shot in the back at the dart
[3:54:44.320 --> 3:54:48.320]  train in Oakland. Then it turns out there were cameras and it shows the cops grabbing
[3:54:48.320 --> 3:54:53.120]  other people's cameras after they murdered the guy. So I suggest everybody go to the
[3:54:53.120 --> 3:55:00.880]  great website digitnet.net. That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net. The lowest prices on surveillance
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:07.560]  cameras, inexpensive systems that are hidden in your car, videotape and audio tape, everything
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:13.720]  happening with a concealed data recorder with a little memory stick that records hours.
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:19.360]  They've got the little cameras and audio hidden in pins. We've all got to use Big Brother
[3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:24.520]  against Big Brother. I have one with me almost all the time. I actually forgot to bring one
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:30.440]  this morning. I just turn it on because this is how we're going to burn these people and
[3:55:30.440 --> 3:55:34.640]  catch them in their crimes. We've got to hit them, hit them hard with the truth and just
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:43.680]  continue to expose, expose as they try to shut down and restrict the web. So digitnet, D-I-G-A,
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:50.360]  it's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net. A whole bunch of great products and they have a whole bunch
[3:55:50.360 --> 3:55:54.880]  of different models, but I think the NCAR system, very easy to install, very, very affordable.
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:58.800]  And then they have pins for 45 bucks, you know, record audio and video that we use covering
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:06.200]  Bilderberg group. So that's also in the Obama deception. So be sure and check out digitnet.net.
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:10.960]  Also I said I'd get to this and I just ran out of time. This is such a huge deal. But
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:15.480]  I got Richard Reeves in here and all these calls. The thought crime bill threatens talk
[3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:21.200]  radio. This is in S-909 that's passed the House, now going to the Senate. Whoever transmits
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:25.400]  an interstate or foreign commerce, radio, TV, internet, any communication with the intent
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:31.160]  to coerce, intimidate, harass, say anything's that, and they have definitions of it. It's
[3:56:31.160 --> 3:56:36.880]  any and everything, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person using electronic means
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:44.840]  to support, severe, repeated and hostile behavior, see severe, shall be fined under the title
[3:56:44.840 --> 3:56:51.480]  or imprisoned not more than two years or both, HR 1966, Section 3, Section 881A. Now the
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:57.480]  same thing, but even worse, same language is in the cyber bullying thing being pushed
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:02.640]  by Hannah Montana. Whoever transmits an interstate or foreign commerce, any communication with
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:06.800]  intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person
[3:57:06.800 --> 3:57:11.240]  using electronic means to support, severe, repeated or hostile behavior, shall be fined
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:16.960]  under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both. And it goes on to say,
[3:57:16.960 --> 3:57:23.360]  so if you say, if something hurts your feelings, they come and arrest you federally. Folks,
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:28.960]  this is America. These things are passing the House. It's in the Senate. This is happening.
[3:57:28.960 --> 3:57:33.240]  They're moving on every front against us. That's why I beg listeners to get the red alert.
[3:57:33.240 --> 3:57:36.760]  The total takeover of America enters its final phase. The good news is when we fight these
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:41.000]  people, we win, but they always come back, but they get weaker each time. It's like
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:45.160]  their NAFTA highways are in big trouble. But, but now they've declared we won. No, that's
[3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:49.440]  another shill. You got to give them no quarter politically because they'll not give you any
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:53.480]  quarter. Richard Reeves finally again, this. So what's happening tomorrow? Okay. You just
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:58.280]  said a real key point. One minute left. Tell folks the event tomorrow. Keep we going. Okay.
[3:57:58.280 --> 3:58:03.520]  The event tomorrow is at 10 a.m. at the state Capitol. Everybody in Texas and beyond needs
[3:58:03.520 --> 3:58:08.840]  to call the Texas state reps. Tell them no to comprehensive development agreements. Tell
[3:58:08.840 --> 3:58:13.040]  them no to public private partnerships. These are the toll road agreements. Transsexist
[3:58:13.040 --> 3:58:17.280]  quartergremes. Tell them no to all these things. Call them show up the Capitol 10 a.m. tomorrow
[3:58:17.280 --> 3:58:23.280]  room E one, the cafeteria. That's right. They've changed the name. More deception. Total scum.
[3:58:23.280 --> 3:58:27.320]  You can read the AP article about transsexist corridors dead. Third paragraph down. They
[3:58:27.320 --> 3:58:32.240]  say, Oh, we're just renaming it. Keep fighting them. Keep defeating them. God bless you all.

[3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:57.440]  you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient. And today that's more important
[3:58:57.440 --> 3:59:01.480]  than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to
[3:59:01.480 --> 3:59:05.720]  stand in a bread line. You have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and
[3:59:05.720 --> 3:59:10.280]  beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency. If you simply prepare, no one
[3:59:10.280 --> 3:59:14.720]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you know. E foods direct.com
