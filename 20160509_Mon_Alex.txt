[00:00.000 --> 00:15.360]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of
[00:15.360 --> 00:23.480]  the information war it's Alex Jones Monday the 9th of May 2016 I'm your host Alex Jones
[00:23.480 --> 00:28.920]  big broadcast obviously lined up today Roger Stone called me a breathless last night he
[00:28.920 --> 00:35.160]  has talked to two different high-level sources and confirmed that Paul Ryan and Prince Priebus
[00:35.160 --> 00:40.480]  and the establishment are still planning to not just try to steal the nomination or scuttle it
[00:40.480 --> 00:50.040]  at the RNC event coming up in Cleveland but they're also planning to take all the money this is
[00:50.040 --> 00:55.760]  amazing and to not win but to scuttle it for Hillary which they openly are bragging about this
[00:55.760 --> 01:01.720]  is all coming up today John Kerry calling for borderless world saying it's coming the EU saying
[01:01.720 --> 01:05.880]  stay in or you'll have World War 3 but right now let's go to this important report from John
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.720]  Bound. Heiko Maas the German Federal Minister of Justice got an earful of the voice of the German
[01:11.720 --> 01:18.640]  people while speaking at a May Day celebration the German people chant you leftist rat and traitor
[01:18.640 --> 01:30.320]  Maas says no we're here to stay we aren't going anywhere the chance of traitor and get out become
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.800]  stronger and louder but Maas fires back threatening we will also take care of the interest of those
[01:36.800 --> 01:41.840]  people shouting traitor right now without even knowing what's happening to them the chance
[01:41.840 --> 01:47.800]  continue as Maas says shout all you want the longer you shout the longer I shall stand here
[01:47.800 --> 01:59.880]  finally he leaves the podium as they chant traitor get out leaving the Germans to chant we are the
[01:59.880 --> 02:08.920]  people Heiko Maas yet another arrogant globalist tool from the Merkel regime the same man that
[02:08.920 --> 02:15.800]  introduced a 2015 law known as data stolen goods a law described by Berlin District Court Judge
[02:15.800 --> 02:22.360]  Ulf BÃ¶hrmeyer as an anti whistleblower law intended to deal a mighty blow to democracy and
[02:22.360 --> 02:29.000]  freedom of speech where in Germany xenophobia and racism is now a punishable crime furthermore
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.080]  Maas is now calling for a legal band on sexist advertisements Germany well known for its liberal
[02:35.080 --> 02:40.280]  attitude towards adult entertainment is now being forced to scale back its culture in order to
[02:40.280 --> 02:46.200]  appease the wishes of the growing Muslim refugee population exploding within Germany meanwhile
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.880]  the German people are being held captive by the ungrateful foreign invaders and their own treasonous
[02:51.880 --> 03:21.400]  government William F. Jasper of the new American rights the migration tsunami that swamped Europe
[03:21.400 --> 03:29.240]  with 1.5 million refugees in 2015 is roaring back with a tidal wave that may be double the size of
[03:29.240 --> 03:35.720]  last year's deluge in fact most citizens of the European Union countries appear to be unaware
[03:35.720 --> 03:41.240]  that they're unelected and unaccountable rulers at the European Commission and their own European
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.880]  economic forecast report issued last fall announced precisely that that is they projected with apparent
[03:47.880 --> 03:54.840]  acceptance and approval that 3 million refugee migrants would arrive in Europe in 2016 time is
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.040]  running out the globalists have all but achieved their soft invasion of Europe and that planned
[04:00.040 --> 04:05.720]  gridlock of civilization is heading in your general direction as I speak thousands of
[04:05.720 --> 04:12.120]  unvetted refugees are filing into small towns across the United States via what will be known
[04:12.120 --> 04:18.440]  later as a broken vetting process a process that should have taken two years has now been reduced
[04:18.440 --> 04:25.160]  to a few pointless months it's Obama's turn and he aims to match Merkel's numbers how do you think
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.720]  the president would explain to me about his inability to have that happen here in the United
[04:31.720 --> 04:38.600]  States when Germany is taking him close to a million people well again I I think the president
[04:38.600 --> 04:42.760]  when he travels to Germany will be prepared to tell her that he's prepared to meet the goal
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.560]  it seems like it might be a little embarrassing to not be able to get 10,000 people into your
[04:49.560 --> 04:53.480]  country but Ron I'm not willing to say that we're not going to hit the goal John bound for

[08:17.480 --> 08:25.240]  there are times in history critical junctures
[08:28.760 --> 08:34.200]  when populations either awaken to the challenge and adapt and overcome
[08:36.040 --> 08:43.720]  or go quietly into societal decline warfare and then explosive collapse
[08:43.720 --> 08:53.960]  coming to you from the former state of texas under the provisional reorganization government
[08:54.680 --> 09:04.360]  in fema region six i am broadcasting worldwide the united states has been captured by foreign
[09:04.360 --> 09:10.680]  banking cartels openly the united states was then used as a command base with our energy and our
[09:10.680 --> 09:20.760]  troops and our inventive population to launch the world government project now we enter the final
[09:20.760 --> 09:25.960]  phases of the open birth of world government the rollout of world government that's already in place
[09:25.960 --> 09:32.840]  the skeletal system is there the muscles the organs the vascular system is being added the skin is
[09:32.840 --> 09:42.840]  being prepared the panopticon computer surveillance grids are being fired up tested psychological
[09:42.840 --> 09:52.040]  warfare grids are heating up we are living in a fantastical time and what's amazing is so many
[09:52.040 --> 09:59.720]  prominent people call me off the record heads of newspapers heads of major news websites
[09:59.720 --> 10:06.360]  and they say you know i worked in the government before and i worked in intelligence or i worked
[10:06.360 --> 10:09.800]  in and everything you're saying is true it's it's just unbelievable what do we do
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.280]  well you pull back and look at how we were put into this trance
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.400]  and therein you find the answer of how to reverse this but yesterday
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.400]  i took a screenshot of it and tweeted it out at real alex jones it's a screenshot of the
[10:33.400 --> 10:40.680]  drudge report yesterday kerry declares borderless world and then below that there was another
[10:40.680 --> 10:47.320]  article where cameron basically says a new world war could start or or a war could start if the u k
[10:47.320 --> 10:56.520]  tries to leave the euro and i tweeted when kerry declares borderless world close quote he is talking
[10:56.520 --> 11:03.640]  about a corporate world government that can run over the nation state that's obviously an oversimplification
[11:03.640 --> 11:13.560]  because it's twitter so i had a limited number of letters to use but that's what it is and the
[11:13.560 --> 11:19.240]  same arrogance of a cameron saying you better do this or we'll be destabilized into war you better
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.880]  let these unelected foreign boards make all our laws and run everything in secret or we're not
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.800]  going to be safe that's terrorism and when you've got open world government being announced
[11:31.640 --> 11:39.000]  and college students being told by obama this weekend and by kerry that's the new talking
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.520]  point that you're going to live in a borderless world it's going to be very challenging very
[11:42.520 --> 11:47.080]  confusing yeah because you'll have nation states that are communist nation states that are fascist
[11:47.080 --> 11:52.680]  administered and run by multinational combines who are above the law that's what obama a month and a
[11:52.680 --> 11:58.200]  half ago went to argentina or a month ago and told him he said no we're merging the two
[12:01.400 --> 12:04.760]  internationally you need free trade but then the nation state can be communist
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.200]  where they call it communism and you're a slave to the globalist
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.840]  here's a headline of bloomberg catastrophe is the new normal for venezuelans
[12:18.840 --> 12:25.240]  and guess who's completely in debt to the imf world bank by design and to the imf world bank
[12:25.240 --> 12:36.360]  would rather work with is communist communist have been the clients of the globalist bank system
[12:36.360 --> 12:42.680]  since the bolsheviks were financed by the house of rothschild and by jp morgan chase and others
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.920]  in 1970 and you've got all these ignorant pseudo-intellectuals running around with their
[12:48.920 --> 12:54.440]  bernie sanders shirts on i went picked up some tacos for the family uh sunday morning
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.600]  at a taco deli and they have a place pretty good tacos and there were like five people
[13:02.600 --> 13:06.360]  wearing bernie shirts the place was completely standing room only i was getting food to go
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.240]  set there 15 minutes waiting and i had no less than three of the people wearing bernie shirts
[13:11.240 --> 13:14.840]  that were running the orders out to people's like a hundred people in there more just standing
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.480]  up waiting at their food it's so popular on sunday morning okay i really appreciate your work
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.600]  alex thank you for the work and they were wearing bernie shirts and i get he's the populist socialist
[13:26.600 --> 13:32.440]  and he's cute and he's anti banker and you know why should the walmart family have 300 billion
[13:32.440 --> 13:41.240]  dollars and all the rest of it but they play that class envy and it's so dumb down and simplistic
[13:42.200 --> 13:47.320]  that they sit here in a country where you can have thousands of choices and and and millions
[13:47.320 --> 13:52.680]  different opportunities when it comes to where you want to work or where you want to live or
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.240]  what you want to buy or what lifestyle i mean you've got so many choices and these spoiled brats
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.000]  sit here in this tv generation liking the idea that bernie sanders is going to give them something
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.320]  free let me explain something to everyone i know our audience knows this but we have new viewers
[14:07.320 --> 14:14.600]  every millisecond new listeners every millisecond the ultra rich are funding collectivism because
[14:14.600 --> 14:22.600]  they're exempt from it and offshore they create centralized top-down regulated command and control
[14:22.600 --> 14:32.200]  crony capitalist economies and because production is so high we can still have the bobbles and the
[14:32.200 --> 14:39.880]  symbols of success that the media tells us we need but culturally and when it comes to savings and
[14:39.880 --> 14:45.800]  so many other ways we are completely impoverished when it comes to knowing how to plant a garden
[14:45.800 --> 14:55.400]  or knowing how to climb a tree and pick fruit or how to fix an engine or how to mend a broken leg
[14:55.400 --> 15:02.120]  we don't have any of our frontier smarts that made the united states so special we are completely
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.800]  domesticated i mean i see these articles every day london telegraph parents smart phones harming
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.640]  children ability to hold conversations say teachers well i mean we know it causes brain
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.120]  damage we know it causes rewiring of the brain we know it limits vocabulary we know it's hurting us
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.960]  but we just can't help it because the kids are already addicted we're addicted on our smart phone
[15:21.960 --> 15:26.120]  we throw them a smart phone and then none of us even talk when we're at dinner at night isn't that
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.720]  where this is going and we're one step away from zuckerberg walking openly bipedally with everyone
[15:31.720 --> 15:38.920]  else squatting like gorillas uh wearing their virtual reality goggles that he programs the
[15:38.920 --> 15:47.080]  reality for it's beyond the wizard's curtain you put a curtain over your head and then live in this
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.680]  tiny false reality which they admit is their plan and here's where i'm going with all this
[15:54.520 --> 16:01.240]  i don't take any pleasure quite frankly when i get calls from some of the biggest media people
[16:01.240 --> 16:06.600]  in the united states and they're all nervous and they want to talk off air and that they want this
[16:06.600 --> 16:12.440]  to be off record and they sit there and think they're having some big solidarity with me
[16:13.960 --> 16:17.080]  when they're going i guess you're right about the government working with radical islam and i
[16:17.080 --> 16:20.600]  guess you're right about them shipping drugs in and i i guess you're right about the media control
[16:20.600 --> 16:26.040]  and about infiltrators and about all this and how bad's it going to get and i talk to people all
[16:26.040 --> 16:31.480]  the time and i and i'm sitting there going look you should have been awake a decade ago 20 years
[16:31.480 --> 16:37.000]  ago everybody warned the public about this this stuff is all in international trade agreements
[16:37.880 --> 16:39.320]  we're going into world government
[16:42.520 --> 16:48.360]  and the fact that i'm so cutting edge talking about this shows the trance people are in
[16:49.400 --> 16:54.600]  because i'm just discussing what is admitted open fact the pope is called for world government
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.600]  we know the nature of the world government is a private corporate banking cartel with sdr strategic
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.960]  drawing rights new digital currency that all other currencies will be based on in qe unlimited
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.000]  basically which then gives these central banks total absolute control you think the old fractional
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.600]  reserve banking where they'd have ten dollars in the bank and loan out a hundred gave the central
[17:16.600 --> 17:23.400]  bank's power you think it gave them power to take one mortgage and sell it 20 30 40 50
[17:23.400 --> 17:31.000]  sometimes a hundred plus times and leverage a hundred thousand dollars into a billion they've
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.560]  just got giant piles of monopoly digital garbage that they created they got governments to sign on
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.840]  to by holding a sausage in 2008 and now they're announcing world government with all these carbon
[17:42.840 --> 17:48.680]  taxes and wellhead taxes and other energy taxes and digital money transfer taxes that's why they
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.240]  want to get rid of cash now they're moving us into their plan their plans public a world
[17:53.240 --> 17:59.720]  cashless society where you'll be social engineered according to your choices controlling what you
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.920]  buy sell and do and where the greatest crime anywhere will be underground economy
[18:08.600 --> 18:12.280]  remember the headline a few years ago 15 million dollar fine for garage sale
[18:12.280 --> 18:18.920]  fox news it actually said on the second offense your thoughts selling something at a garage sale
[18:18.920 --> 18:25.960]  sale without it going through some federal inventory you will be given a 15 million
[18:25.960 --> 18:32.440]  dollar fine you're like well that'll never happen oh yes it will this is total control
[18:34.200 --> 18:42.520]  and it shows the arrogance of all these different global partnerships chaired by the very same
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.800]  handful of men and women owned by the very same corporations merging us into world government
[18:47.800 --> 18:51.400]  that Kerry comes out and says we're getting rid of borders there will be no borders at a commencement
[18:51.400 --> 18:56.360]  speech i have the clip coming up and then Cameron comes out and says you'll destabilize everything
[18:56.360 --> 19:02.360]  you know we'll go into war if the uk tries to leave the euro which again the they never voted
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.840]  to enter it neither did germany or france they can't vote to get out of it the polls all show
[19:06.840 --> 19:12.040]  that they would leave it like 80 percent in europe i don't believe these polls is just 50 some percent
[19:12.040 --> 19:19.000]  wanting on england and it's the very same arrogance here where paul ryan this is coming up with roger
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.800]  stone just in about 15 minutes this is exclusive it's up on info wars dot com red linked paul ryan
[19:26.600 --> 19:32.120]  and rinse previous who used to work for ryan are saying they're going to just keep all the rnc money
[19:33.480 --> 19:37.720]  old money that gets donated goes to them be divvied up instead of the donald trump
[19:37.720 --> 19:44.440]  so he can't even raise money and they admit they're preparing to scuttle donald trump and give it to
[19:44.440 --> 19:49.400]  hillary just because you know he has a cute little trendy beard little blue eyes and
[19:49.400 --> 19:53.800]  previous looks like a little sock puppet or something just these arrogant guys they've
[19:53.800 --> 20:02.360]  stolen the country they think it's legitimately there's hi this is ron paul i'm a former 22
[20:02.360 --> 20:07.000]  year congressman and republican presidential candidate i'm here to tell you about something
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.120]  that just might save your lives you never know when there will be another katrina an economic
[20:12.120 --> 20:16.680]  collapse or a serious drought we should all have little food storage that will carry us through

[24:36.360 --> 24:40.600]  news had a roger stone joining us with probably the biggest trump news we've ever announced here
[24:40.600 --> 24:47.720]  we'll stand up in the next segment at the terror in each sip and in each so many times in history
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.960]  populations take the arrogance of the elite and their confidence
[24:55.000 --> 25:06.440]  as invincibility but the type of grasping bootlicking sycophantic people like Paul Ryan
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.760]  and rents previous and the rest of them that rise to the tops of these organizations
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.000]  not because they're good leaders are independent men but because they're total
[25:19.720 --> 25:25.880]  minions who get off on the security of going into their big marble buildings into their back rooms
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.680]  and sitting around with the lobbyist and the representatives from the establishment thinking
[25:30.680 --> 25:39.000]  they're invincible that's that's criminology that the more criminals get away with something
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.400]  the more reckless they get just like they tried to announce there was never voting in a primary
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.400]  you silly conspiracy theorist actually use those terms conspiracy theorists and kooks
[25:50.280 --> 25:55.000]  think that your vote counts and the delegates supposedly pledge themselves well they do and
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.880]  I don't care if you change some rule to say it then we need to change that back where you claim
[25:59.880 --> 26:04.040]  the inner party besides who can run for president directly out of the communist
[26:05.960 --> 26:09.960]  pollut bureau central committee system I mean that's what it is
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.480]  and these lawyers they all get up there in their three thousand four thousand dollar suits and they
[26:19.480 --> 26:23.080]  sit there with their five hundred dollar ties on and their four thousand dollar shoes
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  and they think because they're banging hookers every night on taxpayer expense and
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  you know eating two hundred dollar stakes and fly around in helicopters that that means they're
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.200]  infallible and invincible I'm always read about billionaires and people like one of the walmart
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.440]  heirs the guy was worth like 80 billion he went got super dangerous ultralight and crash it killed
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.440]  himself and family said well he thought he was invincible because he had 80 billion dollars no
[26:46.440 --> 26:53.560]  you're not invincible that's what I'm getting at here is these people are crazy what do they call
[26:53.560 --> 27:01.000]  small planes and small jet planes they call them doctor killers there's so many doctors and lawyers
[27:01.560 --> 27:07.000]  go get their license they learn to fly they get arrogant they get confident and then they drive
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.640]  their planes right into the ground it's that same delusion that megalomania as they get more power
[27:13.640 --> 27:21.880]  they feel more and more invincible and so they came out and said nobody can have trump and all
[27:21.880 --> 27:25.640]  these foreign leaders agree and so we're going to just take it away from them people said no you're
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.200]  not so it caused the numbers to get even stronger for trump so now they've backed off and I said
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.480]  last week with stone I said you watch they're arrogant they're not going to back off now they
[27:35.480 --> 27:42.200]  think they're invincible they're just waiting so that trump stops talking about how they're
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.840]  stealing it from him and then they're going to basically scuttle it or or or take the money or
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.080]  do something and that's exactly what they're doing is they're claiming because the rnc the money goes
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.560]  to the rnc first is the clearinghouse that they're going to keep the money and that trump's supposed
[27:57.560 --> 28:03.160]  to make a deal with them and then they're going to basically run the ship aground and let hillary
[28:03.160 --> 28:11.000]  get in which paul ryan has said and mitch mcconnell have said again the arrogance level that they get
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.280]  up there and say we're the party we run this country we'll do what we want we're working with hillary
[28:16.280 --> 28:23.960]  they've totally uncloak themselves just like john carrey comes out and obama in the same weekend at
[28:23.960 --> 28:27.240]  commencement speeches and says we're going to have a borderless world get used to it
[28:30.360 --> 28:34.600]  just like they say hey uk you got to stay in the european union even though you never got to vote
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.960]  20 years ago to enter it and even though it now makes almost all your laws and is ordering the uk
[28:39.960 --> 28:47.000]  to bring in hundreds of thousands every few months of unvetted people from syria and other areas or
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.920]  they're going to find them a quarter million euros per person on elected bureaucracy says
[28:54.920 --> 29:01.160]  quarter million for each person you refuse and you're a nation state you go i don't want to pay
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.080]  for this i don't want to do this they go that's the way it is you're going to go under it that's
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.280]  world government it's not just like they're building some star trek federation we're all going to be
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.960]  lovey dovey and you know walk around and you know cool one-piece outfits and fly around and battle
[29:15.960 --> 29:24.120]  the aliens and whatever that's all un programming the un symbol they admit that the the symbol of the
[29:26.360 --> 29:31.400]  star fleet and all the rest of it it's just in your face no it's big giant megabanks above the law
[29:31.400 --> 29:38.360]  and armored fortresses controlling everything we do and dictating what we do and then you look at the
[29:38.360 --> 29:44.120]  media and the propaganda the culture they're pushing is pure death anti-family anti-free market
[29:44.120 --> 29:51.960]  eugenics these people are pure evil they're committed to evil we're on the march the empires on the
[29:51.960 --> 30:02.760]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network the constitutional convention 1787 was held strict
[30:02.760 --> 30:07.320]  secrecy and at the end of the proceeding citizens gathered outside independence hall to learn what
[30:07.320 --> 30:11.800]  had been produced behind closed doors while benjamin franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him
[30:11.800 --> 30:17.320]  well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you
[30:17.320 --> 30:21.960]  can keep it but today not only have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic
[30:21.960 --> 30:27.320]  even is for one thing a republic is not a democracy the republic operates under the rule of law which
[30:27.320 --> 30:31.640]  protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority under
[30:31.640 --> 30:36.120]  republic the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or
[30:36.120 --> 30:40.360]  lack thereof democracy on the other hand only leads the mob rule fueled by the unrestrained
[30:40.360 --> 30:44.600]  whims of the public and a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals proposing the
[30:44.600 --> 30:49.160]  minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority it is a case of majority
[30:49.160 --> 30:53.880]  over man in other words under democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under a
[30:53.880 --> 30:58.840]  republic the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law this is kit daniels with info wars

[33:37.080 --> 33:41.240]  in strategic drawing rights for the central banks it's all been announced the last four
[33:41.240 --> 33:47.080]  devos meetings in a row john carrey is telling students at commencement speeches that's coming
[33:47.080 --> 33:53.000]  up that we're in a borderless world and sovereignty is gone this is 21st century warfare we're
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.480]  witnessing and that's why donald j trump is under such attack because he is a nationalist
[33:57.480 --> 34:01.400]  he said globalism is the problem it's not fair it's a bunch of special interests screwing over
[34:01.400 --> 34:07.560]  the nation state they've used america's openness to come in and buy us off wasn't the communists
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.520]  that were the big threat say in russia it was the globalist within using collectivism to
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.000]  domesticate our people so it was the sneak attack we're going to roger stone with probably the
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.680]  biggest news is ever broken here i keep saying that each week when he comes on this just gets
[34:20.680 --> 34:26.440]  bigger and bigger but this is huge the story is up on info wars dot com it is an exclusive
[34:26.440 --> 34:32.280]  it's red linked it needs to go viral everywhere roger stone ryan and previs planning to extort
[34:32.280 --> 34:38.840]  trump at rnc now are they looking to openly take up with the money yes are they looking to scuttle
[34:38.840 --> 34:45.560]  the campaign for hillary they've admitted that he needs to be removed a speaker now the arrogance is
[34:45.560 --> 34:52.520]  just dumb founding it's it they're like villains out of a out of a shakespeare play we're going
[34:52.520 --> 34:58.760]  to mr stone here in just a moment of stone zone dot com before i go any further we've had a
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.080]  storable food special that ran for two weeks it's only supposed to run a week it's 30 to 40% off
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.640]  was the most successful sale we ever did because people realize the climate's crazy with all the
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.520]  destabilization and i don't like to end a special when it's doing so well and that helps the small
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.240]  profit we make on each sale overall with a lot of sales helps fund the operation i'm a free market
[35:17.240 --> 35:23.240]  guy it's the highest quality lowest price uh smaller profit per unit but but sell more units
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.520]  win win win but because we go with my paper supply probably the best company out there i know for
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.600]  the price they're excellent the packaging is amazing it's it's fresh they said look we have
[35:32.600 --> 35:35.960]  contracts you're a private label or so and our full spectrum of foods you can offer these
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.640]  discount sometimes but we've gotten too much heat from other suppliers and people you're undercut in
[35:39.640 --> 35:46.680]  the market you got to stop and i said okay what about this um on our four top selling packages
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.040]  how about i just say 40% off just on those and they went and checked and looked and they said yeah
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.280]  if it's not on the 60 something packages that are there sure so that hasn't even been launched yet
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.600]  but that's gonna be up on the side by letter today on the four week on the six month on the year

[37:30.200 --> 37:37.080]  roger stone joins us with undoubtedly the biggest news since he first started coming on the broadcast
[37:38.360 --> 37:44.520]  11 months ago warning of the plan to steal the convention in a broker convention
[37:44.520 --> 37:49.240]  at first he got poo pooed for that then it all came out it was true a month before it was admitted
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.440]  that the cook brothers were meeting in secret with other billionaires to donate hundreds of
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.840]  millions to try to defeat trump he broke that they denied it the next day turned out a month later
[37:56.840 --> 38:02.600]  that meeting actually happened uh that was even in the new york times so just over and over again
[38:02.600 --> 38:07.320]  he gives us the inside baseball and that's why they call him dirty and evil and mean because
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.120]  they're dirty and evil and mean and because he tells the truth they're scared of him
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.920]  former campaign head for trump well he has two sources that was as of last night
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.360]  i know he's been working on it more it's up on info wars.com he's just been in new york last
[38:24.360 --> 38:30.520]  few days meeting with trump and the rest of the campaign team unofficially but war gaming with him
[38:30.520 --> 38:37.400]  so he's got a lot to cover with us today roger stone ryan and previs planning to extort trump at rnc
[38:37.400 --> 38:44.600]  gop establishment still scheming to steal the nomination from the populous new york front
[38:44.600 --> 38:52.680]  runner and he goes over all this he's got the internal plan that they were going to use with
[38:52.680 --> 38:58.440]  crews so he's going to break it all down for you to the end of this hour the next 22 minutes
[38:58.440 --> 39:02.120]  i want to thank roger stone for joining us thank you for giving us this exclusive roger
[39:02.120 --> 39:08.920]  you alex i'm as always i'm delighted to be with you it is uh first let's kind of set the table
[39:09.560 --> 39:15.320]  the mainstream media uh this weekend as we have seen seems to be focused on the past
[39:15.880 --> 39:23.480]  point here is not one of party unity uh but one of recognizing that the millions of people
[39:23.480 --> 39:29.800]  that trump is bringing to the republican banner or at least to his candidacy more than offset
[39:29.800 --> 39:37.960]  that the five percent who are never trump so the the focus is entirely wrong understandably
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.600]  because trump is the first political figure really in decades who has been able to expand
[39:44.600 --> 39:50.840]  the republican base and change the entire dynamics of the next election and i love how he said look
[39:50.840 --> 39:55.320]  i'm a populist i'm a conservative but it's republican party not conservative party plus
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.280]  uh paul ryan these people are not conservative leaders they're globalist puppets who openly
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.520]  say they'd rather have hillary he should be removed as the speaker of the house right now for that
[40:04.520 --> 40:10.920]  alone i'm sorry go ahead roger well at a minimum he should be removed as chairman of the republican
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.200]  national convention and hired by hillary he should be the head of her campaign well if he cannot
[40:16.200 --> 40:22.600]  support the democratically selected nominee of his party he should step down but the point here
[40:22.600 --> 40:30.520]  i think is that instead of focusing on quote on quote party unity trump yesterday said correctly
[40:30.520 --> 40:38.440]  the party may not be unified let me be clear this movement and trump's candidacy is much bigger than
[40:38.440 --> 40:44.840]  the republican party that is the point that they missed now alex we only lost the last
[40:44.840 --> 40:54.920]  presidential election by 700 000 votes distributed in five states if you went to colorado iowa
[40:55.560 --> 41:04.840]  florida michigan nevada new jersey ohio virginia wisconsin and pennsylvania there are at least
[41:04.840 --> 41:13.080]  one million people who are unregistered but meet the profile of trump supporters politics is about
[41:13.080 --> 41:21.800]  addition not subtraction i mean i had to laugh this weekend because as you've seen uh bush 41
[41:21.800 --> 41:29.720]  bush 43 say they won't support the nominee thank god the mainstream press thinks this is a negative
[41:29.720 --> 41:36.520]  this is a positive george w bush destroyed our economy and sent american men and women to fight
[41:36.520 --> 41:43.240]  and die in a war where we had no vital national interest he is a disgraced foreign president
[41:43.240 --> 41:49.800]  and bare minimum bare minimum covered up the saudi arabian role at a minimum so the idea
[41:49.800 --> 41:56.600]  that you can't win without the support of george w bush or his father uh who is uh another uh
[41:56.600 --> 42:04.200]  criminal um is it's a false narrative then this is even more laughable jab bush comes out and says
[42:04.200 --> 42:13.080]  he can't support trump because trump doesn't have the character to be president let me get this straight
[42:13.800 --> 42:20.120]  jev bush who is a drug dealer in boarding school and college and his early years and
[42:20.120 --> 42:28.360]  used it in miami jev bush who defrauded a florida s and l out of four million dollars paid for by
[42:28.360 --> 42:37.240]  the taxpayers jev bush who lined his pockets in return for official acts he took as governor
[42:37.240 --> 42:43.160]  florida he is saying dylan shrunk doesn't have the uh integrity be president yeah a guy that never
[42:43.160 --> 42:47.720]  got about five points or whatever i mean it just shows the delusion it's like we live in north korea
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.640]  or something with him propping these people up in the arrogance of these folks so so this is where
[42:51.640 --> 42:56.680]  we are now i want to get into you know well now let's get into now let's get into the big meeting
[42:56.680 --> 43:06.600]  that's coming up all ryan is posturing uh making his support for donald trump conditional on a set
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.600]  of demands those demands uh need to be now now now stop for him because siren's the background
[43:12.600 --> 43:15.560]  roger show this is a big deal i mean you just dropped such bombshoes want folks to listen
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.440]  carefully you have this from inside the r&c uh you know tell folks kind of walk through what you
[43:20.440 --> 43:26.200]  can repeat to the audience that you told me last night of the magnitude of their arrogance and that
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.920]  they still think they're going to bear minimum rob the money of everybody that donates to trump
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.080]  uh and and scuttle this for hillary i mean you'll phrase this as you did last night to me please
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.240]  certainly shall first of all it's important to understand the history r&c chairman rights
[43:41.240 --> 43:51.240]  previous uh is often publicly identified with romney or with uh his governor uh in uh uh in
[43:51.240 --> 43:59.400]  wisconsin walker but in truth ryan's previous is a ryan man that's his birthright in politics
[43:59.400 --> 44:07.240]  fall ryan don't forget that as we move forward so uh in essence what walker is going to pardon me
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.960]  what ryan is going to demand of trump is control of the republican national committee would remain
[44:13.960 --> 44:22.040]  in the hands of previous uh and his cohorts they would also demand that the trump campaign use the
[44:22.040 --> 44:29.320]  data vault which was built and is partially owned by carol rove uh for all of their outgoing
[44:29.880 --> 44:37.720]  voter contact we happen to know that this flaw this system is flawed it's dirty it was proven to be
[44:37.720 --> 44:45.160]  ineffective in the 2012 campaign they've essentially just taken the romney data program which crashed
[44:45.160 --> 44:52.200]  on election day and recycled it as a new product it's still flawed beyond that they want to demand
[44:52.200 --> 44:58.840]  that the individual republican state chairman have control and run the trump campaigns in the
[44:58.840 --> 45:08.680]  individual states now this struggle is mostly about money it's about the favored vendors for ryan's
[45:08.680 --> 45:15.320]  previous uh getting multi-millions of dollars worth of business from the trump campaign and from
[45:15.320 --> 45:23.160]  the 2016 effort here's what ryan's previous doesn't understand he's about to meet he and
[45:23.160 --> 45:30.920]  paul ryan are about to meet the toughest negotiator probably alive today speaking as someone who over
[45:30.920 --> 45:37.240]  the last 30 years has negotiated multiple compensation agreements with donald trump
[45:37.240 --> 45:44.200]  i can just tell you he's tough he's clear he's blunt and he understands that the movement
[45:44.200 --> 45:50.200]  that he is leading is far bigger than the republican party he will not be blackmailed
[45:50.200 --> 45:58.040]  he will call for ryan to step down as speaker uh pardon me as convention chairman there is
[45:58.040 --> 46:05.640]  as i reported here on info wars last week a back bench revolt among individual liberty-minded
[46:05.640 --> 46:11.320]  congressmen who are furious with ryan and sarah palin is pledging to go after ryan and his reelection
[46:11.320 --> 46:16.200]  what a wonderful lady this is this is america taking its country back this is so exciting and
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.360]  again it shows their arrogance that that they think they can try to steal it even though it
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.680]  already backfired on them and they tried to publicly sell it if paul ryan said he'd rather
[46:24.680 --> 46:30.600]  have hillary and so has the leader of the senate mitch mcconnell on record then they have no place
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.720]  at the head of the rnc they have no place as the speaker no place as the senate majority leader
[46:35.720 --> 46:40.520]  i say get on the offense now and i understand trump's giving him a chance to back off and they
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.680]  need to just remove themselves because look they'll steal the money and then they'll scuttle
[46:44.680 --> 46:50.360]  the campaign and give it to hillary that's their stinking plan they've admitted it these little rat
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.560]  bastards have admitted it mr stone am i wrong no you're absolutely right and alex this is the
[46:55.560 --> 47:04.680]  insidious hand of carl rove let's remember rove has a proprietary interest in the data trust uh uh
[47:04.680 --> 47:12.120]  data bank rove has tight relationships with many of these republican state chairmen so the fix is in
[47:12.120 --> 47:20.360]  if ryan and previs get their way now i also believe that the rnc has a one million dollar
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.080]  hard bank debt that the trump campaign is unaware of i also think that there are
[47:27.080 --> 47:33.560]  accounting tricks being used at the rnc to make their fundraising totals look more impressive
[47:33.560 --> 47:40.360]  than they are taking compliance money and legal money and recount money and essentially double
[47:40.360 --> 47:48.040]  counting it to make the bank balances look higher so this is just my personal view i would urge uh
[47:48.040 --> 47:53.960]  don trump and his people to do an audit of the republican national convention committee uh as
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.720]  soon as uh he takes control and i would make no deal to give away that's right what has been
[47:59.720 --> 48:07.720]  since the 1860s the right of the republican national nominee to control the party in a in an
[48:07.720 --> 48:13.480]  election year so really the headline here is from full wars dot com paul wrote a very good
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.200]  article uh you know conferring with us last night but i mean really it's
[48:20.680 --> 48:26.040]  a bunch of neocons or a bunch of rhinos are trying to hijack the party and derail the whole
[48:26.040 --> 48:31.480]  process claiming it's their rules trying to openly steal the money trying to take over the process
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.760]  and try to take control the party away from the presumptive nominee even after they're
[48:36.760 --> 48:42.440]  nominated this is just so sensational but in the age of the tpp secretly being ratified and
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.120]  we're under world government and in the age of the pope calling for world government and
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.360]  everyone's saying donald trump's so evil because he says globalism is destroying us
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.800]  isn't this emblematic of these of these bureaucrats and these politicians because they're in control
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.840]  of the system believing they own it and control it and then they come out and openly say it's
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.080]  all theirs i mean i'm wondering if they realize how this is backfired they already tried to sell
[49:05.080 --> 49:10.920]  that there's no popular election one man one vote doesn't exist in the primary silly kids that never
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.080]  happened even though you have all the public interest the money and election laws and uh you
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.640]  know uh false advertising and the rest of it but now they just think they can just take it again
[49:20.280 --> 49:26.040]  and take over the party uh that it just really shows how delusional these people are you were
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.800]  there when they tried to steal it from reagan enforce the compromise you were there throughout
[49:29.800 --> 49:37.000]  this have you ever seen such levels of brazen uh megalomania in your view roger stone
[49:37.640 --> 49:43.960]  we put it this way alex i have never seen a situation in which a republican speaker tried
[49:43.960 --> 49:51.160]  to blackmail the republican nominee for president this is extortion uh and all he has all ryan has
[49:51.160 --> 49:58.680]  to trade uh of course is his endorsement which he has withheld to create this leverage let me move
[49:58.680 --> 50:04.360]  on because there's another important development this weekend you uh i'm sure noticed that don
[50:04.360 --> 50:11.240]  trump engaged hillary clinton on the questions of her husband's epic abuse of women and her role
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.640]  in covering up that scandal and let's just say it you don't like to brag but you've been advising
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.520]  trump for a year and a half when this is the game plan you told me a few weeks ago watch get ready
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.640]  he's gonna go after her on this and he did which shows he's got the bona fides to go toe to toe
[50:25.640 --> 50:30.200]  he's he's for real folks this is what we've always needed is somebody to not play patty cake continue
[50:30.200 --> 50:36.360]  roger well look i don't trump is his own man and he decides what he says but i i think it is very
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.880]  clear that he has read my book the clinton's war on women as have hundreds of thousands of other
[50:41.880 --> 50:49.960]  americans so when new york magazine yesterday reported that trump made this claim without
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.480]  foundation no there's a lot of foundation read the well we're gonna go over it in the books available
[50:55.480 --> 50:59.560]  at info or store.com but let me just add i see articles every day saying donald trump
[51:00.120 --> 51:04.680]  claimed that the soddies had a role in 911 there was a cover-up with no proof and i don't even
[51:04.680 --> 51:09.320]  mention the 28 pages so you know this is like gibbs saying there's no drone program six years after
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.520]  the program's public sorry go ahead well but it's very important to understand here what the strategy
[51:14.520 --> 51:22.120]  is because the clintonites hope that they can suppress this story as they did in the 80s unfortunately
[51:22.120 --> 51:31.000]  for them that was the pre-internet age so they have put enormous pressure on cnn on fox on msnbc
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.480]  on the networks trying to claim oh this has all been discredited no no they admit on msnbc and cnn
[51:37.480 --> 51:42.520]  as you know they cut people's mics when they mention this yeah it's extraordinary but it won't work
[51:42.520 --> 51:48.760]  and i'll tell you why because you cannot gag the nominee of the republican party can't do it you
[51:48.760 --> 51:56.440]  cannot gag donald trump and he gets it now her entire campaign strategy is based on winning a
[51:56.440 --> 52:04.440]  disproportionate number of votes from women uh and media matters for america the the clinton
[52:04.440 --> 52:12.920]  apologists financed by soros uh but directed by hillary um seek to pressure and discredit anyone
[52:12.920 --> 52:20.360]  who raises this question this is really simple though let one eat a broadrick speak let paula
[52:20.360 --> 52:27.800]  jones speak let my friend kathleen willie speak hear them out let them tell you exactly what
[52:27.800 --> 52:33.160]  happened to them at the hands of bill and then at the hands of hillary then hillary can deny it if
[52:33.160 --> 52:38.600]  she wishes that's right and the american people can decide who's telling the truth but for her to
[52:38.600 --> 52:46.280]  say for hillary to say that young college women who are sexually assaulted at school deserve to be
[52:46.280 --> 52:52.760]  believed but these women do not deserve to be believed is outrageous now the truth is they're
[52:52.760 --> 52:57.240]  an organized crime syndicate they've settled cases we know they're doing it and thank god you wrote
[52:57.240 --> 53:02.360]  the book to expose it all other facets i mean i love the fact that trump's so strong i love the
[53:02.360 --> 53:06.920]  fact he's not backing down i love his foreign policy speech uh so much good stuff is happening
[53:06.920 --> 53:12.440]  uh what are other pitfalls what are other attacks what else is on the radar uh i mean bottom line
[53:12.440 --> 53:16.040]  i guess we get the word out about the clinton's and their in their abuse of women we we get the
[53:16.040 --> 53:20.440]  word out about what paul ryan and and previous of these little arrogant creatures are doing
[53:21.080 --> 53:26.200]  we expose the fact that uh that that that you know the whole world's trying to gang up on us
[53:26.200 --> 53:31.800]  and tell us what to do what else is on the radar roger stone well there was one other very significant
[53:31.800 --> 53:37.400]  development this weekend in which donald trump referred to the clinton foundation as a scam
[53:38.280 --> 53:46.760]  so you you're seeing the the elementary uh messages of donald trump's campaign he is vowed
[53:46.760 --> 53:53.000]  to go after hillary hammer and tong he understands her epic abuse of women he understands the
[53:53.000 --> 54:00.680]  disaster that is her tenure as secretary of state and he understands the the largest single
[54:00.680 --> 54:08.040]  money laundering operation in us history which is the clinton foundation the mainstream media
[54:08.040 --> 54:15.480]  is trying desperately not to cover these stories as exist as if they don't exist terrific piece on
[54:15.480 --> 54:20.840]  bright bark this week about how subsequent developments regarding the clinton foundation
[54:21.480 --> 54:28.120]  got no mainstream media coverage so we see the game they are going to try to play they're going
[54:28.120 --> 54:34.440]  to try to make these issues untouchable this worked for them in the 80s it is not going to work for
[54:34.440 --> 54:40.520]  them in 2016 well even when i talk to democrats and people i know some of them which are prominent
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.160]  here in austin they go no we can see trump winning now we can see it hillary's damaged goods and then
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.120]  the fbi set to talk to her this week i mean even if they don't go after her it's just this whole
[54:50.120 --> 54:56.120]  backdrop uh that it's it's if she's crawling you know towards her own grave while trying to crawl
[54:56.120 --> 55:01.480]  away from it at the same time she wants more power to protect herself uh into the future she's just
[55:01.480 --> 55:08.680]  hoped for a pardon uh out of obama how was trump when you met with him in new york he seems to be
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.200]  energized when i see him out on the campaign trail uh i mean this whole thing just has the
[55:14.200 --> 55:21.240]  smell of destiny well it's as you know uh any conversation i i have with donald is proprietary
[55:21.240 --> 55:27.000]  and i would never reveal what we talked about sure but i'm asking overall how's he doing uh but in
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.600]  terms of his mood he is excited he's pumped up he's super confident about his ability to win he is um
[55:34.600 --> 55:40.600]  he reiterates again uh in everything he does that he is his own man he's not going to be
[55:40.600 --> 55:46.440]  controlled by wall street he's not going to be controlled by k street he is going to do this
[55:46.440 --> 55:53.160]  his way and in all honesty doing it his way has worked extraordinarily well so far
[55:53.160 --> 55:58.120]  he is bigger than the republican party he's absolutely right it's not about whether the
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.440]  party is unified it's about whether the party can attract several million new people and that's
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.320]  beautiful and that's why they're so scared of him and and democrats out there if you want prosperity
[56:09.320 --> 56:15.880]  folks just bring somebody in who doesn't dislike america and have it out for the west these globalists
[56:15.880 --> 56:20.440]  in both parties are setting up a world government they want to parlay american interest into that
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.480]  for themselves and get themselves seats at the new table it's not their country to sell out it's
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.120]  not their election to steal it's not it's not their government even to paul ryan and and and
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.280]  hillary clinton and all these people think it we're watching the death of these individuals they
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.200]  claim the death of the party the party died a long time ago it's rising like a phoenix again
[56:38.200 --> 56:44.440]  because of donald trump this is destiny uh you you said that the they tried the mafia thing on
[56:44.440 --> 56:49.000]  they tried that it didn't go anywhere what are other attacks you expect now against donald j
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.400]  trump well you also saw this uh fraudulent lawsuit filed uh in texas where a non-existent woman
[56:58.280 --> 57:08.120]  claiming to be her own uh attorney accused trump falsely uh of uh of abusing her in the company
[57:08.120 --> 57:14.760]  of jeffrey eppstein the convicted pedophile who ironically is a running buddy of bill clinton
[57:14.760 --> 57:20.440]  and whose top people were uh and who you wrote about in your book and who you told me privately
[57:20.440 --> 57:24.920]  trump was getting ready to go after him with so they just threw it back on him yeah so uh the
[57:24.920 --> 57:30.520]  the good news of course is that a judge has now dismissed this lawsuit it's fraudulent this was
[57:30.520 --> 57:39.240]  an attempt to try to uh neutralize trump on the issue that they realized is a killer for the clinton's
[57:39.240 --> 57:46.280]  themselves what was bill clinton doing on pedophile island for these private parties
[57:46.280 --> 57:51.960]  and what did hillary think he was doing not paradise island but pedo island wow incredible

[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.520]  company i'm gonna talk about it we come back in the next segment set up the model of world government
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:26.760]  we see forming today the problem is once world government comes out of the shadows into the
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.400]  open and really tries to carry out its aims why do these power people want world government it's
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.920]  eugenics it's playing god once they try to actually implement everything and it goes from stealth
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:42.040]  mode to out in the open mode that's the beginning of the fall they've been gearing up into talitarianism
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:48.200]  behind the scenes to try to block us when they emerge but patriots are 50 years have been exposing
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.120]  them back the days of very goldwater when people like roger stone were first getting involved
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.360]  so in the last few minutes with roger stone he's he's he's breaking down
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.520]  just some incredible things that are happening we're forcing the clintons to come out in the
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.280]  open we're forcing the paul ryan's to come out in the open we're forcing them to be arrogant and
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.600]  tell us we don't have any rights and we don't have elections and they'll take all the rnc money and
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.680]  not give it to uh to you know to donald trump because that's where your donations go through them
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.560]  and they're just showing everyone how delusional they are it's like you you've been out of town
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.440]  for a month you come back and you're an arrogant employee trying to stage some type of takeover
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.680]  to your business and you just say hey watch this you're all fired they just can't believe that they
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.080]  took your kindness for weakness we got three minutes left i appreciate roger stone being here
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.120]  with us roger encapsulate how this is going to play out when we'll know whether they're successful
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:45.080]  or not stealing this uh extorting donald trump when these meetings should happen and and what we can do
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.120]  to make sure because they didn't want trump or you talking about how they were stealing the
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.040]  elections calling sore loser but that's what destroyed them because they were stealing it so
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.360]  now we're gonna continue to attack them uh and hopefully get the grassroots behind it so roger
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.800]  what do we do and how does this play out well first of all no one extorts donald trump uh so
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:08.280]  that's not going to work uh and i think ryan may misunderstand the value of his endorsement trump
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:14.600]  got nominated without any endorsements other than the great patriot jeff sessions uh it is that he is
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.600]  not the candidate of endorsements uh and i continue to argue that the support of the romney's and the
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.720]  bush's is not a positive it's a negative now he should come out and say that not just say hey i
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.560]  don't need the party leadership you know the party's the people that's great he's saying that say hey
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.240]  i'm glad i don't have you people that sold us out you're the failures you're the loser sorry go ahead
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.000]  uh but i can also report that in a closed door meeting of the republican lawyers association
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.080]  last night last there was a presentation by don mcgane uh the lawyer who represents donald trump
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:53.960]  a very able man very solid guy very positive upbeat presentation about how the campaign is
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.440]  gearing up to raise the money necessary uh to fund a general election after mr mcgane
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:07.080]  left however the entire meeting focused on a discussion of how to stop donald trump
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:13.880]  in the rules committee now uh the details all of the details of this closed door meeting
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:22.120]  will be up on info wars dot com tomorrow with a whole report because fortunately i had a spy
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.360]  in the room just like you did at the coke brothers meeting incredible but just finishing up
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.240]  when do these negotiations happen when when will we know whether they're going to be successful
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:38.120]  stealing uh the the war chest uh donald trump uh is going to be meeting with speaker ryan and chairman
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.080]  previous uh on thursday in washington dc uh and we'll see how this gets worked out but
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:51.320]  anyone who thinks you can hold up donald trump is a fool uh he is uh bigger than the republican
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.520]  party he's the only one with the potential to expand the republican party and alex this final
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:04.920]  thought those congressmen and those senators who are fleeing trump today are the same people
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:12.520]  who will be desperate to get on the the platform with him this october mark my words absolutely i
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.520]  mean they're all the yes men that got there because they're yes men trump is independent clearly
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.400]  and they're all just a bunch of delusional followers because just as jp morgan and goldman sacks tell
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.280]  him you know do this we're backing you it's it's it's just all a con game and it's coming down
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.480]  and regardless donald trump's injecting nationalist issues and anti politically correct issues that
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.000]  are a god's end he's a total winner he's already won by being on the arena and you're in the arena
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.320]  too roger stone thank you so much for the time stonezone dot com find both his books on the

[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.720]  three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be what you can be what you will be
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:13.640]  they are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail to regain faith when
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:20.360]  there seems to be little cause for faith to create hope when hope becomes forlorn unhappily i possess
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.200]  neither that eloquence of dictation that poetry of imagination nor that brilliance of metaphor to
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.880]  tell you all that they mean the unbelievers will say they are but words but a slogan but a flamboyant
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:38.360]  phrase every demagogue every cynic every hypocrite every troublemaker and i am sorry to say some
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.920]  others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.960]  mockery and ridicule but these are some of the things they do they build your basic character
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:53.880]  they mold you for the future roles as a custodians of the nation's defense this was said on may 12

[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.400]  information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.480]  we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:37.080]  iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling it is the purest
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:42.040]  cleanest strongest out there quite frankly i'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.680]  nasa and iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.720]  get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have

[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:08.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones only on the gcm radio network
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:25.480]  we now take you live from the central texas command center we're broadcasting from world
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:32.200]  wide i'm your host alex jones a collection of mega banks have seized control of the globe to a
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.800]  great extent they're mopping up the last corners of resistance and even drilling down to end all
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:44.840]  resistance and terminating the life force itself terminating the will to live and survive and
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:52.520]  thrive attacking the very biological processes of humans and targeting the family unit itself
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.880]  the basis of civilization and that is being done openly because they're going to collapse world
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:05.320]  civilization selectively uh into a new dark age and out of that will be the rise of the machines
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:11.000]  and the technotronic era you see this in a lot of globalist propaganda placement
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.280]  in fiction prepping your mind with predictive programming so that you simply accept it into
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.800]  the future and that is the plan for the planet i think people should be concerned about an
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:32.520]  unelected world government being set up whose goal is to carry out eugenics i talked earlier
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.440]  about the british east india company and then became merged with the dutch east india company
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.040]  these were big private combines backed by banks and insurance companies
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.520]  and the first stock exchanges where you'd buy stock in a ship that would have you lost a ship
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.200]  you wouldn't lose everything as you and a hundred other people were invested in it and they they
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.200]  brought in mercenaries they brought in private groups they learned how to play groups off against
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:01.240]  each other in india and other areas and and this is the model we're under today and you've got all
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.920]  these politicians bought and paid for by globalist parlaying the national sovereignty the jobs the
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:12.040]  industry selling it off even though it's not there's the sell to these institutions
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:20.040]  and our children are being prepped to go to colleges to get into debt and they'll never get
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.320]  jobs almost all of them with the degrees they're getting that are obsolete before they even get
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:30.600]  the degrees it's all done by design to arrest development and to create servile soft people
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:39.160]  ready to be basically taken over with national health care and very slowly euthanized and here's
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:47.960]  an article politico obama will push transgender gender identity rules on all k through 12 schools
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.680]  kindergarten through 12 and that's in bright part well that's already going on confusing
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.360]  children sexualizing children who needs bill clinton's pedophile island when you've got just
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.960]  the schools becoming places where the school tells your child they can have an abortion where the
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.160]  school tells your child they can have an inoculation where the school is going to talk to your five
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:18.440]  year old i mean my children are 13 11 and 8 and i barely have talked to them about sex
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:26.360]  and i probably should do it more but it's an uncomfortable thing instead you've got the government
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:33.640]  involved trying to confuse their identities imagine if somebody wrote a science fiction book
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:40.760]  60 years ago when the year 2016 they'd be opening the borders to jihadis by the millions they'd be
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:49.720]  teaching children how to do things sexually that i didn't even know about till i covered it as a
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:59.160]  young man on the air they set up in middle schools now they're going to go earlier grades
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.880]  little signs up and say come to this counselor's office come to this school room after school today
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.080]  if you're bi or curious and if you don't want to be bullied because you're gay and you get there
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:17.880]  and then you're led by adults who take you to these off school retreats that your liberal parents
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:25.080]  sign on for you to go to and they go and then they are in dormitories with beds this is better than
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:32.120]  the news all over the country the same program and then they sit there and teach them all this
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:38.040]  incredible sexual stuff and then the teachers say we're leaving now enjoy yourselves this is pedophilia
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:45.000]  with six and seventh graders now they're going to go down lower it's a sex cult
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:54.680]  but the sex cult is only one engineered system to totally confuse and break down society
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.960]  and they sell it like oh you're against somebody because they're quote gay
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.400]  look there are homosexual pedophiles they're heterosexual pedophiles anybody trying to
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:11.000]  sexualize children is a pervert and is encroaching and and and and getting involved in in parents
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.880]  lives and children's lives they're bullying us just like the republicans bully us and get up
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.760]  there with arrogance and laugh at us on every tv channel going your vote never counted it never
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:29.000]  did we're sovereign we decide we don't go with a mere plurality of the majority we decide okay

[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.560]  riva's previous wevis i approve this message i'm paul blue eyed you know ryan
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.800]  boy toy of the of the of the of the house i mean it's a bunch of guys up there literally delusional
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:57.320]  in their own world hanging out at the dc bath houses just thinking they're invincible because
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.360]  they prance around in fancy suits look uh this country and this planet and our families and
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.720]  this species doesn't belong to you just because you hijacked the country signed the world onto a
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:13.080]  bunch of derivatives fraud and think you own us it's over the bottom of the hour i'm gonna play
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:22.760]  part of this uh beautiful classical music that the that a russian orchestra played
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:31.320]  for solidarity with the folks being massacred in palmyra syria and mainstream western news
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:36.280]  decried the russian propaganda because they had a symphony
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:45.160]  in solidarity with the people being murdered in the non-radical muslim nation of syria
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:52.440]  they call that propaganda not sending in hundreds of thousands of jihadis not spending tens of
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:01.000]  billions of dollars no they hate the fact that the russian orchestra would go to palmyra in the
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.840]  ruins recently retaken from isis and they would play there obviously a serious risk to their lives
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.640]  and just an act of dignity and and wholesomeness and you know why the new order hates classical
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:25.240]  music because it touches the soul it it raises the connections in the brain it takes us to a higher
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:33.080]  level the globalists admit ugly music ugly culture ugly this every message you see is father is
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:39.480]  stupid father is bad women are all the heroes women get everything done it's not to empower women
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:47.000]  it's to totally make women disdain men and think that they get power out of dominating men
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.640]  there are roman handbooks you can look them up we've covered them on how when they would take
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:00.280]  over areas of europe they would bring back slaves they'd kill the men but keep boys and then they
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.800]  would single out as soon as they got to the camp some of the boys and beat them with an inch of
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.760]  their life claiming they've done something wrong and they tell the women you suppress your boys
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:14.600]  you control them you spy on them you report to us or we're going to kill them and within just a few
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.880]  months the women were the biggest oppressors of the men and then set themselves up as a predatory
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:27.720]  group in every slave culture the women are the controllers of the men it's an inverted system
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.200]  and this is what they've set up this is what they're doing and then women are totally frustrated
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:39.800]  they've got these men groveling to them they're in discord and their families the men act like
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:45.880]  arrested development babies and now the wife or the girlfriends like their mom and the boys run off
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:55.000]  together and act like bad kids playing hooky from school they've taken real women from us
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:03.160]  mother's day had my 90 year old grandmother over she's still there when she's there sometimes she
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:12.120]  drifts out really smart lady great lady classy lady but my dad's mom i wish she was still alive
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:19.560]  she's been dead 11 years she was just so smart
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:28.200]  and was a real intellectual and was cool and she loved the men in her family
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.200]  she loved her husband she loved my dad and his brother she loved me
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.560]  and yeah i just don't see any women like that anymore they just where are they
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.120]  i remember being a little kid a teenager and like all those that last generation of women
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.240]  and the ones before them and those were just powerful magical creatures and now you look at
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.840]  women they are just freaked out and run and scared and they should be the our civilization
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.960]  everything humans built together everything we did huddled in the dark going through the ages
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.480]  all of the fights we went through together they've convinced us that we're even separate we are the
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.040]  species we are one you know first they denied they were building a world government now they
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.600]  admit they're doing and the question is did we vote for that did we support that no and then
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.880]  hey what type of world government is it no one's asking what do they want to do
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.520]  they want to suck all the resources out of us play us off against each other
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:35.640]  and set up hardened facilities worldwide to carry out a mass extermination
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.280]  and they're going to total automation and robot control as fast as they can
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.840]  so nobody can say no to them and so the soldiers won't refuse their orders because they're robots
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.160]  they've already got all of our houses wired with ai tracking everything we do
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.760]  they admit they're doing it i mean i again i'd tell people and i'm not happy about this i'd
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:00.280]  tell people 18 years ago they're tracking you with your cable boxes and your smart meters and it
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:06.840]  dials into everything because it was public but it was in the congressional documents it wasn't
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.480]  widely known and people would say you're crazy even when i had the documents and wrote articles
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.600]  about it and made films and now they just go guess whatever they've watched we're tracking
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.040]  everything and yes the borders are wide open but we're going to grope you when you go to the tsh
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:25.640]  it's diabolical it's bad people not because they're elites that they get into control but
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.000]  because they're willing to do anything they don't have governors they're like cells many
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.880]  malfunctioning and replicating it's cancer the globalist are cancer what else would come in and
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.360]  try to turn the life force off what else would come in and try to destroy the human family and
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:48.200]  dump everybody down i'm going to come back and play these clips of the carry talking about

[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.560]  wouldn't be the capacity of elites to carry out really big crimes and cover them up because people
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:54.680]  go public well we've had hundreds of members of the military defense intelligence army
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:00.360]  intelligence naval intelligence fbi as much as i want to criticize the fbi they do a lot of bad
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.640]  things at the top it was the fbi tried to stop 9 11 and spoke out and a whole bunch of agents got
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:11.720]  demoted instead of getting awarded it was even atf people that started blowing the whistle on
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:23.320]  fascin furious there are still good people but we've got all these facebook insiders coming out
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.080]  and saying no we sit there with algorithms and we censor and we put in the pre-program
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.600]  things to block folks i mean i know i put donald trump in a headline on on the facebook mentions
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.240]  and they don't allow it to be shared off our page i mean i'm watching it in real time and then sure
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.960]  enough the people go public and they say that's exactly what's happening you know and why are you
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.760]  on facebook because that's where the people are it's a war it's like asking if i was in a war
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.200]  why would i fly over and drop leaflets to the resistance saying good job
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.800]  they don't want us in there we're going to be in there you don't take the fact of trying to censor
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:10.680]  you and play games as a reason to quit oh my gosh i'm running into opposition let me quit no no i go
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:20.120]  towards the opposition it's my radar system that's what i do i go to the flag they didn't have
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.800]  satellites back in world war two folks and when they'd fly in over germany or they'd fly in over
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:34.520]  japan they would go to the flag they'd fly into the clouds of reigning metal and explosions
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:42.760]  because that's where the enemy was i always hear the general public go you're gonna get opposition
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.360]  they're gonna come after you they could do something could kill you people tell me that really i've
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.200]  only probably had 15 guests they killed after they came on really they could get me uh you the death
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.880]  threats i've gone through the physical attacks the credit i don't say bring it on because i don't
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.720]  want to have more stuff to deal with but once it happens i'm absolutely heading the game because
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:16.520]  this is what i expect it's like telling you know my dad's dad when he was climbing into a b17 to
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:23.560]  flying out of north africa and bomb italy oh you know they're gonna be shooting at you and you get
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:31.560]  there as he's climbing into the cockpit but that's what they've taught culture just deny
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:38.440]  stuff's going on just ha ha conspiracy theorists say that there's a world government conspiracy
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.520]  theorists say they're going to sign us on the derivatives it's just a little excuse for people
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.720]  who don't want to spend time or energy on being involved who just want to go play golf or go
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:55.960]  go get their Porsche waxed or don't you understand you've been given all that to fool you and to make
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:02.680]  you think you're successful when real manhood and and real honor is waiting for you you only have
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:08.120]  all this success and all this luxury and all these choices because we had ancestors that would fight
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:14.040]  to the death before they would bow down to be slaves and then they looked at themselves and
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.000]  said we're hypocrites we just fought to not be slaves to england and we have slaves we're hypocrites
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.880]  not a ribbit thomas jefferson row but it was the thought that counted that led to what's happened
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.560]  now and the whole system opposes that renaissance idea coming to full bloom a prohuman
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:39.960]  free choice dynamic trailblazing adventure the opposite of the nanny state the universe is waiting
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:47.560]  for us and i love future progeny that don't even exist yet i guarantee if i could meet my great
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.800]  great granddaughter a great great grandson that's my goal is that they'd be able to exist
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:02.200]  not in some utopia but in the true utopia of imperfection and of the challenges of the universe
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.920]  and discovery the true utopia of the fact that there is no utopia
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:15.560]  i love them i know my ancestors loved me before i was ever born they had a sense of destiny and
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:21.880]  living on and i'm not going to let them down my ancestors i love them i feel them i have the wisdom
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.480]  god gave us our ancestors and god gave us the genetic link to them
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:37.560]  so you need to use the tools god gave you and realize that this is the great contest the great
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:44.280]  the great movement to try to harness humanity try to make us slaves and mount our head on the
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.720]  wall by these ugly psychopaths that tell us we're obsolete we're on the march the empires on the
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:30:00.280]  world giant human sacrifice was up no we're not radio network no we're not
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.840]  antifederalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would become a monster

[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.360]  hillary clinton to the bush family my sister-in-law when you are subverting the power of government
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.680]  that that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy what do you think of edwards
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.600]  i think he's a traitor obama is the one that kills the us troops of the russians bomb any of them
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.400]  obama is the one to put him in harm's way obama is the one using him as human shields it is the
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.520]  most corrupt degenerate criminal government in american history i'm here to warn people you
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:25.560]  keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game we got people that have taken your asses out in
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.320]  this building right now we're armed with the teeth and we're not scared you got that you sons of
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:35.400]  bitches in 2012 your agency was saying quote the salafists the muslim brotherhood and al-qaeda in
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:41.800]  a rock are the major forces driving the insurgents in syria in 2012 the us was helping coordinate
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.720]  arms transfers to those same groups and why did you not stop that why didn't you come forward
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.840]  before what were you waiting for well for you inspector i needed you
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:36:03.080]  i suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected we're all part of it
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:19.400]  are we ready for it from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.640]  i understand that people don't want to hear they've been conquered by foreign multinational
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:31.080]  interests but we have been and have you ever wondered what it would look like to see the fall
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:40.680]  of the united states this is it i liken it to a 40-foot boa constrictor trying to swallow a
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.800]  small cow and it's trying to force us down its throat right now and we're still alive
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:55.640]  we can still kick and probably get free but we have to realize we're in the clutches of a big old
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:05.160]  mean snake so amazing videos on youtube of like 30 40-foot snakes eating alligators and stuff i mean
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:12.120]  just crazy and that's how i would like it to what's happening now you see snakes eating something
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.440]  where let's say the snakes a foot around and then they've got something in it that's three feet
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.000]  around and the snakes just lying there with this giant you know you know pig or whatever it's eaten
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.840]  inside of it and it's so greedy it thinks it can eat it and the video shows it later throwing it
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.120]  back up because it's too big and you're like how did that happen the snakes jaws come unhinged and
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:38.280]  out comes this big monstrosity that's what it's like watching paul ryan say i'd rather hillary
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:43.000]  get elected and i'm gonna try to take the money away from trump it's just total arrogance like who
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.160]  died and made you king another one of these so-called frat boys that thinks he's smarter and better
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:56.600]  looking than everybody all i see is a little boy a sellout of nobody a punk piece of crap
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.880]  but he's airing it and he's got the right suit and he's got the right haircut and he acts confident
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.800]  so a bunch of idiots out there following but not anymore who cares if the republican party leadership
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:16.280]  says they're not back in trump that's a good thing for trump and forget trump he's a litmus test
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:22.120]  for how awake people are very powerful article up on info wars dot com that just went live it's
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.520]  amazing in fact there's video guys i forgot to tell you during the break grab it for me this is so
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.880]  important this is what i'm finding when they tried to steal the election from trump in eight different
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:39.640]  states and gave it to ten crews a lot of democrats i know who are friends of mine who really like me
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:43.080]  you know because obviously i used to criticize bush because he was a bad guy as well it's just
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:49.960]  obama's like five times worse if that's possible he is and they're now going yeah i kind of like
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.880]  trump yeah i kind of get it he's not really racist he didn't really do anything yeah it is true we
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:59.240]  have unfair trade deals yeah i do want prosperity i do have family losing their jobs yeah i kind of
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.800]  get it because the republican establishment doesn't want him and around all these burning
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.200]  supporters yesterday that told me hey we like trump too we're just going with somebody different
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.000]  so america hasn't fully woken up but america to a certain extent gets it and all over the
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.040]  world nationalist anti-globalist candidates from the right and the left are being elected
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.600]  and the trump type guy is about to get elected in the philippines and you saw what happened in
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.440]  austria two weeks ago nationalist and they demonize it
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.920]  and they focus in you know in germany on a few skinheads or whatever i'm not worried about the
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:42.440]  skinheads folks i'm worried about five million jihadis being brought in who are already attacking
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:48.280]  and when they do attack i get to hear how i'm going to lose more liberty let me tell you something
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.080]  if i saw millions of skinheads running around saying they were going to take over then i'd be
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.440]  concerned but you know what skinheads don't try to make women wear hoods over their heads
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.640]  and sexually mutilate them and all i'm saying is i don't like skinheads but man i mean the muslim
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:10.840]  system the dominant muslim system is a freaking brainwashing cult of absolute hell the most
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.280]  illiberal anti-freedom based system the world has ever seen and i just want to say that the
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:23.240]  pseudo-intellectual leftists out there you're in a cult the fact that you're so allied with islam
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.000]  and i knew they were doing a clash of civilizations i was against these wars to take out more
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.480]  moderate people in the middle east i know the globalists have the middle east slated for
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:41.320]  absolute bedlam and deindustrialization and enslavement but to see the bold double cross of
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:51.800]  them flooding us with the poorest most backward wahhabist saudi arabian financed crazies
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.120]  use the globalist deal will flood all the nation states have everybody fighting with each other
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.680]  have no excellence with the multinationals above the law ruling over it because they're in competition
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.400]  with that i want to play a bunch of clips i said i'd get to them and i have it the toll free number
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:18.840]  to join us is 800-259-9231 i'll be taking calls the bottom of the next hour 800-259-9231
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.560]  long time callers first time callers whatever just please have a good phone
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:33.000]  800-259-9231 but really i've reached the surreal point in my life where
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.640]  i just can't even believe that stuff i was reading about 20 years ago
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.240]  in different university papers and different publications and in different congressional
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.960]  funding bills and you know they'd have tests back then they'd have like an article in the
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.040]  washington post going there are human animal chimeras in south korea hong kong a little
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:03.800]  closer to home in uh in costa rica and there are some labs here in the u.s but those are
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:10.760]  partially classified and they are part chimpanzee parts human and i go on here and i read well
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.640]  here's the washington post saying this and i get emails going you're crazy that's not happening
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.680]  i read the washington post now it's now admitted and i have hundreds of articles i haven't even
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:27.480]  gotten any of them have i because it's just it's the backdrop there are hundreds of open fields
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.840]  thousands of open fields just a few years ago it was hundreds thousands of open fields with
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:39.240]  cloned pigs cloned sheep and cloned cows running around and there are hundreds of open fields
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:48.760]  according to mit that have part human part animal cows part human part part porcine pigs
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:55.880]  and they grow humanoids in them now they're very secret about what's going on with the humanoids
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.720]  but you know they had a big article last week researchers in the uk have discovered how to
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:06.840]  grow embryos up larger in you know in artificial wombs oh it's such a breakthrough they make it
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:13.560]  all about that the ethics of how big to grow it and you know there's more rights for a bunny rabbit
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.800]  to not get tested on than there is humans but here's the trick they change the genetic of the human
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:22.760]  one percent they claim it has no human rights and they just date them and keep them after
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.920]  birth i mean you better know if they admit 20 years ago they got kameras and farms all over
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:36.440]  the place that's from the greek you know creatures that are multiple multi-animal or centaurs you
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:44.840]  know the body of a man on the top horse on the bottom men redundant now we don't need women
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.840]  either the guardians see and then they release systems that sterilize our normal human activity
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.960]  then we have to go have a test tube creature made and now the corporations just like they have
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.040]  terminator seeds where your seeds won't grow new plants the next year you got to buy from them
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.480]  each year well how about you can't have kids anymore you got to go to them and then they back
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.080]  door just like they do on your cell phone all the trojan horses in control and by the way they admit
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:17.080]  that they already have bioethics boards in the united states and england deciding what will be
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:23.160]  engineered and there and then you read these white papers this is mainstream news going it'll be
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:29.320]  wonderful knowing that normal humans are bigoted and hateful biologically because of our race
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:36.040]  ancestry we're going to have five gay daddies have a baby and it'll be five people oh that's
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:41.800]  never been done oh that sounds really good but it's okay because it's gay five gay men are gonna
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:51.240]  create the new egg and the sperm and this is this is what they admit they're already doing
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:57.800]  but notice they don't say three men two women they say five gay men oh how wonderful mad
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:07.960]  science five gay men well then why didn't you say so there's a total revolution coming and
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.840]  they're not going to give everybody access to life extension which they've already got by the way
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:19.240]  and so they're all on power mad trips with the technology they've stolen from humanity
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:26.360]  and i'm just trying to get people to understand you don't make a deal with this
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:37.640]  this is alien i don't know what's behind it it's the final equation the devil whatever you want to
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.760]  call it fall an angel i mean come on folks read the bible fall an angel coming here to destroy us
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:46.600]  here to take over here to overthrow god's creation and then they get control and they're doing exactly
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:56.280]  what the bible said they do some big stuff's going now and everything else is window dressing
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.360]  and then somebody like donald trump who just doesn't hate america he just he just
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.520]  doesn't have it out for the country's like why do we make bad deals with the communist chinese
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:18.280]  people it's bad deals we're not going to do that that's his crime and his crime is my crime it's your
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:27.240]  crime of caring about humanity they don't like confident successful alpha males that want to
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:33.560]  build a strong world and to enjoy prosperity these are twisted sniveling people that do not like you
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.840]  to do well their pleasure is running your life they're like a homeowners association this has
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:47.000]  happened before that gets so arrogant they start claiming they own your house because they found
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.240]  you know the wrong kind of grass growing in one area of your yard even though you didn't plan it
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.960]  there they had somebody come on take a photo of it and then they try to take your house and it

[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:23.880]  a nine so fine i've been on fire with sally feel gone fast with a girl named boat but somehow
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:35.320]  they just don't end up as mine it's a death defying life i lead i take my chances i die for living
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:45.880]  in the movies and tv but the hardest thing i ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:55.080]  guy while i'm bandaging my knee i might fall from a tall building i might pull a brand new car
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:02.920]  because i'm the unknown stuntman that made redford such a star you know i hope that folks that men

[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:32.040]  the time i wanted to with my children and now they're growing up really fast don't don't don't
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.000]  let them steal your reality don't let them steal the universe from you and and and let you think
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.720]  that mainstream media and culture is all there is that's all i'm saying is make a break with these
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:51.880]  people and realize that the globalists are very cynical bad people and they don't have good will
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:56.280]  i went and saw i walked out of it captain america
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:02.360]  and they put out the second one winter soldier that had a really good plot based on it was
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.680]  it was good film i'm not against superheroes and fantasy they're all art types
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.400]  but i walked out halfway through it i read the synopsis once i got home so i could comment on
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.760]  this exactly what i thought it was a bunch of world government propaganda and it's got false
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:27.560]  flags and things like that but they're not movies anymore they're two and a half hour
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:32.360]  globalist brainwashing scams where they'll have the stuff for africa the stuff for china and the
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.480]  stuff for europe the stuff for latin america where everybody gets their little part of the movie so
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.000]  it's an international bestseller worldwide but it's not about the money it's about selling that
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.640]  image and that idea i know everybody knows that but still people just sit there and watch this crap
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:54.040]  and they make it unwatchable if it's going to be propaganda at least make it watchable
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.920]  but it's so dumb down it's so dumb down i just go read the synopsis because it's just it's it's
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:06.440]  horrible it's like the fast and furious movies you know the first few were okay it was more just
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.960]  hot rods racing each other by the end it was like cartoons guys driving cars five miles down mountains
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.720]  running into four foot tall boulders just total fantasy land mario brothers is more real
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:26.360]  and people believe this stuff because the globalists are using psych warfare to overthrow reality
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.280]  so that when they start doing really bad stuff people are already desensitized to it
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.960]  and accept it and i know you know that but let's go to john carrey i mentioned this the last couple
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:39.800]  hours never got to it here he is at a commencement speech taking quotes swipe at trump saying get
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:45.560]  ready for a borderless world he looks like somebody from the adams family he's got a rubber face
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.680]  he's a lying criminal that backed isis and al-qaeda and then he says we've got to have
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:56.040]  open borders but but checkpoints for citizens internally when they say open borders they
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:01.320]  mean world government running over your sovereignty because these traders have transferred power to
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:07.640]  themselves offshore let's play the club any of you were in elementary school when you learned
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:15.640]  the toughest lesson of all on 9 11 there are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:21.800]  tens of thousand miles away who are determined to take their own lives while they target others
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:26.120]  so i think that everything that we've lived and learned tells us that we will never come out on
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:34.120]  top if we accept advice from soundbite salesman and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:38.440]  country on earth can remain great we'll be back with the rest of clip where he says get rid of the
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.800]  borders but this is the carnival barker these are the people that lie these are the known quantities
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:51.800]  the frogs flicks his tongue like a snake the whole time uh yeah first of all i want to say

[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:58.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:08.360]  you
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:26.760]  you
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:35.800]  running on the highway going to the show going to the show
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:01:02.600]  I'm here to tell you, it's harder than it looks.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:12.600]  I'll tell you one thing, all the adversity I've gone through over the years made me who I am and that's why they want a nanny state.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.600]  That's why they want you coddled and soft and stupid.
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:22.600]  When I was growing up reading Nietzsche, I started reading him when I was about 12.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  I really thought, really, that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:30.600]  As I get older, I realize that that is absolutely true.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:36.600]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  And the things I've learned about media and my 21 years on air is just mind blowing.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:48.600]  We're going to go to break the moment, come back and go to Peter and Darren and Bill and Parker and Anthony and all the big news.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.600]  I went to the carry clip late so I got cut off by the break there.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.600]  Those are satellites so I can't really skip breaks at the end of the hour.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  I'm just saying, hey, we don't have borders and then making fun of Donald Trump and flicking his tongue and calling him a carnival showbarker.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:13.600]  You've got these criminal mummies up here that he's been backing ISIS, backing Al Qaeda with John McCain and Obama.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:16.600]  It's all come out Benghazi, you name it.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:23.600]  And he says that we learned on 9-11, we're not safe, so why even have borders?
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  But when I flew in from Mexico last year and I had bought my father a $1,800 watch for his birthday that was coming up.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:42.600]  I didn't buy it in Mexico because you could get a little bit cheaper there.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.600]  We're trying to get around the duty or whatever.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:47.600]  I never have time to shop, so I'm on vacation for five days.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:56.600]  I go to the shops, oh, there's a nice watch, I'll get my dad a watch, a little dive watch, a tag.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:04.600]  And they sit there and put me in a database when I'm buying and I think it's weird and then I'm going through the thing into customs.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.600]  And I'd put on there $2,000 or whatever as I bought some other stuff.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.600]  And then one of them goes, did you buy a watch?
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  And I said, yeah, yeah, well, how much was it?
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.600]  I don't know, it's in that bag.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.600]  She goes, uh-huh, you're going back here to get basically searched.
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  And I'd even put it on there, but it was just an excuse to mess with me.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.600]  Everything is totally, and I went and looked it up.
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600]  Sure enough, they got a database back and forth.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.600]  Everything is totally tracked.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.600]  These countries are all working together.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:31.600]  The corporations are laundering the drug money.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.600]  They're involved in every crime you can imagine.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  And then they sit there and micromanage.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  I was flying out to Vegas a few years ago to be on Jesse Ventura's TV show.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  They were shooting it there.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:45.600]  He's the chief of the shooting in LA.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.600]  There was a rocket base outside there we were going to cover.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.600]  So that was the main reason, but I'm there.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  And there's a guy on the plane who just had his 20 silver coins taken by the TSA.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.600]  And then sure enough, I didn't even know it,
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:07.600]  but I Googled it when we're on the plane about to take off.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.600]  And it was all over the country.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.600]  They were taking people's coins.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.600]  And by the way, he was going to a silver and gold convention.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.600]  He was going to sell his coins to have money to then, you know,
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.600]  go do whatever he was going to engage in.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.600]  And it's just, wow, that's such a free country.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:32.600]  You can't fly with 20 silver coins.
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.600]  And then other people start talking on the plane about stuff they had taken.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.600]  It's just all part of training us that we're prisoners.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.600]  And I'm going to remember there's been so many of those cases.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.600]  It's just we're treated like slaves.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  We have no rights.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.600]  But oh, we're going to bring in unlimited Muslims from war-torn areas,
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:51.600]  cover up the actual numbers,
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:53.600]  and then we're going to comply with their culture.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.600]  That's how much these people hate the West.
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:22.600]  They're out to get us.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.600]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:28.600]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.600]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.600]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:37.600]  should not be highly rated.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.600]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny,
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.600]  has declared that she has a right not only to tax,
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.600]  but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.600]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery,
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:50.600]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:52.600]  Even the expression is impious,
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:56.600]  for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:25.600]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:30.600]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:32.600]  we use decades old scientific research
[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:35.600]  to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:38.600]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:42.600]  that uses our proprietary Spike Jirex herbal processing technique.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:46.600]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research,
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:49.600]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:52.600]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing,
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:58.600]  visit infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:26.600]  20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.600]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:30.600]  Read about it, find out why.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.600]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise,
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:36.600]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:38.600]  that will blow your socks off.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.600]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:42.600]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.600]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.600]  got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:53.600]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com,
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:58.600]  or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:09.600]  You're not going to have an AI computer
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.600]  come up with something as beautiful as that guitar,
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.600]  that Spanish guitar, are you?
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:20.600]  No, humanity's just begun our climb to the stars.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:23.600]  He aligns himself with the truth,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:48.600]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:50.600]  I just love humanity.
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:59.600]  I hate seeing us play it off against each other.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  This is, of course, from the soundtrack to the Big Lebowski.
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:08.600]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls,
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:10.600]  and then I do want to go through a bunch of news.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:15.600]  We have Leigh Ann McAdoo coming in here to talk about Facebook censorship.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:20.600]  Facebook admittedly censors they want to keep it secret.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  There's this false argument, well, that's their corporate platform.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.600]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.600]  They've had mainstream media running around what's left of it,
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.600]  you know, in the last few months, saying,
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  hey, you own Facebook, censor more.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:37.600]  Just don't allow Trump people or pro-gun people on their period.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.600]  But see, they want to do it stealthily.
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.600]  They want to advertise it's open.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.600]  They want everybody's data.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.600]  They want you to be there,
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.600]  they want other platforms building those.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:51.600]  They just want to have you there so they can control you.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.600]  People say, well, then why are you on Facebook or Twitter?
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:59.600]  Well, it's simple, because that's where the fight is,
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  because they don't want me there.
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.600]  I'm there to expose them on their own platform.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:07.600]  They don't count on us being bold.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:09.600]  They don't count on us being aggressive.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  They don't count on us taking action.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.600]  These people are easily defeated.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove,
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.600]  because I snuck into some military training operations
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.600]  and been covered by the British media,
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  and John Ronson, who wrote the book,
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.600]  Manus Derek Goats, and them, and a bunch of other big hit Hollywood movies.
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:30.600]  We wrote books that were made into films.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  And he was covering Waco for a TV show he's doing for,
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.600]  it was BBC, and he said,
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:36.600]  have you heard of Bohemian Grove?
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:37.600]  They're these weird rituals.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:44.600]  And this is like 1998, like a year and a half before I even infiltrated.
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.600]  And I said, yeah, I heard all that and skull and bones,
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:47.600]  but I said, I don't go there.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.600]  I just cover, you know, Second Amendment,
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  the Federal Reserve's private and stuff like that,
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.600]  and Waco is wrong, and, you know,
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  I'm just a constitutionalist.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.600]  He's like, listen, I got an insider.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.600]  I can't sneak in there because of liability.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:00.600]  Our insurance won't cover it.
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.600]  You have snuck into military bases and things,
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  and you've, you've, you know, done this before,
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.600]  and we're going to pay you to go in.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  It's only four days.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:13.600]  We'll get you out there.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:14.600]  You'll meet with our insider, all the rest of it.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.600]  And I said, sure, I'll do it.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:17.600]  A year passes.
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:18.600]  He calls up.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.600]  He goes, we're ready on six months.
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  You're ready to go.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:21.600]  So six months passes.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  And we fly out there.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:23.600]  We do it.
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:24.600]  I go in.
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  Dozens of people have gone in from CBS News and People Magazine,
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:33.600]  and you name it, all got arrested, all got stopped.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:41.600]  But I prayed before I went in that God give me the strength
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  to get in and to be undetected and to get it all.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:45.600]  And I went in.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.600]  I rode in on the bus.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.600]  The parking lot went to, got questioned by the Secret Service
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.600]  three times.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.600]  The Sheriff's deputies once successfully, you know,
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.600]  talk to them, knew enough about the internal passwords
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:03.600]  and things to get in and get the footage of them engaging
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.600]  in a satanic ritual.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.600]  And I'm not bragging that I was successful doing that,
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.600]  but I've always been successful.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:20.600]  All the other reporters were so arrogant that they would march
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:22.600]  into the different camps and begin basically conducting
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  interviews with people and asking them questions.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  So, of course, they would all go, wait one moment,
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.600]  and then they'd get the police.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:33.600]  That's what I mean about the establishment media.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.600]  They're all so arrogant and so insecure, and they overcompensate
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.600]  that they all just stick out like sore thumbs.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.600]  They just can't get anything done.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.600]  They're losers.
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  But I'm here to tell you, when we take action against these people,
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.600]  they're paper tigers.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:51.600]  They're straw dogs.
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:52.600]  They're not real.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.600]  It's all bravado.
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  And that's why they've sought to dumb everybody down.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.600]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, but this is the reality.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.600]  Let me hit some headlines and I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  Roger Stone, Ryan and Priebus planning to extort Trump at RNC
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  may even try to steal the nomination.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:15.600]  That is back on by these two crazy men, the Speaker of the House
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.600]  and then his little buddy, Priebus.
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.600]  I mean, Priebus looks like a bad guy from a movie.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  Just another arrogant.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  What is it about weak men that have some intellect
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  and know how to scheme that they think they're smarter than everybody?
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.600]  I just, there's a softness to them.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.600]  There's a glenbeck softness continuing.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.600]  Donald Trump won't rule out effort to remove Paul Ryan as convention chairman.
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  Absolutely.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.600]  Punish him.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:42.600]  Run him into the ground.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:44.600]  You've already defeated them, Trump, with grassroots movements.
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.600]  They're trying to openly say you wouldn't get it regardless.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  That failed.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:48.600]  They had to back off.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  Now they're steaming again.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  Run them over again.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.600]  Don't give these dogs quarter.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:54.600]  They don't give us quarter.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:56.600]  They're dishonorable, dishonest.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.600]  Jacobins, all of them.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  They are Jacobins.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.600]  They are Jacobins.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  Jacobin of old, Jacobin of today,
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.600]  Jacobin of the future falls.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:16.600]  So sick of them.
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:20.600]  Trump slams Hillary Clinton as nasty mean enabler of husband's affairs
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:22.600]  and sexual improprieties.
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:23.600]  Absolutely.
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:24.600]  He's going there.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.600]  Donald Trump calls Hillary Clinton nasty mean enabler.
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:32.600]  Donald Trump enabler in sexual attacks.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:34.600]  Does it have to be unified?
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:38.600]  Defiant Trump says he can win without backing of Republican leaders
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:41.600]  and says party doesn't need to show United support.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:44.600]  The people that have hijacked the party and are running it with the globalist
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  are the enemy occupiers.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  We're going to go to that club of him saying
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  doesn't need to be unified here in just a moment.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.600]  In fact, let's go ahead and go to that club now.
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.600]  Does it have to be unified?
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:57.600]  I'm very different than everybody else.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  Perhaps it's ever run for office.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:01.600]  I actually don't think so.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:02.600]  I think that...
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.600]  It doesn't have to be unified.
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.600]  No, I don't think so.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  I think it would be better if it were unified.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.600]  I think it would be, there would be something good about it,
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.600]  but I don't think it actually has to be unified in the tradition.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:14.600]  Because I think I'm going to go out and I'm going to get
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:16.600]  millions of people from the Democrats.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:19.600]  I'm going to get Bernie because they like me on trade.
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:21.600]  I have to stay true to my principles also.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:23.600]  And I'm a conservative, but don't forget,
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  this is called the Republican Party.
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:26.600]  It's not called the conservative party.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:27.600]  You know, there are conservative parties.
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  This is called the Republican Party.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:32.600]  Yeah, and the people that claim they're the conservatives,
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:36.600]  Paul Ryan and people, it's all just fiction.
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  It's all fiction.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.600]  They'd rather Hillary.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  They've said that.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  I mean, he should resign as the speaker.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.600]  There should be a recall movement now,
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  and there is with Sarah Palin.
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:49.600]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and sit back
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:53.600]  while they gut the Republican, bring in world tyranny.
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:56.600]  When the people we know running the show are out to get us,
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  I mean, I'm not going to do it.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.600]  I want to go to Peter here in just a moment.
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.600]  Then we'll go to Bill and Parker and Anthony and Darren and others.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.600]  Peter, thank you for holding.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:05.600]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.600]  I've covered a lot so far.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.600]  What did you want to chime in on today?
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  Alex, good afternoon.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:12.600]  I'm calling from Florida.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:17.600]  I'd like to ask you, why do people contribute to the Republican Party
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.600]  if they're voting for Trump?
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.600]  Nobody's saying a word about this.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.600]  I don't understand why Stone isn't saying anything.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.600]  I don't understand why you aren't saying anything.
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:29.600]  Withdraw your contributions to the Republican Party.
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:30.600]  Here's the problem.
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:31.600]  I totally agree with you.
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:32.600]  No, no, I totally.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.600]  This could send all the minutia,
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.600]  but the party in a general election gets all the funds.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:41.600]  It has to go through that once you get to that point,
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.600]  once you leave the primaries.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.600]  Okay, so they've set the rules like that.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.600]  That's why the presumptive nominee and then the nominee becomes the head of it
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:50.600]  and then it controls it.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:52.600]  They're saying, no, you're not.
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.600]  So that's the issue.
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:55.600]  We need to fight and not let them be in control of it.
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:58.600]  The way the election law is written,
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.600]  it has to go through them or they indict you.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:04.600]  I mean, look what they did to Dinesh to Sousa.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  So do you see what I'm saying?
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:07.600]  Yeah, I understand that,
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:11.600]  but the Republican Party's been subverted by Karl Rove, Priebus.
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:12.600]  Absolutely.
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:13.600]  So listen, I hear you, brother.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:14.600]  So what do we do?
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:18.600]  We call for Paul Ryan to not just be removed as the chairman of the Republican Party.
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  He needs to be removed from the speakership.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.600]  They knew this was coming and they got rid of Boehner
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:26.600]  because he was so reviled and hated he couldn't lead this.
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:28.600]  They put Pretty Boy up there.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:29.600]  And I agree with you.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.600]  So we need to move against Paul Ryan now.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  What do you think?
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.600]  Ryan is up for reelection in November in his home district.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:41.600]  I mean, if we take him out there and support his competitor,
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:43.600]  we stand a better chance.
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.600]  No, that's it.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.600]  So the way we recall him is everybody gets behind his competitor.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:48.600]  And Sarah Palin's coming in.
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:49.600]  God bless her.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:52.600]  And so just folks, if you're angry, this is war.
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:54.600]  This is political war.
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:55.600]  And we need to put pressure.
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.600]  I agree with you.
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:58.600]  That's what Stone was saying.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.600]  We need to put pressure on them now.
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:03.600]  And Trump is, he's not going to let them make a deal
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.600]  where they maintain control of the RNC.
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:10.600]  He takes control of the RNC as the nominee.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:11.600]  Geez.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:14.600]  But, you know, everybody, nobody's saying anything
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:16.600]  about withdrawing the contributions.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:17.600]  I mean, Stone's not saying anything.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:18.600]  No, I hear you.
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:19.600]  I mean, I get the leverage.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.600]  You need to tell Ryan.
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:21.600]  No, that's your leverage.
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:23.600]  You tell Paul Ryan and you tell all of them.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.600]  You tell the media, because Ryan already knows.
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:26.600]  He'll ignore you.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.600]  We're not going to give donations if you don't make Trump
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:30.600]  the head of the RNC.
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:32.600]  So you need to step down.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:34.600]  You say you're for Hillary over him.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:36.600]  You're disqualified on its face.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:38.600]  It'd be like if you were the football coach of a team
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:40.600]  and you said, you know, I don't like our team now.
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:42.600]  I want the other team to win this, this game.
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:45.600]  You, what they would say, step down, resign.
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.600]  You piece of crap.
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:49.600]  I put a tweet out earlier saying Paul Ryan should resign
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.600]  a speaker of the house, resign as the head of the RNC,
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:54.600]  and he should go be the head of Hillary's campaign.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:56.600]  And that's not tongue-in-cheek.
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:58.600]  How do they insult our intelligence?
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:00.600]  And I get your anger, Peter.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.600]  They insult our intelligence and they tell us that
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:06.600]  we support Hillary over him and we're going to run the party.
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.600]  No, no, you have disqualified yourself.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:11.600]  I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:12.600]  Exactly.
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:13.600]  I do agree with it.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.600]  100%.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:16.600]  What's your gut tell you about Trump?
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:18.600]  I mean, he's sweeping with Democrats everywhere.
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.600]  They're trying to spin the books and the polls,
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.600]  but the numbers really show Trump is going to beat Hillary
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:23.600]  in the landslide.
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:26.600]  I just pray to God they don't put a bullet in him.
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.600]  I get the same feeling with Donald Trump
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:31.600]  as I did with Ronald Reagan in 1980.
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:32.600]  I wasn't able to vote in 1980.
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:33.600]  I was too young.
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.600]  I voted for Reagan in 84.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.600]  I get the same feeling from Donald Trump as I did
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.600]  with Ronald Reagan.
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:42.600]  He's going to make this country great again.
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:45.600]  I'm going to be able to feel secure in my own country.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:47.600]  Just having a president that did not forget us
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.600]  is going to fix everything.
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:52.600]  These globalists have hijacked us through the enemy, folks.
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:53.600]  Donald Trump knows it.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:54.600]  Great points, Peter.
[02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:55.600]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:24.600]  Stay with us.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:27.600]  Brought to you by The Conservative Investor.
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:56.600]  That returns not indicative of future results.
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.600]  This is it.
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.600]  For the first time ever on this station,
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:05.600]  U.S. government gold offered at cost for only $139 each.
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.600]  With Wall Street suffering its worst start
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:09.600]  to a trading year in history,
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:12.600]  now is especially the time to be paying attention to gold.
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:13.600]  This first time ever,
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.600]  U.S. legal tender government gold
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:18.600]  offered at cost for only $139 each
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:20.600]  is from the U.S. money reserve.

[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:42.600]  Ask for a free 55-page gold buyer's book.
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.600]  Plus, get a free Walking Liberty half-dollar

[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:58.600]  1-866-944-GOLD
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.600]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:05.600]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.600]  There's no reason to be sick this cold and flu season
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:11.600]  with immune system support from supernatural silver.
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:14.600]  Supernatural silver can give your body the help it needs
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:16.600]  to fight off harmful pathogens
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:18.600]  without hurting beneficial gut flora
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.600]  and without leaving behind resistant bacteria.
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:23.600]  Antibiotics can damage good microflora
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:25.600]  and often leave behind bacteria
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:27.600]  which can cause problems later on.

[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:34.600]  Love the human spirit.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:36.600]  Love hearing birds sing.
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:39.600]  Love hearing the cow's howl.
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:49.600]  The prettiest voice I ever did here was that of my fellow species.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:51.600]  Anthony in Texas.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.600]  Parker in Florida, Darren, Greg, Bill, we're going to all of you.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  Let's talk to Parker in Florida.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.600]  You're on the year worldwide.
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  Hello, Bear, Clare and Parker, Pasco County here.
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:07.600]  How are you doing?
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  Good, brother, come on up.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.600]  You're on the year.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.600]  Go ahead.
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:13.600]  Through Cracker County, Pasco, you ever been down here?
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.600]  I've been in a lot of places in Florida.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:17.600]  I forget all the counties, brother.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:19.600]  Oh, I know, I know.
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.600]  I wanted to find out who's your favorite general?
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:23.600]  George Washington.
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  I never thought I heard you say it.
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  George Washington.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.600]  You must be a racist though, really.
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:31.600]  George Washington.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  Yeah, there's nothing intellectual anymore.
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  It's just a racist homophobe.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  I know it's a bunch of poor college students who have no future,
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:42.600]  no jobs, no nothing, running around desperate, mad,
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:45.600]  because Donald Trump didn't want the communist Chinese murderers
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:46.600]  to screw us over.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.600]  I know he's so horrible.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  Personally, I like Patton.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.600]  I'm probably more of a racist for that.
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:55.600]  But anyways, what do you know about this new transition
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  of power executive order?
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:00.600]  Well, I don't know which executive order you're talking about.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.600]  They've got hundreds of them on the books.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:04.600]  They reaffirm each new president that just establishes
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:06.600]  executive rule, dictatorship.
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:08.600]  It's forced labor camps.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:09.600]  It's all in there.
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.600]  They've never implemented all of it,
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:13.600]  but they think they can operate because they pass laws.
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  Like the Republican said, your vote doesn't count.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.600]  We passed a law.
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  Well, that dog doesn't hunt, as they say.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:22.600]  Parker.
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:24.600]  Oh, wow.
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:25.600]  God bless you.
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:26.600]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  Go ahead.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  Go ahead.
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:30.600]  It's all over YouTube, so I guess anyone who wants to figure out,
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:31.600]  maybe judge for yourself.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.600]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:34.600]  Well, you didn't give me a specific executive order,
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:35.600]  but there are a bunch of them doing that.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:36.600]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  Thank you, Parker.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:40.600]  Anthony in Texas wants to talk about Ivanka Trump,
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  which is always a nice subject to discuss.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:44.600]  Go ahead.
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:46.600]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:47.600]  You bet.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:50.600]  I want to pre-qualify myself first by saying that I've been
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.600]  listening to your show, both on your public access and radio,
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:56.600]  since you started here in Austin, probably haven't missed
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  more than a month of shows in the entire, whatever,
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:00.600]  17, 18 years on there.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.600]  Boy, you've seen it all.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.600]  Back when I'd be in the control room with a light on my face.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:05.600]  Yeah.
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:07.600]  I'd come home late at night and watch that,
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:09.600]  and I thought, well, here's somebody who knows what's going on.
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  I got into the Patriot movement.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  I'm a little bit older than you are in my 20s,
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:16.600]  and so before the internet, you had to go to meetings
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:18.600]  and pass out flyers and literature and things like that
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.600]  to find out anything about any of these.
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:22.600]  And, boy, aren't you vindicated?
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:24.600]  World government's now out in the open.
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:26.600]  Everything we warned about is now known.
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:28.600]  We've advanced the ball so far.
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:31.600]  That's why I say we're in good standing as pro-humans worldwide
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.600]  if we just press the matter and realize we are winning the war
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.600]  right now.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:37.600]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  And I couldn't agree more, and that's why I called to get on.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  I've never even attempted to call before I got on almost instantly,
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:44.600]  so I appreciate that.
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:45.600]  I guess that was...
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:46.600]  Appreciate you, brother.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:47.600]  Go ahead.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:49.600]  You know, I'd want to pre-qualify myself with that,
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:51.600]  and also I've been in the same business,
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:54.600]  basically, that Ed Group's been in for about 25 years as well,
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:59.600]  so I can kind of give the credence and the acknowledgement
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:01.600]  that the products that you sell,
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:04.600]  that are based on a lot of his products that I've used in my clinic,
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.600]  actually are the real deal,
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  and it's an important point because how people get toxic in this world
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:14.600]  via chemicals and all sorts of things,
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:16.600]  not only what they hear and see,
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  but what's in their body is very important to understand that,
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.600]  you know, it puts people in a trance,
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.600]  and it keeps them under-
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:23.600]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:24.600]  People are drugged up by design.
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:25.600]  That's the embedded plan.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:27.600]  Now, you want to talk about Ivanka Trump, though, I'm told.
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:29.600]  And I'm getting to that, but this is my point.
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  You know, it's almost like you're under mind control
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.600]  when you're that toxic.
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.600]  You really can't hear the truth.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:35.600]  My concern is this about Ivanka.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:37.600]  I've just read the book by Roger Stone
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:39.600]  and the other gentleman about the Clintons,
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  and I saw the family interview with the Trumps,
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  and Ivanka Trump, you know,
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  they asked her about her relationship with Chelsea Clinton,
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  and they're good friends, evidently.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:50.600]  You know, that's well-known in the world.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  And Chelsea Clinton knows, obviously,
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.600]  that she has not Bill Clinton's daughter,
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:56.600]  that she is Webb Hubble's daughter,
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:59.600]  and that the Clinton, so that the information,
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.600]  I think the collusion between people who are really wealthy
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:04.600]  has to be carefully watched,
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:08.600]  and I'm not saying that Ivanka is her dad's handler in any way.
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:13.600]  All I'm saying is that she has his ear very closely.
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:14.600]  No, I hear you.
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:17.600]  Look, some of the past Clinton connections are very troubling,
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:19.600]  and we're watching those very closely,
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:21.600]  just like the Ted Cruz connections to the Bushes.
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.600]  And if Trump starts going sideways on us, it's a big issue,
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.600]  but you're absolutely right.
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:30.600]  But if he had to operate in New York,
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:32.600]  Trump has played both sides.
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:34.600]  And if he is the double-crosser,
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:36.600]  he'll be the biggest Benedict Arnold in history,
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.600]  and he will destroy his name and dynasty forever.
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:43.600]  But if he was the guy to help turn America around
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.600]  and defeat globalism, he'll be the ultimate superhero,
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:30:14.600]  George Washington 2.0.
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:17.600]  In Hillary's response to using executive orders
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.600]  to take our guns,
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:22.600]  well, let the congregation say, amen.
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:25.600]  Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton says that gun control
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.600]  can finally be implemented
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:29.600]  now that Justice Scalia is dead.
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:32.600]  They believe the next time the court rules on gun control
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:35.600]  will make a definitive ruling.
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.600]  Well, here's a news flash for the Clintons.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:40.600]  America doesn't have a gun problem.
[02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:43.600]  America has a gang problem.
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.600]  And in gun-free zones like Chicago,
[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:49.600]  there's already been over 1,000 shootings this year.
[02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:50.600]  And guess what?
[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:54.600]  Not one of the shooters was a member of the NRA.
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:55.600]  Come and take it.
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:00.600]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:04.600]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:07.600]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:09.600]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.600]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:15.600]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:17.600]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:20.600]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:22.600]  But in the 21st century,
[02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:25.600]  there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:27.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water
[02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:30.600]  and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:34.600]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:38.600]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.

[02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:04.600]  I'll show you the Republic.
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:07.600]  From enemies, foreign, and domestic.

[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:13.600]  Clay and Maca do have a week or so of vacation.
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:16.600]  She's back from lovely Portugal.
[02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:18.600]  And we also have Joe Biggs,
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:21.600]  who's back from a wonderful weekend.
[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:24.600]  He's back from a wonderful weekend.
[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:28.600]  We also have Joe Biggs, who's back from a wonderful weekend
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:30.600]  with a social justice warrior trying to shut down
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:32.600]  free speech in Oregon.
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:33.600]  So he had a vacation.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.600]  That's your vacation, Biggs, by the way.
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.600]  We're going to be going back to your phone calls
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:40.600]  here in a little while for Darren and others
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:42.600]  that have been patiently holding.
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.600]  Manny and Alex and Bill and Greg, just briefly,
[02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:46.600]  because I want to cover two big topics with you guys
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:48.600]  here in just a second.
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  I was forced by the manufacturer, the producer,
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.600]  my Patriot supply. We sell their full spectrum of food,
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:55.600]  best out there, lowest price.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:56.600]  That's why they're our sponsor.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.600]  We could have 15 sponsors that I endorse,
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:00.600]  but I just choose to go with what I think is the best deal,
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:02.600]  what I buy for my family.
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:03.600]  And I've been stocking up.
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:05.600]  I'm getting more in here for the office,
[02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:06.600]  medical supplies, you name it,
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  hoping that things don't get as bad as it looked like they could.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.600]  But understanding the elite are buying swareable food,
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:12.600]  all the stuff's going on,
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:15.600]  now really is the time to get prepared with insurance you can eat
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.600]  with inflation and the rest of it.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:17.600]  A couple of years from now,
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:19.600]  just eat your investment.
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:22.600]  So this type of insurance which you 100% can use,
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:23.600]  another win-win-win.
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:25.600]  And the small profit we make off discounting it,
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.600]  funds our operation, not the profit's bad.
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:30.600]  I want to have the best price and sell tons of it.
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:31.600]  And that's actually been working.
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.600]  It's helping fund us to go to Bilderberg,
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:35.600]  to cover the RNC, DNC,
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.600]  try to hire a few more crew members.
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:39.600]  I mean, this is the win-win.
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:41.600]  So thank you for shopping within FullWareStore.com.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:43.600]  You're making it all possible.
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:45.600]  But I did talk to them this morning and I said,
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:46.600]  look, I twisted your arm.
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:48.600]  I extended it, you know, like a week.
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:50.600]  I promised I'd end it Sunday.
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:51.600]  We did.
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.600]  You've got 60 different packages or so.
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:56.600]  Can we just take the four best sellers
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:59.600]  and do it for another week at 40% off?
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:02.600]  And they said, yeah, it's, you know,
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:04.600]  you're the one that's not making really much money.
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:06.600]  I said, well, actually, look, I am,
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:08.600]  because we're absolutely dominating the market doing this.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:09.600]  People are shopping.
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.600]  They know this is a good deal.
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:13.600]  So for a limited time, get 40% off.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  This is 30 to 40.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:15.600]  Now, I'm going 40 with this.
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:17.600]  This is only four items, so it's 40.
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:19.600]  Off the retail price of our best selling
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:22.600]  InfoWare Select Storeable Food at FullWareStore.com.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:23.600]  We don't know how long we can continue this.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:25.600]  They think till this weekend.
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:27.600]  All InfoWare Select Foods have a shelf life of 25 years,
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:28.600]  made in the USA.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:30.600]  Food prices are going up around the world.
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:32.600]  And now is the best time to get started to prepare, I think.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:34.600]  Also, ending tonight, all of the preparedness items
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.600]  from G-Shock watches to optics to non-GMO early seeds
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:41.600]  to water filtration systems too.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.600]  Shortwave radios, it's all 10% off

[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.600]  That's strategic relocation of the book.
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:50.600]  Strategic relocation of the film.
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:51.600]  Hundreds of items.
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.600]  Privacy and security,
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:55.600]  blocket pocket type systems.
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:57.600]  That battery pack thing is amazing.
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:58.600]  Absolutely.
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:35:59.600]  We've got more of those in stocks.
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:01.600]  The best compact, highly tested battery,
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:03.600]  less than Amazon sells it for.
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.600]  Dozens of different plug-ins.
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:06.600]  Jump your car.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:07.600]  I've actually used one before.
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.600]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:10.600]  The miniaturization is taking place.
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:12.600]  All this stuff's 10% off are the lowest prices.
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:14.600]  Anthroplex is back in stock.
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:16.600]  SuperMail, of course, has been sold out.

[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:44.600]  at very low prices.
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:46.600]  So whether it's a book, a video,
[02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:49.600]  heirloom seeds, or a Hillary for President T-shirt,
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:52.600]  or all the nutraceuticals discounted 10%,
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:53.600]  it's going to end today.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.600]  That will end tonight at midnight.

[02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:58.600]  Okay.
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:00.600]  First off, Leanne McAdoo.
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:01.600]  Missed you in the last week.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:03.600]  Good to have you back here in Austin.
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:05.600]  Biggs, good to have you here, my friend.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:07.600]  I want to talk about just the general state of the world
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.600]  with you briefly.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:10.600]  We're going into these other two topics, censorship,
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:12.600]  and what's going on with Uber in Austin.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:14.600]  This is a microcosm of the rest of the world, obviously.
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  Now, both of you have been covering this.
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:18.600]  The Trump phenomenon, just briefly, Leanne,
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:21.600]  and then Joe Beggs, where would you say it is right now?
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:23.600]  Where's your evolution with Trump?
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:26.600]  What do you make of the story up on infowars.com?
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:29.600]  John Kerry, you know, saying,
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.600]  borderless world, world government.
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:33.600]  In the EU, they're saying if England tries to leave,
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.600]  it might start a war.
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:37.600]  I mean, it really shows how we're already captured
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.600]  under globalism, under these deals.
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:41.600]  And just the state of the world,
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.600]  where do you see all this going?
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:45.600]  Well, I mean, I'm kind of there with you,
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:49.600]  where I was really enjoying the Trump phenomenon
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:51.600]  and how he was kind of speaking out
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:54.600]  and separating himself from the rest of the establishment.
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:57.600]  So it'll be interesting to see what happens now
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.600]  that they're all deciding to align behind him.
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:04.600]  You know, just make sure he doesn't get compromised.
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:06.600]  So I think, you know, you're always bringing that up,
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:10.600]  that it's going to be really important that we hold him to the fire,
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:13.600]  you know, so that he doesn't sell out at this point,
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.600]  which is what we've seen politicians do
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:19.600]  when they make it, you know, you don't get this far.
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.600]  So...
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:24.600]  I agree that we got to watch for him to be compromised,
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:26.600]  just slowly wanting to make deals.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:28.600]  But at the same time, we already now have
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:30.600]  previous Dominion of Paul Ryan,
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  saying they're just going to keep the RNC money
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.600]  and not even give it to Trump because they want Hillary in.
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:36.600]  How could you be the head of the Republican Party and the RNC
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.600]  and say, we're not going to let Trump become the head,
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:41.600]  what are you supposed to do by law?
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:42.600]  We want Hillary to win.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:44.600]  I mean, these guys are really arrogant.
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.600]  What do they think of their constituents?
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:48.600]  I mean, when you go to these events,
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:51.600]  there are people driving from Canada, from Alaska.
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:53.600]  I interviewed some guys from Alaska.
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:57.600]  They're making huge treks journeys to come to these Trump events.
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.600]  You don't see people going to Hillary Clinton events
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:02.600]  from five states away or another country
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.600]  to hear her talk because everyone knows she's corrupt garbage.
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:08.600]  But people are taking these long trips spending money,
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:10.600]  their savings to go and hear this man speak
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:12.600]  to get a chance to be in his presence
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.600]  because there is a giant movement
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:16.600]  sweeping across the country right now.
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:18.600]  And whether he ends up being good or not,
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:19.600]  he's pushing nationalism.
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:21.600]  He's saying things that scare the elite.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:23.600]  And the people involved are involved for the right reason,
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:26.600]  trying to promote freedom against globalism.
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:28.600]  So you can't lose by engaging.
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:29.600]  Right.
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:32.600]  The curtain has been pulled back with this election cycle.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:33.600]  And that's really exciting.
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:35.600]  You know, it's interesting, you know,
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:37.600]  the whole thing about the curtain being pulled back
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:40.600]  and people actually having the election process
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:41.600]  explained to him now
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:43.600]  because a lot of people didn't really know how things worked.
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:45.600]  It's interesting how you can see
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:47.600]  that Bernie's having a lot of this stuff stolen from him.
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:49.600]  But he doesn't say anything.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:52.600]  He's not coming out and complaining in a state.
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:53.600]  He's totally rigged.
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  Which it just doesn't.
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:55.600]  I don't get like,
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:57.600]  if you're really trying to be this popular guy out there
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:39:59.600]  and you really want to make a stand against Hillary Clinton
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:00.600]  and take her out,
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:02.600]  why don't you expose some of this stuff
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:03.600]  and come out and say something?
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:04.600]  Right.
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:06.600]  He has more people coming to his events.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.600]  He's just as popular as Trump
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:10.600]  on the other side of the spectrum.
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:11.600]  And yet he doesn't really,
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.600]  he's not shaking anything up.
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:16.600]  He's not putting any kind of fear whatsoever in her eyes.
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:17.600]  I mean, and he could do it.
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:18.600]  He could take it from her,
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:20.600]  but you just don't see him trying.
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:21.600]  Yeah.
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:22.600]  I totally agree.
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.600]  Very salient points.
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:25.600]  All I know is anybody's saying their board's crazy.
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:27.600]  This is such an exciting time to be alive.
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:31.600]  Let's shift gears first off into these two articles
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:33.600]  because it dovetails with what Leigh Ann wanted to cover.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:35.600]  And I'm glad she's going to be doing a special report
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.600]  on Mountain News tonight.
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:38.600]  Researchers say computer screens
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:40.600]  change how you think about what you read.
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:42.600]  And just consider the programming Washington Post.
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:44.600]  This is just the flavor of the news today.
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:45.600]  London Telegraph.
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:46.600]  Parents, smart phones,
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:48.600]  harming children's ability to hold conversations,
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:49.600]  say teachers.
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:51.600]  Well, yeah, all the numbers show it's brain damaging.
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:53.600]  That's why Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have them.
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  Gizmodo.
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:56.600]  I've got another one here.
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:57.600]  Former Facebook worker.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:59.600]  We routinely suppress conservative news.
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.600]  I've got another one right here.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:02.600]  Facebook.
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:03.600]  That's Gizmodo.
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:04.600]  This is Daily Caller.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:06.600]  Facebook made Black Lives Matter trend
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:08.600]  by inserting it into news feeds.
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.600]  Yes, it's White House run.
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:11.600]  The Hill Report.
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:13.600]  Facebook made in conservative topics from trending lists.
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:16.600]  You know, people over the last six months as we exposed this.
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  And it's always been going on, but it's getting worse.
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:21.600]  They'd say, you know, hey, it's their site.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  Yeah, but they have terms of service.
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:24.600]  We're not breaking those.
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:26.600]  They don't want to admit their censoring, but they are.
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:28.600]  And they're doing it more and more.
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:30.600]  So this really shows when they meet
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.600]  with the Communist Party Chiefs on how to quote censor.
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:34.600]  He keeps meeting with them.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:37.600]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb efforts.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.600]  I'm going into Facebook to say, hey, don't be dumb efforts
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:41.600]  and get involved.
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  But the good news is we've been hammering this.
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:45.600]  Others have been hammering this.
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:47.600]  Drudge has been hammering this.
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.600]  And so they're having to admit it.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:52.600]  And their own employees are saying, yes, we go in.
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:53.600]  Go back to Benghazi.
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.600]  Navy Shills has sent out a meme, you know, saying,
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.600]  you know, basically, you know, she stood down
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:00.600]  and we died showing four dead guys.
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:03.600]  And I remember we were trying to share that
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:06.600]  and they suspended us for a day and said this is not authorized.
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:09.600]  I mean, this is a big deal like the Soviet Union
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:10.600]  if we let this happen.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:11.600]  Leigh Ann.
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:12.600]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.600]  They're trying to put themselves as this non-bias news aggregator,
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:20.600]  but they are specifically choosing what you're allowed to see
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:23.600]  and suppressing any conservative viewpoints
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:27.600]  or injecting topics that they say, well, this needs to go viral.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:28.600]  So let's make this.
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:32.600]  And then they put it out there as if it's just this, you know,
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.600]  natural thing that's happening.
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  People are all excited about this, talking about it.
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.600]  Meanwhile, they're the ones that force Black Lives Matter.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:40.600]  It's like mainstream.
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:41.600]  It's like a daily thing.
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:42.600]  I get people writing me all the time.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:44.600]  We can't see the article you share.
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:45.600]  We can't see the info article.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:46.600]  Why can't we get it?
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:47.600]  When I click on the video, it won't play.
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:49.600]  I can't see Alex's Facebook mention.
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  You know, they are.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:53.600]  And then the engineers come out.
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:56.600]  I mean, six months ago, I started to point out this was happening.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.600]  They shut up conspiracy theorists.
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:42:59.600]  Now the engineers are going public.
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:02.600]  They get black bolted for this going, no, we're ordered to do this.
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:07.600]  There's algorithms and people need to get upset about it.
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:09.600]  And listen, folks, don't get discourage.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:12.600]  It's because we're having an effect when you see a drudge link
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:16.600]  or an info wars link or a world that daily or whatever the case may be.
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:18.600]  And you can't find it.
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:22.600]  Go to info wars to find it to put it out on your own site.
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:24.600]  You can also culture jam.
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:26.600]  And I've done tests to see what works and maybe say, hey,
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:30.600]  Molly Cyrus talked about, you know, her new boyfriend and that would be a link to us.
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:31.600]  Yeah.
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:33.600]  You know, take our stuff, change the headline, sabotage the enemy.
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:34.600]  That's what I have to do.
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:37.600]  I have to put like Tom Brady or something like that or something about football
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:39.600]  and all of a sudden it will get like 20,000 shares.
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:44.600]  But if I put, you know, you know, target bathroom policy changed
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:48.600]  to allow men into women's restrooms, all of a sudden it's like 10 shares,
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:49.600]  20 likes.
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:52.600]  But if I put Tom Brady in there for the Patriots or something like that
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:55.600]  or Obama eats with, you know, Kanye West.
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.600]  It's not because that's popular.
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:59.600]  They admit Kanye West, Black Lives Matter, BeyoncÃ©.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:00.600]  That's the Super Bowl.
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:01.600]  That's the CIA.
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:02.600]  That's Viacom.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:03.600]  That's Fox.
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:06.600]  Shane go out and attack the police.
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:09.600]  Well, plus two with all the people are already self censoring
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:11.600]  because they know how much we're being surveilled.
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:13.600]  So they already are beginning to self censor.
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:16.600]  So they don't want to share those topics that are really controversial.
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  Well, that's it.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.600]  They want to talk about football and whatever.
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:20.600]  Exactly.
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:23.600]  They said we're going to have a new social rating in China where if you've
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:26.600]  behaved yourself, you're allowed to have high ratings on the web and buy and sell.
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:27.600]  Right.
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.600]  This is the Mark of the Beast.
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:29.600]  Lee Ann, go ahead.
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:33.600]  And then you see that they, they actually, the Facebook employees put out this
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:40.600]  internal poll and it specifically says what responsibility does Facebook have
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:43.600]  to help prevent President Trump in 2017?
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:46.600]  I mean, so these are, this is an internal poll that they're asking with their
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:47.600]  employees.
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.600]  And they only put the poll out to make them feel like, to make them feel like
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:54.600]  they're involved in the process when the algorithms are already in place.
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:55.600]  Right.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:58.600]  I mean, so this just lets you see how much Facebook could be like one social
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:00.600]  network that could have a.
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  And look at Zuckerberg.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:04.600]  He's a CIA front on record from Harvard.
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.600]  Praying on everyone is a little bastard predator who thinks he's smart.
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:10.600]  He's an arrogant, anti-human prick.
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.600]  He doesn't want walls, but he's got a wall around his place.
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:13.600]  He doesn't want arms.
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:16.600]  He doesn't want you to have guns, but he's got like a 10 man team that goes
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:18.600]  jogging with them every day strap.
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:20.600]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:21.600]  He's a son of a...
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:22.600]  He's a frickin...
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.600]  And there's another story out about how regulators in Washington are now talking
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:29.600]  again like they do every year about increasing and tightening the rules on the
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:33.600]  political speech on the web because they say the new media is becoming too powerful,
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:34.600]  too influential.
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:35.600]  Yeah.
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:36.600]  They're not talking about Facebook though.
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:38.600]  And they've already said they're going to just take your election from you.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:39.600]  Oh, Bernie's winning.
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:40.600]  Just give it to Hillary.
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:41.600]  Oh, Trump's winning.
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:42.600]  Just give it to whoever.
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:44.600]  But notice it didn't sell with the Trump movement because Trump would come out
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:45.600]  and say it was a fraud.
[02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:46.600]  Right.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  You've got to go the next level and say this is baloney.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.600]  You've got to call them instead of just mainstream media said it must be true.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:54.600]  Again, it's a facade, folks.
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:56.600]  Well, they're so confused right now.
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.600]  They were so able to sideline Ron Paul, Rand Paul, all these guys and make them seem
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:03.600]  kooky for being constitutionalists.
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:06.600]  But they haven't been able to do it with Trump and he's been able to bust through
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:08.600]  these, you know, walls and everything they've ever done.
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:10.600]  The Liberty movement was already crashing.
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:11.600]  Trump just grabbed it.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:12.600]  Right.
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.600]  And he's had the most people ever vote for him in the Republican Party.
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:20.000]  Hillary Clinton in 2012 had more people vote for her then compared to now.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.600]  So how was she even relevant in any kind of way?
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:24.160]  Her numbers are so far down.
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:26.600]  Did you see the article that is on infowars.com?
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:28.400]  It should go viral.
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:33.100]  The kid Daniels did with CNN admitting because they're live and they go to like a Democrat
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:35.600]  event and they can't, they're all for Trump.
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:36.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:37.600]  And they're like, no.
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:39.600]  And then, oh, well, cut to commercial.
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:40.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:41.600]  Again, folks.
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:42.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.600]  Are they trying to put down the person that when they interviewed the one black guy that
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:50.100]  was at the Trump rally and they thought he was going to, you know, give them the point
[02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:52.600]  of view they were expecting and then they cut away.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:56.600]  Oh, well, obviously he doesn't represent all of the African Americans that are, you know,
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.600]  and that's a classic bait and switch where they say, don't go to the Tea Party.
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:01.600]  It's all racist.
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:05.200]  And then it's hard to get people who aren't quite white to go to it.
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:08.000]  It's the media saying it's white to make that happen.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.200]  The last thing they want us all to come together around basic freedom.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.200]  This is so diabolical.
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.200]  Right.
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:16.440]  And of course, we know Zuckerberg has political agenda.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.800]  And so even with this article that came out, he said, oh, well, we didn't suppress any
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:21.500]  stories that had to do with Facebook.
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:23.200]  We kind of left those alone.
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.320]  Meanwhile, we reported on this and this came out of Breitbart too last year where he says
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:32.760]  he didn't censor any content that was undermining the immigration agenda.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:36.000]  So they said, oh, we didn't mess with that where with which isn't true.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  They constantly walk us.
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  Yeah.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  They put out job reports, demonstrated, he told, he told Merkel, the German chancellor,
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.600]  he was going to censor three months ago.
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:45.600]  Exactly.
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:50.280]  And so they're trying to paint themselves as this unbiased place, but they are really
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:51.600]  controlling the narrative.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:52.600]  Sure.
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:58.080]  There's a kill Donald Trump page up on Facebook that won't take down or organize how to murder
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.080]  it.
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:00.080]  Yeah.
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:02.600]  But if I guarantee you, if I organize that, the Secret Service would rightfully be here
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:03.600]  in hours.
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:06.000]  If you put up a thing that said beat Bernie or whatever like that, like beat them and
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.520]  have pictures of like people clubbing seals or whatever like that, that would get taken
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:10.520]  down.
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:12.920]  Like you said, Secret Service would show up and like, what did you really mean by that?
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:14.440]  Are you trying to harm this person?
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:18.640]  But you don't care that people are openly rapping and making videos about killing Donald
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:19.640]  Trump, waving guns.
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.400]  There's a guy on Facebook that just put out a video the other day where he's got two guns.
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:26.240]  He's looking in the cameras like, I'm going to kill you, MF, or if I ever see you, I'm
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:27.240]  going to kill your wife.
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:28.240]  I'm going to kill your kids.
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.240]  And that could be on Facebook.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:34.440]  But if I post a picture and like say, for instance, if I were to take a Mossberg 500 and shoot
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:38.040]  a Clinton book or whatever like that with it, they would take that as something completely
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:39.040]  the wrong way.
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:40.040]  Oh man.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:41.040]  I tell you.
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:43.040]  These kids are here and threatened to kill a presidential candidate.
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  Right.
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:47.840]  Well, what happens is they've got actuaries set up and in algorithms, when something starts
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.040]  going viral, they just kill it.
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:50.040]  Yeah.
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:54.760]  And now they just don't let the videos from Facebook.
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:55.960]  They just don't let us share them.
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:56.960]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:59.600]  What's happening is I go in the videos and I go, they're censoring this to everybody
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:02.760]  else copies it to their channels and they don't already have algorithms there.
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:04.480]  And then it dominates.
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:05.480]  So right.
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:08.440]  And that's it is like, you have to call it out when you see it.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:12.640]  And you know, thankfully we have such great info warriors out there, they, you know,
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.640]  take action.
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:16.760]  Well, it shows they're losing the info or Zuckerberg and others help fund the Arab Spring
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:19.040]  to put radical Muslims and control the Middle East.
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  These are bad people.
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:21.040]  Right.
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:23.720]  Now, Lee, and I want to shift gears into this other subject.
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.120]  Lift and Uber all over the world.
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:27.600]  The different unions are trying to shut it down.
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:28.600]  The taxi cab unions.
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:29.600]  I'm all for it.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:34.160]  But then the weird part is, Uber says they want to have robot cars to get rid of humans
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:35.160]  next.
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.480]  So they're even more globalist tied into the Democrats.
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:39.040]  So it's all a bunch of infighting groups.
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:42.320]  But I mean, how about just individuals can go to an app and then if they want to be a
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:43.320]  contractor, do it.
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:46.280]  It's a, you know, person, but where I mean, who says I don't get in the car with a crazy
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.720]  taxi cab driver, you know, so, so, so a major fight going on, big tells us what's coming
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:51.720]  up.
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  You're going to be with us too.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:57.080]  Well, the thing is, is Travis County can earn anywhere from about $8.7 million and $9
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:00.000]  million a year on DWIs.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.640]  So you've got to think we've got about 2 million people.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.080]  Each DUI costs anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000 per case.
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:10.720]  You have to pay to the city in fees, court fees, all this stuff.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:11.720]  That's revenue.
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:12.720]  They're making.
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:13.720]  It's a revenue thing.
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:15.360]  They don't care about stopping, driving while intoxicated.
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  They want that money.
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:21.400]  And when they brought in these ride sharing apps like Lift and Uber, those numbers drastically
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:23.640]  dropped, you know, 17 to 25%.
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:27.360]  That's right, you could never get a taxi when you want one.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  They're so corrupt.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:29.360]  They're so smooth.
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:30.360]  They're so out of control.
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.200]  But I mean, I'll use, I hate to hear Uber's leaving because you go out to dinner and have
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  a couple glasses of wine.
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:36.200]  You get an Uber.
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  I use Lyft all the time.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:38.880]  I don't like Uber because of what you said earlier.
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:40.280]  So I don't use Uber at all.
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:41.280]  I use Lyft all the time.
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:42.880]  Let's talk about when we come back, what's happened?
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:43.880]  Yeah.
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:44.880]  Just tell folks what's happened.
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:49.560]  So what's happened right now is a prop one pass, which means that these ride sharing groups
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:53.840]  have to be fingerprinted, they have to have these background checks and all this stuff.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:55.800]  And that's another way for the cities to get money.
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:56.800]  Sure.
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:57.800]  And it's not their jurisdiction.
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:00.140]  And then we're going to take the percentage of their...
[02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:03.440]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.

[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:11.880]  It's funny when I was in Eugene it was like every 10th person in line or thousands of
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:16.200]  people waiting to see Trump at this convention center and it was like every 10th person there'd
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:20.440]  be like one killer for prison t-shirt or like a family like there was a couple, a married
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:25.120]  couple and their kid they all had the shirts on and outside of the events there were groups
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:29.080]  of people like they would like like form little cliques of Hillary for prison groups and I'm
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:32.280]  walking around filming you know and I can see Darren McBrain off of the side and he's
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:35.560]  interviewing somebody and there's like 10 people right here with a hiller for prison
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:39.320]  t-shirt on and then like you know 100 yards down the road there's another group of like
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:42.760]  three or four and they're all sitting there talking they don't know what I'm proud of.
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:46.160]  I'm proud of in almost all the videos even ones we don't shoot but the Breitbart shoots
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:47.160]  and others do.
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:48.160]  They're everywhere.
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:51.560]  It's our listeners with a you know mass murderers degree gun control shirt works I designed
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:57.880]  that shirt like 18-19 years ago and we still sell it it says peasants love disarmed or
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:03.160]  our politicians love disarmed peasantsinfowords.com on the back and it's our guys and gals they're
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:06.560]  actually in everybody's faces not hatefully going you're an idiot the globalist or enslaving
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.840]  you know blah blah blah it's our people that have the courage because the other Trump folks
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:13.400]  are nice they kind of hang back yeah it's our people that go into the melee I mean I'm
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  really proud of the info words.
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.240]  I mean you can only fight with facts.
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:21.280]  But you can see them when they walk they have a different swagger to them you can see these
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.440]  guys wearing their info war shirts they got their head held high their posture straight
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.200]  their shoulders are out their chest is barreled and they're walking right through these lines
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:33.680]  of protestors like taking like badge of honor like when they're cussing at them screw Trump
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.200]  screw you you're a racist so like just marching through there you know the peacock as well
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:41.400]  as like called peacocking or whatever and they're just walking through there and they come
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:47.280]  out the other end they're like yeah absolutely now getting into Uber and Lyft I mean here
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:53.160]  it is it's running it's operating it's doing great it drives down DWIs massively and I
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:57.120]  mean as you just change the way everybody does everything but and now they're banning
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:58.120]  it.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.800]  It's it's 10,000 jobs lost pretty much right now with that there's 10,000 people in Austin
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:05.720]  who are either driving for Lyft or Uber or both a lot of them and Lyft and Uber are
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:09.080]  right saying screw you we're leaving that's going to make them capitulate as taxpayers
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:10.080]  and people get mad.
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:13.360]  Well the city wanted to take a cut of their earnings and that's another thing they have
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:16.880]  an issue with they're like no this is our city has the highest taxes in the state of
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:17.880]  Texas.
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:21.760]  And the great thing about Uber and Lyft is one simple thing when you move to a new city
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:25.040]  Austin is the fastest growing city in America.
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:28.720]  When I moved here two years ago there's about 800,000 people there's over 2 million people
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:32.440]  here now when you move to a new city what's the easiest job you can pick up and get right
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:37.320]  away that's doing Lyft and Uber that's a couple grand a week you can be making putting in
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:38.840]  your pocket while you're looking for another job.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:42.280]  Well listen if they had plenty of taxis it would be as big an issue they're horrible
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:46.280]  drivers it's weird but then they never show up they never show up and then they ask you
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:49.160]  which way are you going they go oh I'm not going that way and then they won't even take
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:50.160]  you anyways.
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:53.160]  Like oh I'm going this way so I'm picking up people who want to go the way I'm going
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:56.640]  no that's not your job your job is for me to give you money and you to take me to where
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:57:57.640]  I need to go.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:02.400]  Well here was here was my it's third world because when I'm in England they just go
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:05.960]  now we're double charging you at your hotel and then all these foreigners agreed until
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:09.240]  one guy from England pulled and he goes oh it's a scam I'll give you a ride I'm sorry
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:10.240]  go ahead.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:14.800]  Well my issue with it and this is where you see the politics playing is that you have
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:19.000]  a corporation who wanted to come in and tell the city how they're going to run their city
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:23.200]  so we obviously don't want corporations coming in and violating states rights however we
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:27.160]  also know on the back end the city wants the cut of that money so it's just like.
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:30.120]  I was about to go further because the state issue would be the state house though yeah
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:33.040]  the city is just a subdivision that but I agree it should be done at the state level.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:36.280]  Well they're they're wanting it to be a national thing with Uber like we don't want your regular
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:40.280]  they want everyone to stay there back in seventy seconds fourth hour straight ahead in full

[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:35.960]  to start co-hosting with us in the next segment we're gonna I'm gonna go to at least 20 after
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:40.440]  so I can talk to Manny and Alex and Bill and Greg and Darren others that are patiently
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:45.600]  holding Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs are riding shotgun with us I want to finish up on the
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:51.360]  whole lift uber point and this whole balance and then I want to come back in the next
[03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:54.600]  segment just go bam bam bam through these calls and hand the baton to David Knight
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:01:02.500]  but again it's the complexity the Democratic Party Ronald manuals brother the big producer
[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:06.360]  they're all heavily involved in uber uber says they want to get rid of humans and bring
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:11.160]  a monopoly in a robot so they're creating monopolies then you've got the local mob bosses that
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:16.400]  want a cut of this and then all I care about is the fact that it ends up taking my right
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.320]  to more choices away it's always government getting in the way claiming it's for my safety
[03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:26.320]  it's always that absolutely and that's that was the whole deal is that the uber lift they
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:30.680]  said it would be too expensive to operate here if they start having all these regulations
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:34.120]  handed down which is why taxis are so expensive because they have to comply with all these
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:39.240]  regulations so it's not a level playing field but it but yeah it's they say that it's for
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:44.360]  our safety because you know then we will know that there isn't some rapist or criminal in
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:48.880]  the uber but then there was a an article that came out in the statesman I believe that was
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:56.720]  showing how taxi cab drivers hadn't been given there they hadn't had a check in a while and
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.600]  some of them look it's impossible they always claim it's for your safety it's a load of
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:05.560]  manure it totally is and that's the reason why businesses love doing businesses here
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:10.320]  in Texas is because we don't have that so many regulations but like you said Austin is
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:14.800]  just a whole different there's nowhere to park downtown right you need it I mean it's
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:19.920]  such an awesome thing to have to go out have dinner have a few drinks well this is a model
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:23.080]  for the rest of the world there's big battles happening other cities are trying to ban it
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:26.840]  or banning it in Europe but once people have a taste of something it's like the internet
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.840]  it's gonna be hard to put back in the bottle I agree yeah I mean I just think it's one
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:34.880]  of the greatest things out there to have because it gives people job is the easy way to employ
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.600]  people is a good way to earn some income it's a good way to get around I have to worry about
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:42.280]  getting pulled over right you've had a couple drinks all this stuff I like and I love it
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:45.640]  I wish we had it back you hit the nail on the head though it's not the cops themselves
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:49.560]  that just want the revenue it's the bosses above it yeah but they don't like this they're
[03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:53.120]  trying to get rid of they want jacari goes to these meetings all the time and he was
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:57.320]  saying that it's all about they want people in Austin to be using public transportation
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:01.240]  they want to be making that money it's all about the right yeah the so-called rail and
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.200]  it's kind of you're in Europe compact cities rail doesn't work here you have to drive to
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:09.960]  the point to get on the train right there aren't and the train beds are old and they're always
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:16.080]  flipping trains it's I mean I would never put my kids on Amtrak no yeah and it's it's
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:20.840]  like it's not even convenient for people who do want to go downtown at night it stops running
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:24.840]  so you can't even take it downtown yeah and then take it back it stops running like right
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:28.280]  at the time that people actually go out yeah it's just ridiculous let me ask you this question
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:34.600]  in closing we're gonna come back and take calls Joe you've gone over this so now it's
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:38.800]  just gonna be outlawed win or it's just not gonna be here it has a 5 a.m. this morning
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:43.240]  Uber and Lyft are gone you can no longer access it apparently they're trying to negotiate
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.640]  with the city to see what they can figure out but at the end of the day it's all about
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:49.880]  revenue Austin wants their money they want to make money off of this they're not getting
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:53.840]  the revenue that they got from DWIs as much as they were getting there so they want the
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:58.400]  drunk drivers out there yeah I mean when they put out these ads like we want to stop DWIs
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:01.680]  and Austin no they don't by the way that's why they admit that they don't ever even are
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:05.440]  hardly arrestee legals for drunk driving because the illegals just walk right when they're
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:09.640]  the ones that have got completely gotten rid of all the parking downtown you can't even
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:13.880]  find a parking spot it was their city design this is the smart city screw job and then
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:17.320]  they're like well wait something it's meant to make you take buses we innovate around
[03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:22.120]  it with technology so they want to screw that over right exactly they have to be in control
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:27.320]  and it's the whole pay to play thing and in the one respect I think Uber is correct and
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:31.320]  then in the other it's you know I've never had a bad experience in Lyft but anytime
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:35.440]  I've been in a cab it's like am I going to die right because it's some of the craziest
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:38.960]  people who are on their phone and it's like oh no no no they're on their phone the whole
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:50.280]  time they're not even paying attention they're texting and they're swerving around I got ran
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:54.520]  over my foot by a taxi and the cop pointed his finger at me and told me I shouldn't
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:05:00.480]  have been standing there like really the guy drugged me under his car Joe Biggs here with
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:06.520]  info wars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul the most basic principle to being
[03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:13.320]  a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions
[03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:18.200]  we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes neither does
[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:23.280]  our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on
[03:05:23.280 --> 03:05:28.520]  their rights freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones
[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:33.840]  if we are only free to make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost
[03:05:33.840 --> 03:05:38.920]  through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:46.040]  checkpoints random searches mandatory identification cards and paramilitary police in our streets
[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:52.160]  we have lost a vital part of our American heritage America was born of protests revolution
[03:05:52.160 --> 03:05:57.760]  and mistrust of government subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long

[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:40.680]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:59.360]  that it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.
[03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:03.800]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:05.440]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:09.760]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies
[03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:14.520]  can devastate IQ, and how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the
[03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:18.880]  food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:23.720]  They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in, and when the Fukushima crisis
[03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:28.480]  worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:29.480]  and your family.
[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:35.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:40.760]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:42.380]  ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:42.380 --> 03:07:44.320]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:48.480]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:50.520]  to any optimum health regimen.

[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:20.360]  We're now into the fourth hour, David Knight is in the Situation Room, we're here in the
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:26.120]  War Room right now, and we're going to be taking some of your phone calls here with
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:29.120]  Leigh Ann McAdoo and Joe Bidge.
[03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:33.320]  Tell us, once we punch out of here in about 12 minutes, David Knight, what you've got
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:35.000]  lined up to cover, my friend.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:38.920]  Well, Alex, we're going to take a look at Venezuela, because the solutions that are
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:43.440]  being proposed there pretty much mirror what Obama, Hillary, and Bernie want to do in the
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:48.280]  U.S., and they're not working, they are headed towards disasters, the same policies we see
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:49.280]  here.
[03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:53.120]  Also, we've got a story that I think has some broad implications when we look at what Obama
[03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:58.560]  wants to do, and in terms of now discovering new rights for felons, if you want to rent
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:05.560]  your apartment or your home, we now have a story out of Seattle, an 80-year-old great-grandmother
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:11.600]  who defended her family as an intruder broken to the house, stabbed her husband, she shot
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  him dead.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:15.960]  We'll talk about that, the implications of this new protected class, and of course there's
[03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:20.320]  some new protected class information coming out of North Carolina.
[03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:24.960]  That war is escalating, as Obama discovers yet another new protected class, always about
[03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:29.960]  discrimination and what's happening with the gay KKK in North Carolina.
[03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:34.120]  All right, powerful info, we're going to call us right now, but I haven't gotten into this
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:39.640]  whole quote, don't discriminate against felons, they include child molesters, you name it.
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:43.080]  The Democrats, just like the Republicans, the Democrats more than anybody, are the ones
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:46.800]  that locked everybody up, they're the ones that pass minimum sentencing, and then they
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:53.320]  sit there as the saviors, saying now we're just going to not let you discriminate against
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:54.840]  somebody who's a convicted felon.
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:57.160]  Well, that's the only way Hillary can become the president.
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:02.760]  Exactly, well they make everybody criminals, and then they become the client managers of
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:06.240]  the criminals and then represent them, this is what they do, they make you dependent.
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:10.960]  At every level, they want you institutionalized, who's been holding the longest here?
[03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:17.240]  Let's go to Darren in the great state of Texas, now under FEMA region six occupation, literally.
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:20.880]  That's not for fun, folks, we're under FEMA provisional government, trying to get out from
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:23.760]  under it, Donald Trump says he wants to be a nationalist, that's why people that have
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:28.840]  hijacked the country freak out and say no, we took it over, well, not without a fight.
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:31.640]  But Darren, thanks for holding you're on the air with Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Joe Biggs, go
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:32.640]  ahead.
[03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:37.520]  Hey Alex, my brother from another mother, man, you guys are doing a great job there.
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:38.520]  Thank you.
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:42.720]  Listen, I think we need to get back to the spirit of the constitution, like you guys
[03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:48.680]  say, and instead of just the restoration of the letters of the constitution, I want liberty,
[03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:55.600]  I want it now, both physical liberty, emotional, financial, and most important, spiritual.
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:11:01.720]  And also, Tony Bart, Dr. Tony Bart, man, when you get her on again, talk about, I think
[03:11:01.720 --> 03:11:05.920]  y'all were starting to get into it when she was on, but the defense again, we're up against
[03:11:05.920 --> 03:11:09.880]  energy attacks, frequencies, these things, I don't even know all of them.
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:13.240]  Oh, well they admit, I mean, the birds are deformed that are by the big cell towers,
[03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:17.720]  but just, we're all in a giant experiment right now, I mean, stuff is crazy.
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:21.720]  I feel like she had information about that that I would really love to find out.
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:24.400]  Oh, we're going to get her back, everybody loved her, I loved her, I instantly clicked
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:25.400]  with her.
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:31.480]  And then last point, if Anthony Gutiarty and Dr. Groot could work on a list of neuropathic
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:35.000]  doctors, I want to get away from the N.D. tyranny that's going on.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  No, I hear you, I hear you.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.840]  Well, let's see, I mean, for me it's a mix, but I hear you, there are a lot of good M.D.s
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:41.920]  that know what's going on, it's just that on top it's orchestrated by Big Pharma and
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:42.920]  others.
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:43.920]  Thank you, Darren.
[03:11:43.920 --> 03:11:44.920]  Great points, any comments?
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:45.920]  What do you say?
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:47.920]  Oh, I agree, especially with the electronic frequencies and stuff, just like you were
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:51.720]  talking in the article earlier about how just screens in general are affecting the way
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:52.720]  we think, well.
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:53.720]  In a bad way.
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:55.760]  What about all the cell towers and just constant?
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:58.680]  What's crazy is in every metric and study, it's all bad.
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:11:59.680]  Right.
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:00.680]  None of this is good.
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:04.480]  There's a new movie coming out, I think it's called Cell, with Samuel L. Jackson, and they
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:09.240]  hijacked the cell phone frequencies and turned everyone into zombies, and it's this movie
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:10.240]  that's coming out.
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:14.440]  The Kingsman, the same deal, but I remember in, if somebody could find this, that covered
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:18.680]  like 20 times on air and then lost the printout article, it was in the Baltimore Sun, like
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:24.200]  1999, maybe 2000, and it was DARPA going, we're practicing putting waves out through
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:27.080]  the cell tower carrier to calm you.
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:28.080]  Right.
[03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:31.760]  And it's like Fox Newscast going, actually, fluoride does help calm you, and now we want
[03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:34.160]  to put lithium in the water.
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:35.520]  People hear me say that, they don't believe it.
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:39.400]  You can go pull up the Fox News saying, government wants to put lithium in the water, but I can't
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:42.240]  find the article where they admitted they're using cell towers.
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:43.240]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:47.560]  I mean, that's what they're going to do to just placate the masses who want to vote
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:48.560]  for Donald Trump.
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:53.880]  They're going to put lithium in the water, and people say, they're actually saying it.
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:54.880]  Yeah.
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:59.240]  They try to tell libertarians, you know, you guys are so stupid, we need the government
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:02.680]  to protect the food, the water, the health, and you're like, what?
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:05.960]  The government's a bunch of multinational corporations that took the country over.
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:08.960]  We've all got a bunch of transmitters, but keep in our pocket on us every day.
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:09.960]  It's just like radiating.
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:14.960]  Oh, when I tell people 20 years ago, your cell phone's tracking, it was federal law.
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:18.960]  Federal law since like 1998, it's all triangulated, and people go, no, it's not.
[03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:23.000]  I mean, if you download like Hathi's app, say, do you give us, do you grant permission
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:27.840]  for me to gain access to your photos, your camera, your microphone, all that, and people
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:30.680]  just go, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, they don't ever read anything.
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:35.640]  Roger Stone had to get all new computers because he'd come in and there'd be cursors
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:37.480]  clicking and things and downloading his dad.
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:38.480]  He's like, what the hell?
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:39.480]  Right.
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:40.480]  And they'd be like, oh, he's a conspiracy.
[03:13:40.480 --> 03:13:44.080]  They had news articles going, Stone claims his computer got hacked.
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:45.080]  No.
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:49.520]  Donald Trump's former campaign head, quarterbacking the resistance, no, no one's breaking into
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:50.520]  his computer.
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:51.520]  Exactly.
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:52.520]  Oh, no, that's so kooky.
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:55.920]  I remember, I remember when I had to admit that they did it to Cheryl Ackerson who had
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:13:56.920]  the video.
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:13:59.960]  Well, of course they're breaking into Donald Trump's brain.
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:03.560]  I remember when I first started working here, Darren McBrain told me the story where his
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:06.440]  cell phone, he would sit it down and it would turn on and flip through the different names
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:10.560]  that would go to like Alex, Leigh Ann, you know, no, no, I've had to read his cell phones
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:15.400]  over and over again because once they hack it, I just smash it and they'll be dialing
[03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:17.280]  people and visiting websites.
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:18.280]  I'm not going to.
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:28.120]  They're like typing and calling people when I was in Pennsylvania when I was interviewing
[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:32.720]  Michael Strange's father, Charlie, the guy, the, the seal that died in Extortion 17.
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:36.880]  He was telling me stories with his wife is using a computer and all of a sudden there's
[03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:42.080]  no webcam, but all of a sudden her on the computer screens popping up on the, on the
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:43.440]  monitor and they screenshot it.
[03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:46.720]  That's because they've got, they've got patents where they can actually off the screen get
[03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:47.720]  video now.
[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:51.480]  And, and they were telling me these stories and quite frankly, and they do that to mess
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:52.480]  with you.
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.480]  Oh, they were scared because there was messages coming up.
[03:14:54.480 --> 03:14:55.480]  Stop looking at this.
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:14:56.480]  You know, why do you care about this?
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:14:57.480]  Stop, stop, stop.
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:14:58.480]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:14:59.960]  You know, like all the stuff and they're like freaking out.
[03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:03.280]  Because I knew the seals had credibility, but that's just like finally they had the
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:06.480]  seals going Fox news and say she's a liar.
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:07.480]  And then nothing happened.
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:08.480]  She gave the order.
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:13.680]  Of course she gave the order 13 hours, eight hours stand down, right?
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:19.240]  I mean, and then she went to bed, Oh, I mean, look, she gave the order.
[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:20.720]  She's a freaking monster, man.
[03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:24.880]  I just, you know, so many settings go, Hey, doesn't matter if Hillary wins, you're gonna
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:25.880]  do a lot better on radio.
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:26.880]  You'll be so popular.
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:28.880]  She's probably trying to have us arrested.
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:29.880]  Oh yeah.
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:34.040]  I mean, I don't want, I don't want to be bigger because the new order gets bigger and everything
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:35.040]  I say comes true.
[03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:37.240]  I'm ready to dial this baby back.
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:40.880]  I don't want to have to literally work 18 hours a day.
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:45.360]  No, I see her if, if she, because president, I really see bad things.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:51.280]  I mean, just we're seeing that the, the government is already trying to up the liquid in Europe.
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:52.280]  Look what's happening in Europe.
[03:15:52.280 --> 03:15:53.280]  She comes in here.
[03:15:53.280 --> 03:15:54.280]  That's ushering in, right?
[03:15:54.280 --> 03:15:55.800]  That's, that's going to be a train.
[03:15:55.800 --> 03:15:57.600]  High rate of speed coming in.
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:15:58.600]  No borders.
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:15:59.600]  Everything.
[03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:00.600]  Everyone come in.
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:01.600]  Come on.
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:02.600]  Let's go.
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:03.600]  What do you make a carry coming out and saying no borders?
[03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:04.600]  That's just completely.
[03:16:04.600 --> 03:16:08.520]  And the EU basically tells, tells the UK this will cause war if you leave because they'll
[03:16:08.520 --> 03:16:09.520]  start a war.
[03:16:09.520 --> 03:16:11.880]  Yeah, it's basically a warning.
[03:16:11.880 --> 03:16:14.280]  It's not a, you know, oh, they're really bad.
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:15.960]  I mean, notice they're under EU control.
[03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:18.400]  They didn't vote to join it and now they can't leave.
[03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:21.600]  I think everybody who doesn't want borders, you should go ahead and take your doors off
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:22.600]  your cars.
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:26.080]  You should take doors off your houses and just let everybody in.
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:28.040]  Let's just all, you know, one big commune.
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:31.880]  Well, that's one blind spot America has that we have the least level of holding passports
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:36.160]  except for like North Korea, something like 70% of people never leave the US.
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:39.240]  They don't know how bad other parts of the world are.
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:42.760]  When I was in, in Molen Beach, Belgium, you get to see how bad it is.
[03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:47.280]  I got off the train where that actual, that incident happened not too long ago, the terrorist
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:48.280]  attack there.
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:49.280]  We got off the train.
[03:16:49.280 --> 03:16:52.760]  The first thing I saw was a guy with his pants down, taking a dump on the sidewalk.
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:16:58.200]  That was the first thing I saw when I got there, followed by a whole bunch of guys wanting
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:02.280]  to chase me out of there and basically cut my head off, you know, ISIS flags in the window.
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:04.080]  And then you get to hear Trump being criticized.
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:05.600]  There's no no go zones.
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:06.600]  Yeah.
[03:17:06.600 --> 03:17:07.600]  There's no.
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:09.960]  They want them to let the Muslims love us.
[03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:10.960]  Yeah, they're not.
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:14.120]  They fricking put women in slave dungeons with beekeeper hats.
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:15.120]  Right.
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:16.120]  I mean, oh, I told the story.
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:17.120]  We're going to skip the break.
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:19.360]  We're going to skip the break to give Dave more time.
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:23.960]  Again, I grew up around wealthy Muslims, smart people whose daughters were, you know, able
[03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:25.320]  to be free and they were intellectual.
[03:17:25.320 --> 03:17:28.120]  They're bringing all these poor Wahhabis now.
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:34.960]  I was at Barton Creek Mall with my daughters and my son and went to dinner and we were going
[03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:38.400]  to go see Captain America, which I walked out of, by the way.
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:42.240]  And I'm sitting there and I'm like, I turn a corner.
[03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:47.200]  There's women in full, full burkas and it's everywhere.
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:52.920]  And then there's like these wild, crazy looking guys like right out of Saudi Arabia running
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:53.920]  around.
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:58.480]  And it's like, my God, this is literally like a bazaar in Syria or something that's been
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:17:59.480]  overtaken by ISIS.
[03:17:59.480 --> 03:18:04.360]  And it was just so freaky and then that they were all looking crazy at my daughters with
[03:18:04.360 --> 03:18:06.240]  their blonde hair and everything.
[03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:09.160]  And just like, it was just freaky because I mean, these are literal slaves.
[03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:10.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:12.160]  Black people would change around their necks or something.
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:13.160]  These women are slaves.
[03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:14.160]  I'm allowed to drive cars.
[03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:15.160]  Right.
[03:18:15.160 --> 03:18:17.480]  I was just, it just totally freaked me out.
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:22.080]  My whole life has been about honoring women and being, you know, truly a patriot.
[03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:24.440]  And then I'm seeing people that are literally taking over.
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:27.240]  It's hard to find so many people who hate America.
[03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:28.240]  There was an article.
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:29.800]  These are not being triggered, Leigh Ann.
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:32.920]  I literally got nauseous because they were like everywhere.
[03:18:32.920 --> 03:18:36.840]  I was like, what the, I mean, you know, the numbers they brought in are much higher.
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  I'm trying.
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:38.840]  Go ahead, Leigh Ann.
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:39.840]  Yeah.
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:42.320]  Well, there was actually a topic of discussion on the BBC.
[03:18:42.320 --> 03:18:48.480]  Should we allow Muslim women to drive more than 48 miles without a chaperone?
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:50.800]  I mean, this isn't a Western country.
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:51.800]  They are now saying.
[03:18:51.800 --> 03:18:55.880]  The buses now say Allah, you praise Allah and the mayor's Muslim and he says, we've
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:58.040]  got to get more hardcore and I have Uncle Tom's.
[03:18:58.040 --> 03:19:00.120]  We got to push jihad.
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:03.000]  They're importing people who don't want to assimilate to our ways whatsoever.
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:07.600]  I mean, they can have their way off and it's okay, but do you want to bring those people
[03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:08.600]  here?
[03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:09.600]  Right?
[03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:10.600]  I mean, in Germany, they tell them.
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:14.040]  Remember the mayor, the liberal mayor of, uh, of, uh, what was the big city, Cologne
[03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:15.040]  or whatever?
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:16.040]  Yeah.
[03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:17.040]  Said, listen, it's your fault.
[03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:18.040]  Ladies, don't dress sexy.
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:19.040]  You get raped.
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:20.040]  Die your hair.
[03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:21.040]  Don't look so blog.
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:22.640]  So the feminist says, watch how you dress.
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:23.640]  Leigh Ann.
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:28.360]  Well, how dare you be in a fifties, uh, really like your style by the way I mean, how dare
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:29.360]  Leigh Ann.
[03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:34.360]  Well, just put it away, get rid of the goddess energy, just hide that.
[03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:35.360]  Let's put a hood over your head.
[03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:39.360]  So some potbellied piece of filth can, I just can't handle it.
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:40.360]  I know.
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:44.960]  Feminists in the West have done to get rid of that, you know, victim blaming and this
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:46.760]  and it doesn't matter what I wear.
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:51.280]  And then now they're injecting that language back into the country.
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:54.120]  I mean, I know why the Germans who put up with everything are going to start to beat
[03:19:54.120 --> 03:19:56.440]  these gangs up that have been raping women.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:20:01.760]  I mean, I'm here to tell you, man, downtown Austin looks like Islamabad part of the time.
[03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:03.000]  And I'm, I'm getting tired of it.
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:04.000]  Okay.
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:07.440]  And I'm not going to sit here and put up with this bringing in a culture that has slavery
[03:20:07.440 --> 03:20:08.440]  going on of women.
[03:20:08.440 --> 03:20:09.440]  That's what it is.
[03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:13.080]  And then there's these communist marches going on everywhere now, like on rainy street on
[03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:14.160]  the weekends.
[03:20:14.160 --> 03:20:18.000]  Last weekend I'm sitting outside having a drink, watching some hockey and all of a sudden all
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:21.200]  these communists with these flags or whatever, fishing with their smart phones and their
[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:25.560]  wealth everywhere, lazy dumb blobs waving their commie flags.
[03:20:25.560 --> 03:20:28.600]  And they're like, they're like, you guys took the street, rainy street used to belong to
[03:20:28.600 --> 03:20:30.160]  a poor Mexicans.
[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:32.040]  This is part of Oz and lawn, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:33.280]  I'm like, well, guess what?
[03:20:33.280 --> 03:20:34.280]  You lost the war.
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:35.280]  You lose the land.
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:36.280]  Get over it.
[03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:37.280]  Move on.
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:38.280]  The truth is rainy street.
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:39.280]  I had friends over there.
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:43.640]  It was just a blue collar and white collar area of just houses and buildings and a lot
[03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:49.160]  of rotting and falling apart, you know, where the old brothels were back in the day, have
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:51.000]  the Western shootouts there and stuff.
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:52.920]  But the point is it wasn't Oz and lawn.
[03:20:52.920 --> 03:20:53.920]  Yeah.
[03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:56.040]  Everybody can walk into those restaurants and places.
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:20:57.040]  What is it?
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:20:58.040]  It was Mexicans and Hispanics everywhere.
[03:20:58.040 --> 03:20:59.040]  Having a great time.
[03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:00.040]  The whole earth.
[03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:01.040]  There's still tons of them there now.
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:02.040]  They go hang out.
[03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:03.040]  No one seems to care.
[03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:04.040]  It's just these communists.
[03:21:04.040 --> 03:21:05.440]  I've never seen so many communists in my entire life.
[03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:06.440]  Why?
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:07.440]  I thought this was over.
[03:21:07.440 --> 03:21:09.840]  Look, they've been breeding it forever, saying it's a little mighty.
[03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:13.440]  Well, and that's the thing too, you have all these kids coming out with all this communist
[03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:17.760]  stuff, thinking that they're so original and they have all these original ideas, not realizing
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:23.000]  that the media, the social media, the schooling has just been programming them for decades.
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:24.680]  And they all think that they're so original.
[03:21:24.680 --> 03:21:26.280]  I just thought of a stunt we can pull.
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:29.040]  We should do some whole deal where you go, I want to be inclusive.
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:31.400]  And just like mother and father hurt someone that doesn't have a mother and father.
[03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:33.080]  He or she hurt someone that isn't here.
[03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:36.400]  She, I now I want to wear a burka and just show like your life.
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:38.120]  You go to the grocery store, wear the hood over your head.
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:39.120]  A full outfit.
[03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:40.120]  I've got my man, Jamie.
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:43.400]  What are you doing on air talking oppressed right now?
[03:21:43.400 --> 03:21:44.400]  What are you doing?
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:45.400]  Lady, women don't talk.
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:46.400]  I got to set up.
[03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:47.400]  That's liberal.
[03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:51.800]  I bought a pair of man, Jamies, when I was in Dearborn, Michigan, a chaperone with me
[03:21:51.800 --> 03:21:53.200]  to drive me there.
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:56.040]  I'll take a few more calls because I have a night.
[03:21:56.040 --> 03:21:57.040]  We're skipping the break here.
[03:21:57.040 --> 03:21:59.320]  I'm about to take a few more calls and turn it over to you, but what do you make of this
[03:21:59.320 --> 03:22:00.320]  whole rant here?
[03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:05.320]  I mean, do you get the fact that I see these women with full, full deals on, not just with
[03:22:05.320 --> 03:22:08.360]  their eyes covered, but I mean the full hoods.
[03:22:08.360 --> 03:22:12.480]  And then it was like, I turn this corner, I turn that corner and I was just, and the
[03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:16.880]  men are all kind of gangster thug in their own groups, all enjoying themselves.
[03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:18.960]  The women are wearing hoods over their heads.
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:21.120]  I mean, I'm fricking in the Jim Jones cult here.
[03:22:21.120 --> 03:22:22.120]  Am I wrong?
[03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:23.120]  Am I wrong?
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:27.080]  My wife and I heard what you said about that over the weekend, Alex, and we both immediately
[03:22:27.080 --> 03:22:31.640]  said that's a spot on analogy when you said what if they were dragging people around here
[03:22:31.640 --> 03:22:34.880]  with chains on their necks because they believe in slavery.
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:36.200]  And that's precisely what it is.
[03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:38.000]  I thought that was a spot on analogy.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:39.840]  Why are we putting up with this?
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:43.120]  Why are we allowing this to overrun our culture?
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:47.280]  And of course, some of the news that I'm going to talk about here, we see that Obama and
[03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:49.760]  the rest of them are openly plotting to replace us.
[03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:54.800]  I mean, we think giving better welfare benefits to people who are not Americans.
[03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:57.800]  The refugees get more than a social security person.
[03:22:57.800 --> 03:22:58.800]  Right.
[03:22:58.800 --> 03:22:59.800]  Exactly.
[03:22:59.800 --> 03:23:00.800]  And it's also welfare.
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:01.800]  It's also in state college tuition.
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:03.360]  And then they're not even thankful for it.
[03:23:03.360 --> 03:23:04.360]  That's right.
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:07.000]  They bring in Syrian refugees, give them houses, and meanwhile, we have homeless veterans sleeping
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.320]  under bridges in Austin, all over the country.
[03:23:09.320 --> 03:23:10.640]  Because we put up with it.
[03:23:10.640 --> 03:23:12.840]  I'm telling you, David, we're going to go to these calls here.
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  Alex in Washington.
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:14.840]  Thanks for holding on here worldwide.
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:15.840]  Is that you, Alex?
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:16.840]  Go ahead.
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:23.760]  Yes, sir, I wanted to call about General Dunford, I've heard some things about him lately,
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:28.920]  about he's a new chief of staff or whatever, former commentator of the Marine Corps.
[03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:32.760]  I actually served under him back in 97 when he was in Lejeune as a battalion commander.
[03:23:32.760 --> 03:23:33.760]  He's a Lieutenant Colonel back then.
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:34.760]  He's a really good man.
[03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:37.560]  I don't know much about him because I haven't really followed him, but I heard about him
[03:23:37.560 --> 03:23:38.560]  lately.
[03:23:38.560 --> 03:23:42.440]  Supposedly, he took over the Federal Reserve, set it down, maybe went to the White House
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:45.560]  and he's got the Army behind him or something.
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:48.640]  Well, I always hear stuff like this, this general's going to do this, that general's
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:50.320]  going to do this, but I know this.
[03:23:50.320 --> 03:23:53.520]  I knew about it at the time and then I was told by sources and it turned out to all
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:54.520]  be accurate.
[03:23:54.520 --> 03:23:55.520]  Sy Hersh reported on it.
[03:23:55.520 --> 03:24:00.040]  The U.S. Army, particularly four and a half years ago, said, we're not backing Al Qaeda.
[03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:01.040]  We're not going to do this.
[03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:04.720]  We're going to give the Russians the intelligence and you can do whatever you can fire us.
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:09.680]  Dempsey went in and met with Obama and so that's why they had a big purge after that
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:13.440]  of trying to get people in place that will back the Saudi Arabia and Jihad force and
[03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:16.040]  then their side deal is they allow them to start taking over Europe.
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:19.800]  They've made a deal with Saudi Arabia in all of this.
[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:27.120]  So I know that Dunford has come out and criticized Obama on women in frontline combat, so the
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:33.360]  Marine Corps is kind of resisting more, but I mean, I would always poo poo saying there's
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:36.240]  good folks at the highest levels of the military and they're saying no because I've never
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:37.320]  seen evidence of it.
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:41.240]  We are now seeing evidence of that and it's very, very historic, but I would expect to
[03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:42.240]  see more.
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:45.720]  We're dealing with open naked tyranny, Alex.
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:47.840]  Oh, for sure.
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:49.760]  I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a good man.
[03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:55.000]  I mean, he's 26 miles on how many times I've never seen a guy do 26 more humbuthers,
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:58.040]  officers, and then go run five miles with a pack afterwards.
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:01.600]  It's like, I'm pretty sure he's a good man and I think if you could really follow him
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:07.200]  a little closely, a little more closer because I've heard some other things that they shut
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:08.200]  the reserve down.
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:11.760]  It's the not.org anymore.gov now and they're printing real US dollars.
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:12.760]  No, no.
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:13.760]  I hear you.
[03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:17.440]  Let me throw this in.
[03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:20.240]  Even people that aren't perfect when you get down to the point of gutting the country
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:24.480]  and breaking it forever and outlawing families and forcibly inoculating everybody, you come
[03:25:24.480 --> 03:25:27.480]  to a moment where you realize the globalists are going to screw me over.
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:29.760]  Why should I go along with it?
[03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:32.460]  Why should I go along without the fads of the mainstream media?
[03:25:32.460 --> 03:25:34.560]  Why should I buy into these cosmologies?
[03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:35.560]  Why should I do this?
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:39.680]  And you realize it's a delusion to think you can join with this system.
[03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:43.600]  Maybe 50 years ago, if you sold out your culture, you'd be rich and powerful now, but you're
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:44.600]  not.
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:47.120]  There's not enough slots in the New World Order.
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:50.520]  It is a system that's based on the reverse of prosperity.
[03:25:50.520 --> 03:25:52.520]  You guys want to comment?
[03:25:52.520 --> 03:25:53.520]  I'm going to throw the baton here.
[03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:56.600]  Well, it just seems like you see in all the movies when the elite are getting in their
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:26:01.320]  ships to go to space or whatever far off planet and there's never enough room and the people
[03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:04.880]  who think they're like, oh, I've been doing all your dirty work all these years, let me
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:08.320]  on and they shut the door in their face and that's how it's going to be.
[03:26:08.320 --> 03:26:12.480]  Well, traders always get taken out even faster than the patriots.
[03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:16.560]  Once evil takes over, the first thing it does is take out its minions because they know
[03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:17.560]  where the bodies are buried.
[03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:19.800]  This is such a dishonorable system.
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:20.800]  We're going to go to break.
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:21.800]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:23.720]  And if the callers want to hold, I'm not sure.
[03:26:23.720 --> 03:26:24.720]  David, you want to take calls?
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:25.960]  I think I've got a bunch of news to cover.
[03:26:25.960 --> 03:26:26.960]  Sure.
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:27.960]  Yeah, I'll take all.
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:28.960]  All right.
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:29.960]  Well, cover your news and then go to the folks they can hold.
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:30.960]  I appreciate them calling.
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:31.960]  Mark and Greg and Bill and Robert and others.
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:38.320]  Full-free number is 800-25-99-231, briefly, you mentioned Hillary for Prison shirts.
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:39.520]  We had the limited edition.
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:42.160]  I followed my pledge and stopped having it.
[03:26:42.160 --> 03:26:43.240]  People got so upset.
[03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:46.400]  We brought back a new limited edition that's similar, but a new limited edition of Hillary
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:47.900]  for Prison.
[03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:49.280]  Great way to promote solidarity.
[03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:52.320]  Great way as we go into the main election to expose what a criminal this woman is and
[03:26:52.320 --> 03:26:56.440]  to be on the news, whether it's Trump rallies, Hillary rallies, you're having a phenomenon.
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:26:59.240]  Info Wars is showing the power of the Info Warriors.
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:05.840]  Bola and Labe shirts are everywhere as well, and your funding or operation has 4.9 stars
[03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:08.680]  out of 191 reviews.
[03:27:08.680 --> 03:27:09.680]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:14.680]  Also, we cannot offer the 30 to 40% off on the high quality swarable food anymore, but
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:22.960]  with the four top selling products, the four top selling packages, the four weeks, the
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:27.120]  six months that goes on to a year of the highest quality out there at the lowest price.
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:31.240]  Great packaging, very fresh, it's what I've chosen for my family.
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:37.000]  You can get 40% off, I've been authorized to run this for one week, but on the four
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.880]  weeks supply, the three months supply, the six months supply, the one year supply, that
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:42.880]  is running right now.
[03:27:42.880 --> 03:27:47.480]  And they say 30 to 40 on this, I guess that's some algorithm or something with the deals,
[03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:51.800]  but I told them 40%, but I guess I'm not allowed to do that, the point is, it's as good as
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:55.480]  the other deal, but I can't do it on the entire, because they got special meals and a lot of
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:28:00.360]  other packages over 60 different configurations, but on these four top best sellers, we got
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:04.920]  30 to 40% off running at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:08.520]  The nutraceuticals that all ends tonight, 10% off on all the nutraceuticals as part
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:13.480]  of preparedness, the non-GMO seeds, the water filtration systems, the crank radios, short

[03:28:19.280 --> 03:28:24.720]  optics, infowarsstore.com, the great car battery charger systems that run off all these different
[03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:29.040]  devices and jumpstart your car, it's like the size of like a third of a briefcase, it's
[03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:32.440]  just amazing what technology's doing, we need to be self-sufficient, and know that your
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:36.480]  purchase of the products funds the very tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:41.560]  We are looking for the truth, we're taking action, we're defending the human family, we
[03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:46.360]  are having huge effects across the world, showing that a resistance can be put up against
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:50.040]  the tyrants, and your funding of the operation is essential, but just spread the word about
[03:28:50.040 --> 03:28:55.160]  our videos, our articles, post our stuff on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, repost
[03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:59.280]  our videos, tell your email list, your friends, your family, your neighbors, this is a war
[03:28:59.280 --> 03:29:01.040]  and say there's a fight, do you know?
[03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:07.080]  The modern Paul Revere's are here, infowars.com, we're part of it too, and there's an excitement
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:11.720]  and it's there, and criminal elites always think they're invincible, but history shows
[03:29:11.720 --> 03:29:15.280]  time and time again they're not when the human spirit of liberty is ignited.
[03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:18.000]  Leigh Ann, 20 seconds, Joe, big 20 seconds, we're going to go to break, come back with
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  David Knight.
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:22.480]  That's very powerful stuff, I think even if they do manage to take down the internet,
[03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:25.280]  it's still not going to stop what we've already started.
[03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:27.880]  So we've got to start planting seeds right now.
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:30.920]  Info wars is so popular everywhere we go, it's so amazing when you go out, everyone's
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:35.120]  coming up to us, with all the nace and iodine, X2 stuff to show us that they're getting it,
[03:29:35.120 --> 03:29:38.200]  they're supporting us, they're happy that they're supporting it, they're behind it,
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:41.760]  they love what you guys are doing, they love everything you do, Alex, it's amazing to see
[03:29:41.760 --> 03:29:45.680]  this whole culture happen like this and sweeping across the country.
[03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:48.960]  Absolutely, and again, these are great nutraceuticals you name it, but it's also about a series
[03:29:48.960 --> 03:29:49.960]  of things.
[03:29:49.960 --> 03:29:50.960]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.960 --> 03:29:51.960]  We'll be back.
[03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:52.960]  Stay with us.
[03:29:52.960 --> 03:29:53.960]  David Knight, right ahead.
[03:29:53.960 --> 03:30:22.440]  In the G.C.N. Radio Network.
[03:30:22.440 --> 03:30:25.320]  Your liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:29.760]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:33.440]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[03:30:33.440 --> 03:30:37.840]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[03:30:37.840 --> 03:30:41.560]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives
[03:30:41.560 --> 03:30:42.560]  are allowed to see.
[03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:46.440]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its
[03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:49.200]  youth, the language of America was different.
[03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:51.000]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:57.000]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:59.120]  Renfowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:59.120 --> 03:31:03.280]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:03.280 --> 03:31:08.520]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:31:08.520 --> 03:31:11.680]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:11.680 --> 03:31:16.960]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:19.480]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:19.480 --> 03:31:21.600]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[03:31:21.600 --> 03:31:50.680]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:31:51.600 --> 03:32:04.240]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[03:32:04.240 --> 03:32:08.760]  and purchase your supply of survival shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products
[03:32:08.760 --> 03:32:09.760]  at infowarslife.com.
[03:32:09.760 --> 03:32:14.360]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:16.440]  and the answer is clear.
[03:32:16.440 --> 03:32:21.120]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[03:32:21.120 --> 03:32:23.320]  simply can't even keep up with it.
[03:32:23.320 --> 03:32:28.720]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[03:32:28.720 --> 03:32:32.240]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[03:32:32.240 --> 03:32:36.160]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[03:32:36.160 --> 03:32:39.080]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[03:32:39.080 --> 03:32:43.240]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[03:32:43.240 --> 03:32:47.640]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[03:32:47.640 --> 03:32:51.680]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[03:32:51.680 --> 03:33:19.480]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the InfoWarslife family of incredible products.
[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:24.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.360 --> 03:33:26.880]  I'm David Knight, your host, and I'm going to go to these callers.
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:30.400]  I tell you what, Bill, I just noticed Bill in Indiana had been holding for a very long
[03:33:30.400 --> 03:33:31.400]  time just dropped off.
[03:33:31.400 --> 03:33:33.920]  Bill, if you want to call back, we can take your call.
[03:33:33.920 --> 03:33:37.600]  I'm going to go also to Robert, to Greg, to Mark in Arizona.
[03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:39.200]  I'm going to take those calls.
[03:33:39.200 --> 03:33:44.160]  I do have some news that I want to cover before I go to those calls, so hang on just a little
[03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:45.720]  bit longer, guys, and I'll get to you.
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:50.160]  One of the things I want to talk about, because I think it's very important, we see Bernie
[03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:55.680]  Sanders and the massive movement of college students who don't know any better rallying
[03:33:55.680 --> 03:34:01.160]  behind Bernie the Socialist, and we need to look at what these policies that Bernie has
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:04.480]  supported all of his life for 35 years.
[03:34:04.480 --> 03:34:08.320]  What have they done to Central America, for example, okay?
[03:34:08.320 --> 03:34:13.640]  We know that he went down and he was absolutely in love with the Sandinistas and Nicaragua.
[03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:19.000]  We've got the recordings of when he went back there and came back and said, well, maybe
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:24.040]  I'm a dupe, but I think they're great, and I was like, yeah, he is a dupe, and he's
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:28.640]  duped a lot of people into this socialism that he's selling.
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:34.680]  But when you look at what they're trying to do in Venezuela, as this country spirals
[03:34:34.680 --> 03:34:41.400]  down into the drain, okay, it mirrors precisely the solutions that we hear coming from Obama,
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:44.080]  from Hillary, not just from Bernie, okay?
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:45.200]  Let me give you an example.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:49.000]  This is a story from W&D, I think it was up on the Drudge Report.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:54.280]  As Venezuela slides closer into the abyss, the country's socialist leaders have been
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:57.120]  trying everything to stop the tailspin.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:02.600]  Now the current president, Hugo Chavez is dead, but he lives on in his policies, okay?
[03:35:02.600 --> 03:35:09.000]  They have raised fuel prices by more than 6,000%, and they're trying to conserve electricity
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:14.800]  by proclaiming holidays for public employees, telling women to stop using hairdryers.
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:16.160]  You've covered all this before, right?
[03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:19.560]  They got rapid inflation, they've raised the minimum wage, okay?
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:21.200]  What are their solutions?
[03:35:21.200 --> 03:35:26.080]  The same stuff that we see from Obama and Hillary and Bernie.
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:31.720]  For example, this is a country like America that has more than enough natural resources
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:35.800]  to satisfy all of its energy needs, okay?
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:39.760]  We have massive oil reserves here, we have massive coal reserves in the United States,
[03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:45.560]  but we're not going to be allowed to use them just like Venezuela if we have the Obama-Hillary
[03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:49.000]  Bernie people in charge, the Democrats, the people who tell us, no, we've got to go to
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  green power.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:52.080]  How'd that work out for Venezuela?
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:53.480]  They went to hydroelectric power.
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:54.480]  Guess what?
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:35:55.480]  They've got to drought.
[03:35:55.480 --> 03:35:56.480]  Guess what?
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:35:57.480]  It's not very efficient.
[03:35:57.480 --> 03:35:58.480]  Guess what?
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:02.520]  They subsidize the electricity prices to an unrealistic level, just like we're going to
[03:36:02.520 --> 03:36:07.880]  have Bernie and Hillary give everybody free this, free that, free college education, whatever,
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:09.040]  okay?
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:12.240]  This is the way it always rolls.
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:15.920]  And they're going to make everybody in Venezuela feel better by giving them a minimum wage
[03:36:15.920 --> 03:36:16.920]  increase.
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:20.240]  I mean, this would be a joke if it wasn't so serious.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:26.040]  This is precisely what the Democrats want to do to this country, what Hugo Chavez and
[03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:28.940]  Maduro have done to Venezuela.
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:33.480]  And then the title of the World Net Daily article was absolute genius.
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:37.440]  It was actually taken from a college professor, an author of a book called Take Down from
[03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:42.160]  Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage.
[03:36:42.160 --> 03:36:43.960]  Paul Kinger said this.
[03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:47.800]  He said, now they're talking about in the context, what they're saying is they move
[03:36:47.800 --> 03:36:53.880]  the country's time zone by 30 minutes to try to save energy by getting different daylight
[03:36:53.880 --> 03:36:54.880]  hours.
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:59.040]  And he says, instead of the regime moving the country's time ahead by 30 minutes, they
[03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:02.080]  should be moving it forward into the horizon of free markets.
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:05.840]  Instead, they have looked back to the year 1848.
[03:37:05.840 --> 03:37:11.400]  The year of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, rather than to a future of economic freedom.
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:12.400]  That's just it.
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:16.320]  And of course, we've got Bernie Sanders, who was a throwback to the Sandinistas.
[03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:22.200]  That's why I call him Bernie Sandinista, because he thinks that the problems were solved back
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:24.400]  when we had these wonderful guys.
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:25.400]  They wrote poetry.
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:26.400]  He says, look it up.
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:31.640]  It's absolutely amazing and hilarious, the speech he gave, especially when you look back
[03:37:31.640 --> 03:37:37.960]  with 2020 hindsight, yet Bernie hasn't learned a thing and neither have his supporters.
[03:37:37.960 --> 03:37:42.720]  They don't want to figure out what happened in Nicaragua.
[03:37:42.720 --> 03:37:47.640]  Daniel Ortega that he praises, the Sandinistas that he praises, were nothing but a bunch
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:50.440]  of thugs and kleptocrats.
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:52.800]  They stole everything from everybody.
[03:37:52.800 --> 03:37:57.000]  And of course, they said, oh, it's for the public good until they were being thrown out
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:01.360]  by not only the conservatives, but the liberals, the left and the right threw him out because
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:04.200]  he was nothing but a thief.
[03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:06.800]  And what he did was, then he privatized.
[03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:10.720]  He and his cabinet privatized some of the stuff that they had stolen, privatized it
[03:38:10.720 --> 03:38:11.720]  for themselves.
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:16.880]  And of course, they talk about the fact that they have fixed, listen to some of the metrics
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:17.880]  here.
[03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:21.120]  They fixed the official price of electricity in Venezuela as three cents per kilowatt
[03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:22.920]  hour for businesses.
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:28.240]  Now other people, the unofficial rate, is a half a cent for individuals.
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:32.000]  Now in the United States, the average price is 10 cents a kilowatt hour.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:36.040]  But of course, they subsidized that there, just like Bernie and Hillary and Obama want
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:39.960]  to subsidize free college education at an unrealistic price.
[03:38:39.960 --> 03:38:43.520]  Guess what happens when you subsidize stuff at an unrealistic price?
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:48.440]  You wind up rationing it, you wind up losing it, and that's what's happening with just
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:49.440]  electricity.
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:51.680]  But of course, we've reported on this multiple times.
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:58.560]  It was absolutely amazing that Bloomberg was bragging about Wall Street investors saying,
[03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:04.560]  hey, and this was early part of 2014, covered this many times.
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:08.320]  They said, look, we've got a 700% return on investment from Venezuela.
[03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:12.120]  This is great, even though the people are having to go to adjacent countries in order
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:15.040]  to get food, medicine, water.
[03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:18.120]  They know they have to pay the bankers first.
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:21.000]  And so we're doing good, and we're going to keep doing business in Venezuela, because
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:25.760]  you know, socialism and communism is good for these bankers.
[03:39:25.760 --> 03:39:30.760]  That's why they financed Lenin to start the Russian Revolution.
[03:39:30.760 --> 03:39:36.200]  They sent him from Switzerland into Russia with $10 million in a train, and that was
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:37.800]  a German central banker.
[03:39:37.800 --> 03:39:42.280]  Brother of the guy who helped establish our own Federal Reserve here in the United States.
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:44.080]  It's always been a good deal.
[03:39:44.080 --> 03:39:46.240]  Communism has always been a good deal for these guys.
[03:39:46.240 --> 03:39:47.240]  They love that.
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:48.240]  They love that.
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:50.000]  It fits perfectly, like a hand in the glove.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.920]  And guess who the Wall Street bankers are supporting here, okay?
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:39:59.560]  The closest thing they got to Hugo Chavez, Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:02.760]  Hillary Clinton is consolidating her support among Wall Street donors.
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:04.880]  This is reported by The Wall Street Journal.
[03:40:04.880 --> 03:40:08.280]  It's part of the Never Trump crowd, okay?
[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:11.380]  But they're saying Wall Street donors and other businesses ahead of a general election
[03:40:11.380 --> 03:40:16.280]  battle with Donald Trump are consolidating their support behind Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:16.280 --> 03:40:20.080]  She has received 53% of the donations from Wall Street in March.
[03:40:20.080 --> 03:40:25.880]  Now, this is even before everything consolidated under Trump, okay, before we got the nomination.
[03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:31.000]  I'm sure they were still throwing a lot of money Ted Cruz's way back in March.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:37.040]  They say that was up from 32% last year and up from 33% in January through February.
[03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:38.480]  Now, what's happened?
[03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:43.400]  They used to give a lot of their money to people like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:49.040]  But now that those guys, after they crashed and burned, they gave some money to Ted Cruz,
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:54.140]  but a lot of the Bush and Rubio supporters start coalescing behind Mrs. Clinton.
[03:40:54.140 --> 03:40:55.880]  Because why?
[03:40:55.880 --> 03:40:59.160]  Because socialism works out great for Wall Street.
[03:40:59.160 --> 03:41:02.200]  They are not polar opposites folks.
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:09.160]  They are business partners, just like they are in Nicaragua, just like they are in Venezuela.
[03:41:09.160 --> 03:41:12.120]  Wall Street loves socialism.
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:13.720]  It pays really well for them.
[03:41:13.720 --> 03:41:18.520]  700% return on investment in Venezuela and look at what's happening to the people there
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:22.280]  and look at the solutions that are being put out there by the socialists.
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:27.120]  Minimum wage increase, rationing and green energy, that's going to pull them out.
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:30.880]  Yeah, just like Hillary Clinton is going to take all the shut down all the coal mines,
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:32.280]  take all the jobs.
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:35.560]  But don't worry because they're going to have some kind of green energy that they're going
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:37.040]  to offer them.
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:39.160]  Let's go to your phone calls now.
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:41.080]  Let's go to Greg in Ohio.
[03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:42.080]  Greg?
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:43.080]  Go ahead.
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:45.840]  Thanks for having me, Greg.
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:46.840]  Thanks for holding such a long time.
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:47.840]  Go ahead.
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:48.840]  No problem.
[03:41:48.840 --> 03:41:51.840]  Well, you have proved the point I called in on.
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:57.400]  First, I'd like to say I'm a daily listener and a prison planet subscriber and a proud
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:42:00.480]  owner of an Alexa Pure water filter.
[03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:01.720]  Love the water it puts out.
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:02.720]  Oh, thank you.
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:07.880]  And Secret 12, or X2 and Secret 12 are great products.
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:13.200]  I just ordered my Alexa Pure, so I'm anxious to, it's on its way, so I'm anxious to try
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:14.200]  that as well.
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:15.200]  I love it.
[03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:16.200]  Yeah.
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:17.200]  That's great.
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:22.520]  My wife had a very low B12 level before she started taking Secret 12, and after about
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:27.520]  three months, she got her blood tested again, and she's got like at the top range now for
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:31.400]  her B12 level after taking Secret 12, so I love that.
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:34.400]  I got to say, I'm happy that that happened, but I'm not surprised.
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:39.600]  This is the real stuff, and Alex goes to a great deal of effort to make sure that he
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:44.680]  has top quality stuff that's very pure, and I'm not surprised to see that.
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:50.280]  And as he's mentioned, he wanted to have this product because he himself had had to take
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:55.320]  injections to get his B12 levels up, and so it's very, very effective.
[03:42:55.320 --> 03:42:57.320]  I'm glad to hear that's working for you.
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:42:58.320]  Yeah.
[03:42:58.320 --> 03:43:03.480]  Well, I also wanted to shout out to Big, because when he was up in Detroit area, where I lived
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:07.240]  during the Dearborn Mosque interview, I was one of three guys who came down to support
[03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:11.720]  him and kind of get his back to make sure that, you know, he didn't get any bloody hassle
[03:43:11.720 --> 03:43:15.800]  while he was there, so I got my picture taken with Joe on my Facebook page, so I'm pretty
[03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:16.800]  proud of that.
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:17.800]  That's great.
[03:43:17.800 --> 03:43:18.800]  Thanks for having our back.
[03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:19.800]  And you just...
[03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:20.800]  Mm-hmm.
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:21.800]  Sure.
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  The reason I called you, you made my case.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:23.800]  I've been on hold for like an hour and a quarter.
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:24.800]  I know.
[03:43:24.800 --> 03:43:25.800]  And I'm driving back from my...
[03:43:25.800 --> 03:43:30.600]  I'm driving back from my mom's in North Carolina back to Detroit, and during my trip by last
[03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:35.920]  weekend, today, I've been kind of surfing the radio, listening to some...
[03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:39.440]  I want to get some education, so I thought I'd listen to some progressive radio, and
[03:43:39.440 --> 03:43:46.560]  I tapped into a couple on SiriusXM, and after trying to keep my head from exploding after
[03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:50.480]  listening, I thought, well, I'm going to call in and rebut what they have to say and engage
[03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:56.200]  them in conversation, and I got on within two minutes of making the call in both of
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:00.280]  those shows, which tells me that the liberal talk radio is just dying.
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:01.280]  Yeah.
[03:44:01.280 --> 03:44:02.280]  Because Breitbart...
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:07.620]  You might take a week to get on Breitbart even if you're lucky, but I think that info
[03:44:07.620 --> 03:44:13.680]  warriors could do a lot of good just by calling those shows, and having dialogue with them.
[03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:17.600]  Don't get on the yell, because that doesn't do any good, they'll yell us, but we might
[03:44:17.600 --> 03:44:20.520]  be able to make a point that may help our cause.
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:25.600]  Well, that's right, and if they get upset, just stay calm and keep coming at them with
[03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:26.600]  the facts.
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:27.600]  I mean, that's a great thing to do.
[03:44:27.600 --> 03:44:30.720]  That is absolutely amazing to hear progressive radio.
[03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:36.320]  I was listening to it the other day, and they started talking about this polio vaccine situation
[03:44:36.320 --> 03:44:40.080]  where they're replacing the worldwide supply, and they have two weeks to replace everything
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:44.680]  in the world, and they want it buried or burned, and they're very adamant about that, and
[03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:49.720]  as they were talking, the one lady who was the host there said, well, of course, nobody
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:54.360]  gets polio from these vaccines, and the guy goes, oh, no, actually they do.
[03:44:54.360 --> 03:45:02.520]  It's actually, it's metastasized here, it's mutated, and there's a right word, not metastasized,
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:07.440]  but of course, they do have cancer viruses, and nevertheless, he said it's mutated, and
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:11.840]  people have actually gotten polio from this, so that's one of the reasons why we're changing
[03:45:11.840 --> 03:45:12.840]  it.
[03:45:12.840 --> 03:45:15.680]  I just about pulled off the side of the road when I heard that, because of course, they've
[03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:19.040]  always denied that you could get polio from these vaccines.
[03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:23.880]  They say, well, it's polio-like symptoms, but it's not really polio, you have to understand
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:29.160]  that, so it's truly amazing, sometimes you hear some incredible stuff on the progressive
[03:45:29.160 --> 03:45:30.160]  radio.
[03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:36.080]  I didn't call in though, but that's great, thanks, Greg, I really appreciate you letting
[03:45:36.080 --> 03:45:37.080]  us know about that.
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.120]  Let's go to Mark in Arizona, Mark, you've been holding a long time as well, thank you
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:41.640]  so much for holding, go ahead.
[03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:43.120]  How you doing, David?
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:44.120]  Doing good.
[03:45:44.120 --> 03:45:47.120]  I just, if Alex is still listening, I just want to let him know it's great to see him
[03:45:47.120 --> 03:45:52.800]  smiling so much today, it makes me feel like things are changing for the better, and it
[03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:54.000]  makes me keep the faith.
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:46:00.280]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, I think there's a lot of people who are waking up, yeah, I really do.
[03:46:00.280 --> 03:46:01.280]  Go ahead.
[03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:04.280]  Did we lose your Mark?
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:08.120]  Yeah, go ahead, Mark, go ahead.
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:10.280]  Well, I think we lost him.
[03:46:10.280 --> 03:46:14.920]  One of the things I thought was interesting was, in terms of people waking up, there was
[03:46:14.920 --> 03:46:21.000]  an article talking about Nancy Pelosi and Vincent T. Fox meeting together, and I thought it
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:26.160]  was pretty amazing what Vincent T. Fox, former president of Mexico had to say, he spent a
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:31.320]  half hour with Nancy Pelosi, and they were kind of brainstorming as to how they could
[03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:32.320]  defeat Trump.
[03:46:32.320 --> 03:46:33.320]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:46:33.320 --> 03:46:39.840]  A head of state from a foreign country brainstorming with our former Speaker of the House, now
[03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:45.800]  the House Minority Leader, and they are working together, conspiring on how they can influence
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:50.760]  our election, and Vincent T. Fox said that he's becoming a big fan of Clinton.
[03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:52.360]  I'm sure he always has been.
[03:46:52.360 --> 03:46:56.560]  He compared her to Margaret Thatcher, I don't think so.
[03:46:56.560 --> 03:47:01.360]  And he disparaged Trump supporters as lazy, uneducated TV watching drunks.
[03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:03.240]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:47:03.240 --> 03:47:04.720]  He thinks that we're not awake.
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:09.840]  He says, we need to wake up that citizen, those Trump supporters who are lazy, uneducated
[03:47:09.840 --> 03:47:12.080]  TV watching drunks.
[03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:14.480]  That's what he thinks of you if you support Donald Trump.
[03:47:14.480 --> 03:47:16.040]  You need to be woken up.
[03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:20.280]  He says, we need them to take, we need to take away from them the TV, the drinking and
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:25.360]  the beer, to working hard and to getting the skills, to getting knowledge, and they will
[03:47:25.360 --> 03:47:27.160]  come along like everybody else.
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:34.240]  Well, here's part of the problem, Vincent T. You say that Mexico buys billions of dollars
[03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:38.440]  of items for the United States that create 10 million American jobs, but Trump supporters
[03:47:38.440 --> 03:47:39.760]  still don't respect us.
[03:47:39.760 --> 03:47:40.760]  You know what?
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:48.160]  I don't know where you got your statistics from, but the reality is that we have lost
[03:47:48.160 --> 03:47:49.760]  millions of jobs.
[03:47:49.760 --> 03:47:52.000]  We have a trade deficit with Mexico.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:57.840]  Yeah, they may buy billions of dollars, but we buy tens of billions of dollars from Mexico.
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:02.680]  Since NAFTA, we have seen a trade deficit that used to be up one year for Mexico, up
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:08.120]  one year for U.S. They used to alternate back and forth, plus or minus five billion dollars.
[03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:13.360]  As soon as we passed NAFTA, it shot up to $15 billion deficit and it has continued to
[03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:15.200]  increase since then.
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:18.880]  We had a $60 billion deficit this last year.
[03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:26.120]  We've lost about a trillion dollars to NAFTA in the 23 years that it's been in place.
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:29.760]  And that's one of the reasons maybe why some of these guys are watching TV and getting
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:35.240]  angry is because maybe they don't have jobs because their jobs have been sent to Mexico.
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:40.200]  And then he goes on to say this, what I've been saying here, I told her, count with us,
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:44.240]  count with all Mexicans to support the Democrat Party.
[03:48:44.240 --> 03:48:49.600]  So here we are, Mexicans, both inside our country and outside our country, foreign leaders
[03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:55.680]  are working with the Democrats to try to make sure that Donald Trump doesn't become president
[03:48:55.680 --> 03:48:59.560]  because they have to get rid of us, they have to replace us.
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:03.920]  That's along the lines of the story that we've mentioned a couple of times, cashing in illegal
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:08.480]  immigrants to get $1,261 more welfare than American families.
[03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:12.960]  And of course, we saw just last week, it was a couple of thousand dollars that students
[03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:20.320]  get, the young students get more than retirees who have paid 15% of their wages their entire
[03:49:20.320 --> 03:49:21.320]  working life.
[03:49:21.320 --> 03:49:26.880]  Now, people who just come into this country illegally get more money than somebody who
[03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:28.280]  is retiring on social security.
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:29.880]  And then of course, there's the in-state tuition.
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:35.920]  If you come here as a dreamer, you can get in-state tuition in any of the states, but
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:37.680]  not if you paid taxes here.
[03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:43.040]  So the whole point of in-state tuition was to try to give some relief to the families
[03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:48.400]  who had paid taxes in Texas or paid taxes in Oklahoma, whatever state they lived in.
[03:49:48.400 --> 03:49:52.360]  They would get tuition relief there because they paid taxes, but these people come in
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:56.400]  and they get in-state tuition rates wherever they want to go, even though they have not
[03:49:56.400 --> 03:50:03.680]  paid taxes here, even though they have come here illegally flaunting our laws.
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:07.640]  You kind of get the idea that Obama wants to replace us.
[03:50:07.640 --> 03:50:08.640]  Let me go to Robert.
[03:50:08.640 --> 03:50:10.920]  I know he's been hanging on for a while and we lost the other call.
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:11.920]  Sorry, Mark.
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:14.000]  In Arizona, we weren't able to get that back.
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:15.320]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:16.320]  Go ahead, Robert.
[03:50:16.320 --> 03:50:17.320]  Thanks, David.
[03:50:17.320 --> 03:50:19.360]  I've been listening.
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:23.760]  You were talking about it and there is a huge awakening going on all over the country.
[03:50:23.760 --> 03:50:29.960]  And for the first time, we're really getting to see how popular the pro-America pro-liberty
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:32.720]  movement and how popular it really is.
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:37.920]  And we've got a little bit of a taste of it when Ron Paul was running in 2012, but you
[03:50:37.920 --> 03:50:41.920]  saw the media really come against him in the establishment of the Republican Party.
[03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:45.920]  But now with Donald Trump, we're really getting to see how popular that is and there's a huge
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:46.920]  awakening.
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:50.400]  And to Vintay Fox, I don't watch TV and-
[03:50:50.400 --> 03:50:51.400]  Hang on, Robert.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:52.400]  Hang on just a little bit longer.
[03:50:52.400 --> 03:50:55.800]  We're going to take a break and we'll come right back, let you finish up that call.

[03:55:19.760 --> 03:55:21.760]  Let's go back to Robert in California.
[03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:25.760]  Robert, you were saying that you believe that people are waking up in mass to Donald Trump.
[03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:29.760]  I think we can see that in the numbers, the people who have voted, the people who are showing up in these crowds.
[03:55:29.760 --> 03:55:32.760]  It's absolutely unprecedented from what I've seen.
[03:55:32.760 --> 03:55:39.760]  And yet we have been sent a fox saying, no, we're a bunch of drunks who are watching TV and totally asleep.
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:43.760]  Let me ask you real quickly, what do you think about the back and forth of Paul Ryan?
[03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:53.760]  I think that he's going to be the biggest obstacle that a President Trump would have to getting the globalist policies repealed, putting America first.
[03:55:53.760 --> 03:55:55.760]  What do you think?
[03:55:55.760 --> 03:55:58.760]  Well, I don't think Paul Ryan stands a chance against Donald Trump.
[03:55:58.760 --> 03:56:12.760]  I think the one message I would have for Trump, and I don't need to tell him this obviously, is not to listen to any of the advice that he's getting from the mainstream media to temper his message or water down his politic.
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:17.760]  Because clearly what he's saying and what he's doing is resonating with the American populace.
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:25.760]  And that's why he's winning in landslides, five states in a row, really shutting down the mainstream media.
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:27.760]  And the people are ready for that message.
[03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:29.760]  They've been ready, and they're so hungry for it.
[03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:41.760]  Everywhere I go, if I wear an info-war shirt or if I'm out there with a microphone asking people what they think of Donald Trump, if the friends aren't nearby, they're saying that Donald Trump's a great person and he's going to be the next President.
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:53.760]  Only the people that are watching all these sitcoms and being indoctrinated and have really been inoculated from an Americana-type president like Trump, that's what the whole message is on TV.
[03:56:53.760 --> 03:57:05.760]  And you see it in the news, but also in the sitcoms and all these comedy shows, they're demonizing anybody who speaks an Americana message.
[03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:09.760]  They're talking about conspiracy theorists and people aren't buying it anymore.
[03:57:09.760 --> 03:57:14.760]  The real thing is that the people that are educated aren't listening to them, so it doesn't matter.
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:22.760]  But Sente Fox, you know, his base, the people that he's speaking to are the ones that are watching TV and really being misinformed.
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:26.760]  Well, I hope he keeps on with that, because I think that's really going to help to make a President Trump.
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:30.760]  I think it's going to be very interesting what happens between Donald Trump and Paul Ryanau.
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:33.760]  That's what we really need to call him, Republican and name only, Paul Ryan.
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:45.760]  Because, you know, he is the face of the GOP establishment that repeatedly has campaigned to do things like repeal Obamacare, to get control of the borders, do all these other things, and has refused to do it.
[03:57:45.760 --> 03:57:47.760]  And so I think it's going to be very interesting.
[03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:51.760]  We've got the primary for Paul Ryanau on August the 9th.
[03:57:51.760 --> 03:57:56.760]  And by that time, we should understand how this is going to break down between Donald Trump and Paul Ryan.
[03:57:56.760 --> 03:58:05.760]  I hope Paul Ryan hangs tough so we understand who the enemy is, because if he tries to pretend that he's on the side of Donald Trump and if Donald Trump buys it,
[03:58:05.760 --> 03:58:11.760]  he's going to find that Paul Ryan is going to be his biggest obstacle to getting anything that he says he wants to do done.
[03:58:11.760 --> 03:58:14.760]  So hopefully, we're going to get him primaried out.
[03:58:14.760 --> 03:58:17.760]  It looks like a pretty good guy who's going to be running against him in Wisconsin.
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:19.760]  Well, that's it for our show today.
[03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:26.760]  Join us tonight at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern for the nightly news.
