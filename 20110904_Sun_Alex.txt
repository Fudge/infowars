[00:00.000 --> 00:05.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[00:05.800 --> 00:11.600]  resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:14.600 --> 00:21.340]  Thank you for joining us on this September 4th, 2011, Global Transmission
[00:21.340 --> 00:26.280]  Against Charity. There's a lot of good news happening and I want to get to first
[00:26.280 --> 00:30.600]  and I'll tell you about it's coming up later in this special transmission before
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.480]  the holiday tomorrow. The Wall Street Journal and others have been forced to
[00:36.480 --> 00:41.360]  report on something that we've known well for close to 10 years that the EPA
[00:41.360 --> 00:47.040]  was ordered to lie to the firefighters police and others that were first
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.200]  responders on 9-11 and tell them that the air was safe to breathe. Now Mount
[00:52.200 --> 00:57.600]  Sinai and many other prestigious medical institutions have done major studies
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.200]  even going back seven, eight years right after the event showing that they had
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.480]  as best as poisoning lead, mercury, all sorts of other just toxins filling their
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.280]  lungs and that there have been massive increases in the rate of cancer and
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.120]  deaths not just in the first responders and then the cleanup crew and the
[01:18.120 --> 01:23.800]  aftermath but also in the police rescue dogs. So here's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:23.800 --> 01:31.520]  Study points to WTC cancer risk rates among firefighters who are at site
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.120]  higher than for those who weren't. Firefighters who worked at round zero or
[01:36.120 --> 01:40.800]  19% more likely. I've seen other studies that have chosen even worse who have
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.200]  cancer than their colleagues who did not work at the site according to newly
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.120]  published research that could pave the way for government payments to those
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.000]  suffering from some types of cancer. I thought we got a law passed to finally
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.720]  give them health care. Well no they still don't get treatment for cancer but
[02:01.720 --> 02:09.360]  we're moving in the right direction. Continuing with some good news as you
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.920]  know the acting director of the ATF he never got confirmed has had to step down
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.480]  he's been caught perjuring himself and he squealed and blew the whole thing
[02:18.480 --> 02:23.520]  wide open that there were six government agencies involved not just the
[02:23.520 --> 02:30.480]  ATF FBI DEA but Border Patrol Coast Guard IRS and others involved in
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.920]  shipping tens of thousands of farms into Mexico Honduras and other areas into
[02:34.920 --> 02:41.320]  gangs around the United States to knock out their drug dealing competition and
[02:41.320 --> 02:47.960]  then blame the second amendment. So internationally it's about destabilization
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.720]  and arming gangs that knock out their drug dealing competition to the in favor
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.040]  of the gangs that launder their money through globalist banks and domestically
[02:56.040 --> 03:03.920]  about demonizing the second amendment. Now in bad news and we were proven right
[03:03.920 --> 03:10.480]  unfortunately yet again Libyan rebels round up blacks put them in prison camps
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.160]  the Associated Press is now having to admit that several weeks on as the
[03:15.160 --> 03:22.560]  quote rebels the al-Qaeda backed Western backed groups are engaged in a
[03:22.560 --> 03:26.360]  scorched earth policy killing black Libyans there's always been some racial
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.840]  slash tribal strife between the predominantly Arab area of North
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.680]  Africa and the black indigenous population that's always been there and
[03:35.680 --> 03:40.040]  Gaddafi had kind of had a multicultural type view on that one of the things the
[03:40.040 --> 03:45.200]  dictator I guess wasn't wasn't too bad on and so now things have gone from bad
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.880]  to worse and it's a giant humanitarian disaster we need to point out this is
[03:49.880 --> 03:56.720]  nothing but a giant NATO power grab a resource power grab and that this is the
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.000]  new UN model for warfare they come in the globalist covertly finance rebels
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.840]  they militarily strike it's called a humanitarian disaster and when we must
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.680]  send in NATO and troops to bomb and attack to liberate the country and then
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.320]  it actually causes the humanitarian disaster that they claimed that they
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.400]  were fighting against now coming up I'm gonna re-air that interview we did with
[04:20.400 --> 04:26.000]  Ron Paul from Wednesday because it was so powerful and I'm asking all of you to

[06:05.160 --> 06:12.240]  Jones well he's the hardest working statesman we've got up there at the
[06:12.240 --> 06:17.520]  federal government level and of course congressman Ron Paul is one of the few
[06:17.520 --> 06:21.000]  statesmen we've got and we've only got him for 15 minutes so let's get right
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.240]  into it congressman what do you make of the super congress and the fact that
[06:26.240 --> 06:33.840]  congress was not able to even be involved in the Libya operation well to
[06:33.840 --> 06:39.640]  course it to me it's an outrage first super congress is some some new fangled
[06:39.640 --> 06:43.440]  invention by the people who couldn't solve the problems up there and weren't
[06:43.440 --> 06:46.760]  willing to cut anything so they're just going to pick 12 people who are supposed
[06:46.760 --> 06:51.400]  to you know pick out the things to really cut so I have no confidence that
[06:51.400 --> 06:55.560]  they'll achieve anything and even if they did it be risky because why should we
[06:55.560 --> 06:59.080]  turn the whole Congress over to 12 individuals to make these decisions so
[06:59.080 --> 07:04.680]  I don't anticipate that they're going to come up with a solution if they did
[07:04.680 --> 07:08.760]  they'll probably be raising taxes and they probably won't cut any money away
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.520]  from some of this militarism going on there they haven't even been brave enough
[07:13.520 --> 07:18.080]  to cut the money from Libya so I don't expect a whole lot to happen from that
[07:18.080 --> 07:24.680]  super congress congressman is there any recourse with Obama telling Congress I
[07:24.680 --> 07:29.400]  don't need your authority to go to war in Libya I have the UN giving me of the
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.560]  authority and I quote do this for their credibility I mean it are we just gonna
[07:33.560 --> 07:37.960]  I guess sit here collectively I mean I know you've been fighting it and just
[07:37.960 --> 07:41.920]  allow the power of the purse and the power of war to more and more move to
[07:41.920 --> 07:46.240]  the executive I'm afraid that people aren't going to demand it and the
[07:46.240 --> 07:51.240]  Congress won't respond and there's a few of us you know the file suit and we try
[07:51.240 --> 07:56.320]  to fight it and vote against the funding but we never get the majority but you
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.680]  know it's not like it's brand new I know this is an outrage but you know it's
[08:00.680 --> 08:04.200]  pretty much what's been going on since Truman Truman actually you know did that
[08:04.200 --> 08:10.120]  on Korea and of course we still are spending money on Korea so on at dead
[08:10.120 --> 08:13.680]  times they would come a president would come and get token approval they never
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.560]  get a declaration of war it's just a token approval to do what I want if I
[08:17.560 --> 08:23.400]  want to fight a war I can and Congress is expected to finance it so we've we've
[08:23.400 --> 08:27.760]  given up a lot over the last hundred years and I think the responsibility of
[08:27.760 --> 08:32.680]  the Congress to be the final decision-maker on going to war that's
[08:32.680 --> 08:36.760]  been long gone lost but that's one of the things we've all been fighting for is
[08:36.760 --> 08:43.880]  trying to restore that principle to our country recently shifting into monetary
[08:43.880 --> 08:48.320]  issues you had Bernanke on the hot seat you said is gold money and he said no
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.640]  it's not to their their counterfeit fellow reserve notes are now we've seen
[08:52.640 --> 08:56.560]  two weeks ago on Meet the Press the former head of the fellow reserve
[08:56.560 --> 08:59.800]  Greenspan I'm sure you saw it say hey we're not going to default we'll just
[08:59.800 --> 09:04.480]  print money but isn't that a form of default that's that inflation tax you've
[09:04.480 --> 09:08.120]  been talking about and another way of cheating people that have have bought
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.200]  the treasuries I mean it's it's it's looking more and more like Hitler and
[09:12.200 --> 09:19.080]  his bunker to watch the fellow reserve giggling about what they're doing once
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.760]  the country gets this indebted they never pay their bills they can't work
[09:23.760 --> 09:27.000]  their way out theoretically we could you know if we did all those things
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.720]  necessary but in reality countries don't and especially if you end up over 40%
[09:33.720 --> 09:39.000]  of the money you need to operate if you have to borrow it is at a point almost of
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.640]  no return so they have to liquidate the debt first they won't admit we're in
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.520]  bankruptcy because they've been able to pawn it off an American taxpayer by
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.360]  raising taxes and playing the currency and borrowing around the world but we
[09:54.360 --> 10:00.360]  literally are bankrupt so the debt has to be liquidated and it is true we won't
[10:00.360 --> 10:06.440]  default on the debt in the sense that they they won't pay off the holders of
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.840]  bonds they'll always be paid off just like the holders of the obligations for
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.680]  Social Security will always send the check but what they don't have control on
[10:14.680 --> 10:18.920]  is the value of that money they sent matter of fact it is a deliberate
[10:18.920 --> 10:25.200]  policy of the Fed and Bernanke has essentially admitted this that the only
[10:25.200 --> 10:29.000]  way we can get out of this is inflation some of the some of the liberal
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.040]  economists are saying what what this economy really needs is an inflation
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.480]  rate of about 6% and so he's actually they're actually encouraging the
[10:38.480 --> 10:42.840]  inflation in order for the real debt to go down obviously if your dollar loses
[10:42.840 --> 10:50.320]  50% in purchasing power your real debt goes down 50% so 50% inflation which
[10:50.320 --> 10:55.280]  they're liable to get the real debt goes from 14 down to 7 but the real
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.640]  problem is everybody doesn't suffer equally some people suffer more some
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.120]  people actually benefit and the middle class generally gets wiped out and if
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.600]  they want to aim for five 10 or 15 or 30% inflation they don't have control of
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.200]  it it may turn into 100% inflation and it'll get out of control and that's
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.320]  what I think is our greatest danger right now congressman has been said by a
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.720]  lot of pundits that you're a prophet I think Al Sharpton even said that and it
[11:21.720 --> 11:25.920]  they can't deny that basically everything you've talked about has now come
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.360]  true and they say Ron Paul's on a mission he's certainly educating people so at
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.600]  least they're admitting that you are in a war of ideas and that you're trying to
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.160]  change the course of history and I would say successfully doing that win lose
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.400]  or draw but but getting some into the campaign even when you were on Neil
[11:43.400 --> 11:47.240]  Cavuto yesterday or a few days ago I saw it on YouTube last night not sure when
[11:47.240 --> 11:50.720]  you know he kept saying too bad you can't win I sure love you too bad you
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.200]  can't win so it was kind of a back slap in a smiley way I'm not attacking
[11:55.200 --> 11:58.680]  Cavuto but but the issue is in every poll I've seen I watch it you've been
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.440]  number one number two or number three for the last six months and you you win
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.560]  the New Hampshire straw poll you get a technical tie even when they're buying
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.160]  the votes in Iowa and they put out this hoax that you can't win but then
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.600]  meanwhile and this is what I want you to speak to you've got Romney who's the
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.660]  Obamacare author his model it's now come out that not only was Perry the campaign
[12:21.660 --> 12:26.080]  manager in Texas for Gore but that now we learned in 93 he gave speeches and
[12:26.080 --> 12:31.680]  wrote letters endorsing Hillary care worse than Obamacare and forced
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.040]  Gardasil shots sir so I know you're a gentleman but it all hinges in my
[12:36.040 --> 12:39.200]  political opinion you can correct me if I'm wrong you have much greater
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.000]  gravitas than I on you going after these people because they are basically like
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.440]  Obama but they look more like Ronald Reagan I mean what do you say about
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.680]  these two establishment hacks that the system is exalting as our you know as
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.920]  our new leader but generally over the years I've allowed their policies to
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.400]  speak for themselves and their policies are now failing wholesale that's why our
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.640]  voice is growing in strength and credibility because everything they
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.560]  say and do and advocate is is a total failure where is the war is a fighter
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.080]  that printing of the money you're running up these debts and and all these
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.760]  proposals for the bureaucracy I mean just think of the size of government over
[13:19.760 --> 13:23.440]  the last the growth of the government over these last 50 years it's been
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.480]  horrendous so I think that that is such glaring evidence that you all I don't
[13:29.480 --> 13:33.880]  you know I don't you know rally the thought of just really accusing of all
[13:33.880 --> 13:39.080]  sorts of things because they're all to blame and it's bigger than one person I
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.200]  understand but those are the guys that they're selling your voters mainline
[13:43.200 --> 13:48.320]  Republicans libertarians conservatives I mean Rick Perry has gone from doubling
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.640]  you know the size of Texas government in 10 years to to saying basically that
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.680]  he's you know I'm the real Ron Paul I'm Rick Perry and you know the Federal
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.280]  Reserve is almost treacherous her treasonous I mean he's trying to become
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.600]  you so what do you say to that well I think that people have to realize and
[14:04.600 --> 14:07.560]  look at his record when they look at his record they know that he's a flip
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.360]  hopper I mean how could what he say I'd be much different than what Romney has
[14:12.360 --> 14:18.240]  done with his medical care system up in Massachusetts and you're right
[14:18.240 --> 14:25.040]  Perry has endorsed Hillary's program but the American people you know I guess
[14:25.040 --> 14:30.080]  one reason why it seems so obvious to me why does anybody even have to elect her
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.560]  people why don't they just wake up and look at history and investigate a little
[14:34.560 --> 14:41.080]  bit I think more and more coming out I you know I I think Terry you know it's
[14:41.080 --> 14:46.880]  gonna be a very very formal politician and he may well walk off with it but
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.320]  it's the sad state of affairs if the people don't wake up and look at their
[14:51.320 --> 14:56.400]  records you know how can they be so happy about like you like you said he
[14:56.400 --> 15:04.440]  was the chairman for Al Gore in Texas in what 1980 1988 handing roads over to
[15:04.440 --> 15:09.160]  center of Spain Bilderberg group meetings forced inoculations I mean the
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.880]  fact is he's doing all this stuff now not just in 93 praising Hillary what
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.840]  person in their right mind would support Hillary care I mean I was I was 18
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.440]  years old when they were trying to Ram 3 we're 17 and I knew it was bad when I
[15:23.440 --> 15:29.080]  was 17 so right there it shows he's got major judgment problems people in
[15:29.080 --> 15:34.160]  Washington I've known for years and those generally who run for presidency the
[15:34.160 --> 15:39.800]  only thing that motivates them is power and it's it's not sound ideas it's not
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.720]  freedom and they're they're locked in on this power struggle both parties are
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.600]  this way the parties pretend they're different and they have different
[15:49.600 --> 15:55.760]  rhetoric but you know regardless of which which party's in control they end up
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.760]  doing the same thing
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.960]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that

[18:21.040 --> 18:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[18:25.120 --> 18:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[18:29.680 --> 18:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[20:20.840 --> 20:31.640]  Command Center in the heart of the resistance rallying Patriots worldwide
[20:31.640 --> 20:52.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[21:02.400 --> 21:07.840]  and the ability to provide special benefits to those special interests they
[21:07.840 --> 21:11.440]  put them in the power yes sir the reason why things are so different today is
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.760]  we're bankrupt and that's why this is all going to come to an end so the big
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.320]  question is who's going to pick up the pieces now and who's going to lead the
[21:21.320 --> 21:25.840]  charge away from the drift where we have gone to you know in the last really
[21:25.840 --> 21:31.840]  hundred years whether it's foreign policy or market policy IRS and and the
[21:31.840 --> 21:35.440]  and if they hadn't all these things have gone on for a long time I think it's
[21:35.440 --> 21:41.040]  coming to an end yes sir and that's why what we're doing now all of us you know
[21:41.040 --> 21:45.920]  it's so important and I think their failures are going to speak for themselves
[21:45.920 --> 21:50.960]  if it's going to be there their failures are shouting out very loud about how
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.720]  poorly their ideas are working we've only got about four minutes left with
[21:55.720 --> 21:59.720]  you sir so I want to move quickly here obviously when you say he may well walk
[21:59.720 --> 22:04.040]  away with it you are within striking distance if we can just expose the
[22:04.040 --> 22:07.400]  hoax that is Rick Perry and then the other minion Mitt Romney you are going
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.760]  to have it sir and it's perfect timing you're the man of the hour God has
[22:11.760 --> 22:15.560]  literally you know given you to us that you've been right all these years never
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.360]  compromised right as America's collapsing here you are with the
[22:19.360 --> 22:25.200]  constitutional tried and true common sense solutions but if you do lose you
[22:25.200 --> 22:31.720]  still win by educating people but but you say that you're gonna go home after
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.080]  this when you're when your term is up if you don't win the presidency if you
[22:36.080 --> 22:39.720]  don't win the presidency and leave sir are you still gonna write and speak no
[22:39.720 --> 22:44.360]  I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't do that I've always thought that I've
[22:44.360 --> 22:48.960]  always done the same thing with I'm in office or out of office or whatever and
[22:48.960 --> 22:53.880]  the goals have always been the same the elected position has generally been
[22:53.880 --> 22:57.920]  secondary the one thing is if you're in the business of trying to change the
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.480]  course of a country you can do a much better job if you're in office and
[23:02.480 --> 23:07.280]  obviously you as president I can do a much better job than if I'm just
[23:07.280 --> 23:14.160]  looking for a format and wondering where I'll go next so no I it's more or less
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.400]  out of my hands I just do what I have to do and we'll see how things come out so
[23:18.400 --> 23:21.360]  we'll still be able to have you pop in from time to time even if you do
[23:21.360 --> 23:26.080]  retire I'm going to be around you are you are awesome sir a final questions
[23:26.080 --> 23:29.800]  here because this is why I know you're so real not just that you don't
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.400]  compromise and not just your perfect constitutional voting record I hope
[23:33.400 --> 23:36.680]  everybody gets behind you campaign for liberty as well all the other great
[23:36.680 --> 23:42.560]  candidates a donated Ron Paul 2012 comm knock on doors get involved in your
[23:42.560 --> 23:47.480]  party precincts become a delegate Ron Paul can win and will win if we get
[23:47.480 --> 23:50.760]  behind him he's put his hat in the ring and is pouring his heart and soul out
[23:50.760 --> 23:56.000]  it's up to us to get behind Ron Paul or wish later by gnashing our teeth that we
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.560]  would have but sir in closing last year at a campaign for liberty event you
[23:59.560 --> 24:03.400]  talked about a coup in America you said the CIA has been caught shipping drugs
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.320]  in we've had a coup in America I want you to specifically because I got a lot
[24:07.320 --> 24:13.240]  of questions about that to this day what you exactly meant by that well what
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.440]  I imagine if you can be done in the literal sense of what a coup generally
[24:18.440 --> 24:24.480]  is probably not quite that but for the CIA to really be running the show that
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.600]  I was referring to the CIA at the time because it's so secretive it's it's
[24:28.600 --> 24:33.320]  somewhat like the secrets of the Federal Reserve in finance is it so hard to
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.840]  find out what's going on but the CIA is involved in war there they they are
[24:38.840 --> 24:44.720]  involved in military activity they pick targets from Langley in the in the
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.920]  Alexander you know in in Virginia they can shoot missiles to any spot in the
[24:48.920 --> 24:52.480]  world generally killing a lot of people they shouldn't be killing and missing
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.760]  the ones they're trying to target so therefore it is totally secret that this
[24:56.760 --> 25:02.120]  is even out of you know out of the realm of what Obama does when he says well I'm
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.080]  going in and I'm going to be with NATO and I'm gonna start bombing Libya I
[25:06.080 --> 25:13.640]  think this is a very serious and now we have the DOD person portrays going over
[25:13.640 --> 25:20.200]  the CIA and then the CIA head going over to the military it it's such a mixed
[25:20.200 --> 25:25.280]  deal that we don't know exactly what's happening but I know the CIA has been
[25:25.280 --> 25:29.280]  involved in so many elections around the world they pick and choose dictators
[25:29.280 --> 25:32.280]  I'm sure they're and I don't think there's any doubt they're very much
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.640]  involved in these revolutions going on in the Mediterranean and we're just out
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.720]  trying to pick dictators so I don't I just don't like all this secrecy and
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.160]  government out of the control of the people who are responsible well
[25:46.160 --> 25:49.160]  congressman we've got to let you go I want to ask you one last question and
[25:49.160 --> 25:54.320]  just remind folks to get behind Ronnie Ron Paul 2012.com speaking of FEMA you've
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.800]  been criticized for saying we don't need FEMA but all they do is confiscate guns
[25:57.800 --> 26:01.720]  at Katrina that's really not the federal government's job I guess but you were
[26:01.720 --> 26:07.200]  asked by a reporter Robert Lanick a few weeks ago in Iowa about the HR 645
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.080]  National Emergency Centers Establishment Act and you said yeah that's their goal
[26:11.080 --> 26:14.900]  they're setting up the stage for violence in this country no doubt about it
[26:14.900 --> 26:21.120]  responded Paul sir in conclusion what did you mean by that who are they well
[26:21.120 --> 26:28.720]  I'm not even sure I recall that exact conversation but you know the FEMA is in
[26:28.720 --> 26:35.600]  charge of all emergency so whether it's a natural disaster or whatever they're
[26:35.600 --> 26:41.320]  in charge of our land they're land planners they're economic planners and
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.560]  they're planning for anti-provision and they I think the
[26:45.560 --> 26:50.080]  establishment of people in Washington those Republicans and Democrats know
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.360]  history just like we do that you can have breakdown of law and order so the
[26:55.360 --> 27:01.080]  people unfortunately will be begging for for a stabilization and they'll be
[27:01.080 --> 27:04.480]  inviting the federal government to come in to stabilize things so I think they're
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.760]  making plans along those lines to how how they take care of a problem when
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.320]  there's a breakdown of law and order and they'd like that power grab that's
[27:12.320 --> 27:18.000]  that's their goal it's all about power congressman Ron Paul Ron Paul 2012 comm
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.080]  sir thank you so much for spending time with us okay good to talk to you good to

[27:50.880 --> 27:55.880]  have to agree I admire Ron Paul more than anybody else out there alive unless
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.560]  come at my dad or somebody or my grandpa's but politically he's it and if

[28:19.880 --> 28:24.160]  been told a lot of folks that know him more than I one and a half maybe two
[28:24.160 --> 28:31.600]  days a month all the rest of time stoic research radio interviews all he does is
[28:31.600 --> 28:37.480]  exercise for one hour in the morning he doesn't even hardly eat anything I've
[28:37.480 --> 28:43.280]  been in events with Ron Paul's he doesn't eat he barely sleeps and you can

[33:38.040 --> 33:46.240]  we've been reporting on fast and furious for six years that's right before we knew
[33:46.240 --> 33:51.800]  the name of the secret federal program to train who lost Zeta's at Fort Benning
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.520]  Georgia then have them engage in a fake defection forming their own border drug
[33:57.520 --> 34:03.880]  cartel Selle Castile and many other sources here in Texas Selle Castile
[34:03.880 --> 34:10.600]  of course retired DEA agent had said that a coming war over narcotics and the
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.760]  five hundred billion coming in a year most of it through Mexico heroin and
[34:14.760 --> 34:19.840]  cocaine that there would be a war over that five hundred billion dollars in
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.920]  that well just three years ago that Los Zeta's had tried to recruit him to
[34:24.920 --> 34:31.800]  train people near the King Ranch down by Kingsville Texas and now it's all
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.680]  happened and at first ATF agents began to blow the whistle about the fact that
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.880]  they were basically ordering gunshots to let certain key people come in and buy
[34:41.880 --> 34:48.440]  masses of firearms to then take them into Mexico now we've learned and this has
[34:48.440 --> 34:52.280]  come out in federal court in Chicago it's been reported on by the Chicago
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.240]  Tribune and the El Paso Times of course Paul Watson saw it in the federal
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.240]  record months ago before they even covered it proud of our work at prison
[35:01.240 --> 35:07.960]  planet dot com and info wars dot com now it has come out that indeed they were
[35:07.960 --> 35:15.280]  shipping the guns directly to the drug cartels not just in Mexico but in Miami
[35:15.280 --> 35:21.200]  Florida Chicago Illinois Los Angeles California and other cities and how did
[35:21.200 --> 35:27.720]  all this happen the rats began to bite at each other the head of the ATF what
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.960]  three months ago was caught perjuring himself before Congress and ATF agents
[35:33.960 --> 35:39.360]  who he was hanging out to dry released the orders the documents the memos and
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.400]  the emails ordering them to do this he was trying to deny it then he came out
[35:46.400 --> 35:51.820]  and said okay I was ordered to by Eric Holder the head of the Justice
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.960]  Department the Attorney General and then he said here's more documents don't
[35:55.960 --> 36:04.080]  blame me the FBI and DEA were involved well now that's all mainstream news DEA
[36:04.080 --> 36:13.440]  FBI ATF shipping guns to Honduras to Mexico and to drug gangs in major
[36:13.440 --> 36:23.080]  cities major distribution points Chicago Miami Los Angeles and now it's coming
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.320]  out that the same thing was going on in areas of New Mexico Texas we're
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.320]  learning more every day what a window into the fact that this federal
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.000]  government is gangster at the top and has put its gangsters in most of the
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.960]  high-level and mid-level positions and are now trying to purge good people now
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.760]  it gives me some faith in America that we can still turn this around that it
[36:50.760 --> 36:56.960]  was ATF agents five of them some of them mid-level senior in their area that
[36:56.960 --> 36:59.800]  said we're not going to be part of this and leaked the information that went
[36:59.800 --> 37:05.760]  public they were either fired or demoted and of course it came out two weeks
[37:05.760 --> 37:11.520]  ago as the Attorney General tries to cover this up that the supervisors that
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.440]  blocked the information and threatened reprisals they of course the LA Times
[37:17.440 --> 37:24.280]  reported have now been given raises and elevated to the national level with
[37:24.280 --> 37:34.240]  Kush desk jobs now so this is a criminal mafia that a wanted to get guns to
[37:34.240 --> 37:40.000]  cartels trained by the Pentagon to consolidate the flow of drugs into the
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.600]  United States through Mexico and also out of Central and South America we now
[37:43.600 --> 37:49.240]  learn that's mainstream news a month ago came out now continuing
[37:49.240 --> 37:55.600]  domestically it had the added goodie of blaming the Second Amendment and I saw
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.520]  Holder two years ago saying we've got to pass gun laws we've got a ban assault
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.480]  weapons we've got a restrict me buying more than one gun because of the
[38:03.480 --> 38:07.800]  violence in Mexico and then even after he got caught he rolled out as you know
[38:07.800 --> 38:11.160]  about a month and a half ago and went ahead and said I don't need a stinking
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.240]  law Congress wouldn't pass this law they tried to pass it so now in four
[38:16.240 --> 38:22.760]  states Texas to Mexico Arizona California wait is Nevada involved is it
[38:22.760 --> 38:33.000]  five no it's four in those four states they now outside of law do whatever the
[38:33.000 --> 38:42.240]  ATF says and they're going to people that go in and buy a high-powered rifle or
[38:42.240 --> 38:46.560]  buy a thousand rounds of ammo I see in the news every day that they're then
[38:46.560 --> 38:54.280]  being ATF visited or even SWAT team and I'll see in the news man had 27 guns and
[38:54.280 --> 38:58.080]  4,000 rounds of ammo and they'll have neighbors saying it's so frightening and
[38:58.080 --> 39:03.760]  it's you know the retired veteran has been arrested in fact I was mailed one
[39:03.760 --> 39:08.880]  of these do pointed it out to me this morning the Orleans County record out of

[39:30.000 --> 39:35.240]  so he can make money and shell guns he's a registered federal firearms dealer
[39:35.240 --> 39:39.880]  and they say right here they confiscated his firearms and they say
[39:39.880 --> 39:43.440]  there's no charges and that they're just taking them and that's the end of it

[50:36.480 --> 50:42.880]  into his awakening and he started to you you you've gotten to the point of
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.920]  talking to folks selling books on the street please continue
[50:45.920 --> 50:53.280]  yeah so there was a guy named Dr. Hill you know he had he had a community in
[50:53.280 --> 50:59.840]  Brooklyn or the answer law community and basically yeah there's people out in the
[50:59.840 --> 51:04.240]  street selling books and the Muslim boy who was in different things like that
[51:04.240 --> 51:07.800]  like incense and stuff like that so I just stopped at the table to pick up this
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.280]  coconut because I like to ask no you know cuz the girls liked it so at the
[51:12.280 --> 51:17.680]  table they would sell these books written by Dr. Hill you know man it was a
[51:17.680 --> 51:23.120]  book it was the first books that I've read books on like the holidays one
[51:23.120 --> 51:31.480]  book was about Christmas Easter and showed like the origin of these pagan
[51:31.480 --> 51:36.920]  you know evil holidays so I picked it up and I was like what the hell is this
[51:36.920 --> 51:41.200]  they had one the Christmas book at the Santa Claus looking like Satan on the
[51:41.200 --> 51:45.760]  cover they were just like strange I never saw nothing like that before you
[51:45.760 --> 51:50.760]  know I was only like 16 I picked up the book and I started getting into it and I
[51:50.760 --> 51:55.360]  started learning who Dr. York is and what he's about and the stuff that he
[51:55.360 --> 52:02.320]  teaches and I started reading a lot of his books and I realized that you know
[52:02.320 --> 52:10.000]  this dude was basically teaching you know people especially black people you
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.920]  know about our origin and where we come from and how we you know we we have a
[52:14.920 --> 52:22.560]  great history in this world and how we were like basically our brainwashed you
[52:22.560 --> 52:29.040]  know and so lost of all of our history and who we are and everything well that's
[52:29.040 --> 52:34.040]  right if you go back to Roman times no one looked at and said black men were
[52:34.040 --> 52:40.440]  inferior I mean that wasn't even you know debated or or discussed and you
[52:40.440 --> 52:43.600]  can lay out your historical review but what really from my research you go
[52:43.600 --> 52:48.200]  back 500 years ago they wanted to start this transatlantic slave trade and they
[52:48.200 --> 52:52.160]  had indentured servants who were white in Europe but they said hey we can use
[52:52.160 --> 52:57.920]  Bible passages and distort them dealing with ham and can enable and say that
[52:57.920 --> 53:02.040]  these people deserve to be slaves and it actually took some selling but because
[53:02.040 --> 53:06.120]  the sailors themselves from Europe were mainly pressed and slaves on the ships
[53:06.120 --> 53:10.200]  if you actually research it I mean most of them were captured and put on the
[53:10.200 --> 53:14.280]  ships to run them that's why there were so many people breaking off and
[53:14.280 --> 53:19.800]  becoming pirates that then they sold that idea and that really is an idea that
[53:19.800 --> 53:26.160]  didn't exist a lot 500 years ago exactly you know they they they flipped it in a
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.520]  lot of the Bible so-called Bible stories and all that or whatever so you
[53:32.520 --> 53:36.840]  know Dr. York was just putting it out there you know me and really you know
[53:36.840 --> 53:41.720]  exposing it to the world you know and sharing information with everybody and
[53:41.720 --> 53:45.640]  accepting everybody also you know no matter what cover you are no matter what
[53:45.640 --> 53:50.960]  ratio it was teaching that this is information that need to be you know
[53:50.960 --> 53:55.480]  just that that needs to be put out there needs to be learned when you start
[53:55.480 --> 53:58.720]  learning about the Illuminati because you told me you've seen the Obama
[53:58.720 --> 54:03.920]  deception you know the radio show you I said well what's your favorite clip and
[54:03.920 --> 54:08.600]  you said the Bohemian Grove the the David Gurdian situation
[54:08.600 --> 54:37.600]  I mean through his books you know through Doc books that's how I learned about it that's how I pumped into it because you know it all coincides with each other you know I mean once you start learning the origin of things and you start learning you know the background things always going on you're gonna stumble on this word Illuminati and you're gonna stumble on you know the whole diabolical plan and the whole grand scheme of things and what's happening you know I mean so
[54:37.600 --> 55:03.600]  that's how I bumped into it and then you know later on years down the line you know I started doing research to me I'm like is this man I'm like this is too unbelievable the information that I was learning was like too incredible you know what I mean so it forces you to do your own research it forces you like back then it wasn't no internet when I was going up you know what I mean so I had to do the library you know what I mean and check books out
[55:03.600 --> 55:25.600]  that's what I did the exact same thing so you you've been awake for close to 30 years yeah I mean I've been I've been learning ever since I was like 16 I've been learning doing research so you know I'm 36 now you know what I mean so that's about yeah 20 years you know what I mean I've been really doing my research you know what I mean and I'm studying this whole thing
[55:25.600 --> 55:53.600]  you know so I started in the lobby these funny old books and just like passing around information they used to get passed around the street like different VHS videotapes that a lot of the people that I knew in the street life like a lot of my criminal friends you know they weren't old just you know just dumb criminals running around a lot of them were very intelligent you know what I mean a lot of them
[55:53.600 --> 56:10.600]  now that's the economy like they say in the godfather that for 100 years they've been shipping the illegal contraband into those black neighborhoods to make that the zone where it was acceptable so people say oh look these people are criminals the point is that's that's the the economy that was set up there by the system
[56:10.600 --> 56:38.600]  exactly you know I mean exactly you know it's a stereotypical thing that people look at us like whatever he just said or whatever you know I mean but anyway a lot of my friends you know I mean we would pass around information to each other videotapes are like I think it was called the lumen 92,000 or it was just crazy show and we used to watch it and I'll forget the God's name
[56:38.600 --> 56:46.600]  Anthony Hilder exactly Anthony Hilder and the other guy with the glasses
[56:46.600 --> 57:15.600]  Ted Gunderson he just died over the weekend so we used to watch those we used to pass them around and this is how we got more into it we like there I started seeing these tapes I'm like hold up this is the same thing that Dr. Noevers talking about so I started the dots started connecting you know what I mean that when the internet came around
[57:15.600 --> 57:32.600]  I was you know research all the things that I was learning from Hilder, Maxwell, York and from everybody that I bumped into you your information you know Alex Jones and I'm like wow everybody is saying the same thing
[57:45.600 --> 57:48.600]  you
[58:15.600 --> 58:22.600]  you know what I mean

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:57.600]  we're being maneuvered into financial slavery the Dow's down 350 points plunging total fear is the CNN headline we're going to be getting into some more of this news throughout the hour obviously as it develops this is all part of an orchestrated program
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:17.600]  and no puppet George Bush Barack Obama or Mitt Romney is going to save you it's the Federal Reserve or us it's the king dragon rulers of this system they have to come down not their puppets now Prodigy of mob deep legendary icon of hip hop and ramp is our guest really exposing the Illuminati
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:32.600]  program and we were getting into you know folks you know coming in and saying we're trying to wake up you know folks and they're not listening it's because they're following a false mirage a false culture sold to them by the social engineers
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:47.600]  but the good news is we're beginning to break through and one of the most common questions I get is get Prodigy on now he's talking about stuff you're talking about so here he is sir and you got cut off by the break this is a short segment you're talking about people have to want it
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.600]  and then let's get into your view on the Illuminati and who's running this system
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:02:09.600]  yeah so you know like I was saying you know it's hard to get people to listen and to get people to want to change they gotta want their change on their own that that'll never happen you can't force somebody to want to change their life and change their way of thinking
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:24.600]  to understand what's really going on that they've been manipulated their parents and their grandparents have been manipulated you know it's hard to break somebody out of that stuff you know and that way of thinking in that and their belief system
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:41.600]  you know I mean they're in a comfortable space where you know it just shatters their whole entire world like and their way of thinking it hurts too much it's way too comfortable for them to just stay the way they are you know I mean
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:50.600]  well it's like Neo in the matrix when Morpheus gives him the red pill and he goes look all I'm offering is the truth nothing else
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  yeah exactly so you know that's a difficult thing you know and I found that real challenging you know I mean growing up in a you know dealing with the environment that I come from you know that street world where you know it's a lot of knuckleheads you know I mean it's real difficult to reach them
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  you know I mean so yeah I had to learn the hard way that you know I could I just sit back and the people that around me that notice what I'm all about and the things that I've learned and you know the things that I put in my music a lot and those that want that change in their life they'll come to me I don't even have to find them you know I mean
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:04:06.600]  how did you begin to awaken I mean it was it was about 1989 you know I went to high school in Manhattan I went to art and design where I met my music partner Havoc you know me and back then they used to have these tables out in the street on random corners like Queens and Manhattan Bronx and Brooklyn all the five brothers whatever
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:30.600]  they used to have these tables and it was like Muslim guys selling books you know I mean or they looked like they were Muslim to me you know I mean because they had on the garb the hats and you know the whole get up whatever so I used to stop at the tables and I used to buy this coconut oil because it smelled like a hot smell you know I mean
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:59.600]  yes stay there well let's come back we've got prodigy of mob deep on with us right now long segment coming up and also prodigy and we come back let's plug all your websites and things there's so many of them I want to make sure I get the right ones out so we'll drop those on people on the other side I'm Alex Jones this is the Genesis Network GCLive.com all Hades is breaking loose right now in the economy everything is proceeding as the globalists have foreseen it

[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:31.600]  it's a little under an hour he's scheduled to join us talk about the campaign and a host of other very important issues i'm going to get into the dangerous Gardasil shot the Mexican government says they're going to inject every girl in their population starting with all the nine-year-olds and they're implying it's going to be forced
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:44.600]  they don't even have that authority just like here in the u.s. they don't but it started with rick perry saying it was the law and you had to he's now apologized for that and a day late a dollar short and a lot of dead girls behind him
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:09:01.600]  i agree with that ron paul's former campaign manager has a lot of courage stand up against these monsters rick perry it's also now come out praise hillary clinton in speeches and in letters in 1993 and supported hillary care even more socialistic than obama care
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:26.600]  joining us with very important breakdown of libya syria terror threats and other issues is lieutenant colonel entity shafer u.s. army who gained fame for his reports about the situation with september eleventh attacks and the fact that the military in many areas was basically told to stand down
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:38.600]  and he joins us now to break down the latest geopolitical developments operation dark heart dot com as we can find his latest best-selling book it's a good to have you here with us today colonel
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:46.600]  well thanks for having me i was going to be back on leave in a while absolutely so much is happening i've got my questions but out of the gates what what is
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  what the is under your saddle well you know i'm glad you brought up the whole libya thing and this is one of the peculiar things where i think we are just totally out to lunch and what's really going on i think and we being the american public for two reasons first i don't know if you're aware of this but there's been a there's a
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:18.600]  lot of people in paris this week with businesses global businesses and a lot of libyan rebels looking at how to carve up the the outcome of the the libyan conflict and keep in mind we don't have a constitution area yet yet you've got folks already trying to make business
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:32.600]  deals with the rebels and of course we don't even know who's doing what so you know when you look at that fact and you look at the fact that we spent a billion dollars and i know that in terms of the budget is not significant but you know a billion dollars
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:46.600]  would go a long way to fix a lot of bridges make a lot of roads and relieve a lot of folks who are having a hard time with the economy right now so this is all been done and the name of the white house and i was just over talking to some some
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:11:00.600]  staff some congressional staff on this very issue last week alex the congress has never seemed received a single report on what the pentagon is doing who they're giving the intel to and according to the pentagon and their most recent reports from last week
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:14.600]  they have been they have given 70 to 60 to 70 percent of the intel which has driven the nato attacks against rebel target or against kadafi's targets well who exactly authorized this because congress never did this and most
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  strikeedly i've been talking to bruce fine bruce you might know wrote a lot of books on constitution the constitutional lawyer stated without any any equivocation that the president is now in violation something called the anti deficiencies act and that's within
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:44.600]  title 31 of the u.s. code which basically says if congress give you money to do something you cannot arbitrarily decide you can do something else with it in the case of libya there's been no obligation or approval of any obligation for funds to go against
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:12:00.600]  the libyan conflict so no matter who you are right or left we should all be concerned about the fact that there is no interest in following what i think most would argue the rule of law and the constitutional basis that requires you know a give and take an
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:15.600]  oversight system within our government well i'm glad you brought this up colonel that was actually one of the things i wanted to raise ron paul of course is called the constitutional lawyer mr fine you know the top constitutional lawyer in the country he's been on this show
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:32.600]  he said this is impeachable it's completely unconstitutional i know you're still in the military so you obviously can't go that far but when congress went to obama four and a half months ago and said look we'll give you the money in the authority but you've got to go to us he said
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:46.600]  i don't need congress i have the u n and i'm doing this quote for the credibility of the u n and it does add incredible credibility it says our president takes his orders from them i mean the congress makes wars you know you're a commission officer
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:13:02.600]  the congress gives the orders the president then executes it as the executive but the board of directors who are elected by us is the house is the senate we now have a super congress now the spending and cutting bills don't come from house members it just comes from a 12 member
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:17.600]  super committee with the president the 13th head i mean so this is a constitutional crisis and but you just brought something of that i didn't even i saw a blur but i'd forgotten to cover so i guess for lack of a better term i didn't know because i never covered it you know the tree falls and nobody
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:30.600]  here's it didn't make a sound and that's that congress isn't even being given intelligence on this giant north african operation that's incredible right and i think the american public needs to really take notice of this and again
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:46.600]  the person i talked to is actually his member he works for is a member of the house arms service committee who could be briefed and and this is where there's huge problems and it's not and again like you mentioned Alex it's not like the president wouldn't have gotten authorization or wouldn't have
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:14:00.600]  got money he just chose to not not to deal with it and say what i'm doing is not a war now i think about the logic here that he's using because by by president obama's logic and the way they're approaching this you could use a nuclear weapon on a country and
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:14.600]  say i'm not really war because we didn't have boots on the ground so that's how insane the premise of the policy is that you could actually use an incredible amount of deadly force against any given target on the planet and basically say that's not really war because we didn't put boots on the ground
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:34.600]  well colonel colonel this is Caesar crossing the Rubicon that led to the end of the roman republic and and and obama's lawyers know exactly what they're doing the pentagon lawyers as you know came to him and said you can't do this and he said i'll do whatever i want so this is brazen and being consciously done talking to other military brass
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:52.600]  who you speak with are they concerned about this yeah i've spoken to several retired generals who have worked in a variety of administrations and and you might find this this ironic but one of the administrations which i was told had that the greatest
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:15:08.600]  interest in listening to generals was actually president clinton clinton would actually bring folks in and talk to them if they disagree with policy from what i'm hearing alex that's not going on now it essentially is a send mode only basically you take the policy you try to figure it out
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:24.600]  and you move forward with it that's about it and if you have concerns then the concerns are really not welcome and this is a dangerous trend because we as officers are trained to give our best judgment and if our judgment is it's not a good idea we need to be able to tell you that and we're not telling you that
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:49.600]  to be disloyal we're telling you because there's reasons why you need to be cautious well it's more than dangerous it is absolute 100% tyranny it is 200 proof evil and if a president's crazy and doesn't want to listen to the military that's one thing he is the commander in chief but he's only the commander in chief once congress gives him the green light to execute their declaration of war or their
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  authorization to use force as you know
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:13.600]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets

[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:21.600]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:50.600]  Thomas Jefferson it's alex jones on the GCM radio network
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:21:00.600]  so this is this is a complete departure from the Constitution and we're seeing on the power of the purse we're seeing them implement gun control regulations outside of law
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:17.600]  we're seeing it done with carbon taxes with power plants we're seeing healthcare law selectively enforced this for all intents and purposes has transitioned into what you could call a dictatorship a stealth dictatorship but nonetheless a dictatorship
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:27.600]  well my concern is as you mentioned alex there's ways there's things in the American public domain that they can see this first off and I don't care how you feel about the the the protection of marriage act
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:38.600]  but the idea is if it's a law I'd say the Justice Department is obligated to enforce that law to include going and fighting for it in court that's one of the things that the Obama administration just said
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:53.600]  you know we don't like this we're not going to enforce it on the military side your points are super well taken I've spoken I don't know if you all knew that you do this I debated Representative Paul on the John Stossel show about two three months ago and four months ago in March
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:22:08.600]  and we talked about a lot of these same issues and well he and I agree on a great number of issues and one of which is the constitutionality the need of Congress to actually do its risk its duties and the two things that Congress must do especially the house
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:23.600]  only the house can can can do the appropriate basically put together bills which appropriate my yes spending bills begin in the house it's law and it's got it's got to stay like that this whole idea of a super committee and I've heard representative Paul say this he doesn't see where there's any legal constitutional grounds for the super committee to exist
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:40.600]  I can tell you I've talked to Bruce by Bruce does the same thing is just there's just nothing there that allows us to happen any other point obviously is whenever you spend money you've got to have clear and compelling justification to do that and I just don't think we're getting our money's worth regarding that
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:57.600]  and when we look at this Alex one of the things I'd like to bring up as an oversight issue is the fact that anytime and let's look at this for the mic mark the mic the mic I'm sorry the macro to the micro and our big scheme of things we use military force deadly force all the time as a tool of national will
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:15.600]  and when you look at the micro when you look at a policeman on the street having to do something to support law anytime he uses deadly force there's an investigation there's basically every full review process that says was this officer justified in using military you know deadly force
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:35.600]  well the problem is we never look at the national equivalent of an officer using deadly force we constantly use military operations military capabilities without understanding three things first was it legal was it was it the right call to make based on the intel I think we would all agree that despite what president
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:50.600]  he says now I don't believe the intel was ever there to justify an iraqi invasion that's the message and I was on the inside of the time I just thought they're talking about now I never saw I didn't sound the same was never recorded what a proliferator of weapons he may be interested or interested in but he wasn't proliferating
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:24:10.600]  so you gotta look at the intel second thing you gotta figure out that if the intel justified your actions did you did you create the appropriate response to the threat and third and most importantly what is the outcome did your use of military force achieve a specific goal or objective that is in the best interest of our nation's policy
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:20.600]  you know is this what we should do and so if it's good enough for a beat cop to be looked at with a great deal of scrutiny for use of deadly force I don't know why we don't do it at the national level
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:38.600]  well continuing it's always in every case in history as you know as a military officer who studied history when leaders start amassing all the power into themselves especially the power of the purse and the power of force that is when the big alarms go off and I'll just say it
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:51.600]  if you read the definition of treason and then high treason it is working with a foreign power to undermine the system of government of the nation of which you serve
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:25:03.600]  and that's the basic definition of not just treason but high treason because high treason is if you're in a position of power and trust and if sworn an oath and you lower the drawbridge for the enemy to come in
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:20.600]  now Obama says to Congress when they sue him when they were buffing when everything and when they offer him the money in the power when it's because that's their job he says I don't need you puts a letter out saying I do this for the credibility of the UN I'm sorry
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:36.600]  that is not only treason it is the definition of high treason to undermine the legitimate government and transfer the power through fraud to a foreign entity away from the elected government of the republic
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:54.600]  as you said he could use nuclear weapons now and say the UN told him to I mean it's even worse if he was power grabbing he would still be an American dictator and it would be treasonous now he's doing it and saying I do it under a foreign entity's auspices if this is not high treason nothing is
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:07.600]  well that's the thing that I've heard several of the congressmen talk about the issues representative Kostinich has talked about this and as you know several congressmen have actually sued President Obama over the very issue you're talking about
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:25.600]  there's now court action saying President Obama has failed to support the requirements of his office relating to war powers and things of that nature so what I'm concerned about is that the American public doesn't seem to be looking at this with any sort of fervor I mean the fact that we have
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:35.600]  I don't care how they argue the fact that we've only got aircraft involved and frankly between you and me Alex I've heard that we've got guys on the ground doing things to support the war
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  I've talked to the army soldiers by name there's at least 50 dead U.S. Army alone that have been brought into the receiving center in the last four and a half months there's special forces all over the place commanding
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:27:06.600]  right the GIs and so this is the deal I don't understand why the American people are the only ones who are being kind of kept in the dark here I mean everybody you know one of my sources was a foreign national who told me about boots on the ground being there and Libya and I'll imagine this a foreign national a former Libyan senior official tells me that
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:22.600]  he knows we got boots on the ground so apparently the jokes of the American people because they're the only ones who are not being told the full truth about what's going on and again you know I you could have we should have a debate about any use of our our national capabilities that be that military be that
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:36.600]  the State Department I mean yes sir but let me interrupt you and just get right to the heart of matters I want to come back and hit a few other issues with you but I'm glad you brought this up I understand you're a commissioned officer you still serve and and and so obviously you're not going to say it's
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:48.600]  treason or high treason but you come back and say it's up to the American people to wake up and start having a debate about this I don't hear you disagreeing I just want listeners understand if this is happening in plain view and if the government gets away with this of the
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:28:02.600]  executive gets away with this then the sky is the limit your comment absolutely I mean this is we've seen this on several issues relating to how the government is amassing power and in this case the executive branch primarily
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:18.600]  the statue that says Congress has to be the thing that says enough is enough and this is where I can I just don't understand how we don't have a Congress actually drawing the line in the same thing this far if you go this far we're going to have to do something to
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:35.600]  you know to me this is far worse some of the massing of power and ignoring of constitutional requirements is worse than the Paula Jones scandal in many ways of course it is I mean no one's endorsing pilfering women but at the end of the day this affects us all
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:50.600]  Colonel Shafer please stay there I want to I want to come back and get into LA Times you name it confirming that the core leaders and the folks that have taken Tripoli are bonafide real Al Qaeda that have been killing Americans in Iraq they brag about it

[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.600]  will stand my ground

[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.600]  and I won't back down
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  well we've been covering since last Friday
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:30.600]  the second armed SWAT team raid on one of the few American companies engaged in fine craftsmanship and that of course is Gibson guitar
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:40.600]  I know a lot of my friends and family dearly love and their classic Les Pauls and they've been ready a few years ago won't tell them why I've been ready to gain
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:46.600]  and now they're learning it doesn't matter if they get the wood legally or lawfully now the police are saying hey we may
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.600]  start raiding musicians homes we when you try to travel out of the country doesn't matter if it's a 50 year old guitar
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.600]  they're taking it but not just Gibson's now they're talking about guns with the wood that's on them
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.600]  if you can't prove that's not some endangered wood from a foreign country it's gone your furniture
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:12.600]  the whole police state system wants to expand you've seen the green police ads on TV where they're arresting folks for light bulbs
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  actually in Australia they do home inspections and are talking about arresting people if you've got a crack in your window
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  this is the total takeover of society and Henry Jeskowitz is the CEO of Gibson and here's one of their press releases
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.600]  Gibson says wood is illegal if US workers produce it
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:42.600]  but continuing here guitar frets environmental enforcement leaves musicians in fear
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  I saw an Atlantic article where they had the headline how do you turn musicians into tea partyers take their guitars
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  Gibson guitar CEO raid by feds to cost company two to three million dollars here's another one breaking it down
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:10.600]  CEO of Gibson guitar or Republican donor Democrat competitor uses same wood just like Obama's contributors are exempt from having to have the government run healthcare
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:16.600]  which is an unfair trade advantage just like General Electric's power plants are exempt from the new carbon taxes
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:25.600]  joining us again is the CEO and I appreciate him coming on
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  Mr. Jeskowitz thank you for coming on today
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600]  thank you very much for having me
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:38.600]  well so much has happened I saw your press conference and it seems like you're really informed you've got the floor tell us exactly what's happened
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:51.600]  well it was a normal day and you know it started normally we were producing guitars and you know very early in the morning
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:37:03.600]  we had something like 20 to 30 armed SWAT like agents descend on three of our manufacturing plants in our corporate headquarters
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:16.600]  they evacuated all the employees several hundred people respectively into parking lots and streets shut down the manufacturing facilities
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  started pouring through them confiscating raw materials in the manufacturing facilities paperwork started grabbing some hard drives
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:35.600]  copying imaging hard drives and generally shutting down our business
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:49.600]  do you think that this could be a political sabotage or espionage because it's been confirmed that General Motors franchises in Minnesota and other areas when they nationalize General Motors
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:57.600]  that people that weren't Democratic Party donors that they had their franchise taken away and given to others
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:05.600]  you heard me sir just mention the fact that 2000 plus big companies that are donors have been given government health care waivers
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:14.600]  we know General Motors has also gotten government bailout money the same thing with General Electric
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.600]  I mean do you think that some of that could be a play here
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  I really don't know I'd hate to say anything without any you know specific knowledge but I will say that we are not the only company that is buying Indian Rosewood and Ebony which is the issue here
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:47.600]  other competitor companies are indeed buying it and have not been in any way impacted, contacted or otherwise harassed
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:57.600]  so the fact that we are uniquely selected that definitely makes me suspicious as to why that's the case
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  now I noticed in your press conference you talked about some of the acts that sign us on to basically agenda 21 international law
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  and that under the Lacey Act and other things that even if foreign countries change laws retroactively now you're under that and that specifically they don't like us buying wood from foreign countries and then working it
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:41.600]  right that's the real irony I mean we have an outstanding American labor force we have been hiring people at the very depths of the economic problems we have hired over 580 American workers new jobs
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:40:02.600]  we are very successful at exporting products 60% of our product goes overseas these are things that normally you know countries get pretty excited about and you're considered a pretty good guy and a good citizen when you cause that to happen
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:22.600]  the fact is the government's position is that it's not about the wood and illegal logging it's about the labor content in the wood and the government apparently prefers that that labor content be outside the United States
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.600]  just kind of a bizarre thing
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:41.600]  again we're talking to the CEO of Gibson guitar sir even Congressman Dennis Cassinich on singing in last night pointed out that the head of the president's economic council the former head of General Electric is actually getting incentives to move
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  General Electric's x-ray division out of the US as I said three of our factories were paid for with the bailout of General Motors to move them to Eastern Europe China and Brazil so that is undoubtedly what's happening the congressman has the headline here
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  Obama's jobs are expert at creating foreign jobs can you speak to that
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:30.600]  well all I can say is that this is costing us money it's making us less competitive and it will certainly impact you know jobs here in the United States and it's really making me question whether we're valued you know in the US
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:41.600]  well don't let him win sir don't let him run you out to China because then you've got to go through one of the Chinese generals and that's why the big cats fat cats did this deal decades ago with China they admit it

[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:45.600]  we need to address this much broader than just our individual situation this is happening with other companies in various areas where regulation is creeping in and being applied irrationally in the hospital

[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.600]  sir in 1984 a fictitious nightmare police state scenario
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:55.600]  winston doesn't know what he's being accused of and of course in the famous a novel that kathke wrote and we get the term kathke asked because in the end he's convicted of a crime and sentenced to death and doesn't even know why he was sentenced to death and more and more
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:05.600]  we're seeing that people are being sentenced and never even finding out it's just they're told national security and i know you were rated a few years ago you've been rated again
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:17.600]  and you can't even find out when you talk to them why you're being rated i mean in the constitution you have an ability to know you're being charged with and to face your accuser
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:27.600]  that's right and it's pretty bizarre to be in our predicament you know not much i can say except it's a nightmare
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:37.600]  we're talking to henry jescovitz the ceo of gibson guitar and of course you can go to gibson dot com and sell the latest press releases
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:49.600]  sir i want to instead of sitting here asking you questions i'd like to give you the floor because in the press conference i saw a lot of media there but the audio wasn't too good on the youtube version
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  so i'd like to give you the floor here to really speak about what you think is most important i would also like to ask you about the armed nature of it how you were treated like you were criminals instead of working with our industry
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:12.600]  and saying hey you know you might do this a little bit better but i noticed that with the vitamin industry they tried that and now the government's trying to shut them down
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:24.600]  so unfortunately they don't want to work with you and even if you try they're going to come after you these are parasites who could care less about our economy or our future but you've got the floor sir
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:39.600]  well i think i think you're a lot more eloquent than i am and you know all i can say is that in fact the government is using you know drug enforcement hospital techniques
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:50:01.600]  we are just a guitar factory we're a small business that's very successful we're hiring people we are competing successfully overseas and exporting and we're talking about you know an import and export paperwork issue
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  that should not be dealt with with people with loaded guns and bulletproof vests intimidation techniques we've had hourly employees put into rooms with five or six armed people
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:41.600]  and interrogated without their attorney present you know you're talking about really hostile action and no one has come to us and said fellas you know here's the problem we have an issue with this let's deal with it
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:51:02.600]  their first response was SWAT raids with guns and they shut our business down they injured us it was an attack and we have no recourse you know there isn't even a judicial recourse
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:15.600]  we are trying to fight this in court and the government is trying to stay the judicial proceedings so that we can't even fight and get our day in court
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:35.600]  so anyway i think we are being treated unfairly way disproportionate to any possible cause i think that their ability to do that really we have to think about what that means for our democracy
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:48.600]  and for other people who could be put in this exact same situation and so you know i asked for reason and i asked for fairness
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:52:05.600]  well you're not going to get that from the federal Gestapo anymore they admit they want to post industrial United States that's what the whole green tyranny carbon taxes about only their friends are going to be able to operate now in America Al Gore has said it
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:20.600]  they've all stated it and this is their this is their program this is the mafia takeover of America we're talking to Henry Jessica which the CEO of Gibson guitar a growing American company 60% foreign
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:40.600]  I know Gibson gets more and more popular they have an entertainment office here in Austin they're bucking the trend with American craftsmanship just like Harvey Harley Davidson and others and the system does not like this and they harass every major American company that is left it's
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:57.600]  on an insider but sir you brought up something that's the heart of the matter we've seen raids on dairy farms that sell raw milk to Whole Foods and people legally and rock raw milk cheese and they do the same thing they show them say we're going to say all your cows have mad cow and kill all of them unless you sign a form admitting you did something illegal
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:11.600]  they just make it up or they show up to Amish and he literally put guns in their heads and scream and cuss and say admit you're guilty I mean they're worse than Gestapo I mean the Gestapo were polite till they got you to a camp
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:28.600]  the ATF had just resigned caught shipping guns into Mexico then blame the Second Amendment here caught perjuring himself turns out the White House ordered it I think we've got to come to grips with these are really nasty people or they're going to continue to have the moral high ground but you mentioned that they got
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:47.600]  some employees in there without their lawyers and began these interrogations that is unconstitutional that is official oppression that is illegal and I hope that you look to get on the offensive with a civil suit against these people and that organizations come to your aid sir
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:54.600]  we are looking for every legal remedy and you know and we'll go to Supreme Court if we have to
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:54:01.600]  well I want to say this we all hang together we hang separate you know who said that Benjamin Franklin
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:10.600]  you know one of our founding fathers and I don't think our founding fathers had this in mind for their democracy
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:25.600]  well our republic is in deep trouble sir we're going to break her in a moment we'll come back and do five more management very gracious with your time but specifically what more can you tell us about the getting people in rooms alone with armed armed green police
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:48.600]  well you know not much more needs to be said I mean it was a pretty frightening situation people didn't know these these are ordinary workers on the factory floor they were pretty freaked out and you know in addition to that several of these people in in subsequent
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:55:14.600]  interrogations by the Justice Department were threatened with five years in prison well that may very well be the fact I mean they are being threatened and coercive techniques were were used and fortunately you know we have good people here at Gibson and everyone here is
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:35.600]  you know really feels terrible about this we all love the company we've done nothing wrong and the intimidation isn't working by the way I mean these four workers I mean they have nothing to do with the importation and working of it everybody knows they're totally innocent
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:53.600]  you know that's that's right I mean I'm the head guy of the company if they if they want to come after someone they should come after management and you know it just really sent chills down my spine for them to go after you know normal people that you know
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:56:11.600]  don't deal with lawyers and and they don't have a squad of legal people and in fact you know the company didn't have to support those people they could have been on their own you know if we did support them we hired independent lawyers for
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  them to protect their own personal interest but that didn't have to happen it's just not right and by the way this fishing expedition is now going into its third year this started in 2009 yes sir
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  Wow I mean I see it all the time where they throw the book at somebody who gets a drop of motor oil in their backyard but then we're shipping all our jobs to China where they just dump the toxic waste right in the ocean I mean how is America supposed to operate with these all these new
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  offices that have been erected and the swarms of agents that have been sent out to eat out our substance
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  it's very difficult to do business with these issues facing you now have you seen an upswing in orders though with the people sympathetically trying to support American jobs
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  a lot of people have been calling in yes we have seen upswing in orders of course it's only been a couple of days since the raid but that people are just pouring letters and support in from all over the country and all over the world
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:39.600]  and yes we have seen an uptick in people buying product so they certainly realize that it's important to have jobs here in America and in closing sir they're claiming that it's because you were working the wood that it's able to have jobs here
