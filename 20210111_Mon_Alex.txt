[00:00.000 --> 00:07.240]  We're truck supporters buff-loaded by Marxist operatives and Civil War zealots into the
[00:07.240 --> 00:12.440]  capital to send the future of American liberties over a cliff, unknowingly driving America
[00:12.440 --> 00:17.880]  into a civil war as Democrats continue their one-party lust for power.
[00:17.880 --> 00:26.000]  The President of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America.
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.240]  The gleeful desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the temple of our American democracy,
[00:33.240 --> 00:40.240]  and the violence targeting Congress are horrors that will forever stain our nation's history.
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.680]  As Pelosi and company frantically attempt to impeach the President yet again in order
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.960]  to cover up verified election fraud and whatever was on the laptop possibly removed by special
[00:50.960 --> 00:54.160]  forces during the occupation of the U.S. Capitol.
[00:54.160 --> 01:03.040]  I, Professor Alfio Durso, lawyer of Via Vittorio Manuele Catania, do thereby provide the following
[01:03.040 --> 01:10.040]  of feedback on facts as conveyed in several meetings with the high-level Army Security
[01:10.040 --> 01:12.640]  Services official.
[01:12.640 --> 01:21.440]  Under instruction and direction of U.S. persons working from the U.S. Embassy in Rome undertook
[01:21.440 --> 01:29.320]  the operation to switch data from the U.S. election of 3rd November 2020 from significant
[01:29.320 --> 01:36.360]  margin of victory from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in a number of states where Joe Biden
[01:36.360 --> 01:38.640]  was losing the vote totals.
[01:38.640 --> 01:46.440]  And you see Pelosi, you see Schumer and just told me that Pelosi called the Chairman and
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.560]  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, and they're trying to get them out on the
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.040]  25th Amendment or to impeach her.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.040]  Why?
[01:56.040 --> 02:03.040]  Well, because on Wednesday they took Pelosi's laptop.
[02:03.040 --> 02:04.040]  She's frantic.
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.760]  There was some people in there that were special forces mixed with Antifa, and they took her
[02:10.760 --> 02:24.640]  laptop and they have that data.
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.160]  There are numerous videos detailing Antifa destroying capital property before they entered
[02:29.160 --> 02:30.240]  the building.
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.840]  And watch the response of the Trump supporters as they call out the Antifa member doing the
[02:35.840 --> 02:59.600]  property damage.
[02:59.600 --> 03:05.080]  And a video revealing people inside the capital doling out weapons to Antifa through what
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.400]  appears to be an open window and former military with security clearances that penetrated into
[03:10.400 --> 03:16.840]  the chamber replete with zip ties, fueling the left's unhinged accusations of insurrection.
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.000]  And wouldn't the intelligence of this premier security force known as the Capitol Police
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.200]  be ultimately responsible?
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.840]  The plans and threats about what would intentionally transpire were readily available online for
[03:30.840 --> 03:31.840]  weeks.
[03:31.840 --> 03:37.400]  But there are videos of Capitol Police officers opening the doors and gates for Trump supporters
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.320]  adding to the false security that Trump supporters were welcome inside the Capitol.
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.120]  And anyway, how the hell was anyone supposed to be aware that entering the taxpayer funded
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.400]  U.S. Capitol building would lead to prison time, job loss, and pariah status?
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.080]  Ironically, there's video of these supposed domestic extremist terrorists respectfully
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.320]  staying within the velvet ropes in the National Statuary Hall.
[04:02.320 --> 04:05.440]  Had Antifa been in that room, there would be nothing left.
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.080]  And then there's the criticism of the response by President Trump.
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.640]  Had the National Guard been called in, who's to say that far more than five people would
[04:13.640 --> 04:14.960]  have lost their lives?
[04:14.960 --> 04:21.040]  And what does it say when politicians cower in fear when confronted by their own constituents,
[04:21.040 --> 04:26.000]  crawling back out of their holes and labeling millions of Americans as domestic terrorists?
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.880]  I guarantee that the founders would have never left those chambers.
[04:29.880 --> 04:34.440]  As more information trickles out, another simple question arises.
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.520]  Was the Capitol insurrection, as it's being called, merely just a clever gambit in the
[04:39.520 --> 04:42.760]  New World Order's playbook to take down America?
[04:42.760 --> 04:58.800]  John Bown reporting.
[04:58.800 --> 05:04.040]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because activated charcoal
[05:04.040 --> 05:07.560]  is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there.
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.240]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring very,
[05:12.240 --> 05:13.240]  very toxic.
[05:13.240 --> 05:14.800]  And also, they have fluoride in it.
[05:14.800 --> 05:17.440]  This does not have the fluoride, it doesn't have the additives.
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.520]  This is a concentrated, it really is, high quality, it's been sold out for months because
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.160]  of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage, but now it's back in
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.160]  stock.
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.440]  Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste.

[05:43.840 --> 05:45.760]  and it supports the Info War.
[05:45.760 --> 05:51.240]  Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals, available again at infowarsstore.com and a
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.760]  lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well, like
[05:54.760 --> 06:00.000]  pollen block, so check that out when you're in the store.
[06:00.000 --> 06:09.960]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[06:09.960 --> 06:16.880]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[06:16.880 --> 06:40.640]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:40.640 --> 06:45.480]  With the simplest of events, there's always at least two sides to any story, but with
[06:45.480 --> 06:50.560]  big historic events, with hundreds of thousands of people involved, it's very important to
[06:50.560 --> 06:53.160]  take your time and look at the details.
[06:53.160 --> 06:58.280]  You've heard that President Trump and myself wanted to storm the Capitol and kill people
[06:58.280 --> 07:03.040]  because that would give us power, that would make us look like good guys.
[07:03.040 --> 07:05.040]  Does anybody believe that on its face?
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.320]  Well, that's what everyone's being told in every major publication on the planet, but
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.040]  the Wall Street Journal was forced to retract and now others are.
[07:14.040 --> 07:17.400]  And they claim that I led the assault on the Capitol.
[07:17.400 --> 07:21.200]  You're about to see the truth of what really happened, and it is criminal, but it wasn't
[07:21.200 --> 07:23.680]  done by myself or President Trump.
[07:23.680 --> 07:31.640]  President Trump called for peaceful rallies in D.C. on January 6, 2021, so that Congress
[07:31.640 --> 07:37.400]  who was holding hearings and debate on the fraud would see that the American people were
[07:37.400 --> 07:42.200]  upset and were not going to accept the fraudulent results.
[07:42.200 --> 07:45.720]  I learned that there wasn't enough funding and that private groups were not donating
[07:45.720 --> 07:51.240]  enough, so I donated some and helped organize the peaceful events that happened on January
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.880]  5 and the day of January 6.
[07:53.880 --> 07:58.360]  Then President Trump said that he wanted me to go out and lead the peaceful crowd that
[07:58.360 --> 08:03.400]  was already there to the Capitol so that we could continue to peacefully demonstrate.
[08:03.400 --> 08:06.400]  So here's the timeline as best as we can nail it down.
[08:06.400 --> 08:10.280]  Right as President Trump starts to speak, tens of thousands of people had already shown
[08:10.280 --> 08:13.820]  up at the Capitol miles away from where he was giving his address.
[08:13.820 --> 08:19.200]  The police in some areas opened up barricades, and other areas kept them closed and clashes
[08:19.200 --> 08:21.640]  between some of the demonstrators began.
[08:21.640 --> 08:25.640]  That's when the provocateurs who had already been there starting fights with the police
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.840]  accelerated their violence.
[08:27.840 --> 08:33.040]  There are literally hundreds of videos, like the one you're watching right now, where Trump
[08:33.040 --> 08:39.800]  patriots physically restrain individuals trying to break out windows and ran down doors.
[08:39.800 --> 08:46.160]  This is how you take a massive, almost million person march, exposing election fraud, and
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.120]  discredit it, because only a few hundred people actually attacked the police.
[08:52.120 --> 08:56.640]  And most of them we now know were led by provocateurs commanded by Antifa.
[08:56.640 --> 08:59.200]  One such individual is John Sullivan.
[08:59.200 --> 09:01.360]  He's a Antifa leader from the West Coast.
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.240]  He's been arrested for staging riots before.
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.120]  This individual said online he was coming to D.C. to overthrow Trump.
[09:09.120 --> 09:10.880]  Well he certainly did a good job at it.
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.560]  Instead of saying he's openly against Trump, he helped lead the assault of the Capitol
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.680]  and even chanted over and over again that others needed to join him in burning down
[09:20.680 --> 09:23.680]  the building.
[09:23.680 --> 09:29.560]  But guess what?
[09:29.560 --> 09:33.840]  After his arrest that night, he was then released and has not been charged.
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.160]  John Sullivan is a smart member of Antifa.
[09:37.160 --> 09:38.160]  Very Machiavelli.
[09:38.160 --> 09:43.440]  If he just went out and knocked out some Starbucks windows and set a fire in a random neighborhood,
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.600]  like his type normally do, well that would actually demonize the left.
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.480]  But if he can lead a riot into the Capitol when the Capitol police are outmanned and
[09:52.480 --> 09:55.720]  stand down, well then he can help bring down the whole country.
[09:55.720 --> 09:57.080]  My name's John Sullivan.
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.560]  I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah.
[09:59.560 --> 10:01.760]  My group is Insurgents USA.
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.880]  We fucking about to burn this shit down.
[10:03.880 --> 10:04.880]  Fuck this shit.
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.920]  We gotta burn this shit down.
[10:10.920 --> 10:18.080]  The Washington Post, NBC and others even reported in the days before the riot that Antifa and
[10:18.080 --> 10:24.200]  other organizations were recruiting on 8-chan boards to go to D.C. and stage an uprising.
[10:24.200 --> 10:29.320]  Once the small agitator groups led by Antifa had forced their way in, some of the hundreds
[10:29.320 --> 10:34.400]  of thousands waiting outside decided to go in and behave like traditional tourists, taking
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.840]  selfies with police and, of course, paintings and statues of founding fathers.
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.840]  And now you see the mainstream corporate media and big tech de-platforming the president
[10:44.840 --> 10:50.440]  off of nine major systems and shutting down Parler because they thought he might move
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.440]  there.
[10:51.440 --> 10:57.800]  Pure authoritarianism and hundreds of publications and groups calling for my arrest saying what
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.880]  happened in the Capitol is my fault for organizing peaceful demonstrations and rallies across
[11:03.880 --> 11:06.480]  D.C. and the United States.
[11:06.480 --> 11:12.160]  I'm going to end this with some footage of what I actually did before the march started
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.040]  and once I got to the Capitol, how I tried to stop it was then unfolding.
[11:16.040 --> 11:21.600]  It was only later I learned that that poor woman, Mrs. Babbitt, had died while I was
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.680]  outside warning people that we didn't want another Kent State to happen.
[11:26.680 --> 11:35.360]  My dog Jilder said, we're not burden-building down or shooting cops, we're building America
[11:35.360 --> 11:38.360]  up, we're here to take our rightful country back peacefully.
[11:38.360 --> 11:43.360]  We're not Antifa, we're not B.L.O., you're amazing, I love you, let's march around to
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.360]  the other side and let's not fight the police and get the system what they want.
[11:48.360 --> 11:56.360]  We are peaceful, we won this election, and as much as I love seeing the Trump quads,
[11:56.360 --> 12:04.360]  fly it over if we need to not have the confrontation with the police, they're going to make that
[12:04.360 --> 12:05.360]  the story.
[12:05.360 --> 12:11.360]  I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.360]  peacefully.
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.360]  Tell everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.360]  Convocateurs have caused a problem and the police are throwing cross bangs.
[12:23.360 --> 12:26.360]  We don't want to have a Kent State here.
[12:26.360 --> 12:33.360]  So, I love you, we're saving the Republic, this is beautiful, but please tell everyone
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.360]  you know, march to the other side.
[12:36.360 --> 12:44.360]  Do not be part of this, tell everybody to come out and sign for march to the other side.
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.360]  Here's what we know.
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.360]  Close to a million people showed up in D.C. to exercise their sacred first woman right
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.360]  and they did it peacefully.
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.360]  A couple hundred provocateurs were able to take over the Capitol because the police stood
[12:57.360 --> 13:04.360]  down and then tried to provocateur cue followers and others to attack the police so there were
[13:04.360 --> 13:05.760]  four deaths.
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.840]  And now we're being told the entire Bill of Rights, the entire Constitution has to be
[13:09.840 --> 13:16.440]  completely thrown out because of the limited violence that was basically a riot at the
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.760]  Capitol that was mainly provocateur by leftist agitators who said they were going there to
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.680]  provocateur this and dress up as Trump supporters to again do exactly what is now unfolded.
[13:27.680 --> 13:30.640]  But they don't have the real power, they just staged the event.
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.360]  It's mainstream media that allows the lives to continue and it's big tech that suppresses
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.960]  us from getting this truth out.
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.520]  But I want to close with this important graph and we'll put it on screen.
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.760]  Your outrage is being manufactured.
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.480]  Let's look at the BLM riots and left wing violence from Antifa and others in the last
[13:48.480 --> 13:51.400]  seven months compared to what just happened at the Capitol.
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.320]  It lasted seven months.
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.880]  It was condemned mostly by Republicans and celebrated by the left, encouraged by media
[13:57.880 --> 13:59.640]  and politicians.
[13:59.640 --> 14:01.920]  Police force was used massively.
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.640]  23 plus people were shot dead by Antifa and BLM, 700 officers injured.
[14:07.640 --> 14:08.640]  Many killed.
[14:08.640 --> 14:14.200]  150 plus federal buildings damaged, hundreds of small businesses destroyed, entire neighborhoods
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.880]  burned down.
[14:15.880 --> 14:20.400]  Now let's compare that with so-called right wing violence in the Capitol that was triggered
[14:20.400 --> 14:22.800]  and provocateur by the left.
[14:22.800 --> 14:28.720]  Lasted several hours, condemned by all Republicans and Democrats, encouraged only by fringe political
[14:28.720 --> 14:29.720]  groups.
[14:29.720 --> 14:31.200]  Police force used.
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.240]  One person shot dead, two others had heart attacks, another died of a stroke.
[14:36.240 --> 14:42.040]  14 officers injured, one federal building damaged, no small businesses destroyed.
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.380]  But we see unbelievable nationwide outrage and are told that all conservatives are evil
[14:47.380 --> 14:50.840]  terrorists and many Republican leaders agree.
[14:50.840 --> 14:53.560]  Wow, that really is insane.
[14:53.560 --> 14:59.480]  Imagine if Mr. Sullivan would have been successful trying to get others to burn down the building.
[14:59.480 --> 15:04.520]  Imagine if those pipe bombs that were found left by the left outside had actually detonated.
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.440]  I've talked to high level law enforcement sources and folks high level in the Pentagon
[15:09.440 --> 15:15.760]  and they have confirmed to me that this was a globalist attempted false flag that misfired.
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.320]  You only got about 1% of the violence they actually wanted because they just couldn't
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.080]  trick a giant crowd of Trump supporters into regular mob psychology you see after a football
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.440]  game or a basketball championship where you could see dozens of deaths, hundreds of fires,
[15:31.440 --> 15:32.600]  you name it.
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.040]  Those Trump supporters were so law abiding this thing basically failed and I thank God
[15:37.040 --> 15:38.040]  for that.
[15:38.040 --> 15:59.160]  Now it's up to us to get the truth of what really happened out to the world.
[15:59.160 --> 16:07.360]  The resistance not video, the resistance not video, the resistance not video, the resistance
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.560]  not video, the resistance not video.
[16:11.560 --> 16:19.160]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have
[16:19.160 --> 16:20.160]  been banned.
[16:20.160 --> 16:26.160]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[16:26.160 --> 16:33.280]  They put Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail but the new website is the
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.160]  resistance not video, the resistance not video.
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.160]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[16:41.160 --> 16:46.800]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.960]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance not video.
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.240]  Share the link, the resistance not video, the resistance not video.
[16:57.240 --> 16:58.240]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[16:58.240 --> 16:59.240]  Thank you for holding.
[16:59.240 --> 17:00.240]  How you doing Alex?
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.040]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.040]  We're in such a critical time.
[17:04.040 --> 17:05.040]  Brother, how are you?
[17:05.040 --> 17:06.040]  I love you, man.
[17:06.040 --> 17:09.440]  I want to make a quick plug that DNA force.
[17:09.440 --> 17:10.440]  I love it.
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.000]  I've been using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.200]  other day and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies
[17:20.200 --> 17:27.600]  that Dr. Merkula has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps
[17:27.600 --> 17:29.440]  channel the zinc into the cells.
[17:29.440 --> 17:32.400]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[17:32.400 --> 17:38.360]  All I know is with DNA force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.760]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle
[17:42.760 --> 17:46.120]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[17:46.120 --> 17:50.720]  So we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[17:50.720 --> 18:00.520]  So thanks for the plug.
[18:00.520 --> 18:27.080]  We know the slogan of the George Soros UN funded antifung that raised $300 million last year.
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.760]  Black Lives Matter raised $10.6 billion because they're the establishment, we are the resistance.
[18:31.760 --> 18:38.640]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[18:38.640 --> 18:56.920]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all.
[18:56.920 --> 19:07.440]  In exactly nine days from now the globalist will be swearing in their installed puppet
[19:07.440 --> 19:15.760]  leader in exactly nine days to the minute basically.
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.440]  Things kick off at noon Eastern but they say about 20 minutes in he'll be sworn in.
[19:22.440 --> 19:26.880]  Go by the open communist operative.
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.760]  And that's why from LA to New York to Austin, Texas, Antifa marched to the streets with
[19:32.760 --> 19:38.920]  shields and guns and weapons saying we own this country, it is ours.
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.000]  And next they're coming to your houses because by day and by night they're Antifa but their
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.320]  real job is contact tracers for the Clinton Global Initiative on record.
[19:49.320 --> 19:56.640]  These are the graduate students and students who are now your rulers, most of them pedophiles.
[19:56.640 --> 20:01.160]  You notice when they get gunned down large percentages of them are convicted pedophiles.
[20:01.160 --> 20:23.520]  And here they are in New York just yesterday intimidating the population.
[20:23.520 --> 20:28.920]  So those are thugs, those are terrorists, they don't hate the police, they want to be
[20:28.920 --> 20:31.480]  the police.
[20:31.480 --> 20:34.960]  And they're the ones that went over 100 of them on record in other names dressed up
[20:34.960 --> 20:39.360]  like Trump supporters and Trump supporters tried to stop them breaking the Capitol but
[20:39.360 --> 20:43.240]  once they broke in there was another contingent of morons there, we've tracked it to H.N.
[20:43.240 --> 20:47.280]  and all the sites.
[20:47.280 --> 20:50.160]  I usually thought the Q. Tards wouldn't actually carry it out but they did.
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.080]  They believed with their zip ties and everything that they were breaking in with special forces
[20:55.080 --> 21:02.720]  undercover cops leading them in to quote capture Pelosi and oh the general saying oh the special
[21:02.720 --> 21:10.800]  forces got a laptop, oh like Hunters and then oh Trump's about to win and all this crap.
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.520]  That is a globalist mind control simulation through the computers manipulating people
[21:15.520 --> 21:23.960]  in real time, augmented reality is what it's called, wasn't enough to have the Antifa break
[21:23.960 --> 21:24.960]  in.
[21:24.960 --> 21:27.720]  They had to have somebody believe they were on a secret mission and they all bragged we're
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.480]  here for Q.
[21:31.480 --> 21:37.280]  The politicians pulled out on purpose so you could come in, they opened the gates and then
[21:37.280 --> 21:41.760]  now they could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat when we had close to a million people
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.720]  there and Trump gave a great speech and we were going to expose the election fraud and
[21:45.720 --> 21:48.040]  now they get to sell this whole agenda.
[21:48.040 --> 21:52.240]  And some Americans say to me well Jones you know you're just a wimp it's time for violent
[21:52.240 --> 21:56.880]  revolution okay well you guys stormed the place when we were having a peaceful event
[21:56.880 --> 22:01.520]  that we advertised as peaceful a small minority of you did to the demonized scapegoat the
[22:01.520 --> 22:07.200]  million peaceful folks that showed up that the airlines are now putting on no fly list
[22:07.200 --> 22:15.720]  just because they flew in to DC the day before.
[22:15.720 --> 22:24.400]  So you walked right into their trap and that's the mind control of the situation very very
[22:24.400 --> 22:31.200]  sad very very disgusting and you're still saying Trump will be in office in nine days
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.440]  well let's sit back and watch and I know you Q folks aren't going to go away even once
[22:36.440 --> 22:40.840]  that happens because you bought into a lie just like you sit the Nigerian email scammer
[22:40.840 --> 22:44.720]  that first thousand bucks and your family says that's a scam they need five thousand
[22:44.720 --> 22:49.760]  more you'll never get that either no I'll get a million now when I send Prince Abu
[22:49.760 --> 22:57.760]  the five thousand and after you've said everything you've got to the scammers you'll hate your
[22:57.760 --> 23:04.560]  family for warning but it doesn't matter we're going to move on from that I'm going to lay
[23:04.560 --> 23:08.400]  out what's really happening what's going to unfold next Trump's got a big speech coming
[23:08.400 --> 23:13.400]  up about 80 minutes that we're going to be covering live at that point when he goes live
[23:13.400 --> 23:18.480]  we're going to go commercial free stations will still fire their ads we're not going
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.000]  to run ads they'll just cut into us so we're going to go commercial free on the audio and
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.840]  video streams for the internet audience once the president goes live in this important
[23:27.840 --> 23:34.240]  speech and this will say it all I've got some inside intel on what he's going to be talking
[23:34.240 --> 23:40.840]  about what he's going to be doing and this is definitely going to be historic we've
[23:40.840 --> 23:48.240]  asked him to use the EAS emergency alert system because Twitter Facebook Google of the mainstream
[23:48.240 --> 23:51.320]  television is saying they're not going to be carrying it you got to go to White House
[23:51.320 --> 23:58.920]  dot gov will have the speech carried in full in its own posting to info wars dot com but
[23:58.920 --> 24:04.320]  this is the fable to attempt to take down our republic separately you remember me in
[24:04.320 --> 24:07.920]  the last six months ahead of the election saying we're trying to sell all the products
[24:07.920 --> 24:11.680]  out at discount prices because we're not going to even have that much stuff in the warehouse
[24:11.680 --> 24:16.200]  the new year because if Biden steals the election they plan to shut us down well you now see
[24:16.200 --> 24:21.480]  that all over the news arrest Alex Jones shut Alex Jones down that's why if you want to
[24:21.480 --> 24:25.680]  go to info wars store dot com and get a t-shirt or get a book or get the supplements I would
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.000]  suggest you stock up now we need to bring in as much money as we can to operate into the
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.160]  future if we have our banking taking away which they've already done at many levels
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.240]  but now they're they're closing in for the full takeover and look don't worry you'll
[24:38.240 --> 24:42.800]  be joining me they plan to never turn the US economy back on never take their boot off
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.840]  your neck the leftist going along with this are useful idiots they're going to be in the
[24:46.840 --> 24:53.040]  streets as well the US is slated for total destruction and so this is a foreign takeover
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.960]  ten years after we're living on the streets and living in tents they'll come in we'll
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.040]  have actual Chinese communist in the capital communist minders with Americans under them
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.400]  in your neighborhood they'll rape your daughter they'll rape your wife you are going to be
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.880]  a total slave because you killed the babies and you turn things over to say now there
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.320]  may still be time to turn us around but I just want you to know in what could be some
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.320]  of our last broadcast here where this is going all the comforts all of its going away look
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.320]  at these headlines out of the UK UK government may only let people out once a week just like
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.080]  Australia did you've got an app that shows you've been out longer than you're allowed
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.960]  you get arrested they let the murderers and rapists out of jail but you go to jail because
[25:33.960 --> 25:41.520]  you walked your dog oh a man got caught jogging oh he went to jail they're saying six months
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.240]  in jail but the police they all get caught partying and drinking and restaurants are
[25:45.240 --> 25:51.320]  open for them because they're in the inner party they live by other rules so you're
[25:51.320 --> 25:56.480]  going to see most of these immoral people joining evil so they'll be partially exempt
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.720]  from the rules this is a class system communism and fascism actually bring in total class
[26:02.720 --> 26:09.680]  systems claiming they're getting rid of them so that's how these scum are and they go to
[26:09.680 --> 26:14.600]  college to learn how to be little elitist and they come and they take over society so

[27:01.280 --> 27:06.600]  family and the major robber barons the planet by the 1920s it's all about corporate global
[27:06.600 --> 27:10.480]  governance and now you're seeing it it's not just the blue states the blue cities the
[27:10.480 --> 27:15.560]  communists and socialist nations all working in unison under UN control to establish a
[27:15.560 --> 27:21.600]  medical planetary dictatorship at the core of it is the fortune 100 corporations themselves
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.960]  funded by a handful of private central banking families the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.760]  the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that then you learn the Dutch
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.960]  and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time but they go back
[27:34.960 --> 27:41.840]  to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam those that
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.680]  don't know history really are doing to repeat it they're involved in plotting the world
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.000]  economy that's what the social distancing the master all about it's about bankrupting

[33:19.840 --> 33:27.040]  and agenda 2030 it's on air like oh the New York Times said that's insane all these zones
[33:27.040 --> 33:32.760]  you can't go into and locked in your houses and world government but the borders stay
[33:32.760 --> 33:39.560]  open oh the borders from the third world they stay open and third world populations get
[33:39.560 --> 33:46.240]  to pour in you'd have millions of tuberculosis deaths and real diseases all that's not a
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.880]  big deal oh but because of a couple hundred thousand deaths attributed to COVID now you
[33:52.880 --> 33:57.000]  can't ever leave your house again you notice it's the liberal the socialist the globalist
[33:57.000 --> 34:04.760]  the communist areas where the lockdowns the worst North Korea is the worst the planet
[34:04.760 --> 34:10.080]  because that's where people will put up with it and so the leftists think wearing their
[34:10.080 --> 34:16.360]  mask and not going to work that oh I'm really smart I'm up to go to work now and I get a
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.640]  paycheck and all you're doing is demonstrating your obsolete you're not essential all you're
[34:21.640 --> 34:25.520]  doing is demonstrating you're a useless here all you're doing is demonstrating you're gonna
[34:25.520 --> 34:33.600]  be gotten rid of I talked to one of our security guys that you know bonded security arm security
[34:33.600 --> 34:40.080]  we have here at the office and his mom is one of the head nurses at a nursing home and she
[34:40.080 --> 34:47.040]  said wow they gave all the old people the shots and now a bunch of sick and none of them are
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.000]  getting up and coming to eat they just got the shots last week and they're real lethargic
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.720]  and they're worried they're gonna start dying so I'll tell you next week I'll tell you next
[34:56.720 --> 35:05.080]  week how many how many are dead they said yeah it's crazy kind of like you give premature
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.880]  babies vaccines they stop breathing about a third of them they put them on respirators
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.360]  if your hospital even does that somebody says let them die so it's all just setting up and
[35:13.360 --> 35:19.760]  practicing and testing killings and you know what if the public doesn't speak out against
[35:19.760 --> 35:27.440]  us and say no to this then David Rockefeller will set this up and his protege Bill Gates
[35:27.440 --> 35:41.800]  and his protege his aid to camp his apprentice his minion Zuckerberg are right they are cleaning
[35:41.800 --> 35:47.720]  a scourge off the planet but then I look at Zuckerberg and I look at Gates and how they
[35:47.720 --> 35:51.560]  behave and act in their own these are the nastiest sickest people out there they just
[35:51.560 --> 35:55.120]  sell that they're enslaving everyone and doing this for the betterment of the planet
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.080]  because they can get underlings to agree to it because of that but really they just want
[35:59.080 --> 36:06.800]  to play God and so we're set in an hour to go live to Trump I say an hour he's set to
[36:06.800 --> 36:18.760]  speak at 130 Eastern but he'll usually be about 10 minutes late and we'll go live to
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.920]  him and we'll carry it Mike Adams is joining us with a big article he put together 25 insane
[36:24.920 --> 36:30.600]  crazy agendas Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will push on America but they cease power after
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.440]  rigging the election and when their communist forces are out shooting people at their checkpoints
[36:36.440 --> 36:43.200]  and killing cops and burning down public housing and oh that's all wonderful but when a million
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.600]  people show up in DC and a hundred or so mainly their own Antifa Russia the Capitol the police
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.120]  stand down let folks in most people take selfies with the cops few people break things few people
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.880]  steal things one crazy woman thinking she was sent there by the president to invade
[36:56.880 --> 37:03.960]  and get the secret codes she got shot and killed poor lady but she was a big Q person
[37:03.960 --> 37:12.480]  that augmented reality she wasn't looking for a Pokemon card she was looking for the
[37:12.480 --> 37:20.680]  secret codes and she got killed and they tell you oh that's the end of America now no more
[37:20.680 --> 37:30.240]  freedom after that went down that's coming up but let's look at some of these headlines
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.560]  right here House Dems voting Monday today they give Mike Pence 24 hours to do this so
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.960]  it's an ultimatum that's illegal right there you 25th Amendment Trump or we're going to
[37:42.960 --> 37:49.120]  impeach you wow and I told you Pence would still try 24th Amendment they just wanted
[37:49.120 --> 37:53.560]  Trump to back down while they cut off all his communications and then they're gonna
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.120]  go for him and that started happening Nancy Pelosi basically asked for civil war with
[37:58.120 --> 38:05.920]  insane gambit to expel GOP House members from the house she called for violence she called
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.160]  for insurrection all of her minions did they didn't do any of that they were part of a
[38:10.160 --> 38:18.440]  big rally to investigate election fraud and less than a hundred people assaulted the Capitol
[38:18.440 --> 38:23.960]  and the police stood down on everybody in for the setup oh and the police officer that
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.160]  gave the order we're not gonna find out who gave him that order because he committed
[38:27.160 --> 38:34.160]  suicide yesterday we first broke that the guy that gave the order for the stand down
[38:34.160 --> 38:42.480]  committed suicide oh like Jeffrey Epstein cellmate that met with Bill Barr the day before Epstein
[38:42.480 --> 38:49.160]  killed himself supposedly uh-huh I mean boy this is quite the time to be alive Pelosi
[38:49.160 --> 38:56.320]  I like 24th Amendment because it gets rid of Trump Pelosi is officially launching second
[38:56.320 --> 39:04.760]  Trump impeachment also activate 25th Amendment and then it gets really weird we'll cover
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.760]  this next segment Merkel says big tech shouldn't have power to decide who has free speech so
[39:09.760 --> 39:14.440]  does the Mexican president because finally even these governmental dictators and the
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.880]  Mexican president isn't a dictator he got elected by landslide they stole it from him
[39:18.880 --> 39:22.840]  he got elected again and that this time got in I don't like socialism but the way the
[39:22.840 --> 39:28.080]  Mexicans doing it is the way to do it I mean he's actually giving people jobs redirecting
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.720]  big government corporate contracts that are socialism for the rich for the public he
[39:31.720 --> 39:37.080]  likes Trump he got Trump's populism they met spent several days together and the guy came
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.680]  out and said I like Trump and he also told the Mexicans he's not gonna be there long
[39:41.680 --> 39:46.360]  and you notice what's going on because Trump was giving people like you know two thousand
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.600]  dollars and a six hundred that's what the Mexican socialist would do but that's a real socialist
[39:50.600 --> 39:54.400]  it has its own problems it makes people dependent we're already way past that like Trump said
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.080]  in his speech he said the country's already bankrupt only by us staying in the global
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.360]  superpower we get out of this you lose that it's all over we've got to keep the industry
[40:02.360 --> 40:07.720]  going people can't go bankrupt we have to do this because the last lockdowns he said that
[40:07.720 --> 40:14.320]  the speech totally pragmatic the Mexican president said this is wrong what's happening and there's
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.160]  evidence as it was stolen he said this is fascism and dangerous to have big tech silence
[40:19.160 --> 40:23.800]  the president so they can then say whatever they want and suddenly Merkel who's a dictator
[40:23.800 --> 40:29.480]  she's manipulated those elections many times and been caught she's even scared now because
[40:29.480 --> 40:36.360]  now they're getting it it's global dictatorship by big tech taking over with the chai comms
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.760]  so we're getting down to the end game here that's all coming up on the other side I'm
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.120]  Alex Jones news wars dot com info wars dot com band dot video they're now announcing

[45:16.440 --> 45:20.880]  get ready this vaccine is going to hurt a lot of people 700,000 will get sick or die
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.680]  remember that i could play the club he was putting the proviso out up front but then
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.560]  having major media later say oh nobody gets sick it's totally safe the mrna vaccine is
[45:30.560 --> 45:36.400]  not normal it orders the ribosomes to then program yourselves to produce proteins that
[45:36.400 --> 45:42.520]  attack your own body well guess what happened ladies and gentlemen they've had a cluster
[45:42.520 --> 45:48.040]  of deaths in new york city and a nursing home that was first to get the vaccine that is
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.320]  coming up next hour but we have one of the crew members has been here many years they
[45:53.320 --> 46:00.000]  lost a family member from a vaccine a child years later their next door neighbor they
[46:00.000 --> 46:08.000]  had him over for lunch yesterday the next door neighbor the ladies mother had a stroke
[46:08.000 --> 46:15.160]  and is basically paralyzed in california on the west coast where she's a nurse so her
[46:15.160 --> 46:24.680]  neighbor's mother took the shot had a convulsion had a stroke and is basically a vegetable
[46:24.680 --> 46:31.360]  so that's how this works and i know so many people personally who go yeah my cousin my
[46:31.360 --> 46:38.640]  mom my neighbor got it and now they're really sick and i just told you how one of the security
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.120]  guys said my mom one of the head nurses at hospital they just gave him the shots and
[46:43.120 --> 46:47.440]  nobody's getting out of bed everybody's real sick people aren't going to get food they're
[46:47.440 --> 46:55.560]  not going to dinner or lunch now they're gonna start dying remember what bill gates said
[46:55.560 --> 46:59.000]  we need to get rid of grandma so we can pay for 10 teachers that's a death panel and people
[46:59.000 --> 47:10.920]  don't like that so we've gone over the edge folks and here's what's happened the megabags
[47:10.920 --> 47:18.600]  created trillions and trillions thousands of trillions of fake derivatives they'd sell
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.720]  each mortgage 20 times 100 times some take cases more they've created a giant fraud they
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.640]  have a huge bubble they need an excuse to pop that bubble and make you think you did
[47:27.640 --> 47:32.800]  it and make you think you're getting checked from the government as if you caused that
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.600]  and that's what the covert lockdowns about is a great reset so they don't get the blame
[47:38.600 --> 47:43.160]  for what they've done and instead big tech all these big banks have doubled their stock
[47:43.160 --> 47:49.480]  the last year they've doubled their profits in most cases it goes from like 30 to 120
[47:49.480 --> 47:54.520]  percent profit increase just type into a search engine big tech was biggest winners from
[47:54.520 --> 48:00.160]  covert well not from covert from the lockdown or type in third world starving enough millions
[48:00.160 --> 48:07.200]  dead from covert no from covert lockdown so this is 21st century war it's not hitler and
[48:07.200 --> 48:17.880]  panzer army tanks it's the medical core it's propaganda it's this info oh yeah I mean I
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.320]  know Austin doctors that are in intensive care from the shot but it's only in local
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.720]  news healthy South Florida doctor died two weeks after receiving cover 19 vaccine you
[48:27.720 --> 48:37.040]  see the headline young Mexican doctor in Mexico City dies but it's not related they say yes
[48:37.040 --> 48:44.840]  he had a convulsion one hour after taking it but it wasn't the covert vaccine so this
[48:44.840 --> 48:50.760]  is very powerful it's got to be powerful enough to make your body have an autoimmune response
[48:50.760 --> 49:00.160]  to the basic protein that builds up much of your body because it's meant to eat the placenta
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.800]  a nursing home at zero coronavirus deaths then it vaccinate residents for coronavirus
[49:03.800 --> 49:12.760]  and death began Ron Paul Institute so people asked me here on the eve of destruction how
[49:12.760 --> 49:18.000]  are you doing Alex Schroeder such attack and I'm like just like I was a few years ago two
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.320]  plus years ago when I went to Congress and I warned everybody I said what they're doing
[49:22.320 --> 49:28.640]  to me is a big tech cartel takeover that is meant to take over business in every facet
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.040]  of life you criticize the vaccine your band even if your medical doctor you criticize
[49:33.040 --> 49:38.080]  the lockdown your band you criticize the election and show fraud your band now you say it's wrong
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.960]  what's happened with open borders your band it's in its AI they had hearings in Congress
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.720]  two years ago saying why is Alex Jones even still online they said soon AI will be in
[49:47.720 --> 49:54.080]  control and no will be allowed to visit him in Congress people said man Jones how are
[49:54.080 --> 50:01.080]  you taking it I said how am I taking it you're next you think I think I'm the primary target
[50:01.080 --> 50:09.880]  no if they could get you to reject me warning you someone coming telling you the plan hey
[50:09.880 --> 50:13.520]  I've been in the enemy base I've got the Death Star plans here's what they're like a shut
[50:13.520 --> 50:21.080]  up then you metaphysically were open for the attack if you killed the messenger if you
[50:21.080 --> 50:26.400]  didn't support the messenger it's all metaphysical then they were allowed to come after you well
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.640]  you as an audience didn't reject us and I can tell you I know how God works you will
[50:31.640 --> 50:37.760]  be blessed compared to what happens other people you will be blessed in this I have
[50:37.760 --> 50:40.960]  been blessed through all of this and I give it all to God all the glory and I thank you
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.960]  God but I just want you to know folks this is so real I told this story last night in
[50:46.960 --> 50:53.000]  my own gut level this this analysis everything else was beta before and I was worried about
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.760]  it but I didn't really think they'd go operation well I thought we could stop them they did
[50:56.760 --> 51:03.600]  it they made the jump because they never get held accountable and so now the UK is a super
[51:03.600 --> 51:08.680]  max prison you can only leave your house they're now proposing once a week just like Australia
[51:08.680 --> 51:12.760]  has nothing to do with the virus folks it's total control ahead of bankruptcy collapse
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.400]  having you sign on to waive all your rights for universal income they're bringing you
[51:16.400 --> 51:22.720]  to your knees it's all Stanford Research Institute Milgram experiment Stockholm syndrome
[51:22.720 --> 51:28.280]  mass control here I am over two years ago in the halls of Congress at a press conference
[51:28.280 --> 51:32.360]  it was caring about me but I wasn't allowed in all the cameras turned to me and this is
[51:32.360 --> 51:48.240]  what happened
[51:48.240 --> 51:53.240]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational
[51:53.240 --> 51:58.240]  corporations in big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead
[51:58.240 --> 52:03.920]  of this critical midterm election and the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit
[52:03.920 --> 52:09.640]  that they met with Senator Warner who's running this whole thing to begin shutting down conservatives
[52:09.640 --> 52:13.960]  or the Democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.640]  to them so the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you
[52:18.640 --> 52:22.960]  cannot violate people's free speech so I want regulations like the First Amendment to be
[52:22.960 --> 52:26.640]  enforced to say you're not going to violate people's free speech you're not going to be
[52:26.640 --> 52:30.840]  able to shut people down like this and I'm also here to face my accusers this is the
[52:30.840 --> 52:35.080]  11th hearing they've had where they make up all these incredible lies about me and others
[52:35.080 --> 52:39.320]  to sell the end of the First Amendment and so that's why I'm here to expose this I'm
[52:39.320 --> 52:43.320]  here to speak out about this and I'm here to discuss the reality that there is an attempted
[52:43.320 --> 52:47.960]  purge of the First Amendment taking place in this country and and Apple and Google have
[52:47.960 --> 52:51.240]  already moved to China and are helping round up political dissidents they've had Senate
[52:51.240 --> 52:56.160]  hearings a decade ago saying that Google is now aiding evil in China and helping round
[52:56.160 --> 53:01.720]  people up it's happening to everybody now who's a libertarian or conservative the dominoes
[53:01.720 --> 53:06.440]  are falling the First Amendment's being destroyed but I think the corporate dying dinosaur media
[53:06.440 --> 53:10.120]  has been off more than it could shoot and what you've done is only going to make people
[53:10.120 --> 53:14.760]  be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more but I'll say this shame on the
[53:14.760 --> 53:19.840]  mainstream corporate media shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First
[53:19.840 --> 53:24.720]  Amendment but instead a tap dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent
[53:24.720 --> 53:30.000]  free press working with big tech these these big monopolies need to be broken up and these
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.320]  are digital commons they've said in their own words and under federal law and they shouldn't
[53:34.320 --> 53:38.440]  be in there controlling what individuals are saying in those private discussions and in
[53:38.440 --> 53:41.640]  those discussions online if it's not criminal what's being said and what's being done
[53:41.640 --> 53:47.360]  Obama signed the order go read the order you can deny it all day long that's how they play
[53:47.360 --> 53:56.760]  these games all right so there you go now what is the headline of the live show today

[56:20.040 --> 56:23.520]  richer I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend I don't think that happens
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.440]  very often it's never happened to me I've never had anyone knock on my door and said
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.920]  Tate you're such a good guy how can I improve your life in every single way there's only
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.440]  one person who woke up and thought that and that was me I woke up and thought you know

[56:43.720 --> 56:50.280]  Kool-Aid's bad the turbo force is good we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.160]  warfare the united nations the big corporations the globalist big tech and big farmer all
[56:55.160 --> 56:59.600]  pushing the covid's most deadly thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak
[56:59.600 --> 57:04.320]  flu or cold but if you are deficient then you can actually die from it that's why you
[57:04.320 --> 57:10.000]  see somebody dying inside the nursing homes meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.920]  and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the covid-19 vaccine
[57:14.920 --> 57:18.880]  especially the mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly and now they're
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.760]  having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies
[57:23.760 --> 57:27.000]  they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the time a lot of times they just
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.640]  let them die and that's on the record it does that guillomare's narcolepsy cancer all these
[57:32.640 --> 57:36.160]  other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy
[57:36.160 --> 57:41.240]  theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from something
[57:41.240 --> 57:44.680]  that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media
[57:44.680 --> 57:54.480]  says it's safe they do it you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:54.480 --> 58:02.880]  I've been everywhere man I've been everywhere man across the desert bare man I breathe the

[58:38.960 --> 58:44.840]  to come up in t-minus 30 minutes house dims introduced article of impeachment against
[58:44.840 --> 58:51.040]  Trump have the necessary votes joining us is Mike Adams at naturalnews.com appreciate
[58:51.040 --> 58:56.160]  him coming on with us he's written an excellent article 25 insane crazy agendas Joe Biden and
[58:56.160 --> 59:02.360]  Kamala Harris will push on America if they seize power after rigging the election Mike
[59:02.360 --> 59:06.560]  thanks for joining us what is your big takeaway about the state of the nation and where we
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.440]  are and what's unfolding before we come back next segment get into your report well thanks
[59:10.440 --> 59:13.640]  for having me on Alex and of course we're all waiting to see what Trump is going to
[59:13.640 --> 59:19.160]  say here in the next maybe 40 minutes or so I know you're gonna carry that live and I'd
[59:19.160 --> 59:22.760]  be happy to ride shotgun with you on that and just just just comment if there is any room
[59:22.760 --> 59:27.760]  to comment the thing is what we really know we know for sure that all the mechanisms had
[59:27.760 --> 59:33.080]  been put in place for Trump to be able to do things like invoke the insurrection act
[59:33.080 --> 59:38.560]  or invoke his 2018 executive order you know he put Chris Miller in place at the DoD and
[59:38.560 --> 59:44.040]  so many things were put in place but that doesn't mean they're going to be used and
[59:44.040 --> 59:49.200]  where we all are right now is waiting to see if Trump is actually going to be able to invoke
[59:49.200 --> 59:54.680]  these things or if he even has enough of an infrastructure of staff who will obey orders
[59:54.680 --> 59:59.440]  to carry these things out and this is the big problem as you've spoken about many times
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:06.240]  the betrayals from the inside you know every other person in Washington DC is a CIA puppet
[1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:12.760]  they're stabbing Trump in the back mercilessly and but think about this Alex Nancy Pelosi
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:18.400]  would not be trying to remove Trump from power so desperately unless she knew that he had
[1:00:18.400 --> 1:00:24.880]  the power to do something dramatic and decisive so oh you're right he has the EAS alert system
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:29.120]  he I mean these are Chinese communist spies all of them on record they don't even hide
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:37.360]  that I mean yeah exactly yeah right so we're not out of all hope yet but it the situation
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:42.280]  is very dire it's very dark they did run the left ran a successful false flag operation
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:46.120]  on on the 6th and they're using that to demonize Trump supporters they're gonna they're gonna
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:52.080]  roll out the military police state dictatorship under Biden that they claimed to oppose when
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:56.320]  they said Trump was going to do it so they're going to turn this country into a military
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:02.440]  dictatorship of sorts and and use the insurrection act against patriots so this this that's all
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:07.280]  true that's all happening Trump has a very very narrow window of opportunity to stop
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:12.120]  this now but Alex for all we know Trump may have he may have thrown in the towel at this
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:18.080]  point and said you know what the swamp is too deep to to to drain you can't fix the system
[1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:22.960]  from the inside perhaps Trump is deciding that the only way to really fix America is
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:28.160]  to let the corrupt system implode and fail and crater and then start a new system on
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:33.600]  the other side that may be what he's thinking we don't know but you know how how can you
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:38.040]  be in Washington DC you've seen the corruption yourself there and and think there's any way
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:43.720]  to repair that system right now what I call it Alex is this is the last stage looting
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:48.960]  of the American Empire everybody has their hand out in DC if Biden gets in he's gonna
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:53.760]  pump trillions of dollars into the hands guys when you pull it out of yesterday's stack
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:58.440]  or just go to Richard in Haas the head of the CFR's Twitter Richard in Haas he says
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:02.520]  oh this is the end of America and celebrates it and says it's Trump's fault they were the
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:06.640]  ones positioning us for collapse Trump tried to stop it but I look I know what's going
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:11.880]  on with Trump we've got I've got his lawyers they're in the meetings with him I know what
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:16.280]  Trump you know I know it unfolded I know what happened to Trump will come back I'll tell
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:20.720]  you briefly Mike and get your take on it then we'll go through these 25 key points of what
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:24.960]  they're planning to really break this country once and for all while they want to bankrupt
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:30.920]  things because they want to consolidate power they want ideological control they want absolute

[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:44.120]  its statements about the riots and pearl harbor and the worst thing but but now we know that they
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:50.920]  sent antifa in dressed up like patriots to try to get mob control going try to trick that giant
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:56.520]  crowd look at it going back for miles into the building absolutely insane and we now know this
[1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:03.240]  was a false flag that dutted it impacted on the surface it didn't get the people that were being
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:09.080]  manipulated over eight chan with with the zip ties and others to go in and quote hog tie pelosi
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:15.560]  and those images thank god that didn't happen uh being provocateur mike i think we dodged a bullet
[1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:21.480]  on this one trump set to speak in about 30 minutes what do you think he's gonna say well i i i have
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.520]  no idea what he's gonna say because all the options are on the table i i suspect it's gonna be
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:33.400]  kind of wishy washy because he he's still got you know a week or more uh in office and he's
[1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:37.960]  still got options on the table and there are a lot of things that can happen so i suspect he's not
[1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:42.600]  going to concede but he's also not going to commit you know sad i'm sad to say but but we'll have to
[1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:48.040]  wait and see what i do want to mention alex is that a secretary of state mike pompeo has a move
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:54.040]  that he could make right now to fight back against this big tech deplatforming of parlor and other
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:59.240]  conservative platforms and individuals mike pompeo could order the state department to seize
[1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:05.080]  the domain names of amazon dot com google dot com facebook dot com youtube twitter and so on
[1:06:05.080 --> 1:06:13.160]  seize the domain names and charge those companies with acting as part of a foreign cyber warfare
[1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:18.200]  attack on the united states of america to rig our elections and he can cite john ratcliffe's dmi
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:22.440]  report that contains that evidence as well as other evidence by the way mike people think that
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:27.560]  sounds radical they've seized the president's communications exactly exactly and they've
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:34.280]  deplatformed parlor so amazon has chosen a side here and they've chosen the side of of china
[1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:40.120]  uh amazon is making itself the enemy of america as long as well as other big tech companies and
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:45.560]  by the way the state department routinely seizes domain names due to a piracy issues and so on you
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:50.600]  know websites pirating brand names like gucci and rolex so they do have the power to do that and
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:55.880]  they should do that even if it's just for what uh you know nine days here they should they should
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:07:01.560]  send a message that says you can't violate the civil rights of tens of millions of americans
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:05.960]  or hundreds right no one ever pushes back to keep testing and testing and testing and now we've
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:11.880]  gone to full war mode well well that's right and and trump has even even if he's going to leave
[1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:17.960]  office on the 20th he has the declassification option right now he's got material that he could
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:23.560]  declassify we we know they have that uh sydney powell routinely spoke about the information
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:29.400]  you know the kraken details from the 305th military intelligence battalion that that wasn't
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:33.800]  that wasn't just fiction they have evidence it's just that none of the courts will hear it and even
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:38.840]  today the supreme court has thrown out two more cases proving that scottis has betrayed america
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:44.360]  as well so now the only options are as you've been encouraging use the emergency broadcast
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:49.560]  alert system declassify the information the american people need to know use the power of
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:54.920]  the state department while you have it to shut down the big tech enemies of america the treasonous
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:08:00.120]  actors who are trying to de-platform all conservatives because you know they're going to come for us
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:05.080]  and by the way it in my article of 25 crazy things you know and you've said this to alex
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:10.520]  they're going to come for every gun owner white person christian trump supporter conservative
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:15.560]  they're not just it's not enough for them to just silence you they're going to disarm you and then
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:21.080]  they're going to come to kill you this is genocide this is a cultural revolution it starts with
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:26.440]  silencing you and then next they take away the guns if you let them and then they come to kill you
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:31.720]  this has been done before over and over in history and it's coming to a by the way again it's not
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:35.880]  that black people or brown people are bad you know you're married to a lady from taiwan it's
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:41.320]  that the globalist set us against each other and biden gave a speech yesterday we have the clip
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:46.520]  and he said oh we're going to keep the country locked down even worse but only minority businesses
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:53.560]  get bailout money so think of that white businesses if you're white you're shut you're
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:59.000]  non-essential and you never get bailout i mean that is the most racist crazy stuff but that's
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:04.840]  what they're teaching us is to accept the suspension of logic well well right exactly and
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:09.640]  that that's going to characterize the biden administration i believe that they will try
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:16.840]  to pursue the green new deal which will lead to widespread famine starvation across america actual
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:21.320]  millions of people starving to death potentially if they shut down combustion engines that drive
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:26.840]  the agricultural industry and food transportation this is all part of the agenda of the left and
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:31.640]  you've said it before i've said it as well what people need to realize is this is a global genocide
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:36.520]  campaign it's not an accident that the vaccines are killing all those patients in the in the nursing
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:41.960]  home near saracuse new york it's not an accident it's all by design it's not an accident that the
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:46.440]  businesses were shut down and people are going to be homeless and dependent on government handouts
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:50.360]  it's not an accident that they want to shut down the food supplies the farms everything that you
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:55.640]  depend on even your your right to speak because it is a global genocide depopulation agenda and
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:02.120]  you know alex if i could just say you and i were really that i think among the top two people in
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:08.520]  the world who warned about this starting six years ago or longer and you know we were mocked and
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:13.080]  they didn't they didn't listen to us and now people have come around to realize that everything that
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:18.280]  we warned about is here everything we told people get off those platforms because they're gonna ban
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:23.000]  you why didn't people move off of twitter and facebook and youtube sooner because they thought
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.920]  well that's where the audience is well what's their audience today it's zero because they've
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:32.840]  been banned that's another great point what about like you said amazon and all of them saying that's
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:38.440]  shutting down parlor it's gone just because the trump might move there i mean the authority that's
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:44.040]  beyond china yeah it's it's even worse than that there there's credible information coming out today
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:49.480]  that then left-wing uh black hat cyber hackers have been able to hack through the authentication
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:56.920]  system uh that ran parlor and that they are right now downloading uh all enormous amounts of data
[1:10:56.920 --> 1:11:02.760]  from parlor users perhaps including the you know the driver's licenses and metadata location geolocation
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:07.320]  data that people had uploaded that that's a breaking story right now i've been getting that from
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:12.680]  multiple sources uh because this was a planned takedown but it but amazon took it down in a way
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:18.920]  that left open back doors so that leftists could gather names of conservatives in order to terrorize
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:23.800]  them and they are going to go door to door there there are going to be death squads under a biden
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:29.320]  harris administration and they're going to try to literally carry out a genocide against conservatives
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:36.280]  across america because it worked everywhere else yeah except well we have a second amendment and
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:41.000]  in most places genocide succeeded without you know anyone having a second amendment we have a
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.120]  second amendment and i don't think the american people are going to hand over their guns to to
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:51.080]  any tyrant so uh you know we're we're headed for some interesting times that's for sure
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:56.520]  because when when harris or biden calls for everybody to turn in your ar-15s your glocks
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:02.280]  you know your revolvers uh people are going to say no come by the way he just said he will defeat
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:07.800]  the second amendment and the nr a he will defeat us that's that's his plan that's absolutely his
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.400]  plan i mean look they've destroyed the first amendment they're coming for the second amendment
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:16.680]  next you know they've already destroyed the fourth and fifth amendments essentially as well this this
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:23.720]  is a a really a global takedown of the human population that is being projected into the the
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:30.280]  rigged uh authoritarian system of american politics uh biden's just a puppet for the globalist and
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:36.040]  the globalist want all americans to be dead that's really what's behind all of this and by the way
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:41.000]  remember how you know a year ago we were talking about bill gates wants to dim the sun with the
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:46.520]  scopex project and push pollutants into the stratosphere and everybody said oh you're crazy
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:50.840]  that's not happening well guess what it's all back in the media now it's it's being pursued uh again
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:57.080]  it's being ramped up this is the plan to shut down sunlight shut down uh food crops from being able
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:02.360]  to grow and combine that with green new deal aspects to to kill fossil fuels and combustion
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:08.520]  engines you have mass starvation famine this is a planetary assault people say oh that's science
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:16.440]  fiction we're in the year 2021 this is a planetary assault yes it it is and we're all in the crosshairs
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:21.720]  it's it's unknown how long you or i will be able to continue to communicate with anyone
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:24.920]  frankly i mean that's that's the reality of this and so it's finally yet we're not just saying that
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:29.800]  i mean i told people six months ago i said they're gonna steal the election they're gonna move
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:35.320]  to shut everyone down and i said you better spread the word you better start your own sites now
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:42.120]  because and go ahead antifa are going to be biden's uh shock troops so you're going to see antifa
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:47.160]  in your face in your cities in your neighborhoods now for by the way you said that we'll show
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:54.360]  new york last night and la will we come back and stay with us cognitive dissonance is a major
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:14:00.600]  issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:06.360]  have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:12.280]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:18.600]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:24.440]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:31.880]  digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:38.280]  immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:45.000]  family and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:51.240]  reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:57.720]  dot com mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:02.120]  as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:08.040]  uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:14.200]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin which according to
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:22.360]  some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:26.840]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:34.200]  the all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:38.120]  through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:41.880]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:46.840]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:50.280]  thanks for the plug
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:16:08.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:19.080]  you
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:22.200]  the george thoroughs funded world government group
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:28.840]  anti-free speech army of method devil worshipers attack people in california texas new york last
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:39.240]  night going on the street saying we own this country here's some of what happened in new york
[1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:04.120]  they get rid of families they get rid of parents they create these people
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:08.520]  and they turn them loose saying you're gonna have all this power and control
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:13.240]  but you don't have a million trump supporters out exposing corruption well you just hire a hundred
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:17.320]  people to break in the capital yeah the capital police stand down now the capital police officer
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.920]  reportedly gave the order has committed suicide we're very sad for that very convenient though
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:27.720]  that should be investigated as more than just suicide perhaps but my condoms you were getting
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:32.920]  into this you're not being this topic this is world war three it's it's economic it's cultural
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:40.120]  it's it's it's digital it's technotronic it's a technocracy and they need america out of the way
[1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:44.680]  for their world government to go into place which is designed to carry out the depopulation of the
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.840]  earth the globalists have gotten control of they don't want to deal with people they want to cut
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:54.200]  the numbers by at least 90 so when you say that it sounds outrageous but it doesn't anymore does it
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:58.440]  because now people get it they're really moving they don't care if it comes out they're killing
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:02.040]  old folks with a vaccine they don't care if it turns out it's killing a large percentage of
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.360]  the nurses and doctors that take it they're just going to move forward right because now they have
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:12.520]  total information dominance so they can push any narrative or engineer any lies that they want
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:18.920]  so when when antifa is in the streets burning down buildings oh that's peaceful resistance
[1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:25.320]  when patriots are in the streets not burning down buildings that's terrorism and insurrection
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:29.720]  so total information dominance now especially with the deep platforming that's all their hundreds
[1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:35.640]  of soros da's in absolutely the the justice system is corrupt all the way up to the supreme
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:41.640]  court you know the the law enforcement at the city level is completely corrupted not necessarily at
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:46.520]  the sheriff county level but in the cities it is so and by the way to anybody who thinks that this
[1:18:46.520 --> 1:18:51.720]  is outrageous you know saying that this is a global depopulation agenda look that's what people were
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:58.200]  saying about what you said alex or what i said two years ago and then there was 2020 and now
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:03.800]  there's 2021 which is going to make 2020 look like a a walk in the park trust me that's what it's
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:09.640]  called agenda 2030 explain what they're planning to do in the next nine years well look they're
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:13.800]  they're going to forcibly remove people from rural areas they're going to stack people in the cities
[1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:17.640]  where they can monitor and control you they're going to take away all your assets with the global
[1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:22.840]  financial reset take away your savings take away the value of the us dollar the dollar will collapse
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:27.240]  we are headed for an absolute collapse of the dollar at some point and by the way by the way
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:33.320]  let's explain this is a model of mal that's even what the prime minister of canada said so what you
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:38.040]  said is key they're going to force people out of the rural areas for re-education that means death
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:44.200]  in the cities yeah absolutely and and i've even i've got a contact of very reputable former military
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:50.760]  contact on the ground uh in maryland today texted me and said that they are setting up the fema
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:56.600]  operation there in in maryland a specific county i don't want to name setting up tents and emergency
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:20:01.560]  equipment i've had army special operations current call and confirm they are preparing for gun
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:07.080]  confiscation they're preparing fema camps right now yep yep they are setting it all up this this
[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:12.360]  is all in place and if you look around dc right now there are thousands of national guard troops
[1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:20.040]  and a seven foot high fence around the capitol building and this is all for to protect a Pelosi
[1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:25.400]  and biden to protect them with the military forces to create their military dictatorship that they
[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:31.880]  claimed to oppose just as the most fixed in 1917 it took them two years to get full control first
[1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:36.360]  they put a military cordon around moscow people say well they're not going to repeat an old plan
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:40.680]  no they are because it worked they're going to follow that exact plan now the war against the
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:46.440]  other cities and states and then rural areas begins and let me put out this warning so there are
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:53.560]  i believe protests being planned at state capitals around the country for i think the 19th or somewhere
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:56.760]  around that don't have yes they've got provocateurs within the groups that are planned to attack the
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:21:02.600]  capitals absolutely i have that from again inside sources in dc i'll leave it at that that's right
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:08.360]  that's right though so you're going to see you know 20 false flag operations across america
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:13.880]  on that day and that's going to then give the democrats and biden the justification to pass
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:19.320]  whatever they want to pass to say that all guns are now illegal gun confiscation is on
[1:21:19.320 --> 1:21:25.800]  and and by the way alex when that happens i i believe that that that will set off the the actual
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:31.800]  kinetic civil war across america because you don't you don't let them take your guns because you know
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:35.320]  the only reason they want to take your guns is because they're planning to do something that
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:40.760]  you might resist and and that is going to be to come kill you here's the whole uh they're right
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:45.000]  to say that most the capital police are on our side and others the very security people of these
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.720]  globalists are going to be the ones that are going to be key as an operation valkyrie if they try this
[1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:57.640]  yeah yeah absolutely i i just want to reiterate to everybody here you know never initiate violence
[1:21:57.640 --> 1:22:01.880]  we always have the right to self-defense if the globalist commanders engage in violence against
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:06.360]  the american people that they're a general a general is more in command than the private that
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:10.760]  pulls the trigger they must be held accountable well i hope that trump will announce shortly
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:15.800]  although i doubt it but i hope that trump would say we are in a state of war we are now enemy
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:21.480]  occupied territory and that trump would invoke every every american citizen to defend the republic
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:26.120]  i hope that's what he says but i don't think he will well let's be clear i'm saying if they
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:31.720]  start arresting and gun confiscating and killing patriots the the generals that are running this
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.920]  are are they started the war i'm all about defensive defense i'm not about offense but americans need
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:41.640]  to know uh that uh you know these guys are already violent the nuremberg coves diva convention
[1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:45.880]  with the force inoculations are trying to push they already put us under covered martial law
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:50.120]  and it's clear they're going to make their move mike and biological weapons are already a form
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:54.120]  of violence actually a form of warfare from communist china as well as the cyber warfare
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:59.640]  that has been waged against us during this rigged election so we have been attacked with with two
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:04.280]  weapons of mass destruction already and we are in a state of war right now and we are
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:10.520]  about to be living under enemy occupied territory that's really where we are so i again i hope
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:15.880]  trump acknowledges that reality and at least if he if he's going to leave the white house you know
[1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:21.800]  at least use this these last few days to do everything he can to declassify to empower the
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:26.840]  american people to defend their republic and and to seize the domain names of these tech giants
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:31.480]  that are are waging war against america that's right here's the point i don't want destabilization
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:36.360]  i don't want civil war but the left keeps pushing it and they want power they're involved in a
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:41.160]  takeover so we keep saying let's not be violent let's not be whatever then they stage stuff to
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:47.320]  blame us anyway so this is insane right well they and the left wants a civil war by the way they
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:52.600]  they want that under a biden presidency because they want america destabilized china wants america
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:58.200]  destabilized and also china wants america to whip up new hostilities toward russia
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:02.440]  and that narrative is all also being put into place as well but at the end i know we're about
[1:24:02.440 --> 1:24:08.120]  to go to break here but at the end of the day what trump did is he handed america four years of
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:13.560]  delaying the globalist agenda that four years looks like it's now up that's where we are
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:19.560]  but their hate of trump was used to build up their massive resistance and to get left us now
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:23.880]  to support any form of evil they don't care about free speech they want to kill us they all talk

[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:37.000]  demonize they saw us light about they saw us as a black sheep but now that's a badge of honor and
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:42.200]  people go wow they did warn of all this so mike we can go through their agenda we'll do that next
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:46.680]  segment the time we have left what can we do on the offense what are other important points you
[1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:52.040]  want to make about this moment we're in and how are the globalist position i see them they always
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:56.840]  had this plan but i see them accelerating it because it's not going well for them at many levels
[1:32:58.280 --> 1:33:04.120]  yeah well uh one of the most important things that people can do is to when gun registration
[1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:09.160]  comes down from the biden administration and they go after the arm braces and the 80 percent
[1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:14.040]  lowers and you know your your pistols with an arm brace there are simple things that you can do
[1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:21.560]  you can for example just with taking two pins out the takedown pins of your pistols slash rifle
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:26.840]  you can separate the the the upper and the upper receiver in the bolt carrier group
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:32.760]  from the lower receiver with the arm brace on it it is no longer a firearm and that that is no
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:37.880]  longer a functioning firearm it doesn't doesn't qualify as an sbr or anything uh now you know
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:42.600]  i'm not your gun attorney everybody listening check your own local laws comply with your laws
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:48.200]  but one thing that american people can do is just takedown take down those and store them store them
[1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:52.360]  in your home you know have them have them ready for the uh the chai comm invasion of america
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:57.160]  because you're gonna need to defend your country probably against uh uh communist troops at some
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:34:01.640]  point and you're gonna need to you know put together those firearms again to by the way not to
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:06.840]  interrupt you but i'll play this next segment they're training at eight bases for ground combat in
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:13.880]  canada and trados says he wants he wants a chinese dictatorship and admires gg ping so just like
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.160]  hitler admired musolini we better pay attention to this yeah yeah exactly and the second thing is
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:27.080]  understand that the the omnibus spending bill has put tens of billions of dollars into the the vaccine
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:33.560]  deep state bio weapons industry through the n i h so they're now being funded to build more biological
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:39.080]  weapons and they're going to release them because the first one worked so well for their evil aims
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:44.440]  we're gonna have covet twenty one covet twenty two covet twenty three forever with more vaccines
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:50.040]  vaccine updates vaccine boosters mandatory mass mandatory lockdowns forever until the system
[1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:58.040]  is dismantled this is this is a revenue model for them as well as a tyranny model it and they
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:03.000]  intend to do this forever because again it gives them the global social credit score gives them
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:09.240]  the depopulation it's their master plan that's right and when you combine the the covet terrorism
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:14.680]  with uh carbon taxes that are coming back carbon taxes allow them to control your movements and
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:20.200]  restrict your use of fossil fuels and even to tax your very existence because as you breathe you're
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:27.240]  exhaling carbon dioxide so through it lists you as a pollutant yeah yeah you are a pollutant and
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:33.720]  you are a threat to the system the system no longer wants you or needs you i mean let's be honest
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:38.760]  they've got advanced robotic systems that are going to take over about 70 percent of human labor
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:44.920]  and so they intend to eliminate more than 70 percent of the human population on our planet
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:50.840]  we're talking about genocide to the tune of billions of people probably six and a half billion
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:55.960]  people that's what they plan to eliminate which is a thousand times larger than the holocaust of
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:36:01.320]  world war two and the third right a thousand times larger and they're on a record saying because we're
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:04.600]  obsolete they're getting ready to get rid of this and we wonder how are they going to do it it's here
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:09.880]  mike so people have to understand wow this is really happening yeah it is really happening and
[1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:15.080]  the way you can survive it because perhaps about 10 of the human population will make it through is
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:21.080]  you have to be entirely self-reliant off the grid as much as possible you need to be able to grow
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:28.280]  your own food and to defend yourself and and then survive the onslaught of the mass illegal
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:33.080]  immigration that's coming the troops the chinese troops that are going to invade at some point
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:38.200]  the the government you know jack booted thugs that biden's going to unleash against america and they
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:43.480]  won't invade they're already calling them helpers that they're visiting helpers that's right that's
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:47.320]  right and and by the way they're gonna they're gonna attack the churches uh just like communist
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:51.880]  china they're going to try to burn down the churches and arrest the pastors who don't go along
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:58.440]  with the globalist agenda so uh if your pastor is truly teaching the word of christ he or she
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:03.160]  will be under attack if they're if they're telling you to surrender then they they will be allowed
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:08.280]  to exist so so we gotta have underground churches underground farming everybody needs to understand
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:13.480]  now we're losing the country we're going under long term globalist occupation the republicans
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:19.800]  didn't know what hit them guerrilla food farming is going to be a very big thing smuggling seeds
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:25.080]  it'll be just like growing marijuana growing tomatoes growing pumpkins growing squash growing
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.720]  everything's going to be under the radar now including money by the way because the dollar
[1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:34.360]  will collapse money will move to alternative systems including crypto system by the way folks
[1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:37.720]  i'm sorry to tell you this but this is the world government takeover we warned you about it's now
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:42.440]  here they're coming to kill you and your family sorry folks i didn't make it up i mean they mean
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:45.400]  business bill gates wants to kill you well they're right back stay with us
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:54.280]  fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted they would they've always been
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:37:59.160]  part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:05.080]  rightfully taking office for second term ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the hammer
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:09.560]  harder than ever on this republic they are going to explode gas prices they're going to shut down
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:14.840]  our coal power plants they're going to cut off the energy source to us so it's impossible for factories
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:20.040]  to go back here this is economic domination this is economic war we're being consolidated we're
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:25.320]  being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states they're consolidating
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:31.080]  power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:36.040]  ownership of all the infrastructure and property this is a monopolistic takeover that's what the
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:41.880]  great reset is clout swab and these other criminals admitted that's what social distancing is so your
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:47.960]  business is only a 25 for several more years no small businesses will be there this is a master
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:53.880]  plan say no it's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:58.920]  us they encourage people to live in tents cities is homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:04.680]  engage in petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:10.440]  great reset they want to lower expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:13.720]  everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they want you
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:18.680]  to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalists fly around in private jets
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:24.440]  they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:30.920]  admit this now they want us locked down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:36.360]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g is
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:41.800]  meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all their admitted plan the public's
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:46.680]  finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post-human
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:54.840]  future you better find out about it right now due to the covid lockdown destroying the supply chain
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:59.240]  many of the best-selling product simple words are no longer available and i thought that

[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:46.680]  reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video share the link
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:49.720]  the resistance.video the resistance.video
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:56.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:42:14.840]  the enemies plan is to slowly condition you to accept tyranny and then when it finally hits you
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:19.560]  with the big mega does you think oh this is just the next level i'll just adapt to being a slave
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:27.080]  and it kills you that's why it's pouring in at my office people have neighbors and family that
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:31.480]  have had strokes or died from the covid vaccine whole nursing home sick and then it's even in the
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:36.600]  news but it comes just a background chatter where they're normalizing all of this when medical
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:43.880]  doctors speak up they get banned and so this is the big fable takeover why do you think they put a
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:50.600]  person who's so brain damaged he's probably got about an 85 IQ in right now and a crazy front
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:55.480]  woman who's just as dumb Kamala Harris because they're gonna get blamed with a collapse and
[1:42:55.480 --> 1:43:01.720]  everything then they'll be replaced by a savior later no one wanted the position that biden and
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:07.320]  harris have been given by the establishment and so that's another sign folks that it's gonna get
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:13.320]  civil war bad i don't want that to happen mike adams you're dead on we are not exaggerating one
[1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:17.960]  centella it's frankly worse than you've even said worse than i could describe and i just won't lie
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:21.960]  to the public this is the megaton attack this is the biggest salt people better get ready
[1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:27.000]  yeah absolutely and if i could just say on a personal note because for all we know this may
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.600]  be the last time i can ever even appear on your show who knows but on a personal note alex uh
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:38.200]  i'm one of the very few people in the world who who i think can have just an inkling of an understanding
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:43.640]  of the personal sacrifice that you have made in order to continue to express your voice and
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:49.560]  and to fight for humanity and trump has made uh the you know the greatest sacrifice uh i've i've
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:53.640]  made you know i've been vilified and i've i've had a sacrifice but not to the extent that you have
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:44:00.840]  and i just want to thank you for holding the line and uh speaking for humanity you've invested
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:07.720]  every asset in your organization to win for america uh you you haven't held back you've been
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:12.840]  all in you put your neck out you said things early on that people thought were crazy now they all
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:17.800]  they know it's all true and you didn't hold back so i just want to thank you on a personal note
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:21.800]  for for for doing well you didn't hold back hold back either brother i know you sacrifice because
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:27.000]  we know how bad it is on the other side there's no making a deal with this that's i'd make a deal
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:31.880]  with it if it came in you can't make a deal with it yeah that that's exactly right uh the
[1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:39.080]  the we can only really i mean i'm going to get a little bit biblical here but the ultimate judge
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:45.480]  of this is god we are not the opinions of the radical left and the corrupt system and you know
[1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:51.240]  the the satanic worshipers and the demons that are now running our country their opinions don't
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:56.680]  matter it's god's opinion that matters we will never give in to the evil and remember they can
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:01.480]  only take your soul if you surrender it because your soul is bulletproof they can't take your
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.120]  soul they can beat your body they can throw you in in prison they can they can crush your
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:11.800]  online reputation but they can't take your soul as long as as you have faith in god and right now
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:18.600]  alex we we've got to continue to have faith that humanity won't be destroyed by evil and i know it's
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:22.760]  difficult right now and i know that but i totally might just interrupt because you're so dead on
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:28.200]  target here this is a satanic rampage because they couldn't get full control and if long people stay
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.760]  on their eyes on god and they're good and and just tell the truth and recognize the enemy
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:37.080]  what matters is the process we're going through and this is going to be rough but anybody that
[1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:41.880]  believes magic stuff about oh it's going to be fine and secret forces are going to save you no no
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:48.280]  folks only us together with god are going to fix this yeah and and also by the way just um for
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:52.520]  for people watching to know you know the the way they know that you are authentic and that i'm
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:57.480]  authentic is you know even throughout 2020 you know you and i didn't always see everything
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:02.040]  exactly the same way but that's just proof that we're not fake news we don't get a memo every day
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.720]  that tells us what to think or what to say we have different takes we have different sources
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:09.080]  different interpretations that's the way it should be because we're the real media we're
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:12.680]  the real news and in real news you're going to get you have different guests that that disagree
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:18.600]  with each other even and that's the way it should be and it's it's authentic and if we survive this
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:25.160]  then we are the the real media for america because if if trump if trump gets a second term
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:31.320]  if he pulls this out somehow that we don't yet know uh he he would take down probably the well
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:36.120]  that's the thing he's been surrounded they've ignored him his spirit was good he did so much
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:40.120]  good and everybody got mad at him that he wasn't perfect well they're about to find out with biden
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:45.320]  what trump was holding back well yeah and also i mean i've got very good incredible intelligence
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:50.440]  that trump has been threatened with detonations of dirty bombs and nukes and all kinds of things
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:55.960]  and uh you know trump doesn't want to see america turned into a radioactive wasteland oh he looks so
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:47:02.680]  strong at wednesday's speech so defiant i was there like 20 feet from him and and i was like my god
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:06.920]  this is he looked like a superhero up there i'm serious yeah and then compared to these i mean
[1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:11.720]  to see him in person under attack and then we just tried we went there they set us up doesn't matter
[1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:16.600]  we were met in the arena like teddy roosevelt talked about well that that's why we can't second
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:20.760]  guess trump we don't know what he's dealing with we don't know the threats that that are our
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:26.520]  leveled against him so we just have to thank him for what he has done he has delayed evil
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:31.960]  for four years we need to pray for us if i need to pray for pray that's right we need to pray for him
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:38.360]  and we need to pray every day and i've been doing that as well and uh it has been quite an experience
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:44.120]  but but i'm telling you alex uh we are not america is not finished yet uh we still have
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:50.520]  the the second amendment we have a hundred million patriots more than that in this country
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:56.360]  trump is still president for nine days pompeo is still secretary of state chris miller is still at
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:01.480]  the do d and so on there are resources available will they be used that's the question we can only
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:05.640]  pray and hope that we know he would do it but he's surrounded by people that say they'll do it
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:10.680]  then they run off and and sabotage him and lie about what he said to the media to remove him
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:15.080]  he's just surrounded by trash but i would say to trump if he if he reached out to the people
[1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:20.040]  directly today the people would come to his aid the people agree he has to directly say non-violently
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:25.960]  you need to take to the streets need to whatever this is a chinese spy what would you do if you
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:31.480]  were trump tell us well i i would invoke the insurrection act i would i would order special
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:37.880]  forces to arrest the traitors i would speak to the people i would activate the people and
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:43.160]  and uh under the second amendment to peacefully defend the republic against all enemies foreign
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:49.880]  and domestic it's very simple he could do that now and the people would respond in huge numbers
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:54.440]  nationwide now the left would try to hijack that and try to create false flags but the the
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:59.400]  overwhelming outflowing of patriots would would be i agree because everything they fear is him
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.040]  being on air he needs an oval office not a farewell address but an emergency address saying
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:08.920]  biden's a chinese agent here's the evidence he's going to cut our power off this is a foreign
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:13.880]  takeover you've got you the governors must mobilize you must have a constitutional convention
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:18.520]  whatever you gotta have we just have to america's under attack he must raise the alarm he must just
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:25.000]  tell it like it is exactly right and and if for whatever reason he is unable to do that
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.120]  then the american people need to make it known to biden and harris and polosin others that we the
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:35.800]  people do not consent to your tyranny to your rigged elections to your your fraud your false
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:41.720]  flag operations we do not consent in fact we withdraw our consent from you and we the people
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:48.200]  will declare a new independence i believe all across this country we will set up a new government
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:52.920]  that competes with the fake biden harris government i believe this is going to happen
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:57.400]  all across america and even in california by the way in oregon in washington and the key
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:03.720]  the key is understanding that biden literally is a foreign agent i mean it
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:09.320]  separate from even election fraud we've already proven that but the way the ballots were sent
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:12.840]  into fraud the way the legislators didn't vote but it doesn't matter he's literally on the payroll
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:19.800]  the chinese on record right right and and look if if if biden and harris if they were to hire
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:26.360]  good people like a pulitzer to come in and do a full audit of all the ballots transparent audit
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:30.680]  and not just have the fbi shredding ballots if they were to do a full transparent audit and
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:36.680]  if they were able to show the american people that biden legitimately won with with real votes
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:42.920]  i would absolutely accept that i'm not asking in any way to override a legitimate election
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:51.320]  i'm asking to defend uh the the win that trump actually earned trump won the election was rigged
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:56.200]  so they won't look at it they won't give us transparency because they know that they cheated
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:00.920]  and any look at the machines the ballots the source code anything will expose all of that so
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:05.880]  they are illegitimate and they're proving it every day so we must withdraw our consent
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:10.280]  from those who have tried to steal our nation i totally agree and you know mike i hope this
[1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:14.680]  is the last time we speak we've never talked like that before this is real and we don't get into all
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:18.360]  this stuff that's happened above this behind the scenes people you know this is intense this is
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  serious and i wasn't up here telling you that if biden got in they shut everybody off the internet
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:27.800]  that was always the plan and now it's here so we're in very very dark days in closing might be
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:32.120]  five more minutes with us and i know you gotta go then trump's coming up i want to ask you we come

[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:46.040]  Ben dot video you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.840]  so we were first told that trump was going to be speaking at 12 30 central then it was going to be
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:11.320]  12 15 central and now the stream put it up on screen please guys there it is earlier was putting
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:18.280]  joe biden up so uh wow a lot of weirdness going on are they 25th amendmenting the president right
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:23.720]  now uh yeah that's not just a possibility that's a probability we are in an insane world we need to
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:28.680]  look more to governors now we need to look more to senators and ourselves what should they be saying
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:34.600]  and and do it because they keep acting but they're normalcy biased like we're in normal times mike
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:39.160]  adams well there are a number of things i'm really glad you asked that question in texas for example
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:45.240]  ag paxton has already said he's going to fight big tech censorship in a huge way but one of the
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:52.360]  things that texas could do is move to shut down amazon fulfillment centers in texas until amazon
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:57.800]  stops censoring citizens of texas via the deep platforming of parlor and yes these are these are
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:05.000]  big moves texas could also pass a new legislation or even via a governor executive order to say
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:10.920]  that any instance of censorship by big tech against the citizen of texas will result in a one million
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:17.080]  dollar fine against big tech and then texas could use that well it would very quickly be at least
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:24.360]  a trillion dollars in fines texas could to defy the rigged election texas could launch its own
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:30.520]  currency and remember texas has its own its own gold uh repository that it constructed a few years
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.760]  ago texas could launch its own currency so that people and this could happen in any other state
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:39.400]  i'm just using texas as an example so that the people could conduct e-commerce and transactions
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:45.160]  in an honest money system owned by the people rather than the fake fiat currency that biden will use
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:50.440]  to hand out more bribes and kickbacks to governors like quomo and nuesome and so on uh in addition
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:55.720]  texas can nullify a federal laws such as any laws restricting second amendment rights and
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:56:59.160]  remember that democrats have already set the example of the nullification through their
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:04.040]  sanctuary cities and sanctuary and by the way as you know my even foreign governments in the
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:09.400]  imf world bank say only texas could lead a successful breakaway because of its energy its
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:15.240]  oil its infrastructure and then a large constellation of states from arizona you know to the west
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:21.880]  through new mexico to colorado to uh oklahoma louisiana mississippi tennessee forward it would
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:26.360]  just be instant texas could reconstitute the republic well absolutely there's there's a
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:32.680]  mechanism for doing that texas could elect a new president of the new united states and bring together
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:37.560]  louisiana oklahoma kansas and other states that want to participate and then texas could order
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:42.120]  its citizens to stop paying federal income taxes to washington and by the way this was done before
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:47.000]  we can do it right now absolutely this has been done many times throughout history texas was its
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:51.960]  own republic uh its own nation at at one point and that may happen again so i believe there's
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:57.400]  going to be a lot of pressure on state governors to pursue these types of strategies against censorship
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:01.560]  against big tech and against the theory and that sounds crazy but we have a globalist takeover of
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.040]  our government and you and take over a police we have to start moving towards the new united
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:12.920]  states of america i totally agree uh yeah absolutely and and remember that the money printing that's
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:18.360]  going to happen in dc under biden if if biden indeed gets in it's going to just it's going to
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:25.160]  kill everybody's savings nationwide people had got you've got to get out of the dollar uh you know
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:29.560]  i totally agree they're getting ready to gut it did you see richard and haas the cf r brad
[1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:35.320]  that america's over no i didn't see that one but doesn't surprise me at this point so it but it's
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:41.320]  going to be states like like texas and and like you know idaho and and and wyoming and so on that
[1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:48.200]  are going to really lead i think the the new society out of the collapse of the old corrupt
[1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:53.800]  america swamp the the old empire that's just being looted in its final hour by democrats and and
[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:57.960]  maybe you're right you know maybe trump doesn't want to be at the helm when that happens trump
[1:58:57.960 --> 1:59:03.960]  would rather lead the new america out of darkness uh with with a whole new honest money system for
[1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:10.440]  example and new laws written for the people by the people rather than for the corrupt criminals
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:15.320]  that are in the senate and the gop and by the way i'm now part of the never gop movement
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:20.360]  i will not vote for any member of the gop ever again unless their name is trump so

[2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:16.680]  well it was put out by fox news this morning to speak at 1230 central and 1215 and now they're
[2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:21.160]  saying will they speak right side broadcasting has the same headline up we need to hear the president
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.600]  speak and not just let them set the agenda not just let them burn and tear down the country and
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:32.680]  kill everybody and then we had a million people in dc and a hundred or so led by anti foot going
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:38.760]  to capital most of them take selfies a few break things folks get killed and they call it the end
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:46.440]  of the world say arrest all of us now president trump possibly speak this afternoon so who knows
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:02:00.360]  what's going on i know this the media is spitting it that jones has confessed reported the london
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:07.960]  independent newsweek and washington post jones inadvertently on a hot mic admitted that he
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:15.400]  led the attack on the capital and that he paid for it what what a load of deceptive crap and they
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:22.360]  put up an edited 17 second clip of me i told you all 50 times that we were organizing a march on the
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:28.200]  six that trump wanted it then he announced weeks later he did want it and then groups had the
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:36.040]  permits but no one would pay the money so i put down the money seed money for both the fifth event
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:40.040]  and the sixth event with the secret service and the port of potties and the fence and the metal
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:45.080]  detectors that's expensive and i didn't have the extra money and then a great donor came through
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:52.280]  and paid for 80 percent of it or more that turns into i wanted to go have a rally like all the
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:57.640]  others we've had that were peaceful so then we wouldn't have a debate and so then everything
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:04.040]  would fall apart that's ridiculous but that's how the media operates and they're just all
[2:03:04.040 --> 2:03:09.320]  over the news arrest jones arrest jones arrest jones you know they're all for their demonstrations
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:13.400]  they're all for their rallies they're all for calling for violence like they've seen all the
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:21.720]  democrats do in fact you guys never gave me a yesterday's list you guys pretty please
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:28.680]  sugar on top with cupcakes maybe you did give me yesterday's list i've lost it you give me
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:32.840]  yesterday's list because i want to play that two and a half minute compilation of democrats calling
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:40.120]  for violence against trump hello c and all of them just give me yesterday's listed that'll be
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:46.920]  absolutely wonderful yeah there it is let's go ahead and roll this because this is what
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:53.080]  they would have you believe we did and and then i've got the videos i'll play them in a moment
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:04:01.640]  of the airlines looked at people that booked to fly into dc the day every day before and
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:07.560]  that flew out the next day and then randomly when you showed up they would say you're on
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:13.000]  a no fly list and not let you fly no judge no jury they were so proud of themselves
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:19.320]  and forms had called for them to do that the day of the event so that's how this fascism works as
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:25.080]  they get all these other enforcers on the ground to do it they weren't part of the hundred people
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:30.680]  that went in you know the lead anti forgot that led the attack they dropped the charges on him
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:38.200]  he was screaming burn this place down he was doing all of that but he's a good guy he got the charges
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:47.560]  dropped against him i never got to that clip of chunky schumer either so i guess when i said i
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:52.760]  wanted sunday's clip i want friday's list but i had yesterday's staple to this we can get friday's
[2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:57.640]  list that'll be good too but since i mentioned it here's uh here's that clip of the real folks
[2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:02.760]  calling for insurrection i i i just don't even know why there aren't uprisings of all of the
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:08.440]  country and maybe there will be people need to start taking to the streets this is a dictator
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:13.160]  you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives enemies
[2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:19.400]  of the state show me where it says that protest is supposed to be polite and peaceful do something
[2:05:19.400 --> 2:05:25.080]  about your dad's immigration practices you feckless they go low we kick how do you resist the
[2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:31.800]  temptation to run up and bring her neck biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:35.800]  them radicalized right up to the right i thought he should have punched him in the face is even
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.520]  if you lost he insulted your wife yes later and called mexicans rapists and murders he said well
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.920]  what do you think i should have done so i think you should punch him in the face and then gotten
[2:05:42.920 --> 2:05:47.160]  out of the race you would have been a hero i'd like to punch him in the face i said if we're in
[2:05:47.160 --> 2:05:52.440]  high school i'd take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of him punch some people in the face
[2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:57.240]  women's the last time an actor assassinated a president they're still gonna have to go out and
[2:05:57.240 --> 2:06:04.840]  put a bullet in donald trump and that's the fact look as his character is stabbed to death
[2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:15.960]  where is john wilkes booth when you need him i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:22.360]  white house a missouri state senator is under investigation by the secret service after saying
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:28.680]  she hopes president trump is assassinating i will go and take trump out tonight and if you see
[2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:36.760]  anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store in a gasoline station
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:44.280]  you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome
[2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:51.720]  are you anymore anywhere and sadly the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:58.200]  our constitution are right at 1600 pennsylvania avenue they're not going to stop before election
[2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:02.680]  day in november and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:07.320]  should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not going to let up and they should
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:15.560]  not if you take real value now you ain't saying nothing yet and there's antivid just randomly
[2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:23.160]  shooting white people because they're white video after video and so their rhetoric is about five
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:30.440]  times stronger than trumps way stronger than mine and i don't want violence i have ideas that defeat
[2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:35.320]  them that's why they're calling for violence because we rejected them and trump won in a giant
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:39.880]  landslide everybody knows it but because the fbi is controlled because the justice department's
[2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:44.520]  controlled the globalists have been winning and getting away with crime so now they're upping the
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:50.280]  crime and now they're coming for your guns they're coming for your children because they're evil and
[2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:55.560]  they have a desire to have power over you and so we're right back where our forebears were
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:08:00.200]  with a great tyranny bearing down on us here's another compilation some of the same clips some
[2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:07.560]  other clips of the same people declaring war on america i want to tell you gore such i want to
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:19.160]  tell you cavernor you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price you won't know what
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:32.200]  hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions if the president does go ahead and fire robert
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:37.400]  moeller we would have people take to the streets i believe there will be widespread civil unrest
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:42.360]  because americans understand that the rule of law is paramount and you think there would be civil
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  unrest widespread civil unrest i do i think you're gonna have protests and marches and rallies and
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:56.440]  sit-ins you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:04.600]  care about michelle which says that you know when they go low we go up no no they go low we kick
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:15.960]  please don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today get up and please get up
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  in the face of some congresspeople it's a danger if don't wake up angry watch his fucking friends
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:32.280]  and fires bob moeller well i hope he doesn't do that he would set off firestorm i think it would be
[2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:44.920]  uh you know not only on the hill but uh in the streets
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:10.440]  anyway that's why i believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the senate
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:16.280]  that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the republicans seem to
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:20.040]  recognize and respect is strength
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:29.000]  what a group of sick freaks that's not even the democrats calling for trump's death so
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:35.080]  so that's what these monsters have done a handful of anti-fun a handful of q people that had zip
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:39.960]  ties that were in our rest fancy and saved the world for trump all you did was blow trumps legs
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:44.040]  off but it doesn't matter you'll go back to your h n and be on a weird power trip
[2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:52.360]  the post-industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush signed on to at the
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:11:02.040]  Rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:06.680]  industrial world plow schwa with the debauchery to the prime minister of piano they're all on
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:14.680]  record saying the great reset is agenda 2030 well you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:20.600]  it is the destruction of society as we know it it is making the population poor by designs we
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:27.000]  can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family they're destroying
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:34.120]  civilization rebuild it and they're dystopic image we are fighting this at info wars dot com

[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:44.680]  to research and share with others and join the fight god bless you visit us spread the word
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:51.560]  at info wars dot com mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:55.320]  just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:12:01.160]  i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:06.280]  i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:14.600]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ion of four similar to
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:20.680]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:28.120]  at that if all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:32.280]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:36.040]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it was really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:41.000]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.720]  thanks for the plug
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:55.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:38.920]  and what richard and haas had the cfr just said a few days ago they said we want to end america
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:45.640]  as an idea we want our globalist system we want the chinese system we want dictatorship so they
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:50.760]  tell you they're liberal they're good and oh alex has hurt people's feelings it needs to be banned
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:56.040]  all the idiots rolling over to tyranny think they're part of the power you're not you're called
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:01.400]  useful idiots in the words of vi lennon so here's what jesson turdo had to say
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:13.240]  there's a level of admiration i actually have for china because their basic dictatorship
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:19.560]  is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a diet let's hear that one more time
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:25.960]  there's a level of admiration i actually have for china
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:35.720]  because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a diet
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:40.920]  and again he's asked by a woman in the tan question what is your favorite politician what's
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:49.560]  your favorite government oh it's communist china so people keep thinking about themselves and about
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:54.120]  how they're doing and how their life is i was talking to a individual this morning who's successful
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:57.960]  in life at business and i was telling him i said the mask are never coming off they're gonna implode
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:04.600]  the economy they're gonna solidate control he looked at me and he said i'm part of the power
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:12.360]  structure so i'll just get richer he goes i've given up on humanity i'm older now and i'm just
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:18.040]  gonna worry about myself and my family and i said but as things implode it'll affect your family
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:20.040]  and he said i'll be dead by then
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:31.160]  you know they say folks as they get older get more virtuous or they get less virtuous and a lot of
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:36.840]  people get really selfish and stayed in their ways it's very very sad
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:44.840]  but everybody that thinks they're gonna get ahead going along with this evil is wrong
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:52.280]  i want to open the phones up i want to take your calls specifically with nine days left what do
[2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:55.960]  you make of the capital attack if you were a witness there in fact i want to do this i
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:01.480]  want to open the phone specifically so i know it's our audience that was there so don't start calling
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:08.520]  yet for those that were at the capital or at the dc march and what you witnessed and what you thought
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:13.080]  and what you think president trump should do with nine days out and what you think of the response
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:18.520]  calling 99.99 of you bad because a hundred people went in there and broke some stuff and got shot
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:23.800]  and killed and the media said it's the new pearl harbor we're victims of a pearl harbor attack
[2:16:23.800 --> 2:16:30.120]  i mean that's so ridiculous so if you were there i want to hear from you eight seven seven seven
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:34.840]  eight nine two five three nine no other callers folks or will never get these calls in because
[2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:38.280]  thousands calling of the number out i want to hear from those that were at the capital please
[2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:43.160]  for them they were there i want to hear from them eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven
[2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:51.560]  seven seven eight nine two five three nine and did you have trouble flying home what did you
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:56.040]  witness what did you want to talk about eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:01.880]  at all the videos of trump supporters trying to stop anti-fun these other weird paramilitary groups
[2:17:03.880 --> 2:17:08.040]  and now we know the guys have been arrested they were air force and army veterans
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:12.040]  from all over the country that thought they were there under trump's orders
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:17.240]  with military intelligence to take out pelosian seized the capital
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:22.920]  and that trump would come be there with them and then of course it didn't happen
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:35.000]  so cuba trades you cuba trades you we're gonna go to break in four minutes and come back with
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:40.040]  this john bound report that's very important and then go to your phone calls but i keep harping
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:44.520]  on the q thing because i've got i've got the h.m. printouts i've got all the stuff right here
[2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:50.760]  here they were on there provocateurs oh we're going you know the breadcrumbs we're gonna overthrow
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:57.160]  it this is the storming of the swamp this is the storm and and and and it's gonna happen and it's all
[2:17:57.160 --> 2:18:02.600]  over and then trump had a rally i had a rally to show that we're against election fraud to be
[2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:08.520]  peaceful trump said it i said it don jr said it and before we could ever get there you guys
[2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:16.680]  fallen anti for the interactive like idiots now we're losing the whole country
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:22.840]  i mean you guys fetishize i've literally been at rallies and they always have this weird look like
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:27.480]  this like like they're in a like out of trance they walk over all it's always like a guy wearing
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:34.760]  a q shirt he goes alex i used to like you but now i'm with q i know you're bad i'm just and i'll
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:41.800]  always go army intelligence i'm with the intelligence you're like well really that's funny because
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:47.160]  the highest levels of army intelligence call up and ask me what's coming next and so does the fbi
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:54.200]  those that are good and you think there's like some magic mountain up there the president calls us
[2:18:54.200 --> 2:18:59.640]  to see what we think it's not a power trip you're like acting like there's some magic level up there
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:06.520]  yes this is it right here and i'm not trying to brag it so you figure that out i know more about
[2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:12.120]  this than anybody basically except for people on the other side a few of their top field marshals
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:22.040]  and i live this i know how it works i understand it and i still got set up because i underestimated
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:30.840]  it how dumb some of these people are and how foolish it is but thank god you they couldn't
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:36.200]  get more of you to invade and more of you to attack but i tell you i've seen it all now man
[2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:43.480]  oh jones you're just a coward you don't want a war it's time for a war the globalist one of
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:49.160]  physical altercation because they lost the election we're trying to prove that and then stop them
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:54.840]  trump didn't want it trump was coming to speak at the capital we had a stage
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:03.960]  but before the crowds ever got there a hundred antifa were attacking cops
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:11.800]  at 10 a.m in the morning and they were allowed to do it and the police were ordered to stand down
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:19.640]  and the guy that reportedly gave the order has committed suicide did you believe that
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:24.360]  and so here's the cops up in the doors and taking selfies with people
[2:20:26.760 --> 2:20:32.360]  and the vast majority were peaceful but the media cherry picks it and uses the killing of that woman
[2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:39.080]  and a stroke and two heart attacks four dead citizens a dead cop and cops got smashed and
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:43.160]  trampled it was terrible and the pork cop probably did have a heart attack because of this
[2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:50.040]  but he died two days later so a cop died the left doesn't usually care when cops die i care
[2:20:51.320 --> 2:20:56.200]  it's embarrassing it's like you throw a party for you know your daughter's wedding and 400 people
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:04.440]  show up 200 crash it and a fight breaks out you're not glad at a party 200 people extra showed up
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:10.280]  and a fight broke out maybe somebody gets stabbed that's not your fault that's because a big party
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:15.800]  happened and things got out of hand and the left was there starting fights on purpose and that's
[2:21:15.800 --> 2:21:21.080]  about all they can do is screw stuff up like the blue cities like the blue states like america
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:26.200]  they did another great job at that and now the very left that loves violence it says kill everybody
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:31.880]  and blah blah like arrest dallas jones like why isn't jones arrested he called for storming the
[2:21:31.880 --> 2:21:38.360]  capital because i didn't you big fat lying scum your people did it and let a bunch of cute tards

[2:24:20.040 --> 2:24:28.600]  is TheResistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:34.760]  them. So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:39.880]  all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that TheResistance.video.

[2:24:43.720 --> 2:25:11.320]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:23.880]  Now I'm going to your phone calls. Rebecca, Josh, California refugee, Dylan, Dominic, Tom,
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:30.360]  Bob and others and I'll be hosting right into the fourth hour. The great Gerald Slunty does a great
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:34.600]  job but I'm going to be hosting an hour so we can take your calls and see if Trump gives this
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:39.960]  speech he keeps backing up. I'm also going to show you a clip of a newscast a few months ago
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:44.840]  when I did a march in Georgia and we marched into the Capitol peacefully with a state rep
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:50.520]  and did a great job. We're very respectful. That's how I storm a Capitol.
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:59.560]  We're not shooting any cops like the Democrats. We're not shooting citizens like the Capitol
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.040]  security for Chuck E. Schumer though we're standing up for what's right and telling the truth.
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:09.880]  But again, you heard Mike Adams last hour saying this will be one of the last times we ever talk.
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:13.960]  Folks, it's that serious. This is a takeover. We've studied where they're going.
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:19.000]  They're censoring the president. They're saying they want to expel senators and house members
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:24.680]  and have votes to kick them out and overturn their elections. The globalists are going for
[2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:29.480]  broke. They have the media. They have the FBI. They're not stopping. So I'll tell you get your

[2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:19.560]  are products that fund the second American peaceful information warfare revolution worldwide.
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:30.040]  The globalists stole the election by fraud. And they now want to start a fight. But like
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:34.840]  Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi or who they were imitating, Jesus of Nazareth,
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:40.200]  we need to be nonviolent at this point because that's what exposes them as the thugs they are.
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:43.640]  Not give them the images that they got at a very limited level at the Capitol.
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:46.760]  They intended to get citizens from all over to militarily storm it.
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:51.800]  And quote, citizens arrest the Democrats that will be in a hostage situation
[2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:57.400]  that would have allowed them to 25th Amendment, the president and or impeach him and bring in
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:06.120]  total tyranny. Thank God, the Patriots fought and battled with the Antifa and the Q people that
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:10.440]  were totally under mind control. Not all Q people are bad. A lot of folks get into it because it's
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:17.160]  fine like an Easter egg hunt or whatever a treasure hunt. But a lot of folks don't get the larger
[2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:22.120]  picture of how they're using augmented reality online to manipulate you in the real world.
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:25.880]  Now it's a globalist operation. Remember, Trump was invincible, couldn't be beat.
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:31.720]  Jeff Sessions was great. Hillary was in Gitmo. Bill Barr was great. None of it was true,
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:36.360]  folks, but they know you want good news. I could make stuff up and have it super viral all day.
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:40.440]  That was something about David Knight. And I really liked David. He could do whatever he
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:45.400]  wanted. He asked me to hire his second son, basically to run a website for them just to
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:52.920]  promote his stuff alone. And he didn't like the Q stuff. And we'd have a few guests on here and
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:56.920]  there that would kind of promote that. And then he would say, Jones is having these people on.
[2:29:56.920 --> 2:30:01.320]  And I'm like, I don't agree with what those people are saying.
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:06.520]  And then he's like, well, I'm going to quit. I mean, I can't be around this. I'm going to get
[2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:12.680]  fired. I'm being censored. And that's what hurts is I never censored him. He took what I would say
[2:30:12.680 --> 2:30:17.320]  on air if I disagree with him as censorship. And it was so weird. I've even seen some of the shows
[2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:20.680]  where he goes, censorship was bad over there. I knew I'd be let go soon.
[2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:26.440]  And the name of Jesus Christ and all my children ever censored David Knight,
[2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:31.000]  he's a liar. He made that up on air. And I see him like a devil on his show now,
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:36.840]  just all envious, hateful, deviling up there. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke you, David Knight,
[2:30:36.840 --> 2:30:41.480]  you're a liar. I never censored you and I'm not with you. And you know that. And that's why I
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:47.480]  let him go because he hated me and he hated info wars. And he told me in his studio that he didn't
[2:30:47.480 --> 2:30:53.400]  want me on his show and he was ashamed of us. Well, good, go away from us. But you and your son
[2:30:53.400 --> 2:31:02.280]  stop lying about us or I'll tell everybody about him. Disgusting. And I'm going to let everybody
[2:31:02.280 --> 2:31:07.640]  know down at the end here, I'm going to be totally tripled everybody. No more BS, no more games.
[2:31:12.520 --> 2:31:16.440]  They wouldn't upload the videos for his show and he'd blame my crew for it when it was his crew,
[2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:20.840]  stuff like that. I barely watched him, man. People send me clips. He's like up there going,
[2:31:20.840 --> 2:31:26.760]  those censorship was so bad at info wars. I knew I'd be fired. That's why I let him go
[2:31:26.760 --> 2:31:33.480]  because the man was a walking pill, a baby, roasting in his own elitism.
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:40.440]  Got a lot more, David, if you want, say one more thing and lie about me and I'm going to tell
[2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:45.480]  him everything. You go ahead and do it, you coward. Because the good part about being down to the
[2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:55.800]  other line here is I'm taking the gloves off. Anyway, side issue. No one talk about that anymore.
[2:31:56.600 --> 2:32:03.160]  I'm pretty wound up today. As I said, I never supported the Q stuff, but I underestimated
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:07.880]  how evil it was and how out of control it was. You know, I've got at least five members of my
[2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:13.000]  crew that are great people whose mothers and fathers are obsessed with it, who are engineers
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:20.360]  and who are scientists that who believe all of it and who are literally obsessed with it.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:31.880]  And it's unbelievable. Absolutely incredible. Absolutely amazing. Absolutely crazy.
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:37.160]  So another day at night thing, it's just, it's just, it's crazy how you hold somebody
[2:32:37.160 --> 2:32:41.240]  to your bosom. You're so nice to them. And then I hired his other son six months ago
[2:32:41.240 --> 2:32:45.240]  when I'm censoring him so he could have his own website. And then they bitched at my crew
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:48.840]  when they had, he had David and I had his own website we built and paid for. And then his
[2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:53.000]  sons didn't know how to run it. And so he was on air saying we had the codes to his site and
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:58.920]  we're sabotaging him when it was his website and he had the codes I paid for when I gave him money.
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:02.200]  He hated me when I paid for everything. He hated me.
[2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:12.840]  He sits there like a big fat baby lying. One more lie out of you and I hope you do it.
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:17.800]  It's not like your lies hurt me. Nobody's even watching your ass. Too bad. I wish people were.
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:22.760]  I wish all these other people, Millie Weaver wouldn't promote us. I let her go. Caitlyn Bennett
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:26.680]  wouldn't do anything. So they just took our money and then all your censoring Millie,
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:33.000]  all your censoring Caitlyn BS. They were ashamed of us. They didn't want to get the platform.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:40.440]  That's why they're gone. They all are BS. Watson will probably be completely gone from us now
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:44.680]  because everybody's cutting and running because they're scared because I haven't backed off on
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:50.680]  defending America. They're all cutting and running because they're scared. Well, guess what? I'm not
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:57.880]  scared and I'm going to be truthful until the end and I'm not going to back down. And that's how
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:06.920]  this works. Took someone off air because I make money off Trump and because I don't want Trump
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:12.520]  criticized. I criticize Trump constantly. All I've been persecuted for Trump will probably be off
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:17.800]  the air soon for Trump. But the very people saying it have still got all their Twitter channels
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:24.200]  so they can sit up there like little toads and lie about us. It's up to God how people are judged,
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:30.520]  but I tell you, gloves are off for all you wimps playing man, playing big daddy. Let's play big
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:39.880]  daddy. Let's talk about the love of Hitler that you hope I don't talk about. We'll be right back.
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:47.960]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:53.960]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:59.800]  fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and give
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:05.400]  him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on the Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:12.840]  world about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:19.160]  thanks to this info or store products. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night. So
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:24.680]  I'm doing what I can, brother. So what my my contention is, why don't we start this new year
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:30.440]  off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now you got to follow that up
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:36.440]  with the Microsoft. Yeah, I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know. We
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:41.080]  didn't screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:45.480]  about living defense, living defense, living defense. Webster's dictionary has a very simple
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:52.040]  definition of terrorism. Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:58.920]  or action carrying on force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the
[2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:04.200]  hell out of people until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19
[2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:09.880]  garbage is. You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:16.200]  COVID-19 they could never imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:22.440]  just eight months ago within three months. Okay, it's a quarter million. If you count all of the
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:27.560]  people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real numbers. These
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:32.440]  are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out,
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:36.520]  and are taught we're not essential. Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:42.520]  Rebuke it, stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:51.240]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling product simplors
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:56.200]  are no longer available. And I thought the pollen block might be gone forever. But after eight months,
[2:36:56.200 --> 2:37:02.120]  we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest, they hope in a few months comes

[2:38:50.840 --> 2:39:10.520]  The gloves are off. Here in the final countdown to construction of Republic,
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.080]  the good news is all the cowards and all the fakes are going to get exposed now as they run for the
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:26.440]  scourge of the new world order. Not me, not this audience of activists. We're full steam ahead
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.560]  against the UN, against the Chai comms, against the globalists, against the AI takeover,
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:38.680]  and we'll never surrender. I didn't mean to go on that rant earlier. I was thinking how much
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:43.720]  the Q stuff's driven me up the wall and how much it pisses me off and how then I got accused of
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:48.920]  supposedly supporting that stuff because it leaks into my show. I saw an article this weekend about
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:53.080]  whatever that general's name, it's not Flynn, it's the other one, said he was at the White House,
[2:39:53.800 --> 2:40:00.360]  didn't see Trump there, and he's like, oh, military intelligence, use the capital event to get Pelosi's
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:05.880]  laptop, and they're like, oh, military intelligence is going to save us and all this stuff, and how
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:12.840]  much that angers me, and then being accused of being part of that because I've got an organization
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:18.120]  and what my other shows do, and then to be accused of censoring people when people are pissed at me
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:24.600]  for what's on my show or what comes out. Again, that's hypocritical, that's BS, but society issue,
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:29.160]  and my rage is not for David when I was getting mad. It's for the whole situation.
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:35.640]  It's for everything, and it's watching this country die minute by minute, watching all
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:42.200]  this unfold. I'm hosting the fourth hour. I just want to say this, I went there to have a rally
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:47.560]  against election fraud. I went there to have a rally for a president the globalist hated,
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:52.680]  didn't mean he was perfect. I went there because it was hard, it wasn't easy. I went there because
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:57.320]  the enemy didn't want it. I went there because they deplatformed me if I did. I went there because
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:03.560]  the fight was there, and to quote John Paul Jones who said, I've only begun to fight, he also said,
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:10.280]  I will only be on fast ships because I intend to go into danger. And there's a Teddy Roosevelt quote,
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:17.640]  the man in the arena, citizenship in a republic. You know, they were asking about this film,
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:20.920]  they're making about me, this film group. They said, what's the name of this film? What should
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:24.520]  it be? I think it should be the man in the arena. That's what I want the film to be called. It is
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:29.880]  not the critic who counts, not the man who points out of the strongman stumbles, or where the doer
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:35.560]  of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena,
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:41.320]  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:46.920]  again, then again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:51.400]  strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:56.840]  himself on a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who,
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:02.600]  at worst, if he fails, at least fails, all during greatly, so that his place shall never be with
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:09.960]  those cold and timid souls who neither nor victory nor defeat. Read it again. And who at worst, if
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:15.480]  he fails, at least fails, all during greatly, so this place shall never be with those cold and
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:24.200]  timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. And that says it all, and I want the patriots
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:30.840]  together. I want us to win. I want us to defeat the globalist and build a society based on God
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:36.680]  and family and justice and real competition that builds up the species, not destroys it. And I know
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:40.920]  we can do it together. I told you I played that John Bowne report that I went off into a ramp.
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:43.640]  We have the whole next hour coming up. I'm going to go to your phone calls instead right now.
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:50.120]  And I said this politely and graciously as I go before I blew up, getting mad about the
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:57.400]  cute stuff. It just drives me crazy. I have arguments with family. I have arguments with so
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:43:03.960]  many people where they believed all that delusional crap and it really defeated us. And then now I
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:08.600]  see how it's a robot army they control through H.N. who will do violence and now they're planning
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:17.720]  to attack a bunch of the capitals during the 20th, which denies us the capability to actually
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:22.280]  protest peacefully because they're going to have cue cards out there with their zip ties and their
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:27.320]  guns believing they're about to overthrow the globalist. And they're being secretly commanded
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:34.280]  by some magic group that is the globalist. Q thinks it's good, but it's commanded by the enemy for
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:41.880]  sure. And it's roped in so many people that are now delusional.
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:53.800]  All I want, man. You know, I really figured things out in the last couple of days.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:58.760]  I kind of went next level. And I already knew all of this, but now I'm totally in the dialectic.
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.160]  I get the whole Machiavellian plan even better. And now I'm sure they're operating according to it.
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:09.960]  And God is it diabolical? Absolutely diabolical.
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:23.720]  Oh, man. And people take kindness for weakness.
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:29.320]  And I just can't believe it. I've always been so loyal. I'm such a loyal person.
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:33.080]  The people that treat me good, I treat them good. And I've just experienced so many people
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:36.520]  that don't treat me like that. But I finally, the years are working hard to found a crew that
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:41.160]  treats me loyally. I treat them loyally as I can. I appreciate them. But I've gotten to a point at
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:47.240]  47 years old that I can't take this loyalty anymore. And rat bastardness. You know, I was watching
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:50.680]  There Will Be Blood again a few nights ago with my wife.
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:59.640]  And it's a great movie. It's very well done. But there's a lot of men like that where he says,
[2:44:59.640 --> 2:45:05.080]  you know, I have a competitive competitiveness in me. I don't like to see others do well.
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:12.920]  So I hate everyone. Well, I love to see people do well. I love to see progress
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:20.520]  as long as it isn't at my expense. I love it. I see someone else's success as building us all up.
[2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:24.600]  But see, a lot of people in the establishment don't, and they want a monopoly of power.
[2:45:24.600 --> 2:45:29.400]  But a lot of the general public doesn't like success either. And they think it brings them down.
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:35.800]  I talk about that story this morning, talking to a prominent person here in town,
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:39.240]  where they looked at me and they said, I've given up on humanity. I don't care anymore. I only care
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:46.040]  about myself. And the reason that person made me so mad is that even as I embrace humanity more
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:52.360]  than I've ever embraced humanity, and I get closer to God than ever, as my godly side gets bigger,
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:57.560]  the satanic side, by understanding it's bigger because I'm fallen and have a knowledge of good
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:04.440]  and evil. It doesn't dissipate. It becomes further away. But I have a greater knowledge of it
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:11.000]  than I ever had. And it makes it that much more disgusting. And I see in people the bad traits
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:16.440]  of myself, but I see them manifest and I see them flourishing in them. And it makes me hate them
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:24.200]  because I hate my own sinful nature. But I have an understanding of it past their understanding,
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:28.920]  way past them. And so it makes me frustrated that I can't get through to them. They won't listen to
[2:46:28.920 --> 2:46:36.760]  me. I mean, I know how the whole thing works, man. You do too. You see it. But we can't get the
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:41.240]  general public to see it. They think we're crazy because we read government documents and we know
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:45.880]  what's going on. And then I thought I'd wake people up and show them the New World Order. And then
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:51.480]  they'd say no to it when it started really going operational. But instead, the dumb idiots that
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:57.720]  followed the government before, when I woke them up, I only woke them up to a cosmology of reality,
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:03.560]  but a twisted fallen nature of it so they could still be controlled and manipulated.
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:12.840]  And then it was like a classism with the Q people where they believe they've got the elite
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:18.360]  information and they territorialize it. Instead of trying to understand that it's transcendent,
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:25.640]  it becomes this power trip that they're dialed in to some mythical elitism.
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:32.920]  As if the understanding of larger things and conspiracies isn't an innate awakening of an
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:38.600]  individual, they believed it was them being given entree and entrance into the inner
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:49.320]  sanctums of the cult. They believed they were fighting the cult, but really they were being led into the cult.
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:58.440]  But not into the cult to fight the cult, into the cult from within to sabotage the new renaissance,
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:03.640]  to sabotage the new Atlantis, to sabotage the next level of human development.
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:14.120]  And I thought, I thought when I'd say Q is okay, if you want to have fun with that,
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:18.120]  but just when someone tells you go do something violent online, you're part of a storm or a
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:23.480]  violent uprising, that's probably a fed setting you up. Don't do that. And sure as hell, it was
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:29.480]  the Q people under Antifa's control who went in there like a group of morons. Antifa breaches it,
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:35.320]  they start it. The Q people thought there's the special forces right on time. They told us to
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:41.160]  invade at this time. They would attack first and they thought Antifa was special forces for Trump
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:46.680]  breaking into the capital. So they then flooded behind waving in the masses, but luckily by the
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:51.720]  blessing of God, 99% of the hundreds of thousands did not go in with them.
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:58.440]  But I saw that and it made me sick. We got a million people there. It was beautiful, very
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:02.520]  race, color and creed. We were exposing election fraud. Trump was coming to speak at the Capitol
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:07.400]  and here are these people taking dumps in the punch bowl, believing they were doing what Trump
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:15.160]  wanted when now you've crippled Trump. And you'll go out on the 20th and attack the governor's
[2:49:15.160 --> 2:49:21.880]  mansions and hurt us even worse because you're mentally ill. You're not a leader and you're
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:28.360]  dialed into the globalist because you want to believe you're a secret agent. God. All right,
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:35.480]  I'll take your calls when we come back. The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased,
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:39.160]  but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:44.200]  turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:48.600]  my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:52.520]  force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life,
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:58.440]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:03.160]  the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:07.480]  up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:11.160]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[2:50:11.160 --> 2:50:14.440]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:18.120]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:22.040]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:25.000]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.760]  go to info wars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:32.680]  into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad. The turbo
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:43.000]  force is good. The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:52.040]  all the lies are being revealed, what will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:59.720]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the patriots of the world
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:07.960]  versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:14.760]  the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That I will bear true faith and
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:22.040]  allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:29.000]  of evasion. And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:40.280]  me God. info wars.com, band.video. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:51.560]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album, Silver Stallion.
[2:51:51.560 --> 2:51:59.240]  Well, now, right side broadcasting is reporting that Trump is going to be reporting that a
[2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:07.640]  speech tomorrow at 2 from Alamo, Texas on the border, probably about his successes. And I knew
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:13.160]  behind the scenes that Governor Huckabee, because I've talked to a lawyer that was on the call,
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:17.960]  said, sir, you got to talk about your successes and not about the negatives and not about the
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:23.080]  capital. You can't just shut up your last days in office. So looks like what he was advised to do
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:27.480]  is going to happen. I talked about this a few days ago. He'll do a trip around the country
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:32.040]  talking about his successes. He'll probably go to like Michigan and Ohio and talk about jobs he
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:37.960]  brought back. He'll probably go do some nano tech talks or talk about how he got prescription drugs
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:42.200]  lower. And that's better than just sitting there quiet and letting the Democrats control things.
[2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:47.080]  So that's good news. But that's another day we lose. We need him to be giving speeches every
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:56.840]  day, every day, every day. So should we even send it send a crew down there? Send Ellen send myself?
[2:52:58.040 --> 2:53:00.760]  How long does it take to get to McAllen? Five hours, four hours?
[2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:10.600]  Six and a half? Pull Alamo, Texas up for folks. I guess I probably didn't need to go down there.
[2:53:11.960 --> 2:53:16.600]  I mean, this is history happening, ladies and gentlemen. Absolutely history happening right
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:24.040]  now. I guess we can do it next segment. That's what I was saying. I wanted to pull it up during
[2:53:24.040 --> 2:53:35.800]  before the break. Here I can do it on my phone. There it is. Type in Alamo, Texas.
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:45.160]  And that is not the Alamo at the downtown San Antonio. That is by McAllen, a little
[2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:51.240]  incorporated area. And what is there in Alamo? Why are you going to worry? He's going to be
[2:53:51.240 --> 2:53:56.680]  speaking out there. But we'll look into that and make sure right side broadcasting is right.
[2:53:57.640 --> 2:54:02.200]  You know their name is right. Unintended. All right. I'm not going to waste your time in this
[2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:06.840]  segment taking your calls. I'm going to go to Rebecca, Dave, Josh, California refugee, Robin,
[2:54:06.840 --> 2:54:12.280]  Dominique, Tom, Bob, Carrie, and others. On the other side, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:18.760]  And there's so much more to get to, obviously, here before Owen Schreuer takes over with the
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:25.720]  old war room. I tell you, every day in full wars is on air. It's a blessing. They're shutting
[2:54:25.720 --> 2:54:30.520]  everybody down. There was just noise that Trump was going to go to parlor and they shut that
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:35.240]  sucker down and took it servers away and took all of it. Just everything away, just like that.
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:41.400]  Banned on every platform or the now 50 groups all piled in. I mean, I bet the
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:46.360]  CEO of parlor came and we got a cup of coffee. He's got money. And that's the global social
[2:54:46.360 --> 2:54:51.560]  credit score. It's not coming. We're inside of it. And so info wars fought like the devil.
[2:54:52.760 --> 2:54:56.360]  Build your own infrastructure and put money in the bank a little bit to keep operating. But man,
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:55:02.600]  I got to tell you, I need you to go to info wars store.com and get supplements and books and
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:07.800]  films and t shirts and air filtration or water filtration. You already need and stock up on it
[2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:13.000]  because I don't want to be making predictions here. But you have a wood desk over here. I can't
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:17.320]  knock on wood anymore. I got a little marble desk, but I mean, it just really is. Yeah,
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:21.320]  knock on my head. That's wood. It really is important for you to put money into our bank
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:27.160]  accounts before they even take our power to take your money away. Because that's the big push
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:29.960]  by the Democrats all over the news right now. As you know, they've already taken the president's
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:37.880]  banking away as credit card operations away as email away. And now the sites that host our URLs
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:42.040]  that do our server work that do what they're trying to take them away right now, too. And so
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:45.960]  it's kind of like there's a wall and the enemies burning through it after us. And people are like,
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:49.320]  God, Jones, aren't you scared? Aren't you? Aren't you upset? No, I'm worried about everybody,
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:54.040]  actually. And then I'm just pissed that I didn't fight hard enough. I didn't do enough to turn
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:58.680]  this back. And there's so many people I tried to build up and work with pissed all over me.
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:04.920]  And we're big babies. And, you know, didn't even appreciate me. And, you know,
[2:56:07.080 --> 2:56:12.040]  I'll be talking about some of those people on air because I'm not an in fighter. But in case I'm
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:16.040]  never on air again, soon I want to go ahead and just get out the truth about everybody.
[2:56:16.040 --> 2:56:19.560]  Not in the mean way, but just so that when I'm in damn FEMA camp,
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:22.760]  they're not out there on TV lying about me. I want you to know the truth what I did.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:26.440]  I've always been a straight shooter to you and your family. I'm as real as it gets.
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:29.320]  And they all know what the enemy knows it. And I, by the way, I'm fearless.
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:35.080]  Except for failure. I fear failure. And I'm so pissed at myself. When I take these calls,
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:39.240]  don't you think me? I walked us right into a trap in DC because I'm the man in the arena.
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:40.760]  And I couldn't help it being in that arena.
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:48.040]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because activated charcoal
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:52.360]  is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there. The problem is a lot of
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:57.240]  the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring very, very toxic. And also,
[2:56:57.240 --> 2:57:01.160]  they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't have the additives.
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:05.960]  This is a concentrated really is high quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:11.880]  chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage. But now it's back in stock info wars,

[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:40.840]  like pollen block. So check that out when you're in the store.
[2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:52.040]  All right, a new giant purge is happening in conservatives, nationals, libertarians and
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:56.200]  patriots. We'll tell you about it coming up bottom of the hour. And I'm Alex Jones, your
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:01.880]  host. Thank you for joining us on this live January 11 Monday transmission. Let's go ahead and take
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:08.920]  calls. California Refugee. Thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, happy to be here. Can you hear me?
[2:58:08.920 --> 2:58:18.200]  Yeah, I can hear you. So I had some realization during that March. The one thing is that there
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:25.480]  needs to be a max max exodus from Facebook, Twitter, even YouTube, all social websites,
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:29.640]  but not for the reason that you're necessarily thinking of. Of course, we want to destroy
[2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:37.080]  these companies. But mainly, we have to slow down the information war. Because right now,
[2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:43.640]  with all that data being sent, individuals can't keep track. They can because they have algorithms.
[2:58:44.920 --> 2:58:48.440]  That's the singularity coming. You're not going to be able to slow it down. You just got to go
[2:58:48.440 --> 2:58:54.120]  to trusted sources. But I mean, I hear what you're saying. I don't want to destroy those
[2:58:54.120 --> 2:58:58.280]  companies for no reason. I want to have independent groups that have the truth,
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:03.960]  but they're battling to shut down parlor and info wars and banned out video right now.
[2:59:03.960 --> 2:59:06.680]  Understand they're battling so we don't even have an alternative.
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:11.640]  Well, you do have an alternative. It's called magazines. You need to start a magazine to where
[2:59:11.640 --> 2:59:17.000]  we can leave it at this office Walmart, call it lifestyle of the free. And you know, I try the
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:22.920]  magazine, sir. Lots of the free sounds great. Do you understand that it had one one millionth
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:28.280]  the response of a digital format? Yeah, but the digital format is not doing anything either.
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:34.360]  Look what it done. The country's still going. I appreciate your call, sir. It's not that digital
[2:59:34.360 --> 2:59:40.680]  transmission is a bad way to communicate. It's that we allow monopolies, oligopolies cartels
[2:59:41.400 --> 2:59:49.240]  to take shape. But I agree. Locally printed magazines are the best mode. It's national
[2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:54.280]  distribution. That's a problem. And we need local control and you should do that. Yes, sir. I agree
[2:59:54.280 --> 3:00:01.000]  with you. Dominique in New Jersey. Go ahead. Alex first off, but just want to say God bless
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:08.200]  you. That's number one. Thank you for trying the best I can. Go ahead. Yeah, I know you're calling
[3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:14.120]  people like us who had our first 10 observations on what happened. And I am proud to be one of the
[3:00:14.120 --> 3:00:19.960]  99% of the people that did not go into that Capitol building that day. But I am also proud
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:25.160]  that I was there to have my voice held heard. Oh, let me just say that this was a beautiful event.
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:31.720]  99% citizens came together and a few idiots with the media focusing on that with a magnifying glass
[3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:37.160]  ruin the whole thing. Absolutely. And I just want to make some other observations. I was
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:41.640]  anywhere that I go. I'm always prepared to go. So with that being said, when we were at Trump's
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:47.480]  speech, I actually rented two electric bicycles so I could get all the way up to that Capitol
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:50.520]  building that day because I wanted a firsthand view because that's why we were there and I
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:54.680]  wanted to be heard because I got a big mouth. And we are from Jersey and I went with five strong.
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:01:02.200]  But when I got there, I noticed that there were less cops at that building than you would have
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:09.400]  at a sports event. Number two, they were hitting us with tear gas and nobody was even up there.
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:16.520]  So to me, not only was the front line, so to speak, these Antifa actors that were trying
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:22.440]  to be Trump supporters, they were up there. The tear gas was getting the Trump supporters a little
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:28.840]  bit riled up. So when you say there's 100 people that went in there, yes, most of them were bad
[3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:35.240]  actors. Some of them were being played on with emotions. It could have been anyone that could
[3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:39.640]  have went up been up there because they were rallying us up. Well, like I said, with those
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:45.640]  tear gas and Alex, do you remember the media tower right there up front and center in the back?
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:52.120]  Yes. There was someone on that megaphone. I know a little bit about neuro linguistic programming
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:59.880]  and LP whoever was on that megaphone was literally by the power of suggestion, hitting all those
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:06.040]  trigger words. Take it now, people. It's now or never. This is China. This is our house.
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.960]  Storm it, push forward, hold the line. They were saying everything that would brow anyone.
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:16.200]  And also read they said Alex Jones and Trump say so to hear that.
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:23.320]  I did not say that, but I'm here that but I can tell you what I felt and the things that I did here.
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:31.720]  And we held the line. And I did see Antifa. I took a selfie with one thinking that he thought
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:36.440]  thinking that I was taking a picture up front. And I did snap someone that looked exactly like
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:41.240]  Antifa. And he had those beady eyes. And when he saw me, he ran back because he knew he was
[3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:45.720]  discovered. Oh, yeah, we have the footage of Patriots trying to stop it. So here's the bottom
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:50.440]  line. Hundreds of thousands of people show up. And if attacks, the police shoot tear gas,
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:54.440]  they get a few of the crowd to attack. The police back up, they get the order to stand down.
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:58.920]  Everybody comes in. Most people take selfies with cops. There's a little bit of violence inside.
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:03.320]  A few people die. But if you look at sporting events, sometimes dozens die. Or you have a
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:09.000]  rolling stone riot and a whole bunch of people die. A race car events, people die. Or a race car
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:13.480]  goes to the stands and people die. You know, I mean, there's so many sporting riots. So this
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:19.720]  was like a sporting riot because of lack of security and provocateurs. And they turn this
[3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:26.840]  now into something completely different. It is 2020. Alex, I want to thank you for the call
[3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:33.640]  for taking my call. Pondside is 2020. If I could go back in time, I would have, I would, I would
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:40.520]  definitely do what those youth Trump supporters did at that front window. Pull these guys off
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:44.440]  the building and tell them to get the hell out of here because this is not what we stand for.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:49.320]  Oh, that night after all happened, I had a feeling I was going with my gut. And that day I did,
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:52.360]  they said, wait till Trump starts to leave. And I kept saying, we got to get to the Capitol.
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:55.480]  I kept telling my wife, we got to leave during the speech. We got to get to the Capitol,
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:59.240]  the Capitol, the Capitol, the Capitol. I got to, I got to get there. And then after I asked
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:02.520]  security guys, I go, should we wait? And they go, well, what do you think? And I said, let's run
[3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:08.040]  to the Capitol. We got to the Capitol. It was like 10 minutes late. With my 20 security guys,
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:12.520]  we could have stopped. If I'd have joined the cops, back up guys, what you were just showing for
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:17.080]  TV viewers of the tear gassing when the lines broke. If I'd have been there with my guys,
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:20.840]  and I had stood in front of that with the cops and said, don't do it. It wouldn't have happened.
[3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:26.360]  Hindsight's 2020, brother. But man, I just thought the Capitol police wouldn't have stepped down,
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:32.200]  wouldn't have stand down, but they did. And, and, and so this is, this is just something for us to
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:42.120]  learn from. Anything else, Dominic? That's it, man. I'm just going to fight the good fight.
[3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:47.560]  Thank you, Alex. I bless you, brother. Yeah, this is so real. This is so real. And then imagine
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:52.280]  being me, they're on the news saying I led this, that I wanted this. Oh, yeah, I want to have
[3:04:52.280 --> 3:04:55.880]  demonstrations and have a million people show up and then it all go, Hey, why are people dying?
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:05:01.640]  That's exactly what I want BS. Absolutely not. It makes me sick.
[3:05:03.160 --> 3:05:10.040]  But if I had their victory, and again, Q people believing that they had zip ties and
[3:05:10.040 --> 3:05:21.240]  we're supposed to arrest Pelosi got manipulated by a Chan and they went in. And you notice a Chan
[3:05:22.280 --> 3:05:29.400]  congratulated Biden when they said he won a few months ago and again after this on Thursday night.
[3:05:32.040 --> 3:05:35.560]  And if you're an eight Chan person, you're not bad. But I mean the leadership of a Chan,
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:40.680]  who are they? Why are they God? Because they're the place that lets you lark.
[3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:47.320]  They're the place that lets you pretend that you work for America and work for Trump and
[3:05:47.320 --> 3:05:51.960]  you're battling the globalist. Well, you just gave the globalist one of their biggest victories
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:56.280]  in a long time. Gregory, she got some breaking news.
[3:05:56.280 --> 3:06:06.680]  Yeah, I saw that. I just got sent that by Rodney Howard. Bring that to me.
[3:06:07.640 --> 3:06:11.560]  Yeah, like they've already done the 20th Amendment. This is a state dot gov state
[3:06:11.560 --> 3:06:16.520]  department. Can you guys would overhead shot for me? Thanks. And it says President of the United
[3:06:16.520 --> 3:06:27.880]  States. Donald J. Trump term ended on 2021, 01, 11, 1940, 41. That could be somebody inside
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:34.040]  there manipulating it. But that is the official state department deal. And we wonder what's
[3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:38.680]  even happened. I mean, that's how crazy every moment of this is. Rodney Howard just sent me
[3:06:38.680 --> 3:06:41.000]  that like 20 minutes ago. I meant to have the crew look at it. Thank you, sir.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:47.400]  All right, we're gonna go to Robin and Tom and Bob and Kerry and Rebecca and Dave and Josh. But
[3:06:47.400 --> 3:06:52.280]  you know what the Democrats have said? They've said we've got to wage war on his supporters.
[3:06:52.840 --> 3:06:55.400]  We got to bully him. We got to bankrupt. We got to dominate him.
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:07:02.600]  Well, if they're going to shut us down, we need provisions to operate as long as possible.
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:06.760]  And their big move is to take the banking and credit card operations away from everybody.

[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:21.080]  All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high end products
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:25.640]  that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor itself like 300 bucks
[3:09:25.640 --> 3:09:29.400]  a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:34.200]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:39.400]  So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:57.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:08.600]  You are listening to an infowarstore.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:17.160]  What a time to be alive. This is from the state department's website. We all trust computers
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:22.360]  like their god. There's lots of mistakes on them. But there are calls for 24th amendment.
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:28.840]  There are votes going on that just failed in the house for 20th amendment. There are hearings
[3:10:28.840 --> 3:10:33.160]  about impeachment going forward. So here it is on the state department's website.
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:45.400]  Donald John Trump's term ended 2021 at 749 tonight, 1940. And that says 41. So it's, I guess,
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:49.880]  the numbers are ticking up or something compared to what I just printed off minutes ago overhead
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:54.920]  shot, please. So I don't put a lot of stock in that. I do put a lot of stock in the fact
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:58.840]  we're trying to remove President Trump right now. Look at this infowarstore.com article.
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:06.680]  Facebook blocks former Congressman Ron Paul citing vague community standards violations.
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:14.920]  So his Facebook's being because he's a medical doctor exposing COVID as an overblown hoax.
[3:11:14.920 --> 3:11:25.640]  And because he pointed out the capital riot was not 10% as bad as the average post basketball game
[3:11:25.640 --> 3:11:31.240]  riot. That's the stuff he's been reporting. And by the way, I like Ron Paul. You know,
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:34.520]  Ron Paul admitted to me back when he was running for president that half the money they got was
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:39.160]  from our audience. We had him as a routine guest, helped his son run. I remember back when
[3:11:39.160 --> 3:11:45.160]  Ron Paul was running for Congress again in 1996, having a son on dozens of times to get
[3:11:45.160 --> 3:11:51.160]  money collected for daddy. When I got the platform, Ron Paul told me, he said,
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:11:56.360]  oh, we can't come on your show because, you know, you're deplatformed
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:03.560]  and just gave us the cold shoulder, which is fine. Because we made Ron Paul in the modern sense.
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:08.520]  Our audience did. Ron Paul is a great guy politically, but I just saw everybody get like
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:17.000]  that. And they always make up an excuse for why. That's all they need. But now he's deplatformed.
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:22.200]  Now the president's deplatformed. See now everybody is. So folks kept asking me,
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:25.000]  how are you handling me deplatformed? Well, you're next. I don't know.
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:32.600]  Zero hedge has an important article. COVID gone crazy. An epidemic of positive test.
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:37.960]  In Germany, other places they've ruled 96% are false positives. The inventor said that.
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:46.920]  It's all a lie. Let's go back to your phone calls. We got Kerry and Tom and we got Robin
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:51.000]  and we got so many others. Let's go to Robin and Florida. Robin, thanks for calling.
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:57.560]  Hey, Alex. I love you, brother. Love you too. Hey, man. Just real quick. I was there January
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:01.880]  the 6th. I want to tell you what I heard and what I heard said about you over a bullhorn.
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:07.960]  But just before I do, thank you for the survival shield. Two eggs, three awesome stuff. There's
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:12.360]  a lot of us Christians that are praying for you. I'm a full-time evangelist. So I traveled for 20
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:17.720]  years across the nation, preaching revivals. That's what I'm doing in Florida now. Just before I
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:23.320]  tell you that, what I saw happened and what I heard said about you guys there at the Capitol.
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:26.520]  I just want to give you a quick scripture, bro. I want to speak something over you.
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:31.560]  I know you're under attack, but I got a word right here. Matthew chapter 5. Jesus said,
[3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:36.920]  blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:43.640]  you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so
[3:13:43.640 --> 3:13:47.720]  persecuted day the prophet. I just want to tell you, bro, I know you're under attack from all
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:52.440]  angles, but we're holding you up. And I just going to tell you, bro, prophetically, the more
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:56.520]  they battle you, the more God's going to bless you, the more they reject you. Amen to that,
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:00.040]  brother. I've never felt stronger. I got to control myself because I actually am so fired up.
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:03.560]  I hear you. God bless you and back at you. So what did you witness at the Capitol, my friend?
[3:14:04.280 --> 3:14:08.200]  Well, I was there. I was pushed back. I couldn't get in and let this park. I had a couple guys
[3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:14.680]  doing security with me, you know, show me where to go. We were pushed back and the guy is a marine
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:20.280]  guy. He kept pointing out to me. This is Antifa plant. So we were noticing it. But what I've done,
[3:14:20.280 --> 3:14:25.480]  we left early and Trump said, you know, that they were coming to the Capitol. He said at one
[3:14:25.480 --> 3:14:29.800]  point he said, we're going to all march down there together. But I said, well, let's hit on back
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:34.520]  because we were pushed so far back. I figured I met the back. I can be first towards the Capitol.
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:41.640]  We walk up. First thing I noticed, very, just zero police presence compared to all the snipers
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:47.480]  that we saw earlier. When we get there immediately, I see these Antifa guys. There's probably a hundred
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:53.800]  guys posted up there at the lower level and they pulled the barricade down. And on bullhorns,
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:58.840]  they start screaming, you know, and this was just totally satanic. They are saying,
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:03.960]  press forward as our house was taken. And I'm waiting. I'm standing back after a bit. These
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:10.120]  guys climb up and we climb up on the grass. I'm about 50 yards from the Capitol step.
[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:13.880]  They're up in that tower, that media tower. And at one point I heard them say,
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:22.360]  Trump said, take the house. Trump said, take the house. Alex Jones gives the command, go forward
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:27.160]  now. And I'm just looking around like, what are these guys? We're seeing, by the way,
[3:15:27.160 --> 3:15:31.080]  that's come out in the news and other people told me this. I wasn't there yet. So you have
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:34.840]  Antifa literally, because I heard they were wearing masks, they said, saying Alex Jones
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:41.240]  gives the order. Wow. Exactly. As if to say that on, on, on info wars, which we knew you were there,
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:45.080]  that you were given some command, but you know, we're not barging in the Capitol.
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:50.120]  The 99% of us are around. Exactly. If I tell you to commit some crime, don't do it. You,
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:56.200]  you, you, this is crazy. And so, and so I'm looking up on the, on the steps of the Capitol,
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:16:01.560]  a couple of the Capitol police come down, just a couple, bro. There's not even a hundred,
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:06.520]  but they're shooting tear gas at us. And this kid runs back and by now I can realize these are
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:11.960]  stage actors. The boss from that guy's there, you know, he's up in the tower, total satanic.
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:16.680]  He's the one, one of the ones that's screaming on the bullhorn. You know, Alex Jones says,
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:21.960]  take the house. POTUS says, take the house. These guys are screaming the T trigger words.
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:27.560]  And they're shooting tear gas at us. This kid runs that down 20 years old. He says, man,
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:32.600]  they just shot me in the eye. Come help, come help. You know, they're trying to incite those of us
[3:16:32.600 --> 3:16:37.720]  that would actually come to a brother's aid to rush up here and do something. And so when I
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:43.240]  watched them literally go in, I left when I saw him storming in there, but the storm was not a
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:48.440]  storm. It was a walkthrough. I watched them. I have them on video. They literally walked across
[3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:54.120]  the barricade and stepped into an open Capitol. Well, that's what experts say. And we've seen it.
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:57.960]  The police weren't part of it. They were just controlled by their orders. You have anti-field
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:03.080]  attack, trick some patriots to go forward, get the photo off of the fight. As soon as the photo ops
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:07.320]  ordered, the police were ordered to open the barricades, stand back. They opened the barricades,
[3:17:07.320 --> 3:17:13.240]  let folks in, knowing anti for inside, but then do some violence and attack cops. So cops would
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:19.800]  fight back. Then they had the whole store. They wanted all put together would buy cops. They
[3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:24.680]  they were literally they were trying to get us to, you know, go along with them.
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:29.080]  And I'm just so glad that the Holy Spirit held us back, held us in check. You know, it took me
[3:17:29.080 --> 3:17:33.320]  a while to decide for everything that happened. But, you know, and I know enough about you that
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:39.160]  you're not saying storm the house, take our house back. Neither is Trump. So I'm glad for the people
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:43.080]  that held restraint. You know, there were a million. Our mission was clear, peacefully be there to let
[3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:47.880]  them know that America doesn't buy the frauds and election. Joe Biden can't get 10 people. We've got
[3:17:47.880 --> 3:17:54.200]  a million. Exactly. Well, the lie goes around the world before the truth puts its pants on
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:18:01.640]  as a great American writer said. But where do you think this goes from here, my friend, in 20
[3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:06.520]  seconds? Well, you know, here's what I think. I think Trump is still in much more control of
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:11.160]  the art of the deal. He said you appear weak when you're strong. I think he's much stronger than he
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:15.720]  actually is letting on. We're going to hear something coming up. But I think that we got a
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:21.240]  we got a sit fight, pray to God. I really feel like that one way God's going to turn this around
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:28.280]  for us. Just to agree, I agree. Look at the protesters. Oh, walking between the red velvet,
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:33.320]  if you kick it over. Wow, that's your big evil riot. So America's over into the First Amendment,
[3:18:33.320 --> 3:18:36.760]  end of everything. China runs this because people came in the capital.
[3:18:39.720 --> 3:18:46.200]  Anybody listening to my voice simply search into the term. Davos group, technocracy, we're technocrats.
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:54.200]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Yunker and all the new world order globalists like
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:59.880]  Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, but they want
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:04.760]  businessmen, technocrats over it. And that's who Klaus Schwab is. I want to look into the guy that
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:09.000]  says they've watched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:14.680]  to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes because he's hidden in plain view,
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:18.680]  and you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it to you. You might want to
[3:19:18.680 --> 3:19:23.560]  find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed, since the 80s,
[3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:29.400]  the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works. So
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:33.880]  you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:41.480]  those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right. Three, two, one, here
[3:19:41.480 --> 3:19:45.080]  we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't get it because the
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:49.240]  lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you real quick about it. But the power of
[3:19:49.240 --> 3:19:53.240]  quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently. Traditional antihistamines that was clinically
[3:19:53.240 --> 3:19:57.400]  studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and aiding
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:02.920]  respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down,
[3:20:02.920 --> 3:20:09.080]  so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock 25% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:14.360]  Pollen block again is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it,
[3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:19.000]  but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally unlike some of the
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:23.880]  stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:28.840]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress.
[3:20:28.840 --> 3:20:34.040]  And it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up the pills. They taste great.
[3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:41.800]  It's available again infowarstore.com. Pollen block infowarstore.com. The resistance.video,
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:51.400]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video,
[3:20:51.400 --> 3:21:01.240]  the resistance.video, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:08.280]  launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:15.320]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the Globlers are on our tail. But the new website is
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:22.520]  theresistance.video, the resistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:28.600]  and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:32.120]  all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:38.680]  is at theresistance.video. Share the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:44.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:21:58.440]  All right, we got an answer on this. And I told you I didn't think that Trump had
[3:21:58.440 --> 3:22:05.320]  resigned or been impeached for the 25th Amendment because the 25th Amendment vote failed in the
[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:09.800]  House this morning. So then the call for the cabinet to do the 25th Amendment, that failed.
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:16.680]  And the impeachment's moving forward, but that'll take time. So I said, why would Trump do that when
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:22.840]  he has event scheduled overhead shot, please? So you could see where the State Department website
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:29.960]  said Trump was now in office. Well, Christopher Miller is now reporting sources tell BuzzFeed
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:33.880]  News that his gruntled staff were behind the State Department's site change of Trump and
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:41.400]  Pence's biographies more to come. So exactly what I said is a computer glitch or some type of leftist
[3:22:41.400 --> 3:22:47.560]  behavior, but that's the fraud they engage in as a group. You can't believe a damn thing they say
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:52.840]  or they do. All right, let's go ahead and take a call. Quick here. I want to get everybody.
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:58.360]  Let's go to Rebecca in Minnesota. Rebecca, what is your view? Were you at the March? Give us your
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:05.880]  tag. All right. Hello. First of all, Turbo Force, Brain Force X2 must have, and I will be getting
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:11.480]  some durable food. No one has really talked about Tuesday night. I just want to make mention of that
[3:23:12.200 --> 3:23:18.680]  in Freedom Plaza. Awesome night, very spiritual. I think you had, there's a pastor there. You
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:27.400]  yourself had some great peaceful messaging. I've been listening every day. There's been
[3:23:27.400 --> 3:23:33.880]  peaceful messaging as far as come to the March. Let's March, nothing to entice violence or anything
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:39.560]  like that. So I just, yeah, when we say we declare war on evil and we want 1776 and we love God and
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:44.920]  we stand up against that. That's energetically, spiritually, we are declaring that power.
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:53.400]  Absolutely. So Wednesday, we felt it was very odd that Trump was supposed to speak at 11 and
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:24:01.720]  didn't come until 1237 or 12 o'clock, I should say. And by that time, some of us had to use the
[3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:07.080]  restroom. We noticed all the restrooms were locked up in the VIP area. We thought that was extremely
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:13.400]  odd. So for all the hundreds of thousands or million people that were there, all the restrooms
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:17.720]  were locked up. So just something to think about. So that was a little bit of it. I noticed that too
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:22.920]  in the VIP area. There were all these porta potties paid for by the donors, but they were locked. They
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:30.120]  had padlocks on a little fence around them and on the porta potties. Correct. And so with our group,
[3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:35.720]  there was foreign, our group, we're from Minnesota, the communist state of Minnesota.
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:41.400]  And at about 1237, we headed back to our hotel because some people in our group had to use the
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:49.960]  restroom. We had came down, I think, I know we eventually ended up on Pennsylvania Avenue. And
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:55.480]  there was all sorts of different people. I did feel that I spotted out some Antifa members in
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:02.360]  my view. They just have a spirit about them, that their movements are a little bit more forceful
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:07.000]  and direct. And there's not a whole lot of interaction. Other people I did witness, they
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.600]  looked maybe like military people, I mean, very in shape and perhaps, you know, can't
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:18.680]  camouflage on, but nothing out of the usual. Most people were just dressed in Trump gear. Of
[3:25:18.680 --> 3:25:22.840]  course you get the people. Sure. So what did you, what did you witness once you got to the Capitol?
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:29.320]  So once I got to the Capitol, I was trying to figure out what the heck I was stepping on.
[3:25:29.320 --> 3:25:36.200]  There was some green rolled fence and fencing posts at one point that I was stepping on.
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:42.840]  We simply walked up to the front and got up on the platform. We were peaceful and we were tear
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:49.640]  gassed. I was around elders that were probably in their 70s, 80s. I was also around children and
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:55.880]  we all were tear gassed for just standing there. So that was quite agitating. Something to think
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:26:05.160]  about too is where the guards were lined up and we were, and then back, not towards the Capitol,
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:11.000]  we were getting, a paramedic told me that they were shooting concussion bullets at us.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:16.760]  I did see rubber pellets that were shot. Sure. Sure. Sure. What happened is they had you,
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:22.520]  they had to anti-fatact the cops and the cops attacked the crowd. Then the cops are told to
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:27.400]  stand down, open the gates to then flood the Capitol. It was all scripted. It was all set up.
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:33.240]  We know that now and the guy that was in charge of it committed suicide conveniently, sadly,
[3:26:33.240 --> 3:26:37.080]  so we'll never know what actually happened. This is interesting. Thank you, Rebecca.
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  Gotta get to everybody here. Great points. All right. Next caller up.
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:46.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave and Pennsylvania. Go ahead, Dave.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:49.400]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? I can't go ahead.
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:58.120]  I got to the Capitol about five minutes before you and it was already gone by that time.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:05.080]  When you came, I saw you get up on a podium or something and try to tell the crowd to
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:10.760]  back off, but at that point it was a lost cause. I think you've said that.
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:15.560]  The things that kind of struck me were there was a lot of people smoking pot
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:22.440]  out in the open around the crowds, which was kind of weird. A lot of people that didn't fit
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:29.880]  the Trump supporter, I guess, mold. I went around the back of the Capitol with you
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:35.800]  and I saw you get up on the steps to try to calm that crowd down. That wasn't working either,
[3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:42.360]  so I think you guys left right after that, but I stuck around and there were people coming out
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:52.120]  back to the Capitol, Trump people or whoever, and at one point, one guy started yelling about
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:59.480]  how they shot a woman inside and he was really, really irate. I walked around where the people
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:03.960]  were coming out and I was talking to them and a few of the people I was talking to,
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:14.040]  they were actually invited in by police and they were kind of happy and jovial about it,
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:18.600]  showing me pictures on their cell phones. They were taking selfies with police.
[3:28:19.560 --> 3:28:24.040]  That's what I'm telling you is that they had a riot, a little bit of riot at the front of the
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.520]  building and they let folks in the other areas of the building and they took selfies inside.
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:32.360]  This was a total setup and again, the police didn't know. They were being given different mixed
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:39.880]  orders. I can tell them I asked them, did they look at any of your identification or anything?
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:43.880]  They said no. I was like, they didn't ask you for your name or anything. They were like, no, no,
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:49.560]  it was a great time and stuff. Then I asked them, well, did you wear a face mask while you were
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:56.280]  in there and then I could see the concerned look creep in on them. That's it. They had their
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:03.240]  staged event. They had to get a crowd in so that they can then demonize and say it was this big
[3:29:03.240 --> 3:29:07.640]  attack. They did a great job and that shows when you've got big tech control, what you can do,
[3:29:07.640 --> 3:29:12.840]  hell, they're rolling the vaccine out. Thousands are dying. Tens of thousands are getting sick.
[3:29:13.480 --> 3:29:17.640]  I know people dying, people getting sick. I know people that run nursing homes where
[3:29:17.640 --> 3:29:22.440]  their people are dying, getting sick and they control the media so no one knows. It's incredible.
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:26.760]  Here's the thing that really haunts me though from that day. When I was standing there talking to
[3:29:26.760 --> 3:29:33.320]  him over across the way, there was a barricade with police inside and I got called over.
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:38.840]  One of the cops needed help and I had some water in my backpack and paper towels and
[3:29:39.480 --> 3:29:45.400]  another guy and me were helping the young police officer. He was in distress. He had stuff in his
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:52.040]  eyes. But at that point when I was standing there talking to the police, this camera crew came and
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:59.560]  set up. I asked them who they were with and they were just stared straight ahead, didn't acknowledge
[3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:06.280]  me, didn't say anything. I'm like, oh great, we got the fake news here. This is pushing an hour
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:13.160]  after the girl was shot inside after Ashley was shot. Here's what these guys did. They called the
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:18.120]  news crew in. They were standing there. They got their camera set up and everything. Five minutes
[3:30:18.120 --> 3:30:26.200]  later they brought a scratcher in. Ten minutes later they brought Ashley out. She had been dead.
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:32.760]  Everybody knows it. She had been dead for an hour. I was five feet away from her when they
[3:30:32.760 --> 3:30:38.680]  wheeled her out. Clearly she was dead but they were faking chest compressions, faking air
[3:30:40.200 --> 3:30:45.880]  and it was just a stage set up with this woman's corpse. So MSNBC,
[3:30:45.880 --> 3:30:54.120]  that's who released this video, could put this on the internet. I think it's disgusting.
[3:30:54.120 --> 3:31:04.680]  Well, so your call is man-witnessed MSNBC fake resuscitation of Ashley Babbitt and I think we
[3:31:04.680 --> 3:31:09.080]  should put your call out as a call because I mean we know that happened. People said she was already
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:14.920]  dead inside and it's so sick and they turned them killing our people into us being bad. Wow,
[3:31:14.920 --> 3:31:20.120]  incredible. God bless you Dave. Glad you called. Very sad story. All right JD, Shane, Nicole, Tom,
[3:31:20.120 --> 3:31:25.720]  Josh, I got to get to all of you in a 10 minute 52nd segment because the war room is coming up.
[3:31:26.280 --> 3:31:29.960]  This could be our last show folks. Everything's being shut down right now. We're in a mayday
[3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:46.760]  situation. Just let everybody you know. Tune in now, infowars.com and Bandai video now.
[3:31:46.760 --> 3:32:01.800]  Where the hell did this water come from? We can't survive without pure clean drinking water.
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:07.800]  So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa pure water filtration system.

[3:32:34.120 --> 3:32:41.560]  Other systems just don't compare. We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[3:32:41.560 --> 3:32:46.280]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalist, big tech and big farmer are all pushing
[3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:51.240]  the Cove's most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[3:32:51.240 --> 3:32:55.800]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying
[3:32:55.800 --> 3:33:01.800]  inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head
[3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:07.000]  medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[3:33:07.000 --> 3:33:11.160]  are basically bio weapons and are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that
[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:15.960]  die, basically. When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:19.960]  resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just slowly die. And that's on the record.
[3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:24.760]  It does that. Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:28.680]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine princess
[3:33:28.680 --> 3:33:33.400]  can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something
[3:33:33.400 --> 3:33:36.600]  that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:44.120]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling
[3:33:44.120 --> 3:33:48.600]  products and floors are no longer available. And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever.
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:54.760]  But after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest,

[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:44.040]  infowarstore.com. The post industrial world. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to
[3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:52.760]  at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030,
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:58.280]  which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the Debo script. Trudeau, the professor of Canada,
[3:34:58.280 --> 3:35:04.920]  they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:11.080]  what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population
[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:17.160]  poor by designs. We can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:24.280]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image. We are fighting this
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:30.840]  at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting for a pro human future, and we need you to get
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:35.800]  the facts to research it and share it with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us,
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:36:01.560]  spread the word at infowars.com. Well, this will be a week of action. And today we will
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:07.960]  seek a unanimous consent request to bring up a resolution authored by Congressman Jim Muraskin
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:13.720]  to demand that the vice president invoke the 25th amendment. I expect the Republicans will object,
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:18.760]  so tomorrow the rules committee, which I chair, will provide a rule to bring that legislation
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:24.200]  to the floor. We will vote on it. And then 24 hours later, we will go back to the rules committee
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:29.320]  and then bring another resolution to deal with the issue of impeachment. This video is called,
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:34.200]  we are out of time for debate. And if you can pause that, please notice the congressperson is
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:41.720]  wearing a mask as a virtue signaler that says end hunger. Now, well, the whole COVID lockdown is
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:45.400]  meant to start a third world to death and is. I mean, it's just everything they tell you is
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:54.520]  the opposite. These are monster globalist operators. These are the bad guys. Wow. Incredible.
[3:36:54.520 --> 3:36:59.000]  But they know because we have morals, they can show us something wrong. Oh, look,
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.320]  a riot at the Capitol. Oh, we're sorry. We're bad. We'll kill ourselves. Meanwhile,
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:07.800]  they're running death camps in China. I was jamming as many of these calls as possible.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:10.840]  Let's talk to Nicole in California. You're on the air.
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:17.480]  Hello. I just want to say God bless you. And God bless you for what you just saw.
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:21.560]  Well, God bless you. Your phone sounds a little bit echoy. Can you get off speakerphone?
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:27.560]  Okay. I don't have you on speakerphone, but I want you to hear you now. Go ahead.
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:32.120]  Ever since we're at the Capitol, our phones have been acting very funny.
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:38.520]  We have video footage. We tried to download as much as we could. My husband had a GoPro.
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:42.040]  We're having a difficult time downloading everything right now.
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:44.920]  Okay. So we're almost out of time. What happened? What'd you say?
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:52.360]  Well, as we were walking towards the Capitol, I saw they were spraying tear gas and
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:57.240]  my husband and I were like getting very nervous and there was people praying, praying for the police,
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:01.880]  praying for Antifa. There was a lot of prayers going on and this couple comes down and they
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:07.720]  looked like they were heavily tear gas and the woman was visibly upset and crying and the husband
[3:38:07.720 --> 3:38:11.720]  starts yelling, they killed a woman. They killed a woman and me and everybody was like,
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:17.160]  let them through. Let them through because they were coming opposite direction. And I told my
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:21.240]  husband, what are they talking about? What are they talking about? And they just kept throwing
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:26.520]  tear gas at us. There was no discrimination. There were children there. There was no
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:32.680]  discrimination. Antifa attacked the cops, so they attacked the crowd. Then they opened the doors
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:37.800]  up so people go in to set you up. A total criminal conspiracy. The left caught yet again.
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:43.080]  As we realized, Antifa was very quickly because of the fact that they were wearing helmets with
[3:38:43.080 --> 3:38:47.640]  Trump stickers on top and we were like, where did they get their gas masks? Why are they wearing
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:51.240]  gas masks? And then they were coming, they were throwing tear gas from behind us.
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:38:58.920]  So you're saying you were seeing people dressed like cops but in plain clothes but with body
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:04.600]  armor and masks, throwing tear gas behind you? Yes. And they were saying, come through, come
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:08.200]  through, make the hole, make the hole, let us through. And they were pushing and I knew they
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:12.280]  weren't job supporters. I knew they weren't there for the marks because they had no hesitation.
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:16.040]  Well, that's what I'm saying is there was a lot of paramilitary, not just the method, Antifa.
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:22.280]  They're all like rich kids, rich kids, you know, of Democrats. I hear you, ma'am. It's pure able.
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:28.440]  Trump needs to speak out against it. Thank you so much. J.D. in Arizona. You're on the air.
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:36.600]  Alex, I'm a man of middle class means, but I spent five figures in the infor store. Anybody
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:41.560]  that doesn't buy your supplements should. And they're really trying to shut us down, brother.
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:47.080]  We need your financial support right now. So thank you. Yeah. And I was there. I was there
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:53.080]  probably 20 minutes ahead of you. I left after Trump's speech because I wanted to be in the front
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:57.320]  of the lawn of the Capitol. I had absolutely no intention of going in and I never did.
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:02.360]  But while I was making my way to on the lawn, they started tear gas and I can tell you this.
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:08.200]  I can concur with the last caller said, but I also like to add it really pissed all of us off
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:14.520]  to be tear gas and that enraged regular Trump supporters to go up in there. And I have to tell
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:18.680]  you, I've been in this fight with you for the last five years. I radio host on your Phoenix
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:25.640]  radio affiliate. And I'm going to tell you something. You need to get that radio station
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:31.240]  owner to put you on daytime. Okay. Because he would, he would be a millionaire instantly from that.
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:33.960]  Anyhow. So what's, what's the name of the station? What's the call letters?
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:40.360]  KFNX. You're on the middle of the night over here, but I had an article five hour for five years
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:44.040]  on Sunday afternoon. And I got to tell you, I've got all my guests, including Ted Nugent,
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:48.280]  coming to my studio. Thank you for all the time. We had a lot of affiliates have us on the middle
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:51.800]  of the night. They're all precious. We appreciate them. I got to jump JD, call me back tomorrow.
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:56.040]  We'll talk more. But yeah, I want to get to all the callers. This is just crazy. What's
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:59.800]  going on? You're hearing eyewitness accounts. We have the video to back it up. It's all at
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:05.960]  band.video, band.video or the resistance.video. Okay. Shane and Virginia, go ahead. You're on the
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:11.640]  air. Hey, Alex, I just want to let you know we were down there to see the president speak and
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:16.680]  it was packed. We could, we didn't have a chance to get on the ellipse and we were there about
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:21.240]  six o'clock in the morning. I stood in a space about six inches for about three and a half,
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:27.080]  four hours. And I was very claustrophobic. Yeah, they didn't even give a chance to let
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:32.200]  everybody through to get onto the ellipse. Anyway, listen to the entire speech that Trump gave,
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:38.040]  not one time did he incite violence. So it was all done. We walked down to the backside of the
[3:41:38.040 --> 3:41:42.760]  Capitol. There were already reports of people like trying to break in. We were just on the outside.
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:49.400]  On the backside of the Capitol, it was almost as packed as, you know, the space on the street
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:54.680]  outside the ellipse towards the Washington Monument. We were singing the national anthem,
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:42:01.320]  God bless America, chanting USA. You know, so if that's insurrection, that's,
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:06.120]  No, I hear you. It was less than a hundred people, brother, that broke in. Most of them antifa.
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:09.720]  God bless you. That's what happened, folks. They don't want people to see the images.
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:13.960]  I'm going quick to everybody. Let's go to Tom in Washington. Go ahead, Tom.
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:21.320]  Alex, you there? Yep. Hey, this is Tom from Washington. First of all, I want to say
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:26.280]  been listening to you for 15 years. I appreciate you bringing the truth to me for all these years.
[3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:30.360]  It broke Bilderberg. People thought I was nuts. I've been trying to spread the word ever since
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:36.920]  I really wanted to get on here to reiterate a few points. I was there. I was of the mong,
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:42.440]  the first group standing back like 20 feet from the barricade to get tear gas. I watched old women
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:49.720]  get tear gas. I can, I can attest to what the previous caller said about the Trump supporters
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:54.520]  getting angry after they started getting tear gas by police. We had vets. I have video of this,
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:59.080]  too. If you need the video, we had vets up there preaching, you know, throughout the entire day
[3:42:59.080 --> 3:43:03.240]  saying, Hey, I'm a vet. I'll fight for you. I would die for you. But this is, this is the,
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:06.840]  you know, we are on yours. The police are on our side. Sir, we know what happened.
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:11.960]  No, anti foot before Trump speech even began attacked. Rob cops came out. Then as people
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:15.240]  pushed forward, not knowing where they were supposed to go, they got attacked. It was bad
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:19.800]  management to stand down by the Capitol was all a psychological setup. A powder keg would happen
[3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:25.080]  with a football crowd, a basketball crowd, a soccer crowd. It was a guaranteed operation.
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:30.440]  I'm 100% with you. And I can, and I can also attest to the people on the media tower. So I
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:34.520]  watched those people climb the media tower and I kept telling everybody they're trying to
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:39.720]  antagonize. They are trying to antagonize us. And like I said, people didn't start getting mad.
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:44.360]  I saw some people in front of me get pissed off and I tried to get video, but my video was pointed
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:47.720]  down. I got to jump. I got to get to every color before the show ends. Carrie and then
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:52.760]  Josh in Florida, Carrie and Oregon, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, thanks. God bless you.
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:43:59.880]  I was at the Capitol and sounding like I was at the backside, but at the rally, I think you walked
[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.120]  about five feet away from me as you guys were making your way through the crowd. Everyone is
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:10.440]  yelling your name and, and cheering. Anyway, we walked, we were up on the second level of the
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:16.920]  Capitol in the back. And this man you had on earlier saying we were saying in the national anthem,
[3:44:16.920 --> 3:44:21.560]  I was up on that second level looking down at people. We were all singing the national anthem.
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:28.040]  We were all yelling USA. That is absolutely correct. Now I had a clear visual of the door,
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:32.520]  one of the doors that were, they were trying to break in lots of guys dressed in black there.
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:37.560]  Now, can I say it was Antifa? Of course I can't. Oh, I can't because Antifa wears pink on their
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:42.840]  breathers or bandanas. And he looked at almost all wearing pink markers on black. They wear black
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:50.040]  on pink. What I did see was right in front of me, I was standing on the rail right in front of me.
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:55.240]  Guys were being pulled up. They were scaling the wall or being pushed up from below, being pulled
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:59.400]  over the rail right in front of me. In fact, I actually helped some of them. And as soon as
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:04.440]  they got up there, they walked straight for that door. No, that's it. I got to jump. Thank you,
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:09.320]  Kerry. Call me back again tomorrow. We'll open the phones up again for all this. Josh in Florida,
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:16.680]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, I just want to say I think this was maybe the biggest
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:23.480]  military blunder in our fight. This is like the equivalent of having two generals with the same
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:29.000]  army and just getting annihilated. Well, this was like Pearl Harbor, but not the way Schumer said,
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:34.920]  we got snuck attack here. Yeah, that's, that's, that's what I mean. I was out there, got there
[3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:41.480]  around 730. Everything was peaceful and loud. We didn't see, I didn't see one Confederate flag out
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:49.080]  there. I didn't see anything like that. But what I did, I was telling my buddy was watch out for
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:55.240]  the people in camo and wearing face masks because that's not Trump people. And that's right. They
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:46:00.440]  sent in military provocateurs, mercenaries and leftists. We have all the video. You're absolutely
[3:46:00.440 --> 3:46:04.520]  right. A lot of time. Great point. Owen Troyer is coming up with the war room. I'm going to be
[3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:08.840]  co-hosting. I'll pop in with him. We've got a couple of special reports right up front that are
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.360]  very powerful to be here. Everyone tune in at Band-Aught Video, the Owen Troyer war room, or the
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:20.040]  main network feed at infowars.com and spread the links, the revolution against tyrannies. Now,
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:24.680]  it's an info war. Only you can stop it. So tell your whole email list and your text message
[3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:25.400]  friends about it.
