[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.520]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.520 --> 00:17.600]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:23.960 --> 00:25.960]  We're live
[00:25.960 --> 00:30.680]  It is Sunday the 19th day of June
[00:31.600 --> 00:34.000]  2011 the quickening is definitely here and
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.720]  We have an extremely important broadcast lined up for you today
[00:40.200 --> 00:42.120]  Undoubtedly during the
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.080]  First hour we won't have any time to take calls but I do look forward to taking your calls in the second hour
[00:51.080 --> 00:57.360]  We knew this was coming. We now have the EU and UN sanctions on the way
[00:58.200 --> 01:02.080]  to begin the pretext of the invasion of
[01:04.040 --> 01:10.320]  Syria now not just Libya and we have the confirmed reports from inside Fort Hood another major basis that
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.120]  US military is going to be sending in heavy armor in
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.680]  late September early October and
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.920]  And I've likened this to World War three
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.120]  Now after I released that video Friday the special report I did I realized I needed to shoot another video
[01:28.840 --> 01:31.960]  Explaining to people the general public what World War three means
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.360]  Because we have a pop culture idea of if we go to war with the Russians
[01:37.360 --> 01:42.960]  That's World War three and the end of the world and I don't know what World War three will look like
[01:42.960 --> 01:49.880]  But I know that World War four will be fought with sticks and stones, but I'm not talking about a thermonuclear
[01:50.400 --> 01:58.080]  World War three. I'm talking about a third World War and you can look up different encyclopedia Britannica Wikipedia other definitions
[01:59.280 --> 02:02.800]  But when you look them up, it's it's a multi-region war with
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.720]  More than three countries involved that has prolonged with high numbers of debt and
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.280]  And if you don't call the last nine years of Afghanistan Iraq
[02:17.120 --> 02:18.840]  Pakistan
[02:18.840 --> 02:24.520]  Yemen all these other countries if you don't if you don't call that a
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.600]  Multi-region war with high numbers of dead people and a lot of different countries involved if you don't call it a World War three
[02:31.600 --> 02:36.720]  What do you call it and it just so happens that I was going for memory, but I wanted to make sure I was right
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.120]  So I did a lot of research Friday night and Saturday to make sure my video was accurate
[02:41.960 --> 02:43.960]  And it turns out it's completely accurate
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.040]  Except for one issue the Pentagon calls the Cold War World War three. Oh
[02:51.200 --> 02:53.200]  Yeah, that's official. We're gonna be going over that
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.680]  And so I guess you'd call this World War four but for a popular understanding and I said World War four
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.920]  Folks wouldn't get it and I even have George W. Bush ABC news and other reports here
[03:04.920 --> 03:08.560]  saying bush lichens war on terror to World War three
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.720]  That's what it is. It was a pretext for World War three or World War four. It's a proxy war
[03:15.840 --> 03:22.280]  It's it's it's a world war via proxies as we predicted what happened and would be expanded in the Obama deception
[03:23.080 --> 03:29.720]  So we're gonna break down exactly what the globalist what the Bilderberg group plans to have come out of this
[03:29.720 --> 03:35.400]  Today and it's extremely important now. I'm not gonna get to that first though
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.040]  Not gonna get to that first. I
[03:38.360 --> 03:40.360]  want to get in to
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.440]  The TSA and the fight against total federalization. That's really what this TSA situation is really all about
[03:47.440 --> 03:49.440]  It's much bigger than just airports
[03:49.960 --> 03:55.960]  And the fact that state legislatures in Texas had their genitals grow up so hard that they were wracked by it
[03:55.960 --> 04:05.520]  They were groveling in pain. They were told you you have been now been punished and then there's many cases confirming even when they're caught on tape when the
[04:09.200 --> 04:13.520]  Federal goons tell you you're being punished. That's why when I go through they get uppity
[04:13.520 --> 04:18.400]  I start explaining. I know your bosses stage 9-11 and there's not the pleasure in it
[04:18.400 --> 04:24.720]  So they don't usually abuse me because I take the pleasure away. I'm I'm I'm I'm ready to be abused
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.720]  I don't care. I'm good. I'm
[04:27.520 --> 04:34.760]  Constitutional, I'm historically informed. I'm for liberty. I'm with the spirit of 1776 and I don't care what you do to me
[04:35.520 --> 04:38.320]  I crossed over that river a long time ago
[04:40.600 --> 04:44.280]  As far as I'm concerned, you know the coins have already been given to Charon
[04:45.640 --> 04:51.200]  Okay, we're gonna come right back on the other side of this break and get into all these huge developments
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.480]  And I have a correction to make as well stay with us
[04:59.400 --> 05:05.000]  When you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road
[05:06.080 --> 05:13.400]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee
[05:15.240 --> 05:17.840]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[05:17.840 --> 05:22.120]  They so pride in every stitch
[05:24.360 --> 05:26.360]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[05:28.240 --> 05:36.080]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond gussets got it
[05:36.920 --> 05:44.320]  Others don't we turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[05:44.320 --> 05:51.160]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could ride all day with confidence
[05:51.600 --> 05:57.640]  Order yours at gusset.com diamond gusset jeans got it others don't
[05:57.640 --> 06:12.760]  The Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[06:12.760 --> 06:21.880]  Thank you for joining us on this father's day live worldwide transmission
[06:22.520 --> 06:24.520]  Against tyranny and defense of liberty
[06:25.240 --> 06:31.120]  I'm Alex Jones your host. We're here every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central 5 to 7 Eastern 2 to 4
[06:31.800 --> 06:36.240]  Civic 3 to 5 mountain and then of course I come back
[06:36.240 --> 06:45.960]  Live during the week 11 a.m. To 2 p.m. All-Times Central standard the websites are info wars.com and
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.680]  prisonplanet.tv
[06:50.560 --> 06:56.680]  Okay, let me do something here that I always attempt and almost always fail because as I read each headline
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.280]  I end up diving into the second or third
[06:59.640 --> 07:05.440]  It's kind of like the old tootsie pop ad with the owl. He goes to the wise owl the kid does and says how many
[07:05.440 --> 07:11.000]  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
[07:11.880 --> 07:17.240]  Lollipop and the owl says one two three and crunches into it and says three
[07:18.320 --> 07:23.880]  I'm never able a decade ago. I could it's a start of the broadcast. It's an old habit
[07:23.880 --> 07:30.200]  I think it was a good habit. I would just read you at least 10 of the top stories. We'd be covering. I never get three or four deep
[07:31.240 --> 07:34.120]  Without just launching into the third or fourth when I get to
[07:34.120 --> 07:39.480]  But we do have big World War three news and I've never used that term on air
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.280]  By never using the term. I mean, I've never said that it's a serious
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.540]  Possibility and it is a serious possibility now, and I'm not the only
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.120]  Analyst saying this so we're gonna be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour
[07:54.120 --> 07:59.660]  That's the big report today, and I assure you that you're gonna want to be joining us to
[08:00.280 --> 08:02.280]  Hear that breakdown
[08:02.280 --> 08:07.040]  Coming up. I will have open phones coming up in the second hour of the Sunday
[08:08.040 --> 08:11.120]  Transmission we're also simulcasting this radio show in full living
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.520]  multi-camera shoot
[08:13.520 --> 08:19.680]  Color at prison planet dot TV an entire other dimension that way. I'm not just claiming
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.840]  I have a news article or a video clip or a congressman here in studio. I'm able to actually show it to you
[08:25.480 --> 08:31.600]  Now and that's really the future of radio is the fusion with video and that's why we've been doing it for more than a decade now
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.280]  Okay
[08:33.280 --> 08:36.880]  Let me just go over some of the headlines here for you
[08:37.720 --> 08:39.720]  Let me see
[08:41.120 --> 08:43.200]  This is out of Forbes it says
[08:44.080 --> 08:50.160]  Texas state officials left sore from TSA Pat down and by the way, that's in the TSA training
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.600]  I actually grab your testicles and squeeze them to make sure they're real
[08:53.600 --> 08:59.840]  I have watched them do this to Jesse Ventura, and he turned red and said I'm leaving this country. It's East Germany
[08:59.840 --> 09:03.760]  I can't handle it. I've actually watched them grab his genitals and
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.000]  Squeeze them. Okay, and I'm just thank God it happened to me because I can't put up with okay
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  See, I just failed. I just read one article and I couldn't shut up
[09:11.720 --> 09:15.560]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's over 100 here all just as evil. Okay
[09:16.320 --> 09:23.440]  And multiple of them they were punished. They said your Texas legislators get over here. We're gonna squeeze your private parts
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.200]  Ah sexual assault. Oh boy total federal power grab outs other jurisdictions so many facets
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.060]  Oh, it keeps us safe from terrorism sure it does
[09:32.480 --> 09:34.480]  sacrifice America on the altar of
[09:34.840 --> 09:35.680]  the
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.280]  Perseverating ninning and fetishes over fear of terrorists that are all financed by the globalist. I'm sorry
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.520]  And oh, here's my correction. I have a correction to make I heard and I'm not even gonna attack them
[09:47.520 --> 09:55.440]  Because I know it's how the disinfo works. I heard local talk radio last week announced Rick Perry had added to the special session
[09:55.760 --> 09:57.760]  something I said he wouldn't do
[09:58.160 --> 10:04.360]  To bring the bill back up to ban TSA write downs here in Texas. It's already against the law. I've had
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.400]  Multiple district attorneys on from around the country. It's there's already laws in the books
[10:10.400 --> 10:15.000]  I cop can't come up without a warrant and grab your genitals an FBI agent can't you can't
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.600]  The dog catcher can't a cable or elf can't nobody can but this this new unbonded
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.000]  Goon Force who are now on the streets of America and high school proms
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.960]  and
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.480]  Looking at these reports here, I I heard the report I went and looked it up that morning couldn't find it
[10:34.480 --> 10:37.880]  But I just went with it and I should learn not to trust mainstream media
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.280]  There's they said Rick Perry added it. Well, actually I made some phone calls Friday and today and
[10:43.280 --> 10:49.960]  And discovered that no they're trying to shield Rick Perry the Republican leadership is because this is a big national hot button issue
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.440]  He's getting ready to run for president. I know he promised you he wouldn't that was the guarantee
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.200]  He would I told you a year and a half ago. He was and just wait
[10:56.360 --> 11:00.480]  Don't hold your breath for him not to run because you're you're not gonna be alive
[11:02.600 --> 11:06.320]  No, he's running you better believe it but
[11:07.280 --> 11:09.800]  They said yeah, he he'd added it. No technically
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.000]  Technically the leader of the house Lou and leader of the Senate can read it
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.840]  They've now got way more than the sponsors. They need to pass it. They had a unanimous vote a month ago
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.240]  130 8 to 0 in the house and they had an
[11:23.240 --> 11:24.520]  130 to
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.520]  131 to 1 and we had one
[11:26.520 --> 11:31.280]  Upstanding vote in the Senate and it got killed by Perry through his through his lieutenant governor
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.520]  The doers gotten so much trouble. He quietly slipped it back in but it's only a recommendation
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.640]  so even if it passes the house and Senate Perry before the final vote can kill it and
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.040]  he's not reentered it and
[11:45.480 --> 11:52.280]  The Washington Times is saying editorial Rick Perry versus the TSA and they say help us. You're our only hope
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.360]  And it just goes on and on meanwhile the Texas house members are being put
[11:59.920 --> 12:01.920]  on the rack
[12:01.920 --> 12:07.600]  I'm being literally tortured by TSA and we've got a clip of that newscast coming up. So I've
[12:08.440 --> 12:13.480]  Gonna cover that first when we come back from this break. Let me let me tell you about some of the other news here and
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.640]  Tell me if you hear the hypocrisy here
[12:17.160 --> 12:20.860]  And it's multi-layered because I happen to know the law in all 50 states
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.720]  Because I've had top constitutional lawyers on to break it down. I've looked it up myself
[12:25.040 --> 12:28.840]  It's not illegal to spank your children. But here's news eight out of
[12:28.840 --> 12:35.400]  Corpus Christi, Texas. We're on a great a.m. Station down there. This is out of the CBS news eight
[12:36.320 --> 12:42.000]  Judge has harsh words for mom before sentencing her for spanking her child and
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.000]  It goes on the child was not hurt, but it doesn't matter
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.760]  And then the gen that she's on five years probation for it. Now, let me throw you for a loop here
[12:52.760 --> 12:59.400]  Here's the Texas Tribune from a month ago. House says no to parental consent for spanking
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.120]  That's right
[13:01.120 --> 13:07.400]  They tried to pass a law that parents have to give consent before they can be paddled at public school by a large board
[13:07.400 --> 13:09.880]  I have got plenty of purple bruises from it
[13:09.960 --> 13:15.920]  By the way, probably one of the only reasons I'm still alive was that I was disciplined by my parents and by the public school
[13:15.920 --> 13:21.320]  And they are independent school districts. I thought and that's what the school board wants. That's what you get
[13:21.320 --> 13:25.440]  And they need to be paddled and they need to be run too as well
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.000]  They're in a lunch hour if they're misbehaving or there'll be a bunch of wild animals
[13:30.680 --> 13:36.120]  But don't worry once they get out of school or you'll get tasered and killed in prison. They'll learn about reality
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.960]  But wait a minute. The school can paddle your child
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.640]  But you can't I mean the school can leave you the purple
[13:46.160 --> 13:48.160]  But you can't well
[13:48.160 --> 13:51.880]  There is no law in Texas against spanking your child. You can look up the codes
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.680]  but see there are plenty of judges that put people in jail for things that aren't illegal and
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.800]  If you actually read deeper, this is not really the judges ruling. They tricked the woman
[14:03.400 --> 14:06.720]  into signing on to a plea bargain
[14:07.400 --> 14:12.680]  That's how in Texas and we exposed this now 11 years ago the ASAP program. It was a federal grant
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.200]  They were piloting it for all the state where children?
[14:18.280 --> 14:23.320]  When they when they're late for school three times in a semester were charged with truancy
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.160]  And then parents were called in and the kids were put on probation
[14:26.200 --> 14:30.000]  But it was it was a fur dejudification which puts you on probation for six months
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.200]  then when you make the next mistake you're officially on it and
[14:32.440 --> 14:39.120]  Judge Jean Mir was on the news screaming at them and having them sign documents anybody who knows real law and due process knew that
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.560]  That was a kangaroo fraud that they were inducing through fraud and through ignorance
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.360]  The people to waive the rights and that's how this was done and then they parade these TV
[14:49.960 --> 14:56.200]  Newscast out there the reporters are ignorant and dumb as a box of rocks the parents are ignorant and don't know what's going on and
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.360]  The people perish for lack of knowledge as Christ said or who wants to listen to him though?
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.800]  Let me tell you you got knowledge folks you're you're powerful you got knowledge you become wealthy
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.520]  You know where to invest you got knowledge your family prospers if you don't have knowledge
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.560]  Oh, I know you got knowledge about American Idol and dancing on the stars and
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.200]  Two and a half a man and you got knowledge about your football team, you know all the plays
[15:22.600 --> 15:26.120]  So don't tell me you couldn't learn about your liberties and your freedom
[15:27.920 --> 15:35.040]  See if you knew about your liberties and freedoms and history you know how dangerous it is once government start doing this and where it always leads
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.240]  total tyranny and
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.200]  You'd also know that the not only can the TSA not grab your genitals
[15:41.600 --> 15:48.520]  They can't be operating in your state. It's a federal power grab. It's called the 10th of 9th Amendment
[15:48.520 --> 15:52.720]  Why do we have states if it doesn't exist? You know, don't give me that argument the feds can do whatever they want
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.640]  Why do we have states for you ignoramuses out there that are new listers and think I'm lying to you?
[16:00.840 --> 16:02.840]  In the past two months over
[16:02.840 --> 16:09.480]  2,000 natural disasters have been recorded with the ongoing economic crash millions of Americans can't afford food
[16:09.720 --> 16:14.800]  Also because of the exploding price of fuel many farmers can't afford to plant their crops
[16:14.800 --> 16:18.800]  We must take control of our greatest dependency food folks
[16:18.800 --> 16:25.600]  You can trust e-foods direct the 28-year veteran of long-term storeable foods and they're here to help for a limited time

[19:14.720 --> 19:23.720]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.720]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[19:27.720 --> 19:30.720]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.720]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.720]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors

[20:00.720 --> 20:03.720]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[20:03.720 --> 20:08.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:08.720 --> 20:22.720]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run
[20:22.720 --> 20:27.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[20:27.720 --> 20:35.720]  Thanks for joining us as we defend the land of the free home of the brave
[20:35.720 --> 20:38.720]  Remember, back when that wasn't a joke
[20:38.720 --> 20:44.720]  And the whole world marveled at our private property rights, our family rights, our Second Amendment
[20:44.720 --> 20:50.720]  The great engine of wealth all over the world was our republic
[20:50.720 --> 21:00.720]  Now, I just saw another big university report in the LA Times last week about how we're ranked at the bottom of industrialized countries for freedom
[21:00.720 --> 21:03.720]  And now, ranking behind many third-world nations
[21:03.720 --> 21:05.720]  We are not the land of the free home of the brave
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.720]  There's still some free speech, still some Second Amendment, still some property rights
[21:11.720 --> 21:14.720]  But all of that is being overthrown
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.720]  Let me tell you, when the president can tell you you've got to buy health care
[21:18.720 --> 21:22.720]  As if that isn't unconstitutional, of course it is
[21:22.720 --> 21:27.720]  But then give thousands of companies who are his buddies, waivers
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.720]  Where they don't have to buy it for their employees
[21:29.720 --> 21:34.720]  That is outright hardcore mafia
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.720]  But why not?
[21:36.720 --> 21:37.720]  Why not?
[21:37.720 --> 21:42.720]  If 11 years ago, they could sign a secret deal with the VA, now public for a year
[21:42.720 --> 21:47.720]  To take all the death benefits of World War II troops right through to modern troops
[21:47.720 --> 21:51.720]  That's right, you got out a desert storm, one or two, you died a car wreck
[21:51.720 --> 21:53.720]  Your wife thinks she's getting that insurance check
[21:53.720 --> 21:56.720]  From all that money you put in from your paycheck, you're not getting it
[21:56.720 --> 22:01.720]  The government signed a deal to let the big insurance companies take it
[22:01.720 --> 22:07.720]  You see, people better grow up and realize just how corrupt this government is
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.720]  And they need to grow up and learn who runs the government
[22:11.720 --> 22:19.720]  Foreign, offshore, totally ruthless megabanks that have overthrown hundreds of third-world countries
[22:19.720 --> 22:22.720]  And every time I say that I get emails going, hundreds of countries
[22:22.720 --> 22:26.720]  Yeah, there's over 180 countries in the world
[22:26.720 --> 22:36.720]  And almost every one of them is economically overthrown and raped on average every decade
[22:36.720 --> 22:40.720]  Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, you want me to go on?
[22:40.720 --> 22:45.720]  See, I happen to be an expert on this, you're an expert on football
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.720]  If you're a new listener, you're an expert on volleyball championships coming up
[22:50.720 --> 22:55.720]  You're an expert on the real world
[22:55.720 --> 23:00.720]  And I happen to know what happens in history when people let government get out of control
[23:00.720 --> 23:05.720]  People get hurt, real bad, society and civilization degenerates
[23:05.720 --> 23:10.720]  And in every case, masses of people get killed
[23:10.720 --> 23:13.720]  Giant war start
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.720]  Every thug, every control freak gets a job with the government
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.720]  With the end crowd, raping, robbing and stealing
[23:22.720 --> 23:29.720]  And all the fruits of big government, all the fruits of the Constitution and Bill of Rights
[23:29.720 --> 23:36.720]  Being gone are now manifest, the hedge of protection is gone
[23:36.720 --> 23:45.720]  Number one in education 50 years ago, now ranking behind every industrialized country
[23:45.720 --> 23:48.720]  The longest life expectancy 50 something years ago
[23:48.720 --> 23:51.720]  Now the lowest in the industrialized world, should I keep going?
[23:51.720 --> 23:54.720]  We are becoming a cursed nation
[23:54.720 --> 23:58.720]  And I'm not giving you some Bible speech here, I'm talking about cursed by corruption
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.720]  Cursed by not learning the lessons of history
[24:02.720 --> 24:05.720]  Well, there's three different ways to learn, they say
[24:05.720 --> 24:10.720]  There's by experience, there's by teaching, and there's by revelation
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.720]  It'd be great to have things revelated to us, wouldn't it?
[24:14.720 --> 24:19.720]  One the not, your parents, others try to teach you, you're too smart, you don't listen
[24:19.720 --> 24:23.720]  Founding fathers, let's not listen to those old guys, what do they know?
[24:23.720 --> 24:30.720]  They were just the cutting edge in history and still are, but let's just ignore them
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.720]  You know, guys, if they disagree with each other with a politely get their muskets and go out in the street and have a duel
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.720]  You know, the vice president didn't like Alexander Hamilton trying to sell him out to the British
[24:39.720 --> 24:42.720]  He said, I'll meet you outside, Hamilton said okay
[24:42.720 --> 24:46.720]  And you know what happened to Hamilton, let's not listen to those guys
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.720]  You know, real men, geniuses, but also ready to get into sword fight with you in 10 seconds
[24:51.720 --> 24:54.720]  Could speak Latin, German, you name it, let's just ignore them
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.720]  Let's just not, you know, what they gave us that built all of this
[24:58.720 --> 25:02.720]  Let's just get rid of all that, what do they know?
[25:02.720 --> 25:08.720]  So, most of us never get taught by revelation
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.720]  That's a great blessing
[25:11.720 --> 25:16.720]  Most of us don't get taught by teaching, by instruction, we don't listen
[25:16.720 --> 25:24.720]  We get taught by experience, we get taught by experience
[25:24.720 --> 25:29.720]  That's how we get taught, you know, I had a dog that liked to dig out under the fence and run around in traffic
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.720]  But let me tell you, after he got hit by a car and half his teeth knocked out and his arm paralyzed
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.720]  And I had to get him back to health, helmet
[25:37.720 --> 25:41.720]  Let's tell you, that dog didn't get near roads and was scared of roads after that
[25:41.720 --> 25:48.720]  He didn't listen to me, when I had him on the leash, he was pulling towards the highway
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.720]  But he didn't need to be told anymore once he almost got killed and knocked
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.720]  I'm told by the folks that picked him up and saved him 20 feet off the side of the road
[25:58.720 --> 26:02.720]  He got taught by experience
[26:02.720 --> 26:07.720]  Let me tell you, America, you're going to get taught hardcore by experience
[26:07.720 --> 26:12.720]  You think there's tyranny now, you think you've been overrun, you think we're in depression now
[26:12.720 --> 26:15.720]  Get ready, you haven't seen anything yet
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.720]  History is entering a flux period of rapid acceleration at every level
[26:20.720 --> 26:28.720]  The good and the bad and the ugly, unchained, every private demon of control freaks and government and major corporations turned loose
[26:28.720 --> 26:31.720]  They write the laws now, they control the courts now
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.720]  Evil has now been unleashed and it's just getting started
[26:35.720 --> 26:41.720]  You think Texas state reps having their genitals squeezed and being told this is for punishment?
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.720]  By the TSA, you think, that takes a lot of nerve, well they've been told by daddy fed
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.720]  You punish those people and those guys will do what they're told
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.720]  You think that's scary, you haven't seen anything
[26:54.720 --> 26:57.720]  There's a reason the feds are trying to break the states right now
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.720]  They know the states are one of the only legitimate avenues for peaceful resistance to tyranny
[27:02.720 --> 27:05.720]  The globalists want a shooting war, they want a revolution
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.720]  See, they build up the police state, they tell you it's for foreign terrorists
[27:09.720 --> 27:12.720]  While they put in policies that they know are going to cause resistance
[27:12.720 --> 27:15.720]  And then when you resist having your farmer ranch taken for no reason
[27:15.720 --> 27:20.720]  Or you resist having your children abused and you finally fight back like a red-blooded human
[27:20.720 --> 27:26.720]  They're going to call you a terrorist and use that to build up their force-multiplying system against the general public
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.720]  They don't care if cops and military get killed and all of this, that's part of the plan
[27:31.720 --> 27:38.720]  So police and military and everybody else, you better grow up and stop playing checkers and start playing chess
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.720]  And you better realize history, you better get history real fast, almost should get religion
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.720]  You're not going to get that in the 501c3 government finance controlled churches
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.720]  Where over 100,000 major churches now are publicly on Homeland Security payroll to spy on you
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.720]  Land of the free home of the brave where you go to church to get spied on by the government
[28:00.720 --> 28:07.720]  Oh, I said I'd get to the news, judge has harsh words for mom before sentencing her for spanking her kid
[28:07.720 --> 28:12.720]  Another deceptive headline, but again, when the propaganda is multi-generational
[28:12.720 --> 28:15.720]  This reporter doesn't even know they're putting out this info
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.720]  Because I went and looked up the actual case, they agreed to the plea bargain and then they had the plea bargain sentencing
[28:21.720 --> 28:27.720]  The judge couldn't give her five years probation and all these fines and family court
[28:27.720 --> 28:33.720]  For something that is not illegal in Texas, the girl was not hurt by the way she was out of control
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.720]  And if you doubt me, House says no to parental consent for spanking
[28:37.720 --> 28:42.720]  They can beat your kid in a government school with a big old board when they're acting like demons
[28:42.720 --> 28:45.720]  But you can't spank him
[28:45.720 --> 28:48.720]  The reason the school can spank your child is the same reason you can't
[28:48.720 --> 28:50.720]  Because it's not illegal
[28:50.720 --> 28:53.720]  You give applied consent when you put him in that school
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.720]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen with the TSA and then World War 3
[29:00.720 --> 29:05.720]  In the past two months, over 2,000 natural disasters have been recorded
[29:05.720 --> 29:09.720]  With the ongoing economic crash, millions of Americans can't afford food
[29:09.720 --> 29:14.720]  Also, because of the exploding price of fuel, many farmers can't afford to plant their crops
[29:14.720 --> 29:18.720]  We must take control of our greatest dependency, food
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.720]  Folks, you can trust EatFoodsDirect, the 28-year veteran of long-term storeable foods

[30:11.720 --> 30:14.720]  By breathing the solution through the lungs
[30:14.720 --> 30:18.720]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[30:18.720 --> 30:25.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[30:25.720 --> 30:30.720]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[30:30.720 --> 30:34.720]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.720]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator

[31:00.720 --> 31:04.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[31:04.720 --> 31:07.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[31:07.720 --> 31:12.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[31:12.720 --> 31:16.720]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[31:16.720 --> 31:18.720]  And they really are calling the shots
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[31:23.720 --> 31:27.720]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[31:27.720 --> 31:31.720]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[31:31.720 --> 31:34.720]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[31:34.720 --> 31:38.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and the arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[31:38.720 --> 31:40.720]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[31:40.720 --> 31:42.720]  Today seems like nobody does care
[31:42.720 --> 31:47.720]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic

[31:59.720 --> 32:03.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[32:03.720 --> 32:08.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.720]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[32:13.720 --> 32:19.720]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[32:19.720 --> 32:23.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:23.720 --> 32:27.720]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[32:31.720 --> 32:35.720]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[32:35.720 --> 32:40.720]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[32:40.720 --> 32:43.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science

[33:01.720 --> 33:04.720]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[33:04.720 --> 33:26.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:26.720 --> 33:31.720]  Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm central, right here on the GCN Radio Network
[33:31.720 --> 33:34.720]  Sunday's 4-6pm, thank you for joining us
[33:34.720 --> 33:37.720]  Alright, I've got to get to our top news, and that's World War III
[33:37.720 --> 33:41.720]  Am I talking about your daddy's World War III, or your mama, or your grandpappies
[33:41.720 --> 33:44.720]  Where you think a war with the Russians is a nuclear war
[33:44.720 --> 33:48.720]  I want to give you the actual definition, or definitions, they vary only slightly
[33:48.720 --> 33:51.720]  of what a World War is
[33:51.720 --> 33:54.720]  And then you can argue what number this really is
[33:54.720 --> 33:57.720]  The Pentagon is calling this internally World War IV
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.720]  And I tend to agree with them a bit that the Cold War was World War III by the definition
[34:03.720 --> 34:07.720]  But the public doesn't know that happens, so I got to call it World War III
[34:07.720 --> 34:10.720]  And that comes down to communication
[34:10.720 --> 34:17.720]  Now, I've already covered some of the police state news dealing with our children
[34:17.720 --> 34:20.720]  But here's another one, and I see these every week now
[34:20.720 --> 34:24.720]  In Washington State, California, Wisconsin
[34:24.720 --> 34:33.720]  This one's in Massachusetts, and it's U.S. Open Kids
[34:33.720 --> 34:36.720]  That's the name of a group of kids trying, the organization's U.S. Open Kids
[34:36.720 --> 34:40.720]  Trying to raise money for cancer, 100% of the money is given to cancer research
[34:40.720 --> 34:43.720]  Fine for operating lemonade stand to fight cancer
[34:43.720 --> 34:50.720]  They were fined $500 apiece for running a corner lemonade stand for cancer
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.720]  Research, I'm sorry
[34:54.720 --> 34:57.720]  You got to train them to be good little slaves
[34:57.720 --> 35:01.720]  While Wacovia and its parent Wells Fargo got caught laundering
[35:01.720 --> 35:07.720]  $306 billion in narcotics money and owning and leasing and running the aircraft with the drugs on board
[35:07.720 --> 35:11.720]  They got, of course, in no trouble, because they run this country
[35:11.720 --> 35:15.720]  But your child gets caught anywhere in America running a lemonade stand
[35:15.720 --> 35:22.720]  They're going after their fine and girl scouts now claiming they got to have a license to go door to door
[35:22.720 --> 35:28.720]  You know, that's always the big tell-tale sign of a tyranny
[35:28.720 --> 35:31.720]  Is that it's targets the general law-abiding good people
[35:31.720 --> 35:35.720]  Because we're seeing as milk cows or hogs to slaughter
[35:35.720 --> 35:40.720]  Okay, some other news before I finish up with the T.S. saying they get into the World War III news
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.720]  Remember this a few months ago, I just thought I'd mention this because you've heard of it
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.720]  It got some attention, Tom Tom, that's one of the GPS units
[35:49.720 --> 35:52.720]  Sorry for selling drivers data to police
[35:52.720 --> 36:00.720]  They're real sorry that without a warrant they sold all of their customers data to the police
[36:00.720 --> 36:08.720]  You got to wonder why you can buy things at cost because there's hidden money involved
[36:08.720 --> 36:12.720]  Of course, you remember that Financial Times of London, that was back in April, three, four months ago
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.720]  I only mentioned that because there's a couple new articles today
[36:16.720 --> 36:23.720]  Here's one, Harold's Son, Apple Patent will stop you filming concerts, sports events on iPhone
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.720]  And they say they're going to put up these infrared towers everywhere
[36:27.720 --> 36:34.720]  That pick up when your cell phone is filming any live event, it doesn't matter if it's a public symphony
[36:34.720 --> 36:38.720]  Down at Zilker Park in Austin where there's nothing against filming
[36:38.720 --> 36:42.720]  You're all just treated as evil and it switches your phone off
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.720]  Contacts Apple and they switch your phone off and you think well, that's not a big deal
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.720]  Here's what you'd understand, Google which is an admitted NSA CIA creation
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.720]  It's on record, government funded it and founded it in QTEL
[36:58.720 --> 37:05.720]  Which is the CIA public venture firm that funds new technologies so they control it
[37:05.720 --> 37:13.720]  DARPA created the internet, the Pentagon created the internet in case you kids believe Al Gore did it in 1996
[37:13.720 --> 37:23.720]  But continuing here with this news, Google admits in its specs and press releases to other industries
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.720]  And we've covered this written at Nauseum Articles that for now six years
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.720]  That all the cameras and microphones Google dials in without asking you
[37:32.720 --> 37:34.720]  And listens and tracks everything you're doing
[37:34.720 --> 37:37.720]  Just like in public schools in California and Pennsylvania
[37:37.720 --> 37:41.720]  They admit hey we're watching your kids at home in the shower
[37:41.720 --> 37:44.720]  If the laptop's aimed at it in the bed and we're proud of it
[37:44.720 --> 37:48.720]  It's just the coming out in the open, hey we're going to squeeze your genitals at the airport
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.720]  Hey we're watching you at home over the laptop
[37:50.720 --> 37:53.720]  Hey we're tracking what you watch and what you do over your phone
[37:53.720 --> 38:02.720]  See the 21st century tyranny is about the big telecommunications companies
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.720]  Four or five mega tech companies, they all meet, they all collude
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.720]  They all decide on global standards and back doors are built into everything on record
[38:11.720 --> 38:13.720]  And everything's surveilled without warrants
[38:13.720 --> 38:16.720]  I remember USA Today eight years ago admitting
[38:16.720 --> 38:20.720]  And I've been told this by an executive, a former executive at a pizza company
[38:20.720 --> 38:24.720]  But I confirm at the big three and this was seven, eight, nine years ago
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.720]  I forget you can pull up USA Today on it, headline scoff laws caught while ordering pizza
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.720]  That when you order a pizza and they get 25% of any fines
[38:34.720 --> 38:36.720]  They get a base fee for doing it
[38:36.720 --> 38:42.720]  Your live location and your name is fed through a database to the police
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.720]  And they got face scanning cameras and license plate readers
[38:46.720 --> 38:50.720]  But none of that for the illegal aliens though because they're a precious part of driving down the wages
[38:50.720 --> 38:57.720]  Continuing here, here's another one from Networking News from ZDNet
[38:57.720 --> 39:00.720]  No privacy on Amazon's cloud drive
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.720]  And they tell you in the contract, as the Google contract tells you as well
[39:04.720 --> 39:07.720]  They all tell you but you don't read that 40 page thing do you
[39:07.720 --> 39:13.720]  They tell you in the subsection at 5.2 that they will use your files
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.720]  They own your files, anyone they want they will give your files to
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.720]  So, oh, they found the USA Today, good job, let's see, I said eight years ago
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.720]  Let's see if I'm wrong, 2004, 2007, seven years ago
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.720]  See my memory fails, 4.2704, Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery database
[39:33.720 --> 39:37.720]  That was one article about a company in Dallas with three companies
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.720]  And how the police in Missouri were using it, or Missouri
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.720]  But if you read deeper it's the whole country, so I thought I'd tell you about that
[39:46.720 --> 39:49.720]  Because you know, I'm that paranoid guy saying they're listening to you
[39:49.720 --> 39:52.720]  And then you say, hey, what do I have to hide?
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.720]  Well, it's not that the founding fathers didn't have anything to hide
[39:56.720 --> 39:58.720]  They knew when government starts spying on you
[39:58.720 --> 40:03.720]  It's so they can shut down their competition and control you and rob you and get away with doing bad things
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.720]  Do you see, it shouldn't be what do I have to hide, it's what does the government
[40:08.720 --> 40:13.720]  You know, I was years ago reading in history about it
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.720]  But also my mom was telling me about it, she's reading The Devil's Disciples
[40:17.720 --> 40:19.720]  Big thick tome on the Nazis
[40:19.720 --> 40:24.720]  And it was about how Hermann Göring had the first systems to spy on everybody, live time
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.720]  The FBI in the 30s had it where they would have the operators all on payroll listening into your conversations
[40:29.720 --> 40:32.720]  When they could, or watching certain phone numbers at the switchboard
[40:32.720 --> 40:40.720]  No, no, no, no, no, no, how, how Hermann Göring was busy spying on the Nazis themselves
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.720]  To be able to blackmail them and stuff
[40:42.720 --> 40:49.720]  See, when private corporations like Google and Yahoo and Microsoft are spying on everybody
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.720]  As it's come out in the US and in Europe, then they can be blackmailed
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.720]  That information can be handed off to client groups and hey, minister, we know about your mistress
[40:59.720 --> 41:01.720]  You're going to vote the way we want
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.720]  By the way, we'll give you some more contracts for your private business
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.720]  Either we give you money, a carrot, for selling out your people
[41:10.720 --> 41:14.720]  Or we release the fact that you've got a male or female mistress
[41:14.720 --> 41:17.720]  Now, what is it going to be?
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.720]  You see, and then the minister or the governor, in the case of New York, says
[41:22.720 --> 41:24.720]  We'll all blow the whistle on you
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.720]  They say, we've got everybody, you're not going to blow the whistle on anybody
[41:28.720 --> 41:32.720]  And if you give us a problem, we'll crack you over the head and put you in solitary confinement
[41:32.720 --> 41:36.720]  See, what happens in a society when everything gets to that point?
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.720]  You get a Soviet Russia, you get a Malish China, you get a Nazi Germany
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.720]  See, folks, a lot of people, good ol' boys think corruption is cute, I talked to a lot of them
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.720]  That are quasi successful, make a few hundred thousand, or even a million a year, billionaires, people like that
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.720]  I know a lot of them
[41:54.720 --> 41:56.720]  And they feel like they're part of the establishment
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.720]  And they say, well, I'm going to be okay, and yeah, there's some corruption, that's the way it's always been
[42:02.720 --> 42:05.720]  Well, that's true, there's always been corruption
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.720]  And when you decide to roll the red carpet out for it, why, it just goes hog wild
[42:10.720 --> 42:12.720]  And that's now what's happened
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.720]  America has cancer
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.720]  And I'll get into the financial news next hour and some of your calls, I want to get into the TSA right now
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.720]  And then into the World War III situation, not on the horizon, but now right down the street
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.720]  But before we do that, you know what, I think a video tells a thousand words
[42:29.720 --> 42:34.720]  This is a local Austin news station when we come back, we're going to play a short clip of
[42:34.720 --> 42:41.720]  Because you hear me saying that the state reps were told you're being punished in TSA, grab their gendals and squeeze them
[42:41.720 --> 42:46.720]  But that's standard, I mean, that's when they had Jesse Ventura when I was flying with him cornered
[42:46.720 --> 42:51.720]  It was like a big celebration, they were all smiling, it was about their personal power in life
[42:51.720 --> 42:55.720]  They don't get big paychecks or houses, but they're the types that just like to have power over people
[42:55.720 --> 42:58.720]  And it was a feast when they grabbed his gendals
[42:58.720 --> 43:05.720]  In the past two months, over 2,000 natural disasters have been recorded
[43:05.720 --> 43:09.720]  With the ongoing economic crash, millions of Americans can't afford food
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.720]  Also, because of the exploding price of fuel, many farmers can't afford to plant their crops
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.720]  We must take control of our greatest dependency, food

[44:11.720 --> 44:17.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.720]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps

[47:54.720 --> 47:57.720]  Is 1776
[47:59.720 --> 48:02.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.720]  Yeah!
[48:06.720 --> 48:09.720]  Let's get some spirit going here
[48:09.720 --> 48:11.720]  Now you want to talk about pathetic
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.720]  The Washington Times
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.720]  www.lurockwell.com
[48:15.720 --> 48:17.720]  Literally hundreds
[48:17.720 --> 48:20.720]  Search TSA Rick Perry in a search engine right now
[48:20.720 --> 48:24.720]  Hundreds of mainstream and alternative media
[48:24.720 --> 48:26.720]  Are begging Rick Perry to save them
[48:26.720 --> 48:30.720]  There's headlines like, Rick Perry is our only hope
[48:30.720 --> 48:32.720]  It's like Princess Leah is saying
[48:32.720 --> 48:34.720]  Help me Obi-Wan, you're my only hope
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.720]  And General Kenobi is no Kenobi
[48:38.720 --> 48:40.720]  He's general fake conservative
[48:40.720 --> 48:42.720]  Make girls take a deadly Gardasil
[48:42.720 --> 48:44.720]  That immediately kills him
[48:44.720 --> 48:46.720]  Nap the superhighways
[48:46.720 --> 48:48.720]  But it doesn't matter
[48:48.720 --> 48:50.720]  He wears a cowboy hat and has a West Texas accent
[48:50.720 --> 48:52.720]  And I got to give him this
[48:52.720 --> 48:54.720]  He is from Texas, not like Bush
[48:54.720 --> 48:56.720]  Nothing against you if you're from Maine
[48:56.720 --> 48:58.720]  But I'm not going to move to Maine
[48:58.720 --> 49:01.720]  I'm from Maine and put on a Maine accent
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.720]  But Rick Perry is as phony as a $3 bill
[49:05.720 --> 49:09.720]  But he's got nice hair
[49:09.720 --> 49:11.720]  Like Schwarzenegger
[49:11.720 --> 49:13.720]  And so he'll probably be the next president
[49:13.720 --> 49:15.720]  And I had this from a high level
[49:15.720 --> 49:17.720]  Fox News executive
[49:17.720 --> 49:19.720]  I had it from a Fox News host
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.720]  And I got it from Texas sources here in Austin
[49:22.720 --> 49:26.720]  And we've got all this inside stuff on Rick Perry
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.720]  Going back a year and a half ago
[49:28.720 --> 49:30.720]  Well, actually three and a half years ago
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.720]  My film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.720]  He went to Bilderberg, we covered it
[49:34.720 --> 49:36.720]  We predicted he'd run for president
[49:36.720 --> 49:38.720]  In the film, when did we predict?
[49:38.720 --> 49:41.720]  2012, right again, sorry
[49:41.720 --> 49:43.720]  Look, when you live in reality
[49:43.720 --> 49:46.720]  You know what plays coming next
[49:46.720 --> 49:48.720]  And I wish Rick Perry was real
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.720]  And I heard local news announced earlier last week
[49:51.720 --> 49:53.720]  That he was going to add it to special session
[49:53.720 --> 49:55.720]  But it turns out he hasn't added it
[49:55.720 --> 49:57.720]  So there's all these editorials begging him
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.720]  To enforce already existing laws
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.720]  And to let Texas pass a law telling TSA
[50:02.720 --> 50:04.720]  You gotta have probable cause
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.720]  And even then you can't grab genitals
[50:06.720 --> 50:08.720]  And Rick Perry's not added it
[50:08.720 --> 50:10.720]  So all these state reps I've had on
[50:10.720 --> 50:12.720]  And state senators, they're going
[50:12.720 --> 50:14.720]  Well, the governor means well, I've had him on
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.720]  Oh, oh, the governor means well
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.720]  He'll probably add it
[50:20.720 --> 50:22.720]  Well, technically we've introduced it
[50:22.720 --> 50:24.720]  We can pass it now and we're hoping he will
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.720]  And then the governor's gone as far
[50:27.720 --> 50:29.720]  To try to put out this info that he's added it
[50:29.720 --> 50:32.720]  He has not added the TSA anti-grubbing bill
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.720]  Again, the FBI can't stick their hands down your pants
[50:36.720 --> 50:38.720]  But the TSA says they can
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.720]  And by the way, I've talked to a lot of TSA people
[50:40.720 --> 50:43.720]  I do bash them a lot because of their overall direction
[50:43.720 --> 50:46.720]  Their power grab, their gentlement, states' rights violation
[50:46.720 --> 50:48.720]  But every time I fly out in Austin, other places
[50:48.720 --> 50:50.720]  They're shaking my hand, they're saying we don't like it
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.720]  They come out of line to tell me, hey look
[50:52.720 --> 50:55.720]  We're told to do this
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.720]  And it's always the second or third TSA agent
[50:57.720 --> 50:59.720]  That comes over, you know, once you say
[50:59.720 --> 51:01.720]  I don't want to be microwave oven, I don't want to be grubbed
[51:01.720 --> 51:04.720]  It's the boss that likes it who comes over
[51:04.720 --> 51:07.720]  And gets in your face, it's the administrator
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.720]  So I have to say, as much as I yell and scream at the TSA
[51:11.720 --> 51:13.720]  And they are guilty of following orders
[51:13.720 --> 51:16.720]  Just like the Nazis were at Nuremberg
[51:16.720 --> 51:19.720]  I'm not saying they're bad people individually, all of them
[51:19.720 --> 51:23.720]  But here is the newscast, a piece of it
[51:23.720 --> 51:26.720]  News 7, Fox in Austin did a good job reporting on this
[51:26.720 --> 51:29.720]  The full video is linked up on infowars.com
[51:29.720 --> 51:32.720]  And prisonplanet.com, but this is News 7, Fox
[51:32.720 --> 51:35.720]  Here in Austin, we wrote an article about it
[51:35.720 --> 51:37.720]  That widely linked out there
[51:37.720 --> 51:40.720]  And here it is
[51:40.720 --> 51:42.720]  In fact, let me just give you the Forbes headline
[51:42.720 --> 51:45.720]  After we reported on it, Forbes, AP, they all reported on it
[51:45.720 --> 51:49.720]  Quote of the day, after Texas state official left
[51:49.720 --> 51:53.720]  Soar from a TSA patdown, and Ron Paul has been on this show
[51:53.720 --> 51:57.720]  He says it's humiliating, it's disgusting, and it doesn't feel well
[51:57.720 --> 51:59.720]  You've all seen the photos and video
[51:59.720 --> 52:02.720]  I mean, they go up between the legs of men
[52:02.720 --> 52:05.720]  And they actually check to see what it is
[52:05.720 --> 52:09.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes that's a little freaky when the wife does
[52:09.720 --> 52:12.720]  I mean, you know, I hate to get graphic here
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.720]  But that's a very, that's a very
[52:17.720 --> 52:21.720]  Exciting thing when you're into it
[52:21.720 --> 52:25.720]  But it's when it's your wife, or the case of women, your husband
[52:25.720 --> 52:27.720]  But this is people you don't know
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.720]  Think about how far we've come, how far we've fallen
[52:31.720 --> 52:33.720]  That I have to even get on air
[52:33.720 --> 52:35.720]  I mean, five, six years ago, I would have thought
[52:35.720 --> 52:39.720]  That I was in a parallel universe of satire
[52:39.720 --> 52:42.720]  And absurdism, if I was going to be on air
[52:42.720 --> 52:44.720]  If somebody five years ago would have said
[52:44.720 --> 52:48.720]  You're going to be on air talking about the TSA on the streets of America
[52:48.720 --> 52:51.720]  And at high school proms and sticking their hands in people's pants
[52:51.720 --> 52:53.720]  Oh, I forgot, a year ago it was on the outside
[52:53.720 --> 52:54.720]  Now it's in the pants
[52:54.720 --> 52:58.720]  Miss America, former Miss America, in Dallas crying
[52:58.720 --> 53:01.720]  They went in her pants and went in to check
[53:01.720 --> 53:03.720]  And let me see, there's something there
[53:03.720 --> 53:06.720]  Let me check that with some dirty glove
[53:06.720 --> 53:10.720]  That had searched a hundred plus people into her body
[53:12.720 --> 53:15.720]  And now, and I've sat there with Jesse Ventura
[53:15.720 --> 53:16.720]  With her patting down and smiling
[53:16.720 --> 53:17.720]  They know he's a celebrity
[53:17.720 --> 53:19.720]  They know he's not an L CIA terrorist
[53:19.720 --> 53:21.720]  And then they go up between the legs
[53:21.720 --> 53:23.720]  And you can read his lawsuit of what they've done
[53:23.720 --> 53:26.720]  And they grab, and then they squeeze
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.720]  It's like getting fruit at this grocery store
[53:28.720 --> 53:29.720]  To make sure it's not rotten
[53:29.720 --> 53:32.720]  Let me see if that feels like what it should
[53:32.720 --> 53:36.720]  This is what America has turned into
[53:36.720 --> 53:37.720]  Now here's a clip
[53:37.720 --> 53:40.720]  The whole newscast is up on the local Fox station site
[53:40.720 --> 53:44.720]  But here's a clip of what happened to Texas legislators
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.720]  When they were out of state
[53:46.720 --> 53:48.720]  And they were targeted and quote punished
[53:48.720 --> 53:49.720]  Here it is
[53:49.720 --> 53:50.720]  State officials are speaking out tonight
[53:50.720 --> 53:52.720]  About their uncomfortable experiences
[53:52.720 --> 53:53.720]  At the airport recently
[53:53.720 --> 53:56.720]  Some are claiming TSA agents went as far as
[53:56.720 --> 53:58.720]  Leaving them sore in private areas
[53:58.720 --> 54:02.720]  Fox 7 School Williams joins us live from the newsroom with the story
[54:02.720 --> 54:05.720]  Loreanna, remember the bill that would limit TSA searches
[54:05.720 --> 54:06.720]  At the airport?
[54:06.720 --> 54:09.720]  Well, it's been reincarnated in special session
[54:09.720 --> 54:12.720]  And we've all seen these videos right here on YouTube
[54:12.720 --> 54:14.720]  Of people claiming that TSA agents
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.720]  Have inappropriately touched them
[54:16.720 --> 54:19.720]  Well, now, top Texas officials are claiming
[54:19.720 --> 54:21.720]  That they've been left humiliated
[54:21.720 --> 54:23.720]  And even left sore
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.720]  Let me put this delicately
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.720]  I was still feeling the effects of the pat down
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.720]  As I sat in my seat from New Orleans to Houston
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.720]  And then Houston to Austin
[54:38.720 --> 54:42.720]  Barry Smitherman, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas
[54:42.720 --> 54:45.720]  Was heading back home to Austin from New Orleans
[54:45.720 --> 54:47.720]  When he says he was ushered to the body scanner
[54:47.720 --> 54:49.720]  He told the TSA agent
[54:49.720 --> 54:51.720]  He'd rather go through the metal detector
[54:51.720 --> 54:53.720]  He said, but you don't have that choice
[54:53.720 --> 54:56.720]  And I said, okay, I'm opting out
[54:56.720 --> 54:59.720]  Those are the key words, right?
[54:59.720 --> 55:02.720]  So the TSA agent goes, opt out, opt out
[55:02.720 --> 55:04.720]  We got it opt out
[55:04.720 --> 55:08.720]  You know, calling everyone's attention to me
[55:08.720 --> 55:12.720]  Smitherman says it took roughly 40 minutes for the TSA agents
[55:12.720 --> 55:15.720]  To search through his carry-on bag piece by piece
[55:15.720 --> 55:17.720]  And to give him a thorough pat down
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.720]  That he says was completely inappropriate
[55:21.720 --> 55:24.720]  And finally I said, you're punishing me
[55:24.720 --> 55:27.720]  For opting out, aren't you?
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.720]  And to her credit, she said, yes, we are
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.720]  State Representative Barbara Nash says she was upset
[55:34.720 --> 55:36.720]  After she was pulled aside for a pat down
[55:36.720 --> 55:39.720]  She went, made me move my legs apart
[55:39.720 --> 55:42.720]  And she fell down my legs and up, all the way up
[55:42.720 --> 55:44.720]  And then she made me stand a little bit
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.720]  Let's stop right there. This may have been on Fox News
[55:48.720 --> 55:50.720]  I can't even air what comes next
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.720]  I mean, I can't even air this
[55:52.720 --> 55:55.720]  I'm not comfortable because FCC harasses talk radio
[55:55.720 --> 55:58.720]  And not TV to even air this, okay?
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.720]  Now, let me explain something to you
[56:00.720 --> 56:04.720]  I have laser-beamed with my eyes Jesse Ventura
[56:04.720 --> 56:08.720]  With someone's hands between his legs squeezing him
[56:08.720 --> 56:10.720]  And that's how they all describe it
[56:10.720 --> 56:13.720]  Back in November when Drudge Report took our reports
[56:13.720 --> 56:15.720]  And sent them out nationwide, worldwide
[56:15.720 --> 56:18.720]  Number one website in the world, news site
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.720]  And I had witnesses, I had video
[56:21.720 --> 56:24.720]  And people couldn't believe that they were going in the pants
[56:24.720 --> 56:27.720]  Much less on the outside. Now it's admitted
[56:27.720 --> 56:29.720]  And that's how it's described
[56:29.720 --> 56:32.720]  They almost lift you off the ground
[56:32.720 --> 56:35.720]  They almost lift you off the ground
[56:35.720 --> 56:38.720]  I mean, they go in there and then they go, let me check
[56:38.720 --> 56:43.720]  Now again, let's say Al Qaeda's real, terrorism's real
[56:43.720 --> 56:46.720]  You got a better chance of being stung by a honeybee than dying
[56:46.720 --> 56:48.720]  I want to face the danger
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.720]  And then expanding, who are these people that want to do this?
[56:52.720 --> 56:55.720]  Who are these people that want to do this to us?
[56:55.720 --> 56:57.720]  What type of folks would they hire to do that?
[56:57.720 --> 56:59.720]  And then you get the federal documents
[56:59.720 --> 57:01.720]  The National Security Force, Obama's talked about
[57:01.720 --> 57:03.720]  And then you learn
[57:03.720 --> 57:06.720]  They have now admitted the TSA, as I told you many years ago
[57:06.720 --> 57:08.720]  Used to be nationwide everywhere
[57:08.720 --> 57:11.720]  They're building an army of people
[57:11.720 --> 57:13.720]  Who will follow any order they're told
[57:13.720 --> 57:15.720]  Who will do anything they're told
[57:15.720 --> 57:19.720]  Now I haven't gotten into, again, the World War III news
[57:19.720 --> 57:22.720]  And the banking news, the financial news
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.720]  What this tiny leader doing
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.720]  And why all over the world they've got TSA-styled goons
[57:27.720 --> 57:29.720]  Doing the same thing
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.720]  They're training you all to be prisoners
[57:31.720 --> 57:34.720]  They're training you all that you have no rights
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.720]  They're attempting to break your will
[57:36.720 --> 57:38.720]  Spread the word about the live transmission
[57:38.720 --> 57:40.720]  We'll be back after the news
[57:40.720 --> 57:42.720]  Hour number two, straight ahead
[57:42.720 --> 57:44.720]  Learn more at m4wars.com
[57:44.720 --> 57:46.720]  and prismplanet.tv
[57:51.720 --> 57:53.720]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones
[57:53.720 --> 57:56.720]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings
[57:56.720 --> 57:58.720]  Opportunity and recognized risk
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.720]  Saving means to make money
[58:00.720 --> 58:03.720]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[58:03.720 --> 58:05.720]  And give you good old fashioned real soaps
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.720]  That are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now
[58:09.720 --> 58:12.720]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[58:12.720 --> 58:14.720]  That contain no useless dyes
[58:14.720 --> 58:16.720]  Perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.720]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[58:20.720 --> 58:22.720]  That give you rashes, itching sores
[58:22.720 --> 58:24.720]  And deteriorating clothing called lint
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.720]  If you want something better
[58:26.720 --> 58:28.720]  If you want something you've never had before
[58:28.720 --> 58:30.720]  You have to do something you've never done before
[58:30.720 --> 58:32.720]  Getting a free catalog is easy
[58:32.720 --> 58:35.720]  We're calling 800-340-7091
[58:35.720 --> 58:38.720]  Or see Calben on the web at 5starsope.com
[58:38.720 --> 58:40.720]  Take charge of your health now
[58:40.720 --> 58:43.720]  By calling 800-340-7091
[58:43.720 --> 58:47.720]  Or see Calben on the web at 5starsope.com
[58:51.720 --> 58:55.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[58:55.720 --> 58:58.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[58:58.720 --> 59:03.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[59:03.720 --> 59:07.720]  I've determined members' influence on our president in Congress
[59:07.720 --> 59:09.720]  And they really are calling the shots
[59:09.720 --> 59:14.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[59:14.720 --> 59:17.720]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[59:17.720 --> 59:22.720]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[59:22.720 --> 59:24.720]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[59:24.720 --> 59:27.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[59:27.720 --> 59:29.720]  They're asking for more matches
[59:29.720 --> 59:31.720]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.720]  Today seems like nobody does care
[59:33.720 --> 59:38.720]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic
[59:38.720 --> 59:43.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[59:43.720 --> 59:58.720]  Or watch it online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:29.720]  All right, I'm going to give the toll-free number out here
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.720]  For folks to join us
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.720]  If they want to get involved in this live Sunday edition
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:42.720]  The number is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.720]  And no one said I'd get to calls on this Sunday edition
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.720]  And I do want to get to your calls
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.720]  It's just that we've been covering all of the news
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.720]  And there's some good news, too, coming up
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.720]  Head of ATF is likely to go
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:03.720]  That means the Wall Street Journal reports go as leaving the post
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.720]  How about head of ATF is likely to go to jail?
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720]  Because there was justice in this country
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.720]  That's where they'd go
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.720]  You see, Congressman Issa last week I'm afraid
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.720]  Released their internal memorandums that he'd gotten
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.720]  Through his congressional power
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.720]  There's subpoenas that ATF knowingly shipped the guns to Mexico
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.720]  As we told you over a year ago
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.720]  To try to demonize the Second Amendment
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.720]  And they had the ATF lied in testimony
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.720]  And said that they did not know this was going on
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720]  They were running the whole operation
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.720]  How about head of ATF is likely to go to jail
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.720]  Instead of likely to go?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.720]  You know, if I lie to the feds in a federal investigation
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.720]  A lot of times, like Martha Stewart and others
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.720]  They didn't do anything wrong really at the end of the day
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720]  But they lied in the process
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.720]  Because they didn't want to be messed with
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720]  And so they go to jail for the lying
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.720]  How about this dirtbag involved in a system
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.720]  That helps ship thousands of guns to Mexico
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.720]  To then trace them to crime in Mexico and the U.S.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.720]  How about he goes to jail?
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.720]  How about that message is sent to government
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.720]  That when you commit crimes, you're going to prison!
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.720]  How about you get some of your own medicine?
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  All right
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720]  I got other rants too
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  A lot of them are so complex
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.720]  It's not that you can't handle complex information
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.720]  You love it
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  But I don't have time to cover every angle
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.720]  Because I don't want to come out and say I'm for profiling
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.720]  Because I'm not
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.720]  On racial reasons
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.720]  I'm against it
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.720]  But anti-crime, true peace officer
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  Investigative behavior
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.720]  Is all about profiling
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.720]  That's what it is
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  If you're looking for smugglers
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.720]  You look for suspicious people driving large vehicles
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.720]  Who are giving off signs of being nervous
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.720]  That's not probable cause yet
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.720]  But you run the license plate
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720]  If it's in a database of known smugglers
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  Now maybe you got probable cause
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:31.720]  But they're going after the TSA
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.720]  In Newark, and I've flown through Newark a lot
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  It's one of the least bad ones from my experience
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]  JFK is hellish
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  They rob your luggage there
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]  At least in my experience
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  They've been caught actually doing it
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.720]  But I've been robbed by TSA and JFK
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  They're in New York City
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.720]  So I try to avoid those highway robbers
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.720]  Highwaymen
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720]  Or let me be politically correct
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.720]  Highwaypersons
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.720]  I try to avoid those highwaypersons
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.720]  They're not politically correct
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  Now at JFK
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.720]  But see what they don't point out here
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  Is that it's this weird globalist fake liberal right system
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.720]  Where, oh don't worry we don't profile
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  So all of you will have your genitals grabbed
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  Well how about in profiling
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.720]  If you don't have probable cause
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.720]  You don't grab anybody's genitals
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.720]  But if you do have probable cause
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.720]  Then you do a search
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  If you catch them
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720]  Then they end up going to jail
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720]  Then there's a search
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720]  Not we're all prisoners here
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.720]  In a makeshift jail induction center
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720]  But see they sound like
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.720]  Don't worry we're going to protect your rights
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720]  Every single one of you
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.720]  Is going to be groped and radiated
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]  How's that sound?
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720]  Don't worry we're not going to search
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]  Latin Americans
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720]  Who aren't citizens
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.720]  Who statistically are the ones carrying in drugs
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720]  Let's not use that probable cause
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.720]  I don't think it meets the standard
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  But it's a shadow of it
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]  Let's go after the TSA
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  Ever trying to actually use their brain
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.720]  In the past two months
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.720]  Over 2,000 natural disasters have been recorded
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720]  With the ongoing economic crash
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.720]  Millions of Americans can't afford food
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720]  Also because of the exploding price of fuel
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  Many farmers can't afford to plant their crops
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.720]  We must take control of our greatest dependency
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]  Food
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.720]  Folks you can trust Eat Foods Direct

[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.720]  On the GCN Radio Network
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.720]  Okay! So we're back live now
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.920]  live now into hour number two. Let me give you the phone number here so I can start taking
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.120]  your calls coming up in the next segment. The toll-free number to join us on any of
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:30.000]  the issues I've discussed. This again is extremist radio. I'm extreme. I think Texas state reps
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.440]  having their genitals roughly squeezed and then tortured because they knew they were
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:40.680]  state reps and weren't submitting to tyranny. I think that's wrong. I'm an extremist. I
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.360]  think taking the military's death benefits on record is wrong. I'm an extremist. I think
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:52.160]  the U.S. government launching five undeclared wars is dangerous. I'm an extremist. I think
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.240]  the CIA caught over and over again and Congress had hearings in 97 and confirmed it. Shipping
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.800]  in the majority of heroin and cocaine is dangerous and horrible and I'd like to decriminalize
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.320]  drugs. That means you sell them across the counter but you decriminalize them and take
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.720]  the profit out. Every study and countries that have done it shows it reduces crime by
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.760]  around 80 percent. But again, I'm an extremist. I mean, let's not listen to an extremist,
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:23.080]  okay? Yeah, I've got news how YouTube is censoring people. By the way, I haven't even
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:31.920]  gotten into that. I haven't even gotten into our own censorship here. Now, I do have the
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.960]  parent company Google of YouTube admittedly working for the federal government and spying
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.640]  on people through the cameras and microphones in your computer. Oh, they now publicly are
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:46.440]  admitting something that was only in their perspective put out to shareholders five
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.280]  years ago that they are watching you in live time. But don't worry, a computer is doing
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.840]  it so it's okay. And then sending reports back or that Tom Tom is tracking everywhere
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.560]  you go and giving it to the police without a warrant or Apple is going to track what
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:07.560]  you videotape with your camera on your smart mini computer known as a phone. Because I'm
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:13.960]  an extremist. I'm telling you about this stuff and warning you and being informed is evil.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:20.320]  Being involved in reality is evil. You individually get up every morning and form a conspiracy
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.920]  with your wife or husband about what time you coming home today. Do I need to go to
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.560]  the store? Do you need to go to the store? Who's going to pick the children up from
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:34.080]  swim team? Who's going to pick them up from football? But see, you conspire. That just
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:40.000]  means talking to each other and working a plan out. Only individuals do that. Sure,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.680]  your car dealership may conspire for a good advertising campaign and a good stick or a
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:56.680]  good pitch. The best pitch is a good deal is the truth. You conspire to make money.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.680]  But big mega corporations that run everything and are cunning and super intelligent and
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.600]  hire all the smartest people and lobby and finance government for policies they want.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.160]  Oh, I'm sorry. That would be a conspiracy. None of that exists. There's no lobbying,
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:17.760]  no special interest. Everything is fine. Okay. All right. Good. I'm glad we're not extremists
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.760]  now. Because I met with some of the biggest radio executives in the country last week
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.560]  when I was the keynote speaker at Talkers and Sean Hannity was there and Limbaugh's
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:34.200]  been the past keynote speaker and people like that. And they said, well, Alex, you are gaining
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.280]  three or four stations a week and then you'll be at 150 stations soon. You're at 120 something
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.400]  and a lot of them are big stations. You do get high ratings, but you've got this label
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:54.760]  of an extremist. And I just point blank said, I am sorry I have that label. How do I change
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:02.920]  that? Do I embrace the TSA, grabbing men's genitals and squeezing them hard? Is that
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:11.880]  how I do it? Because there's a reason we have 116 million views on one of my eight YouTube
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.720]  channels. I have a total of over 300 million views. You can go look at it just on one platform.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  Just in TV, we have three days of reporting from Bilderberg. Never used it. New account.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.960]  We had a test account years ago. It was on the test account. The test account had a few
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.400]  hundred thousand views, but 3.5 million extra views in three days on an account we ever
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.080]  used. I wonder why everybody's tuning in. I wonder why we have millions of visitors
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.280]  at the sites every day. I wonder why the Drudge report links to us two or three times a week.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.960]  The biggest website in the world. I wonder why we're getting all these radio stations.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:55.560]  I guess it's because I'm an extremist. I actually spend hours reading financial news
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.440]  every day. I actually spend hours interviewing the top experts every day. I actually go out
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:07.240]  and get top historians and top quantum mechanics businesses. I'm obsessed with knowledge and
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:14.400]  information. I sit here and cover common sense. I'm an extremist. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.200]  going to admit to you right now here on air that I am so extreme that I actually know
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:26.080]  the Bill of Rights of Constitution. I've actually read the Constitution many times. I've actually
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:32.240]  read literature. I've read for him the Bell Tolls. I've read Kurt Vonnegut. He even got
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.360]  a loving letter from Kurt Vonnegut in a painting he did for me individually right before he
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:49.880]  died. But he's an extremist too though I forgot. I'm one of these people who is a problem.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.400]  It's extreme when you see Obama give out 2,000 waivers to companies. Some of them with over
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.280]  half a million employees like McDonald's where they don't have to get any insurance and keep
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:07.000]  paying folks $6 an hour or whatever minimum wage is, $6.50 an hour. And then my company
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.960]  with people paid $16 up to $50 an hour, they had none of them want insurance. I've said
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.360]  you want me to get insurance? They don't know. We'll make the decision ourselves. I'm sorry.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.640]  The government says I got to start getting ready to take part of the money out of your
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.760]  paycheck and then I'm going to match it. So instead of $16 an hour, you're going to get
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.760]  $10 an hour. But you're going to have the insurance. And see it's extreme for them to
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.400]  then say, well, why do these thousands of other companies that are special interest,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:47.120]  they don't have to get it. They don't have to buy insurance. Well, you know what, let's
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.240]  not intellectually think about that hypocrisy or that corruption. There I go again. I was
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.240]  just an extremist right there. Right there. I just did it again. I keep doing this over
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:07.120]  and over and over again. I should accept the hypocrisy and the crime, the mafia unfair
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:18.760]  trade advantage. There I go using actual legal terms of racketeering. Extreme, extreme, extreme.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.600]  I should not be upset by that. I mean, obviously it's good that people that have contributed
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.840]  to the Democratic Party and Obama should be given public waivers. Of course, it's illegal
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.360]  to have fundraisers at the White House. Bill Clinton got in trouble for that, but Obama
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:39.520]  does it publicly, but the only an extremist would know that was illegal. So I apologize
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:49.480]  for that. So I guess at the end of the day, I need to learn to be sorry for what I've
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:58.680]  done. I need to learn to be more reasonable. I mean, big deal. If I fly some potbellied
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:05.080]  guy and a bunch of them have been caught being pedophiles, some probably pedophile person
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.080]  is going to want to stick their hands down my daughter's pants. It's happened to my
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.880]  employees, men trying to go in babies, diapers and grab their genitals. See, I shouldn't
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:21.720]  be extreme. I should think that's completely normal. But you know what? I still am old
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:28.760]  fashioned and I guess that's my problem. And I guess I shouldn't be mad about the last
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.800]  few years. My Austin power bill is basically doubled and they admit that Austin's taken
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.720]  on carbon taxing. Other cities are doing it as well because the UN can't get the feds
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720]  to do it. That is the Congress, the elected government. So they've got Obama doing it.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.600]  It turns out the head of his economic panel, his economic board, his economic council there.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.280]  That's the proper name of it. The economic council is the former head of General Electric
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.120]  who has himself hundreds of millions of dollars of stock in it. And the shareholders that
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:01.480]  were one of his biggest contributors that they have waivers from all the new EPA regulations
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:06.320]  that Congress wouldn't pass, but stroke of the pen law, the land kind of cool. Who needs
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:15.840]  actual laws that the big GE coal powered plants and 52% of our power comes from coal, they're
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.360]  exempt. But you know what? That's reasonable. That General Electric, the day it went into
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.040]  effect, Obama signed the waiver on their hundreds of plants and plants they build and manage.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.400]  See, oh, your plant's going to be shut down as the head of the energy department announced
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.480]  a few months ago in the Wall Street Journal. Don't worry. You don't have a General Electric
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.440]  plant. You just go hire them and pay them protection money and then you can keep your
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:49.000]  plant open and just pass the cost on to your users, to your customers. And again, it just
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.400]  came to me during the segment. I'm an extremist. I apologize to all of you. That's reasonable.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:04.680]  In fact, the mafia's good. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.080]  have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk. Saving means to make

[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.640]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lunges Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.360]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.200]  of the Silver Lunges System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.680]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver

[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.080]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.560]  Number 1. New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.160]  2. Our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.640]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.040]  is coming. Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.080]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number 4. Dangerous
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.280]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.920]  power from weather-related onages. Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.080]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.400]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:07.640]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:14.640]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:38.640]  Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. Welcome to tyranny.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.920]  Welcome to bondage. Welcome to control freaks that couldn't produce anything, running your
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.480]  life. Oh, you don't want a data tyrant? You don't want to serve a tyrant? They'll just
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:03.400]  take your society over and teach you to do what they say. That's what tyranny is, is
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  a collection of scum. Control freaks turned loose against you and your family. And extremism
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:19.400]  in defense of liberty is no vice to quote Barry Goldwater. Listen, my friend.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:26.400]  Frank it up. That's right. Anybody that doesn't like tyranny, you need to go to a sanitarium.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  That's right. Anybody that doesn't like tyranny, you need to go to a sanitarium. That's right.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:51.400]  We're all crazy. We don't like tyranny. All right. Your phone calls are coming up in the
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  next segment. Let me get into the big, big news for you. Oh, it's not this. UK banks
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:07.840]  abandon Eurozone over Greek default fears. We told you two years ago when all this started
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:13.080]  that it wouldn't be fixed, no matter how much money the Greeks paid. The EU is a system
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.320]  to bring every country into receivership. Their own founders have admitted that. Here's
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:24.320]  another one. Moody's threat to downgrade Italian debt raises Eurozone contagions. And the big
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.680]  private megabanks run our countries now through fraud. And don't worry, they're going to bankrupt
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:36.440]  every country in order right up to the US and England when they're done. And they're
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:42.680]  going to own you because a bunch of crone like hunchback New World Order people tell
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.920]  you what to do when they tell you what to do. You're going to do it because you don't want
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.440]  to be called an extremist. So there's some of the news on that front. Okay, let me get
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:57.440]  into the World War three situation. We've got a video that we launched Friday afternoon
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.480]  that's got 200,000 views on YouTube and was on the front page of YouTube till they took
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:09.080]  it down part of their tactic to keep our information from going viral. But I shot a little video
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:16.080]  that we put out Friday titled Obama launching World War three. And then it was overwhelmingly
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.280]  received in a positive nature because most people are extremist. Over 90% of Americans
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.960]  in polls believe that more than one person shot and killed JFK. 90 plus percent bad people,
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:40.960]  9% good reasonable sane people. Thank goodness they run things right. Okay, I'm sorry, continuing
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:48.040]  here. But but there were some people that were confused. And so a lot of times I forget
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:54.800]  to put on my anthropology, sociology, psychology hat, because I don't really wordsmith what
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:01.240]  I say. I don't really calculate my semantics. I really try to just tell the truth in an
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:08.040]  easily understood way as best I can. And I saw some people saying, World War three,
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:13.000]  it's not the end of the world. There's not going to be a nuclear war. How could Alex
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.480]  say that? And I went, Well, wait a minute, from all my geopolitical research, World War
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.480]  three would be more than two regions involved in a prolonged conflict with more than 100,000
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.480]  people dead with the two sides being packed, being backed by one or more groups as proxies.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.320]  And I went to Encyclopedia Britannica. I went to Wikipedia. Can't really trust them,
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.800]  but they just copied Britannica. I went to some other history books just to double check
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:52.720]  my memory and I was absolutely correct. In fact, I was only incorrect in one facet. The
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:59.720]  Pentagon since 1991 has officially taught and a lot of you seen this on the news. It's
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  just popularly stated that the Cold War from 1947 until 1991 with Perestroika and all the
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:16.400]  rest of it was World War three. And then it was a Cold War fought with proxies and actually
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.520]  had those quotes there. I'm not just going to tell you that and then not go to the quotes.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.920]  So when I say World War three, the only mistake is, and it wasn't a mistake. If I said World
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.000]  War four, even more folks would have been confused. But to be technical, world from
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  the position of the people that run our country. World War four is now being kicked off. And
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.480]  I did more research and wow, I thought I was more right than I even thought. I got ABC
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:54.480]  News. I've got Associated Press. I've got a bunch of reports here. Here's ABC News. Bush
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.880]  Lichens' War on Terror to World War three. He said during a television interview. Okay.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:10.720]  But expanding on that, what is a world war? Is a war affecting the majority of the world's
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.200]  most powerful and populous nations? Well, all these wars are affecting us through taxes,
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:22.080]  regulations, dead troops coming back and flag draped coffins. World wars span multiple countries
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:29.080]  on multiple continents. Let me see. Africa got the EU and the French and the Ivory Coast
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.040]  got the US and NATO and the French and the Germans. The Germans just pulled out in Libya.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.640]  You got the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan now expanding into Pakistan. You've also got that
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.920]  undeclared war going on for a decade down in Colombia over cocaine money. So there you
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.640]  get. And then it gets into large numbers of dead over a hundred thousand. Million dead
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:57.000]  Iraqis conservative continues. The term has usually been applied to two conflicts unprecedented
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.720]  scale that occurred during the 20th century, World War one, 1914, 1918, World War two,
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.640]  39 to 45. Although in retrospect, a number of earlier conflicts, maybe regarded as world
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:14.280]  wars. And it goes into the Napoleonic era and other things. Okay, let me actually in
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:20.960]  the world war section bring you to some of the quotes. And it has links to the Pentagon's
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.960]  own statements in there. Digging into it here. Excuse me. I highlighted this. That must be
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.960]  my World War three section, but I've got the, here it is. Yeah, this is the one. This is
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.960]  the one I highlighted. Here it is. Some analysts and historians have suggested that the Cold
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.960]  War can be identified as World War three, because it was fought on a global scale by proxy
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.960]  combatants of the United States and later NATO and the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:57.960]  Some neoconservative thinkers, including Norman, Pod Horowitz have suggested as well as the
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.960]  former CIA director that the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union in the
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  mid 20th century should be considered World War three. On the other hand, in a 2006 interview,
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.960]  U.S. President George W. Bush likened the war on terror to World War three. And then
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.960]  it just goes on from there. And then it goes on from there. And it goes on from there.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:25.960]  Now, why am I going over this so much? Why is this, why is this so important? Because
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.960]  World War three and pop culture is seen as a war with the communist Chinese or the Russians
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.960]  or both that results in mushroom clouds everywhere. But I want to be clear. The ongoing buildup
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.960]  for the invasion, the ground invasion of Libya, the ground invasion of Syria, the drone attacks
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  in Yemen, the hostilities in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, all of that fits the bill of a giant
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.960]  World War. Call it whatever name you want. It's a World War. And it does in their war
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:23.960]  gaming lead to thermonuclear.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:50.960]  It's a World War.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:30:14.960]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.960]  one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:25.960]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.960]  how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.960]  Police State Four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:40.960]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:45.960]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:51.960]  of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.960]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now,
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.960]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number 4. Dangerous weather is
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.960]  always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.960]  weather-related onages. Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.960]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions

[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:27.960]  Okay, I know we got at least 12 phone calls online, and I'm going to try to jam you all
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.960]  in right now. I shouldn't even have gotten into World War 3 without spending at least
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:40.960]  an hour on it, but I got sidetracked by TSA, squeezing people's private parts into oblivion
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.960]  and all the other news, but here's the deal. People think either in black and white,
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.960]  geopolitically, either America good, Gaddafi bad, or Gaddafi good, America bad. No. Global
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.960]  megabanks want the trillions in oil and water that's there. They want control of it. It's
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:06.960]  on record now that they overthrew their former ally, Jose Mubarak in Egypt, that Western
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.960]  groups and Google have been involved, fomenting these revolutions. Well, I mean, any government
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.960]  could come to the U.S. and find a group of people that wanted to have an armed revolution.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.960]  Would the U.N. then invade the United States if the government was putting down a foreign,
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:27.960]  funded, and led insurrection? I mean, think about this. And it's now admitted that they're
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.960]  going ahead with battle groups off the coast of Syria, that the West is in there, same
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:38.960]  thing in Libya, same thing in Yemen, everywhere, drone attacks. I mean, this is a major war,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.960]  new attacks every month of a new country. And they say, well, people are protesting and
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.960]  the government might have killed some of them, usually with no evidence. And then we're
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.960]  told, well, we've got to invade countries then if governments go after resistance movements.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.960]  But then Israel shoots a bunch of people on their border, peaceful protesters. It's like,
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.960]  oh, how wonderful. Well, whether you think it's wonderful or not, it's hypocritical.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.960]  And these wars are being launched. Oh, I'm sorry, kinetic military actions. They're not
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.960]  wars. I forgot. Without Congress's approval, and it's unprecedented. And even Senator
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.960]  Al Franken's had to come out and say, Obama, you're supposed to get congressional approval.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.960]  Even Bush did for his wars. You know, if the president sets a precedent where the military
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.960]  attacks who he says without congressional approval, we got a dictatorship here. You're
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.960]  like, well, I like Obama. Where are all you peaceniks who hated Bush for all these illegal
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.960]  wars? Where are you now? Well, he was given a peace prize. Well, why not give Adolf Hitler
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  a peace prize then? Why not in the Star Wars universe give Emperor Palpatine a peace prize?
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:54.960]  After all, he tells Anakin that it will now be peace. This is a sick or welly and joke.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.960]  And the German government has come out and said, this is illegal. We've confirmed with
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.960]  people on the ground. You're bombing major buildings. You're killing civilians. You are
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.960]  causing the humanitarian disaster. Well, we're only told, I mean, I got an email today saying,
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:14.960]  how dare you back Gaddafi when he had helicopters attack protesters? Where's the proof? Where's
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.960]  the proof? The same British government foreign secretary told us he ran to Venezuela. Turns
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  out most of that's a lie. They're foreign observers there, and most of it's not true.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.960]  I mean, Western media is allowed to drive around in major cities and videotape it in Gaddafi's
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.960]  people. Leave them alone. I'm not saying Gaddafi's a good guy. I don't like big government.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.960]  Don't like dictators and clown suits. The point is, is that we were told Saddam threw
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  babies out of incubators and stomped their brains out. That was later admitted to be
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:50.960]  a lie. I don't like being lied to. Imagine al-Qaeda backed groups on record a month before
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:55.960]  this stuff started. We're funded by the U.S. and British government to start the war with
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:00.960]  Gaddafi. He puts the al-Qaeda rebellion down, and we're told, you're an American if you
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  don't back al-Qaeda. And now they're saying that the U.N. sanctions are coming. There's
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:13.960]  already European Union sanctions on Assad and Syria, and there's U.S. backed Kurds in one
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:23.960]  day killed over 100 Syrian police. Those are quite the protesters. I mean, they go out
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  with their U.S. issued rifles coming in infiltrating out of Kurdistan in the northern Iraq area,
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:37.960]  into northern Syria, northeastern Syria. They come in and they machine gun the police when
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.960]  they're coming out of restaurants, gas stations, sitting in their cars, and you're surprised
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.960]  that the Assad government is running around murdering people en masse. This is a full-on
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:56.960]  western-backed destabilization overthrow. And if our criminal government's going to do
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.960]  this, they should at least be honest about it. But again, read my lips, no new taxes.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  I didn't have sex with that woman. Wiener didn't send the photo. Breitbart hacked him.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.960]  None of it true. They lie and lie. And again, I'm an extremist. You know, the heiress of
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.960]  Formula One who's going to get part of the money, 250 million of Austin taxpayer money
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  to pay for her own track, if I don't pay my property taxes, they send a SWAT team to my
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.960]  house to kick me out. If I resist, they kill me because I've got to pay her my money for
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.960]  her Formula One track. I'm an extremist. I should be thankful that foreigners come here
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.960]  and buy off our politicians and then they raise my taxes to pay for a Formula One track
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.960]  that they could pay for over and over again so she could have a $150 million mansion.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.960]  Michael, Frank, Chris, Frank, Adam, Karen, Josh, Connie, Sean, Ty, Rick, Jack, Jake.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.960]  We'll see if we can get to all of you. Michael and Tejas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.960]  Hey, Alex. I'm in Plano. A couple things. One of the greatest parts of that favorite quote
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.960]  that you mentioned from Goldwater, a lot of times it doesn't get mentioned the second part.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.960]  Silence isn't golden. It's yellow.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.960]  That's right, but the extremism and the defense of liberty is no vice. The second part of that
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.960]  says also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. In other words, people
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  today in America say that if you're a moderate, that means that you're willing to compromise
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:28.960]  and it makes you a better person. Well, if the code of this country, part of the code
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.960]  of the United States of America is the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and if
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:40.960]  you veer off of that, that makes you a good person. If you're a moderate, no. It makes
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  you a traitor. Something else, Alex, I think you should see. There's a video. I know that
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  sometimes you'll even play things. In Cedar Falls, Iowa, the residents just had a local
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:58.960]  order. You have to give the cops the keys to your house. You've got to give the cops the
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.960]  keys. I mean, and I showed this to my friends and they said, well, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.960]  What do you think? The globalists now get down to Cedar Falls, Iowa? Yeah, they do.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.960]  It's called Gen 21, Global Standardized Local City Laws, and that's exactly part of that.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  Europe's already done that. Why didn't we give the cops the keys to our house before
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  if it's such a good idea? If the states don't have any power, why do we have stinking
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.960]  states? And the scariest part of all of it is, even if the globalist didn't approach
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:32.960]  Cedar Falls, Iowa, I looked into it. They did. It's part of global zoning. We've been
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.960]  trained. We're being trained to be slaves, and you should watch that whole video because
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.960]  one of the town council members says, well, we elected us so that we can tell you what
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:49.960]  to do. Some foreign guy. I saw it hardly speaking English. I know. Very well said, Michael.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.960]  What do you think of this whole New World War situation? I think we're already in it,
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  and, you know, it's, like you said, exactly, but they change it to a peace action. It's
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.960]  not a bombardment. It's kinetic. I mean, we are entering. We've gone beyond 1984. I don't
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.960]  understand how people who look at all the campaign videos from Obama, where he said,
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:17.960]  we are going to pull the troops out. He's in more wars and started more wars now than
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:24.960]  Bush did. I want to know why Boehner is playing golf with him and gland-handling him. I want
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:30.960]  to know why Rick Perry hasn't introduced the anti-groping bill. I appreciate your call.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.960]  Very well said, Michael. Gosh, I could go for 10 hours with great calls like that. Frank
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.960]  in Washington, you're on the air. Welcome. Hi. How's it going, Alex? Good. Good. I'm a
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  first-time caller, but a long-term listener and president. I just want to start by saying,
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.960]  man, you're just awesome and happy Father's Day because I know you're a dad and you're
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  an awesome dad and what you're doing is standing up. Well, you know, Thursday, they asked me
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.960]  to interrupt you because you brought that up. They said, do you want to take off Sunday
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.960]  on Father's Day? And I said, well, no, because it's Father's Day, I'm going to come in.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.960]  Because anytime I need energy, I look at my children and think about this tyranny. And
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.960]  believe me, I got plenty of energy and plenty of fight in me when I realized what we're
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.960]  facing. Sorry, Frank. Go ahead. No, man, you're absolutely right. And I just want to make
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.960]  a couple quick points and then let you talk about them. I just noticed that, I mean, I
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.960]  picked up in New York Times recently and I don't normally read the mainstream media
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.960]  because I can get it all online. But I wanted to see what it's like when you actually read
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.960]  their newspaper nowadays. And I just noticed that there's no real important headlines
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.960]  anywhere near the front of the page. But as you dig into it, you can actually find some
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:38.960]  information about what's really going on in the world. For instance, like the dollar's
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:47.960]  falling fast, obviously. And we have now these banks are actually dropping out of the lending
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.960]  market so that they can aid in helping the dollar fall even faster.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.960]  Exactly. It's all planned. Let me comment on on the other side and we'll go to all the
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:20.960]  other callers. Stay with us.

[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.960]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.960]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:16.960]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.960]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.960]  the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:33.960]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.960]  of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.960]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided, making
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:50.960]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.960]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.960]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.960]  from underneath the Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:20.960]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:26.960]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:32.960]  our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.960]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.960]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today it seems
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.960]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:54.960]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.960]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.960]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.960]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.960]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.960]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.960]  to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.960]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.960]  of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:49.960]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:21.960]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:28.960]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:35.960]  By the way, I looked up Corpus Christi, Texas, and they do have corporal punishment in their
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  high schools at junior highs, paddling with students without parental consent. But if
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  you lightly spank your child there, they will put you in prison. And that's in the news,
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  linked up at the Drudge Report today if you want to see that CBS News Report. That's how
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.960]  dumb they think you are. We're going to put you in jail or put you on probation for something
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.960]  that isn't illegal, something we do because we're the government. You're the extremist.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:04.960]  You're the criminal. You're the scum. You're here to suck the boots of the government.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:10.960]  Not lick them, but suck them. Get down on your knees, grovel and beg. Who makes the sun
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.960]  shine the government? Want to go back to your calls and give each caller about a minute
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:20.960]  each out of time here. And I apologize for that, but you know how I am. He mentioned how
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.960]  the mainstream media tries to divert you. Yeah, they don't just lie or spin. They're
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.960]  not so mainstream anymore. They're falling apart, which is why they're coming in with
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  all this new censorship on talk radio and the Internet because they're desperate. But they
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:38.960]  lie by omission and by throwing petty diversionary issues at you. So you're absolutely right,
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:43.960]  Frank, to answer your question. You've already answered it. Chris in Connecticut, you're on
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:48.960]  here. Welcome. Hey, Alex. Great to talk to you. First of all, I want to commend you and
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.960]  the crew on your coverage of Bilderberg and the upcoming October kinetic action in Libya.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:00.960]  Just amazing stuff that you can't find anywhere else other than info wars.com. So first of
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.960]  all, amazing stuff and thank you, Chris. Roll this together, brother. Indeed. And look,
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.960]  you know, I've been listening to you for about a last year and a half. And I've been able
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.960]  to wake up maybe about a dozen friends and family members over the last year kind of
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.960]  just teasing out of them. Like, you know, that everybody has a sense that things are
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:21.960]  not going well in this country. Things are heading downhill. Yeah, we got a case of
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:27.960]  charity. Exactly. And so what I wanted to ask you just, I know we all have a minute.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.960]  Paul Joseph Watson on Friday said that the focus of the resistance should no longer be
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.960]  trying to wake up the thumb suckers who can't understand that things are on the
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:42.960]  decline. But those of us who are awakened, you need to rally us to action instead of
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.960]  us just like sitting behind keyboards and just writing on websites and things like
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.960]  that. I wanted to ask you whether you had any sort of sense that you should step up
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.960]  and go to Washington like in September or October before the kinetic action and
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.960]  call all of us to like the Washington Memorial like Glenn Beck did or John
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.960]  Stewart. Man, you pull 500,000 people.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.960]  Well, stuff like that's a great idea. And I heard Paul live when he talked about
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.960]  that. He was talking about folks that criticize other patriots and say we're
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.960]  doomed. That's different. It's great to get the word out. The keyboard's a great
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.960]  way to reach people in cyberspace. That's our most effective tool. He was talking
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.960]  about pessimist. But yes, for people that are awake, now is the time to reach out
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:32.960]  to others. So I think the way you interpreted that, I'm not disagreeing with
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.960]  interpretation, but it's not exactly what Paul was saying. I appreciate it.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:41.960]  Let me tell you something. We've got YouTube openly censoring our videos.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:46.960]  They've sent us a letter. We have a copy of it saying that we showed Obama as a
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.960]  joker and that that's considered racist and that our account now has a strike
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.960]  against it. 160 million views. That's bigger than any of the news agencies on
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:58.960]  YouTube. Check it out. ABC News doesn't have that many. It's like 50 million.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:02.960]  They treat us like garbage. We have no respect. That's just one of our channels.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.960]  We have over 300 million. They said that we're now being looked at for racism
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.960]  and that the site will probably be shut down. You are not allowed to talk about
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:16.960]  Obama or defile him, our Lord and Savior. Again, I'm reaching hundreds of
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.960]  millions of people through cyberspace. I do have demonstrations. Things like that
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.960]  are great, but they can ignore demonstrations. Again, it's about you
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:29.960]  being a leader. Let's move quickly. Frank in California. Go ahead, Frank.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:34.960]  Alex, you're doing a great job. I just want to say a few things.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:40.960]  I know you doubt the whole 2012 thing, but you have to admit with the
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.960]  whole banking thing collapsing. No, it's more sophisticated.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.960]  I've read the Mayan prophecies. A, I don't believe that sorcery stuff.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:54.960]  B, I know the Mayan prophecy just says a new age begins, not the end of the world.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.960]  The globalists are occultists and they've used this for non-Christians.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:03.960]  They tell Christians it's the end of the world. Jesus is coming, so they lay down.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.960]  They tell non-Christians, kind of atheists and agnostics, oh, it's the end of the
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.960]  world. The Mayans said for some reason they buy it. It's a fake, self-fulfilling
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:16.960]  prophecy to make you think all is lost. The globalists do plan by 2012
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.960]  with their own documents to have open world government and all hadies to break loose.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.960]  So I agree with you, sir. Yeah, well, the thing is too, I remember when
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.960]  Lindsey Williams, you had him on the show, he said that two weeks after the
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:35.960]  Euro collapses that the dollar would be next. So, yeah, it just seems like
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:42.960]  it's going to be sooner, so I don't know. It's scary. It's just really...
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.960]  Don't be an extremist, Frank. I appreciate your call. Don't worry about
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.960]  things. The government's taking care of it all. They're good people.
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:57.960]  Man, what's wrong with you? Adam in New York, you're on the air extremist.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:04.960]  Welcome. Yeah, hi, Alex. I just wanted to get your take on Israel's role in the
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.960]  grand chess board. Well, that, again, the problem is all these questions are so
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.960]  sophisticated. I mean, they sound simple, but they're sophisticated. Israel is a
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:19.960]  key outpost of the Anglo-American establishment. It's meant as the claim
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:24.960]  that there's real estate there by a group that isn't Arab so that conflict can be
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.960]  carried out by all sides against each other, and it's all part of the
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.960]  Balkanization situation. I mean, does that mean that I'm saying all the
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:35.960]  Israelis are bad? No, I'm not saying the Libyans are bad. It's, again, full
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.960]  spectrum dominance where the globalist create atmospheres politically where
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:44.960]  conflict can be created that can't be resolved because they don't want the
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.960]  conflict to be resolved. The conflict is the pretext for the greater control.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:53.960]  Well, I appreciate that, and great job, Alex. Thank you so much, sir. Again,
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:56.960]  I'm not doing a great job, folks. I have no future if we don't beat these
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.960]  people, neither do you, and I appreciate the kind words, but I don't deserve it.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.960]  I'm an example of what one motivated person can do when others join with
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:07.960]  them and support them. You want to thank me? Spread the word about the
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.960]  broadcast so this isn't done in vain. We're having a huge effect. I'm under
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.960]  full surveillance, all sorts of hit pieces, but we have a lot of people in
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.960]  government and corporate America and worldwide that are good people, and
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.960]  in the struggle against light and darkness, they have privately chosen to
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.960]  serve light. The next step is serving it openly. Karen in Arizona, you're on
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.960]  the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. I do spread the word about your websites, and
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  another thing I want to thank you for is about the smart meter because
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:43.960]  APS is installing smart meters without... No, they're going in nationwide,
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  and Apple will control what you can videotape on your own phone you buy.
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.960]  They don't get the concept of ownership. Smart meters going in nationwide
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:55.960]  to control your thermostat. First, they denied it, now they admit it.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.960]  Total control. Tom Tom's tracking you with the police. It's all illegal,
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:06.960]  but they're just doing it. They're criminal. They admitted that they
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  want to do a rate increase, and if the rate increase is also to pay for the
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.960]  smart meter. Yeah, and the studies show once the smart meters in, the rates
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:20.960]  go up because they are going to absolutely screw us from every angle, Karen.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.960]  That's right, and I'm educating the people, and I also tell them the people,
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  the health effects, side effects of the smart meter.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.960]  Totally proven. It uses a wireless system, just like a cell phone,
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.960]  and we can't see that digital spectrum, but we're in a blast furnace of
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.960]  electronic pollution. I appreciate your call, Karen. Josh, Tony, Sean,
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.960]  Ty, Rick, Jake, there's no way to get to all of you, but I'll be back live
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.960]  tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time, and if you call in, you tell them,
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:56.960]  put you to the head of the line, I'll get to you. I really want to hear from you,
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  and I'm sorry I didn't get to more of you. Let me just say this on the whole
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.960]  digital electronics tech front. If you go to a trilateral commission meeting
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.960]  and cover it, or Bilderberger, any of it, the biggest group representative of the
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  heads of the tech companies, and they all put out public policy papers admitting
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.960]  you have a breakaway civilization or an attempt by the military industrial
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:26.960]  complex under the guise of national security to establish high-tech systems
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  behind closed doors outside of public scrutiny, genetic engineering,
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.960]  super weapons, all of it, and so they're attempting to form a breakaway civilization
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.960]  under the guise of carbon taxes they want to bring in a new dark age to block
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:44.960]  the general public and companies that aren't insiders development, like with
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.960]  the coal plants and the government insurance and all the rest of it.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.960]  The insiders are exempt from it all. So it's a new type of royalty,
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.960]  corporate royalty, where they own your politicians, and any technology they give
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:06.960]  you, iPhones, droids, wireless, smart cards, all of it, you pay for it,
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.960]  and then you pay for the Trojan horse systems of surveillance.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.960]  You order a pizza, wired into the government. You use a GPS, it's live time
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.960]  into AI computers tracking everything. They have maps of everywhere you've gone,
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.960]  everything you've done, the threat fusion centers or federalization spy bases
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.960]  to spy on people, they fuse all the data, they slowly are bringing the cops in
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.960]  and finding out who will go along with it, and then showing them the technology.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.960]  This is a serious takeover, and here's what I'll leave you with,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.960]  because it's in all their documents and a new video we just put out,
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.960]  The Elite's Plan for Global Extermination at PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:58:10.960]  The end game, once this grid's in place, is to exterminate at least 80% of us.
