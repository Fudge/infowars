[00:00.000 --> 00:05.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all new online network, FreeSpeech.tv, Gavin McInnis, Joe
[00:05.740 --> 00:35.040]  Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:36.700 --> 00:42.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday,
[00:42.180 --> 00:48.700]  October 29th, 2019 Worldwide broadcast. And if you're not feeling a sense of
[00:48.700 --> 00:52.740]  urgency about what's happening in the world, you're blind, you're not paying
[00:52.740 --> 01:00.460]  attention. The future of humanity is on the edge, and humanity is barely winning
[01:00.460 --> 01:05.940]  this race against the anti-human globalists by just a few inches by a
[01:05.940 --> 01:13.860]  nose right now. DrudgeReport.com has the headline that Republicans fear a 2020
[01:13.860 --> 01:19.900]  wipeout, and there is an article from Axios that breaks it down. So we'll put
[01:19.900 --> 01:24.660]  DrudgeReport.com on screen please. The GOP nightmare scenario, ladies and
[01:24.660 --> 01:29.500]  gentlemen, we're going to be going over all of that. We also now learn it's an
[01:29.500 --> 01:33.340]  army officer who heard Trump's Ukraine call reported concerns, but there's a
[01:33.340 --> 01:38.380]  recording of it, and there's a transcript. So there you go, ladies and
[01:38.380 --> 01:42.260]  gentlemen, and that's what the media is claiming. Who knows if that's even
[01:42.260 --> 01:45.620]  true. Now we're told the whistleblower won't be testifying, and they've been
[01:45.620 --> 01:50.940]  having these hearings that no one shows up at. So that's all coming up today as
[01:50.940 --> 01:55.660]  well. We're going to have open phones, but the first thing I want to get to is
[01:55.660 --> 02:00.540]  there is an invasion. There is a movement worldwide of sexualizing children,
[02:00.540 --> 02:03.940]  and when elementary schools try to have events for free speech saying, don't
[02:03.940 --> 02:08.540]  sexualize our children, very aggressive people show up and have to be arrested,
[02:08.540 --> 02:14.060]  and that ties in with, oh, drag queen accidentally flashes their genitals at
[02:14.060 --> 02:18.540]  children. There's no accidental. This is going on. They're following a script.
[02:18.540 --> 02:24.860]  Here's Will Johnson in Austin, Texas last night. Thank you, Jonathan. Well, I have
[02:24.860 --> 02:28.860]  been directly involved in this battle professionally for almost a year. One
[02:28.860 --> 02:35.900]  black transgender woman fatally shot today where black as a father in her
[02:35.900 --> 02:44.020]  apartment. 27 a black transgender woman was fatally shot and Prince George
[02:44.020 --> 02:50.060]  County where the god of 21 black transgender woman was fatally shot in
[02:50.060 --> 02:57.820]  Cleveland, Malaysia Booker, 23 a black trans woman fatally shot in Dallas.
[02:57.820 --> 03:24.300]  Michelle Tamika.
[03:27.820 --> 03:39.100]  So imagine a 300-pound man wearing a red wig wants to charge in an elementary school that's
[03:39.100 --> 03:43.660]  having to have a demonstration by parents saying, do not sexualize our children, not
[03:43.660 --> 03:49.420]  let men in dresses have contact with them, many of them convicted child molesters, and
[03:49.420 --> 03:55.820]  the police drag this man off and he charges back in repeatedly until he gets arrested
[03:55.820 --> 04:01.820]  and then begins squealing, this we've got to get near your children or black trans men
[04:01.820 --> 04:07.100]  are going to be killed, help us, give us access to your children and we're all dead, and there's
[04:07.100 --> 04:11.100]  all these videos of them coming to the city councils and saying we're here to groom your
[04:11.100 --> 04:17.980]  children, oh it's beautiful, oh it's so beautiful, oh it's so good, oh it's so wonderful, and a man
[04:17.980 --> 04:22.700]  has been convicted of killing a mother and two little girls, but it's okay the media says because
[04:22.700 --> 04:28.300]  he's trans, he went to the house raped and tortured him to death, we're going to tell you about that,
[04:28.300 --> 04:35.820]  not this individual in Austin, this is a story out of Connecticut, it's all coming up, just howling
[04:35.820 --> 04:49.100]  screaming big fat man with red wig saying I'm a woman, give me access to those kids, give me those
[04:49.100 --> 05:01.900]  children, I'm a woman, I need your children, across the space time continuum the demon force is
[05:01.900 --> 05:05.260]  trying to punch through into our dimension, will you stand against them?
[05:09.020 --> 05:13.500]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here,
[05:13.500 --> 05:17.900]  I don't care what your views are, I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and
[05:17.900 --> 05:22.380]  debate them, that's important, but we have something in common, we have a set of values that are at
[05:22.380 --> 05:27.740]  the core of this country that hold this place together. Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks
[05:27.740 --> 05:33.100]  it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress in the world, he thinks committing
[05:33.100 --> 05:39.100]  crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted, but word is the criminal
[05:39.100 --> 05:47.980]  investigation is honing in on him, from my new home in New Zealand I will, oh and now suddenly
[05:47.980 --> 05:53.580]  he's talking about moving to New Zealand, not so fast criminal, we're going to bring you to
[05:53.580 --> 05:58.540]  justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well, because if we don't you criminals will
[05:58.540 --> 06:03.660]  continue to strike back at your enemy, but the American people know how much you hate us and
[06:03.660 --> 06:14.620]  we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com and banned off video. Waging war on corruption,
[06:14.620 --> 06:34.620]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:36.380 --> 06:42.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the forces of hell are being released upon what's left of
[06:42.540 --> 06:49.660]  Christendom in the West. Once we got rid of our Christian values, it was like opening a door
[06:49.660 --> 06:55.020]  underwater to a submarine, the bulkheads are flooded and the worst of the worst have been
[06:55.020 --> 07:03.420]  turned loose. Nambla has long sought to have access to children in schools, they want to emancipate
[07:03.420 --> 07:08.380]  children as young as three years old to have sex with them and they thought how do we get
[07:08.380 --> 07:14.940]  past the taboo of men getting near your children, they try to get them out of the backyard,
[07:14.940 --> 07:18.620]  they try to get them at the park, they try to get them at the mall, they try to get them
[07:19.500 --> 07:23.020]  out of their bedrooms at night, climb through the windows, put the knife through the throats,
[07:23.740 --> 07:30.700]  how do they, the demons driving these people, grabbing these meat buckets, how do they usually
[07:30.700 --> 07:40.860]  apply belly type mail, how do they do that? Well, they just dress them up like clowns so
[07:40.860 --> 07:52.060]  their identities are protected and then call the clown, call the clown a woman. These are men in
[07:52.060 --> 07:57.100]  disguise as doing this and they've launched a full out assault and they're following a script.
[07:57.100 --> 08:02.220]  You'll see the same report in Australia that you see it in the United States or England or Germany
[08:02.220 --> 08:09.100]  on the same day and they're all networking and operating in unison and it's all funded by the
[08:09.100 --> 08:14.220]  big universities, funded by the big art displays, funded by taxpayers. They're taken into schools,
[08:14.220 --> 08:22.380]  remember in Denver and the elementary and the parents aren't told that a drag queen, a transvestite,
[08:22.380 --> 08:27.660]  a man is coming to speak with their children on career day until second, third, fourth, fifth
[08:27.660 --> 08:32.140]  graders that they should grow up and work in adult entertainment and then the children sit on their
[08:32.140 --> 08:40.220]  laps, unannounced appearance and then the man dresses a woman, sits on a table and then moves
[08:40.220 --> 08:47.420]  across the table and spreads their legs to the children and we're putting together a compilation
[08:47.420 --> 08:57.740]  since this broke this morning of them doing these exact moves. The next move is to ride them horsey,
[09:00.620 --> 09:06.460]  ride them horsey and it's the exact same move. They sit on the table, they spread their legs
[09:07.260 --> 09:13.900]  like it's a woman inviting a man to come in and have sex with them and it's a ritual. They are
[09:13.900 --> 09:20.220]  sexually marking your children and we've got videos of them saying we're coming, we have them,
[09:20.220 --> 09:25.900]  it's beautiful, you won't stop us, you sick evil people, we're going to have love with your children,
[09:25.900 --> 09:31.900]  we're going to get them, we're going to groom them, they're ours now and then in the ritual,
[09:32.940 --> 09:38.140]  when the Stockholm syndrome women bring their children to them at events, they sit the women
[09:38.140 --> 09:45.260]  on their laps, the women put the babies on their laps and then the men go and the children recoil
[09:45.260 --> 09:53.260]  and they go and then that's a further demonic ritual, the demon manifest, marking its territory
[09:53.260 --> 09:58.540]  for future slaughter. Now that is what this is, they're going to slaughter their innocence
[09:59.340 --> 10:04.780]  and in the satanic rituals that are conducted that have now been declassified by the FBI this week,
[10:04.780 --> 10:11.020]  Epic Times is reporting on it, FBI releases information on finders of secretive group,
[10:11.580 --> 10:17.020]  accused of child sex abuse, no accusation, we have the giant file, I'll get it there in the break.
[10:18.300 --> 10:24.860]  I had Ted Gunnerson on 25 years ago exposing all of this and how they work and how they're operating.
[10:28.620 --> 10:33.820]  Now they have to get you to give up on your spirit and your discernment,
[10:33.820 --> 10:38.940]  they have to bathe you in corruption, so the new thing is sex with animals, sex with snakes,
[10:40.300 --> 10:48.540]  sex with rodents, torturing animals and sex with bugs, centipedes, spiders, spiders
[10:49.500 --> 10:55.660]  and so there's a giant new massive rollout hitting every channel, just it's everywhere today,
[10:55.660 --> 10:58.620]  Al Jazeera says not wanting to eat insects is racist,
[10:58.620 --> 11:04.700]  Texas Art Museum encourages children to eat bugs,
[11:07.340 --> 11:11.340]  Cheshire Home Invasion Killer tells podcasts he's transgendered,
[11:12.460 --> 11:15.980]  he's getting his transgender in prison, it's all cute, it's all funny,
[11:16.700 --> 11:20.780]  hey you get those houses easier sometimes, you know the big bad wolf, what's the big bad wolf do?
[11:20.780 --> 11:29.980]  He dresses up like grandma, my what big teeth you have, my what big eyes you have,
[11:32.540 --> 11:39.820]  all the better to see you with my dear, yeah grandma what big nose you have,
[11:40.700 --> 11:48.220]  all the better to smell you with my dear, grandma what big teeth you have,
[11:48.220 --> 11:57.500]  all the better to eat you with my dear, and in Spain and in Portugal and in Germany and in
[11:57.500 --> 12:04.140]  Sweden and in Italy and in Denmark no one knows where Little Red Riding came from but they found
[12:04.140 --> 12:13.180]  over a thousand year old engravings in Germany and Spain of Little Red Riding Hood and people told
[12:13.180 --> 12:19.260]  their children from age two, when you're walking through the forest there are men that dress up
[12:19.260 --> 12:27.180]  like women and they will kill you, so even if someone's dressed like a woman in the woods,
[12:27.180 --> 12:35.420]  run if you don't know them, run for your lives they'll kill you and they will from Transylvania
[12:35.420 --> 12:42.860]  to Austin, Texas they are with us and they are amongst our children and they are powering up

[30:09.100 --> 30:15.020]  again i'm not talking down to the info wars audience but i've been banging my head against
[30:15.020 --> 30:20.380]  a wall for a long time on this and i'm talking about fluoride and i'm talking about i and i
[30:20.380 --> 30:26.540]  now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glass tron boat and you want to take it on the
[30:26.540 --> 30:32.700]  lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if you're a human being you've got to have oxygen to
[30:32.700 --> 30:39.340]  live okay it's the same thing well ladies and gentlemen the bad halogen is fluoride that's why
[30:39.340 --> 30:42.860]  in every western nation they put it in the water they're going to teach us christians lay down and
[30:42.860 --> 30:48.060]  die the chai comes don't put it in the water they'd execute you if you did that they put iodine in
[30:48.060 --> 30:53.580]  the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence
[30:53.580 --> 30:58.940]  and everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com we have
[30:58.940 --> 31:03.340]  all the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists
[31:03.340 --> 31:11.100]  are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at infowarstore.com info wars presents
[31:11.100 --> 31:17.580]  alex jones in august of 2019 jamma or the journal of the american medical association
[31:17.580 --> 31:22.380]  the most prestigious came out and said oh my gosh just a little bit of fluoride in the water
[31:22.380 --> 31:27.260]  causes lowered IQs massive infertility and a lot of babies die in the womb and it causes
[31:27.260 --> 31:32.300]  cancer that was just one of thousands of studies admitting this you know it's illegal to have even
[31:32.300 --> 31:37.980]  one part per billion in the water in places like california unless it's part of adding fluoride and
[31:37.980 --> 31:43.100]  then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the
[31:43.100 --> 31:48.700]  liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children so whatever you do drink lots of
[31:48.700 --> 31:54.300]  fluoride and don't get the thing that counters the iodine at infowarstore.com drink fluoride
[31:54.300 --> 32:01.020]  and die drink fluoride dirty americans and roll over do not visit infowarstore.com and get high

[32:10.700 --> 32:16.300]  folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because different
[32:16.300 --> 32:22.380]  types of physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[32:22.380 --> 32:29.340]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people
[32:29.340 --> 32:36.060]  need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great
[32:36.060 --> 32:42.620]  for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine
[32:42.620 --> 32:48.220]  is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of
[32:48.220 --> 32:54.060]  reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality iodine
[32:54.060 --> 33:01.100]  infowarstore.com and help fund the info war infowarstore.com we've got a huge sale running right
[33:01.100 --> 33:07.260]  now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off
[33:07.260 --> 33:14.780]  together you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:26.380 --> 33:32.940]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[33:32.940 --> 33:43.740]  front lines of the info war so i'm sitting here getting ready for the broadcast and last night
[33:45.180 --> 33:51.580]  i took home a copy of the fbi report that got released a few days ago about the finders
[33:52.300 --> 33:56.860]  organization it turned out in the late 1980s early 1990s that was a cia
[33:56.860 --> 34:03.340]  a leftist cutout running out of a cia building in in dc this came out even in mainstream news
[34:04.060 --> 34:09.260]  with kidnapped children and even killing them for stuff films so it's it's it's jeffrey epstein stuff
[34:10.060 --> 34:15.100]  again jeffrey epstein is just a manager above that he gets people into the first level uh
[34:15.100 --> 34:19.580]  sex with underage girls and then they tell you to get in the real club uh you got to kill little
[34:19.580 --> 34:27.020]  kids and uh that's just what they do so i was reading last night at home and i also had another
[34:27.020 --> 34:32.300]  copy of my office printed two copies of this year's day i was reading and everybody went to bed
[34:32.300 --> 34:40.060]  probably a hundred pages of this and i only got partway through it and it's just devil worshipers
[34:40.060 --> 34:46.860]  all over the country taking over small towns ritually abusing children programming them
[34:46.860 --> 34:52.940]  creating uh multiple personalities that having the children recruit more children um schools
[34:52.940 --> 34:59.260]  elementary schools with satanic temples underneath them the fbi went in confirmed it found the
[34:59.260 --> 35:04.620]  temples found the pentagrams everything it's all right here that's what trump's releasing
[35:04.620 --> 35:09.580]  i think they're a little bit pissed there's a 10 fold plus increase the amount of pedophiles and
[35:09.580 --> 35:13.740]  actual pedophiles with kidnapped children in cages being busted you'll hear about it
[35:13.740 --> 35:19.820]  400 plus busted here 300 there 500 here 200 there 20 here 70 here and then you never hear
[35:19.820 --> 35:25.180]  about it again you think the courts are upset why do you think liberal leftist judges are just
[35:25.180 --> 35:29.900]  disregarding first amendment now disregarding everything just going after all the trump supporters
[35:30.620 --> 35:36.460]  because most of them have sex with children okay these are devil worshipers
[35:38.460 --> 35:41.180]  they're in a club how do you think they took over the catholic church
[35:41.180 --> 35:51.100]  3000 plus priest the state police own report in pennsylvania confessed 3000 plus that they
[35:51.100 --> 35:56.860]  had sex with children in satanic rituals in pennsylvania alone
[35:56.860 --> 36:13.500]  alone 3000 and the state said we can't prosecute 3000 people because the priest all said by the
[36:13.500 --> 36:19.340]  way we did it for these people there's a satanic group above us and they name names and that's
[36:19.340 --> 36:26.220]  in the pennsylvania news and it just shuts down who do you think the pope is ladies and gentlemen
[36:26.220 --> 36:33.260]  he took over the catholic church 100 now at the top and they they're taking over all the
[36:33.260 --> 36:36.860]  major churches all the major colleges with pedophile rinks it's how they do it
[36:38.940 --> 36:43.820]  first they get you to have sex with an underage hooker then they blackmail you or they send
[36:43.820 --> 36:48.940]  you child porn and they go oh oh we know about the child porn but we won't put you in jail if you

[36:56.860 --> 37:08.220]  who we're up against the evil of the evil of the evil of the evil of the evil you see evil exists
[37:08.220 --> 37:12.620]  and thomas jefferson was once asked what is the level of tyranny at which tyrants will stop
[37:12.620 --> 37:20.860]  and he said it is the level at which you resist them there is no bottom bottomless bottomless pit

[39:53.580 --> 39:58.620]  and i was in there until june and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening
[39:58.620 --> 40:05.660]  to info wars every day for three three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys
[40:05.660 --> 40:11.260]  talking about living defense let me tell you something man i had an internal digestive problem
[40:11.260 --> 40:16.380]  and i suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody
[40:16.380 --> 40:20.540]  could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group and those
[40:20.540 --> 40:24.700]  commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now i wasn't
[40:24.700 --> 40:28.700]  supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff but i ordered it had
[40:28.700 --> 40:35.180]  it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that stuff changed my life
[40:35.180 --> 40:41.820]  it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life listen man if there's any veteran out there
[40:41.820 --> 40:47.020]  i don't care if you've traveled though anybody's traveled overseas you absolutely owe it to yourself
[40:47.020 --> 40:52.940]  to get two bottles of that living defense steve called in and was talking about if he just joined
[40:52.940 --> 40:58.460]  us how he was in the va really sick nothing was working you got a bottle of living defense
[40:59.020 --> 41:03.020]  that doesn't just flush out the big parasites it's designed to go after all the microscopic ones
[41:04.860 --> 41:11.900]  and folks this i thought would be our best-selling product i mean it's sold some but this is the
[41:11.900 --> 41:19.420]  strongest best natural herbal compound that'll flush your guts out okay and then we've got the
[41:19.420 --> 41:25.020]  myco zx that gets out the candida the the mold the yeast because people take probiotics that's great
[41:25.740 --> 41:30.460]  you know the good bacteria because as you get older a lot of the good bacteria are flushed out
[41:30.460 --> 41:35.420]  you take antibiotics it kills them all uh or there's other toxic bacteria you know that that push out
[41:35.420 --> 41:40.220]  the good bacteria so what's good to have things that are fermented or things that have a lot of
[41:40.220 --> 41:46.380]  natural bacteria i'm like yogurt or sauerkraut pickles those are all great sources uh naturally
[41:46.380 --> 41:51.020]  but nothing works good like a good probiotic but you got to have the other thing like a myco zx
[41:51.020 --> 41:55.900]  that flushes out the yeast the mold the candida but then to go after parasites well that's living
[41:55.900 --> 42:02.700]  defense and so this is the best you're going to find out there that's over the counter okay and if
[42:02.700 --> 42:06.380]  you go places i don't want to be gross but if you go places like cuba i've been told by everybody
[42:06.380 --> 42:12.060]  that goes there most beautiful woman you'd ever want imagine but they're begging for dewormer
[42:12.060 --> 42:16.140]  because the government won't produce it or sell it and people can't get it and so people
[42:16.140 --> 42:22.140]  are taking dewormer people go there with the dewormer and people you just they'll do anything for
[42:22.140 --> 42:27.100]  it you know cases of guards women or whatever just for you know for the dewormer pretty gross right
[42:27.100 --> 42:32.300]  but that's how it is in communist countries well there's all sorts of stuff out there that the medical
[42:32.300 --> 42:36.300]  system won't tell you about and so we're not competing with their death traps and what they're
[42:36.300 --> 42:42.380]  doing we're just saying living defense well alice i'm telling you every listener out there
[42:42.380 --> 42:47.020]  should order a couple bottles of this because everybody's got parasites whether you think
[42:47.020 --> 42:52.380]  you don't or not if you've ever eaten any kind of seafood anything like that obviously you do
[42:52.380 --> 42:57.740]  sushi forget about it you're riddled with parasites and i don't know of a better product and i've
[42:57.740 --> 43:03.020]  done a lot of research since i had this miraculous turnaround in my health i started looking into it
[43:03.020 --> 43:07.740]  and there's no better product out there we're not making this up just like our information's game
[43:07.740 --> 43:12.540]  changing we have strongest agreement on policy grounds and i hope there's diversity in policy here
[43:12.540 --> 43:16.940]  i don't care what your views are i hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and
[43:16.940 --> 43:21.500]  debate them that's important but we have something in common we have a set of values that are at the
[43:21.500 --> 43:27.500]  core of this country that hold this place together clinton deep state bag man comey thinks it's funny
[43:27.500 --> 43:32.780]  that he was the leaker and then he lied to congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are
[43:32.780 --> 43:38.860]  funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted the word is the criminal investigation
[43:38.860 --> 43:47.500]  is honing in on him from my new home in new zealand i will uh oh and now suddenly he's talking
[43:47.500 --> 43:53.420]  about moving to new zealand not so fast criminal we're going to bring you to justice and we're
[43:53.420 --> 43:59.100]  going to bring hillary to justice as well because if we don't you criminals will continue to strike

[47:56.860 --> 48:01.340]  costume parties because they may hurt someone's feelings and big national polls and studies
[48:01.340 --> 48:06.700]  outward 60 of millennials say arrest people for any politically incorrect speech
[48:08.860 --> 48:13.340]  and where every major democrat candidate says they want armed gun confiscation
[48:13.340 --> 48:21.340]  that will trigger a violent civil war and that governors would be passing laws in places like
[48:21.340 --> 48:29.420]  new york and virginia to keep babies alive after they're born until they line up all the organ
[48:31.660 --> 48:38.860]  purchases that are about to happen and then quote gay pride parades from coast to coast

[52:30.700 --> 52:35.580]  spirit it's a transfer and it's a psychic attack and they want to put you into a trance
[52:35.580 --> 52:42.780]  where you're just not really thinking about it so it slowly incrementally builds up till you're gone
[52:45.980 --> 52:50.460]  call an exorcism call whatever you want you need to think about god and your will and god's will

[53:30.460 --> 53:34.700]  child rapists some of them are murderers that chopped other men up
[53:39.500 --> 53:46.300]  here's the report here's the compilation we are grooming the new generation of americans to be
[53:46.300 --> 54:02.380]  fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity

[54:23.420 --> 54:27.660]  ten-year-old girls you'd call the police for kicking ass the children for the little boys it's okay
[54:27.660 --> 54:33.660]  okay
[54:39.180 --> 54:42.220]  men dressed like women licking their lips shaking their butts in front of kids
[54:42.220 --> 54:46.940]  kind of agenda i'm was told at the library council meeting last night that i'm pushing the
[54:46.940 --> 54:52.460]  trans agenda i'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda are you nervous yes do you want to touch
[54:52.460 --> 54:56.620]  my hair no and for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this
[54:56.620 --> 55:01.660]  is going to be the grooming of the next generation that's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't
[55:01.660 --> 55:08.460]  used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it michael likes to twerk now does anybody
[55:08.460 --> 55:14.940]  in this room know how to twerk turn around and shake her butt shake them shake them shake

[55:57.340 --> 56:02.300]  laughter self-expression are values that we want to instill in our kids so i think it's really
[56:02.300 --> 56:10.060]  important that we bring this program and the joy of just spreading love all these kids commit
[56:10.060 --> 56:14.540]  suicide at record rates it's our fault not the parents not the sick ones and everywhere else
[56:14.540 --> 56:20.380]  it's called pedophilia but when it's done institutionally and they can get away with people

[58:08.620 --> 58:14.460]  and it's a great good old chainsaw and i've used it probably 500 times but a few times i've forgotten
[58:14.460 --> 58:20.300]  to oil it and it seizes up really quick and i feel like an idiot for not oiling it now imagine
[58:20.300 --> 58:26.220]  if somebody told me to put let's say super glue uh in the oil container on it it would seize up
[58:26.220 --> 58:31.740]  forever but only an evil person would do that well fluorides like putting super glue at a chainsaw
[58:31.740 --> 58:35.500]  it's going to make it seize up and that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're doing
[58:35.500 --> 58:41.020]  it to hurt you and your family yes they're really evil iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw
[58:41.020 --> 58:45.820]  to help with the gasoline lubrication it's that simple i know you understand this but let's warn
[58:45.820 --> 58:51.180]  other people before it's too late it's part of the iodine conspiracy find out more at m4store.com
[58:51.180 --> 58:56.380]  and take action against the globalist carbons everywhere on this planet it's almost like we're
[58:56.380 --> 59:05.180]  carbon-based life forms folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[59:05.180 --> 59:11.660]  because different types of physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people will like
[59:11.660 --> 59:18.220]  different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other
[59:18.220 --> 59:25.180]  types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get
[59:25.180 --> 59:30.300]  both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family
[59:30.300 --> 59:36.780]  or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be
[59:36.780 --> 59:42.620]  deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's
[59:42.620 --> 59:50.620]  simple get your high quality iodine at m4store.com and help fund the m4m4store.com we've got a huge
[59:50.620 --> 59:55.740]  sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine
[59:55.740 --> 1:00:05.020]  with selenium for 60 off together you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:27.980]  where are the clouds send in the clouds just when i stopped opening doors
[1:00:27.980 --> 1:00:34.140]  okay i uh came in here ready to cover the gop's nightmare scenario which we have to look at or
[1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:40.380]  trump could lose if we're overconfident and i i don't just say this because matt drugs links to my
[1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:49.420]  articles again with my you i mean i say it because i know why i mean i was gonna shoot a video last
[1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:53.260]  week i just never got around to it where the type of videos that drudge links to is where i'm like
[1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:57.020]  how dare you say red flag lost rump whoever's telling you this is a liar if you do this you're
[1:00:57.020 --> 1:01:00.460]  destroying yourself or why aren't you fighting the censorship why aren't you standing up for
[1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:05.020]  assigns why are you committing political suicide not making these key moves he's doing a lot of great
[1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:12.220]  stuff but if you have a fire maybe a hundred days out of the year in your fireplace and then one of
[1:01:12.220 --> 1:01:15.820]  those days you take coals out and throw them across the room you're going to burn the house down
[1:01:15.820 --> 1:01:21.500]  doesn't matter the other nine nine days you have the fire properly going here and uh so you know
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:26.700]  drudge is right to publish or to link to these reports and a lot of people like it calls probably
[1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:31.900]  ten times a day text messages you know what about drudge what about drudge and it's this huge hysteria
[1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:41.340]  out there about you know he's linking to stuff from the enemy well if i saw people trying to come
[1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:47.340]  rob my house and i'm looking out the front window and i see the robbers getting out of their van
[1:01:47.340 --> 1:01:51.820]  with crowbars and masks i'm not going to get mad at my eyeballs for showing me that i'm going to get
[1:01:51.820 --> 1:01:59.020]  my shot gun out and so i see it as the same thing when i come out and say stop the censorship
[1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:05.500]  free of signs back off on the gun control it's because trumps moved the right direction on a
[1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:11.260]  lot of those since we did that and drudge linked to that because that's hard core and that makes
[1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:19.980]  sense and and so drudge is speaking through what he links to and linking to hard core stuff like
[1:02:19.980 --> 1:02:24.300]  you better back off on the red flags better leave our due process alone hey you better go out for
[1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:31.740]  the censorship buddy we really care about you trump so if i disagree with something that drudge is
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:36.460]  saying or doing i'll i mean i'm just automatic i'll say what i really think i have been super
[1:02:36.460 --> 1:02:40.700]  critical of the president hell i would imagine i'd probably influence drudge drudge says i've
[1:02:40.700 --> 1:02:44.780]  influenced him i appreciate some of his nice statements he's put out in the past that i'm one
[1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:53.100]  of the best shows out there but we need to be upset there's massive election fraud trump
[1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:58.460]  barely won three years ago because of a giant landslide and he barely won because the fraud
[1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:05.100]  and remember i'm the guy that told you he was going to win and laid out the facts and the
[1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:11.420]  real polls well i'm looking at the numbers and he is very very popular more popular than
[1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:20.060]  was three years ago but there is unbelievable fraud being pulled out right now and people being
[1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:24.460]  registered the names of dead folks that's been proven by the lawsuits by traditional watch
[1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:30.540]  and others and so if you think they had their act together to rig stuff three years ago man they are
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:34.940]  this is the biggest salt so people better and i'll tell you because paul watson even before
[1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:40.540]  drudge started really you know getting more critical of how much trouble trump could be in
[1:03:40.540 --> 1:03:47.420]  because it's true watson goes and hangs out some with the you know high-level mid-level republicans
[1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:52.300]  you name it some of these big events weddings things like that in dc in virginium and he was
[1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:57.420]  just like it's disgusting the people are nice but the trump worship and trump can do no wrong and
[1:03:57.420 --> 1:04:02.300]  we're invincible and the trump dynasty is going to reign for a hundred years man that's the stuff
[1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:12.380]  that has ss titanic written on the side of it i mean that is just not good not good not good
[1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:18.220]  not good not good not good not good not good not good not good people like hey they admit
[1:04:18.220 --> 1:04:23.580]  they want to take our guns wow that means we're gonna be able to stop them now no that means
[1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:29.660]  they're getting ready to make their move they want a civil war my god ladies and gentlemen they're
[1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:37.900]  openly having children do strip teases down to their underwear in front of men with erections
[1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:41.020]  and the news is saying it's a good thing in the new york times
[1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:46.860]  they're not doing that because they're playing games they're making
[1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:57.500]  their move they're making their move they're making their move are you ready what are you
[1:04:57.500 --> 1:05:02.060]  gonna do about it what are you gonna do about it we'll talk about when we come back to 60 seconds
[1:05:02.060 --> 1:05:12.620]  please stay with us again i'm not talking down to the info wars audience but i've been banging my
[1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:17.580]  head against a wall for a long time on this and i'm talking about fluoride and i'm talking about
[1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:24.220]  i and i now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glass tron boat and you want to take
[1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:30.060]  it on the lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if you're a human being you've got to have
[1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:36.860]  oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well ladies and gentlemen the bad halogen is fluoride that's
[1:05:36.860 --> 1:05:40.860]  why in every western nation they put it in the water they're gonna teach us christians lay down
[1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:46.060]  and die the chai comms don't put it in the water they'd execute you if you did that they put iodine
[1:05:46.060 --> 1:05:51.740]  in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence
[1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:57.180]  and everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com we have all
[1:05:57.180 --> 1:06:01.500]  the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists
[1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:15.820]  are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at infowarstore.com
[1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:24.700]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[1:06:26.380 --> 1:06:36.460]  satanism is about taking the spiritual code of the universe and defiling it and twisting it
[1:06:36.460 --> 1:06:42.620]  and making it ugly when a leaf lies up to a beautiful flower and collects that pollen
[1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:50.460]  that is a beautiful ritual that the creator of the universe designed a planet an atmosphere
[1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:58.540]  an ecosystem and millions of generations of bees still living on and seeing the universe
[1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:06.620]  and experiencing all of that and that's just the bees you think about men and women coming together
[1:07:06.620 --> 1:07:14.380]  the ancestral line of the woman the ancestral line of the man coming together
[1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:23.740]  and creating a new creature that can experience the universe beauty pain
[1:07:25.260 --> 1:07:35.660]  exaltation humiliation it's all a giant experience it's it's it's god's dream becoming
[1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:42.540]  consciousness and life throughout the universe and free will but because that exists there is
[1:07:42.540 --> 1:07:48.060]  also those that will dial into very very bad things they can't create anything good they
[1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:56.380]  can only defile and so when women kill their babies or when women kill their babies after
[1:07:56.380 --> 1:08:01.020]  they're born or when women take their children to the trendy drag queen story time and it's
[1:08:01.020 --> 1:08:06.060]  incremental it's first them in dance for them and then give them books about sexualizing them
[1:08:06.060 --> 1:08:09.340]  and telling them what their future is going to be the parents probably haven't even done that but
[1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:13.340]  a weird man they don't know in a clown outfit's doing it next he shakes his butt the next time
[1:08:13.340 --> 1:08:17.340]  they come and talks about their booty and you know boys can be girls girls can be boys
[1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:22.620]  then he torques and shakes his butt and the kids come up and give him dollar bills the next time
[1:08:22.620 --> 1:08:26.940]  he spreads his legs and he's wearing underwear next he spreads his legs his genitals are hanging
[1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:33.980]  out we showed this last hour all over the country the exact same ritual the same dance they get on
[1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:40.140]  the table they spread their legs they put the children in their laps the mothers lay them on
[1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:51.820]  their crotches it's a public exercise of power it's a ritual it is a defiling you know you look
[1:08:51.820 --> 1:08:56.780]  at the classic satanic rituals and i'm not going to go into them here on air the compendium of the
[1:08:56.780 --> 1:09:00.620]  them but most people get into it because then you're going to get to have sex with hot chicks
[1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:04.860]  or whatever that's just low level that's like chicken feed to get the chickens into the weasel
[1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:10.860]  dens the weasel can eat you but it's all about humiliating people hurting people and it's all
[1:09:10.860 --> 1:09:17.900]  about defiling god and it came out the catholic church in pennsylvania alone this came out the
[1:09:17.900 --> 1:09:23.340]  report last year i almost no coverage but it was in the mainstream news 3000 plus priest in the
[1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:30.380]  the state police state report who had confessed to sex with children mainly little boys and that
[1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:36.940]  they would have black masses in the churches on friday nights and on halloween and things like that
[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:44.460]  where they would gang rape little boys and then they would give them the sacrament this is my
[1:09:44.460 --> 1:09:52.380]  body this is my this is my blood and in many cases they gave the little boys hiv so they
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:59.020]  didn't just rape them in the mouth and in the anus they would then give them a disease why do you
[1:09:59.020 --> 1:10:04.460]  think bill clinton for 15 years knowingly shipped out factor eight blood product with hiv and hepatitis
[1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:09.740]  in it they knew it had it in it and then when and the executives it turned out in their transcripts
[1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:15.900]  said good there's too many hemophiliacs it was a blood ritual to hurt so many people
[1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:23.180]  the hiv was created it was put in the hepatitis vaccines it was given to gay men in new york as
[1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:30.140]  a vector to spread it and they use these men that are their slaves today to spread this and to do
[1:10:30.140 --> 1:10:35.500]  all of this and this is the nature of evil these are rituals being conducted
[1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:43.020]  and so when vice has shows about pedophilia being a great thing they've done those
[1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:48.540]  or sex with bugs
[1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:56.540]  it's all about the filing your body and all about doing things that don't help anybody or
[1:10:56.540 --> 1:11:05.740]  anything except hurt you and it's the openness of our free society to the extreme to bring down
[1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:09.980]  our free society and the high priest running this whole thing now tell us your children belong to us
[1:11:09.980 --> 1:11:14.220]  your speech is ours you will do as we say your money is ours your guns are ours
[1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:22.780]  they want absolute total power and then you see the people that are their low level serbents
[1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:26.700]  they're just like out of the art type they are grimer worm tongues they are
[1:11:26.700 --> 1:11:40.700]  are renfields and what is renfield in brahm stoker's dracula what does renfield want he begs
[1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:52.700]  count dracula to be able to eat bugs and to be able to torture and kill rats
[1:11:52.700 --> 1:12:00.300]  rats and then he just handles the children for dracula and that's what these are these
[1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:06.220]  are just minions that they send out so let's do this let's just tear these back to back
[1:12:06.780 --> 1:12:10.060]  i'm not gonna hear the whole things the whole things are on info wars.com and news wars.com
[1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:15.740]  let's air part of the vice piece sex with bugs that alga zero says not wanted to eat and sex is
[1:12:15.740 --> 1:12:25.900]  racist and then eat a bug at the school for kids here in texas the museum and channel 12 so they're
[1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:34.540]  telling you it's it's time to lower yourselves it's time to defile yourselves it's time to become a
[1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:45.660]  renfield here it is you can hear the mealworms or superworms in this case uh squirming around in
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:52.300]  there uh renfield i'm just gonna take out a few for our demonstration purposes well there's a
[1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:57.740]  couple of things that you can easily do with them the first and foremost these superworms are an
[1:12:57.740 --> 1:13:06.940]  interesting sensation squirmy they move a fair bit and they have a sharp feet for gripping so this
[1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:15.980]  is an archetype superworms also of raping will bite i will put usually a bit of honey onto something
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:20.940]  that i onto an area i want them to bite yes i know other people who use juice from cooking hot dogs
[1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:28.540]  in the microwave then the earth just like guys use white trucks rinse these all candy puppies it's
[1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:38.700]  all an allegory now talk about the earthworms they feel very unnatural and you can feel that
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:47.500]  contracting and expanding against the skin oh there's certainly a taboo in the kink community
[1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:54.380]  around uh former kofilia play listen there's definitely folks who have concerns around consent
[1:13:55.020 --> 1:14:01.580]  i don't worry over much about issues of consent see it's about right about a maggot um because
[1:14:01.580 --> 1:14:09.180]  that maggot has no prior reasoning uh or thought process really of any kind um i very much don't
[1:14:09.180 --> 1:14:15.260]  feel that way about say my dog my dog clearly is capable of making decisions and doing all that
[1:14:15.260 --> 1:14:21.580]  hell he has power over something to do uh and thus her consent is important which is one of a
[1:14:21.580 --> 1:14:25.660]  myriad reasons why i would not have sex with my dog other than not being interested in sex with
[1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:31.180]  dog we were talking about anxiety earlier and i wish y'all could feel my heart beating right now
[1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:37.820]  oh no i'm gonna eat it off the floor it's a five second rule it's all psychological warfare
[1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:44.540]  against you and your family apparently these are flavored with text joy yeah what you're gonna give me
[1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:53.660]  if i eat this i need more than a sticker you see that i need more can i can i get a day off of work
[1:14:53.660 --> 1:15:00.940]  if i eat this hey that even tastes crunchy it's not bad cry put it in your mouth i'll do it with you
[1:15:00.940 --> 1:15:06.460]  put it in your mouth do a cheers okay it's all about getting access to your children what are the
[1:15:06.460 --> 1:15:12.060]  what did local news in uh houston say when the kids were coiling trying to run away from the
[1:15:12.060 --> 1:15:17.420]  men rest his clowns calling themselves drag queens they should gotta get them while they're young okay
[1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:26.380]  do so happily like in china korea mexico and india so the chutneys made out of ants and if you
[1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:31.100]  think about it we in the west eat some pretty weird stuff rotten milk with fuzzy blue mold spores
[1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:35.260]  fishes looking creatures with bdi's in large claws or pulverized animal flesh encased in the
[1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:39.100]  intestine of another animal so if we can eat all that why do some of us find bugs so gross
[1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:44.940]  is there a way to overcome that disgust these are actually really delicious and which bug tastes the
[1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:51.660]  best to find out my team and i headed to new york city to try tasting them for ourselves all three
[1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:56.140]  of us are in the frame again this is all about assaulting western culture they want to put taxes
[1:15:56.140 --> 1:15:59.420]  on all the meat and ban it they've all admitted well they're right but they're going to say it's

[1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:51.260]  you live from the front lines of the info war in the front seat it turned on the radio
[1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:59.020]  home and them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid contrago then i noticed the
[1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:05.100]  strength all right we just spent an hour and 20 minutes on the full out assault on america's
[1:21:05.100 --> 1:21:13.420]  children the children of the world men now flashing their genitals of children children
[1:21:13.420 --> 1:21:25.500]  riding on men and public schools elementary schools gay bars libraries but they're not gay
[1:21:25.500 --> 1:21:31.820]  bars are they they're pedophile bars now and that's the tolerance of america and the very
[1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:35.820]  tolerant groups that run all this are now telling us we don't have any speech they're gonna arrest us
[1:21:35.820 --> 1:21:40.620]  for our speech well we're gonna exercise our speech and we're gonna take action and
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:48.060]  we're gonna come out of the trance and go wait this little seven-year-old boy is gonna start
[1:21:48.060 --> 1:21:54.300]  chemicals to castrate him and finally at age 10 have his genitals cut off and there's video
[1:21:54.300 --> 1:22:01.180]  little boy saying he doesn't want it even if he wanted it that's mental illness that's that's
[1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:06.300]  if i wanted to cut my hand off they put me in a mental institution they put kanya weston one for
[1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:20.540]  two weeks because he put him in there for two weeks two weeks because he said he supported trump
[1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:26.780]  but if a mother likes to get publicity showboat or kid around
[1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:38.220]  why then she can get parts of the body chopped off the judge said but the governor got involved
[1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:45.260]  and that judge ran for the hills to see they're like hey this one will get away but if you make
[1:22:45.260 --> 1:22:50.380]  too much of attention to make this boy a martyr we're not gonna get to millions let him go we're
[1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:59.260]  gonna get all those and we'll get him later don't worry and they know the boys are gonna rebel later
[1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:03.180]  when their testicles are chopped off
[1:23:08.860 --> 1:23:12.860]  and so they drug them up real good make sure they commit suicide by about 18
[1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:21.660]  and the mission's completed and it's done so delicately it's so carefully my pretty
[1:23:24.860 --> 1:23:29.500]  because all of this must be done very in PR voice very delicately
[1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:34.700]  because you don't want your patient to wake up on the operating table
[1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:42.140]  while we take their soul and everything they ever were and ever would be with us forever
[1:23:43.900 --> 1:23:48.860]  because chopping their penises and testicles off is just a way to freak them out and screw them
[1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:56.140]  up so we can put them under psychiatric care and slowly depress them and use them as a slave
[1:23:56.140 --> 1:24:04.380]  until they finally die beautifully and the arms of satan forever oh it's so labor
[1:24:07.180 --> 1:24:13.580]  you see i show you their real soul just the surface it's much worse beneath there i really
[1:24:13.580 --> 1:24:20.780]  don't want to tune into it to you but you can't avoid it anymore because you can turn on the news
[1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:27.740]  you can walk down the street you can't go anywhere without their offensive
[1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:38.700]  i was in san diego a few months ago i was in a small town a few weeks ago outside austin
[1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:44.460]  and i walked in to little breakfast coffee shops two different times and there were big plastered
[1:24:44.460 --> 1:24:50.540]  signs for drag queen story time at the coffee shops and images of men and satanic at the clown
[1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:56.540]  war paint and children sitting on their lap just like a hunter mounts a moose head on the wall it
[1:24:56.540 --> 1:25:04.940]  was smiling like a pig and you know what then you looked a little piggy weirdos behind the counter
[1:25:04.940 --> 1:25:13.500]  and you're like boy that's a pita have i ever saw one and of course i don't eat food there i leave
[1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:19.740]  you think i want those dirty filthy hands touching those eggs
[1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:26.940]  oh they want the eggs all right
[1:25:29.980 --> 1:25:36.700]  ladies and gentlemen you're facing bona fide satanist they got a plan
[1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:46.540]  they got a general and they're coming for you and the question is what are you going to do about it
[1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:55.740]  because it isn't just something to when you watch fear factor and they're eating donkey testicles
[1:25:55.740 --> 1:26:00.300]  or eating beetles something gross to get ratings the people involved in it don't know what they're
[1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:05.180]  involved in at the time but if you read the ciad classified documents of all of it ugly architecture
[1:26:05.180 --> 1:26:11.020]  ugly culture ugliness like the joker movie ugliness ugliness ugliness so you give up on god
[1:26:11.660 --> 1:26:16.300]  when you can go out in the field and look at a tree and some birds and see a hawkland and you
[1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:20.060]  would have a connection to god or you go help somebody to have a connection to god even the
[1:26:20.060 --> 1:26:25.500]  ugliest place but instead it's just all meant to make you feel sorry for yourself and just give up on
[1:26:25.500 --> 1:26:37.020]  life and then right at that point here comes the devil along offering you sanctuary offering you
[1:26:37.020 --> 1:26:44.460]  shelter but it's not shelter at all it's induction into life isn't it tragedy like you thought
[1:26:45.420 --> 1:26:51.420]  embrace evil be part of the bad in the world kill your mother kill your children kill yourself
[1:26:51.420 --> 1:27:00.700]  it's a comedy be a joker but really it's not a joker it's the mouth of a predator
[1:27:03.260 --> 1:27:11.980]  see how that works and then they celebrate it's beautiful and cool and deep and powerful acting
[1:27:11.980 --> 1:27:22.460]  oh wow so big you think walkie being phoenix looks like a psycho killing people in that movie
[1:27:22.460 --> 1:27:28.700]  that's nothing like the real thing you think that guy looks scary
[1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:37.420]  you ought to see what those kids see when they're getting tortured for days begging for their mommy
[1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:42.380]  and you better remember all you know it's true and all you know it's happening
[1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:46.940]  and if you don't take action and speak out against these people and if you don't get involved it's
[1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:55.020]  on you and you will stand before god and if you haven't resisted this but all you did was
[1:27:55.020 --> 1:28:00.700]  glitterbug over at the church and act nice all day and act like you're a holy person god is going
[1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:10.220]  to throw you out of your ass and you're going to be out in the cold with the group you bowed down to
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:20.460]  for eternity and if you want to be exiled with these people then katie bar the door there's
[1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:24.860]  something wrong with you you know they spend all this time telling us there's no devil there's no
[1:28:24.860 --> 1:28:30.380]  evil in the universe but it's all around you and that's what they serve none of these people are

[1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:30.060]  survival is victory stay on the air and we win arrange everything needed to stay online and
[1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:36.220]  keep broadcasting your very existence means they can't monopolize the narrative you were born
[1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:43.340]  for the events unfolding over the next 13 months
[1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:51.180]  and i encourage that individual as well to stay on air and just keep fighting and how critical
[1:34:51.180 --> 1:35:00.220]  things are obviously i'm gonna stay on air as long as you keep us on air but the enemy is just
[1:35:00.220 --> 1:35:06.380]  enraged that they haven't been able to destroy us and they have tried to plant child porn on us
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:12.300]  they have tried to destroy my family they try to take my children they have done everything they
[1:35:12.300 --> 1:35:20.140]  can but god is there as a hedge of protection so please keep praying for info wars and whatever
[1:35:20.140 --> 1:35:26.940]  you do realize the power that you have when you tell people about articles and videos that you
[1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:35.740]  send out from news wars dot com or band on video or info wars dot com articles every day on every
[1:35:35.740 --> 1:35:41.020]  subject it's all there whatever you think is most important whether it's humor whether it's hardcore
[1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:45.820]  news or whether it's a special report share them from band on video
[1:35:48.780 --> 1:35:51.740]  and david knights talked about this i've talked about this a lot but we need to do it we're gonna
[1:35:51.740 --> 1:35:59.100]  start every week you'll do one i'll do one a subject on the federal reserve or a you know
[1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:03.100]  kind of like prager university informational videos and i've done a lot of those over the years
[1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:09.420]  that we're really going to go with that model more and set up things where it's just boom boom
[1:36:09.420 --> 1:36:16.060]  boom on the subjects five minute videos the fundamentals of how things work and just go down
[1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:27.580]  a line and it's an understatement to say you're keeping us on air i mean it's it's total and i
[1:36:27.580 --> 1:36:34.700]  gotta tell you i don't just want to stay on air i want to expand into 2020 i want to do some really
[1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:40.780]  important things i want to put aircraft up with messages that will get massive attention around
[1:36:40.780 --> 1:36:46.860]  the country and will have a huge critical effect and will trigger others to do things in 2020 that
[1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:51.820]  are decisive that i haven't announced yet but i don't have the money to do it and every time
[1:36:52.460 --> 1:36:58.060]  we start to go back into the black and i've got extra money my sense of urgency goes away and then
[1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:02.380]  we go into the red again literally in the past i would always have extra money to work with
[1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:08.780]  but the globalists have done a lot of stuff to try to stop us and i've you know i've helped a lot
[1:37:08.780 --> 1:37:14.780]  of people that i think are doing critical work with no strings attached a lot of groups a lot
[1:37:14.780 --> 1:37:18.700]  of organizations i mean pretty much anybody you can think of it's prominent we've cut big checks
[1:37:18.700 --> 1:37:26.460]  to with no strings attached and i don't like not being able to do that anymore i don't like being
[1:37:26.460 --> 1:37:33.820]  able to take the extra profit we have and not do things because i by the grace of god and discernment
[1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:38.380]  basically everything we've ever tried or done has had a huge effect some of it devastating
[1:37:38.380 --> 1:37:44.780]  to the globalist i mean devastating and i'm a lot smarter and wiser than i was five years ago
[1:37:44.780 --> 1:37:55.420]  ten years ago and to not have the capital to do the things i want to do is very frustrating
[1:37:57.260 --> 1:38:00.380]  so i'm going to go to your calls and go to all this news but i was going to make this very very
[1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:08.780]  clear a caller called in sunday and said i'm 61 marines i've been in months at the va i was dying
[1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:14.220]  i was going to die and boy they said no supplements no supplements which they had never taken
[1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:19.100]  and he got living defense
[1:38:21.820 --> 1:38:24.780]  and his gut problem went away and he's fine now he couldn't believe it
[1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:34.780]  well we just take stuff that you know people a thousand years ago in europe and five thousand
[1:38:34.780 --> 1:38:39.980]  years ago in china were taken to kill parasites in your gut okay and what we've been advertised is
[1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:42.940]  that it's just good to flush you out it's a lot of good herbs concentrated
[1:38:42.940 --> 1:38:55.100]  and you heard what the caller said and people bought now half of what we have left over
[1:38:55.980 --> 1:39:00.300]  but i'm not going to raise the price from 1995 even though we barely make any money at that because
[1:39:00.300 --> 1:39:06.860]  this is a high quality interstitial it's concentrated there's no fillers it's the real deal
[1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:14.700]  look at 100 reviews of living defense and i was just telling my general manager you know the guy
[1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:19.420]  that manages things for me good friend of mine been here 15 years i was just telling two weeks ago i
[1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:24.620]  said you know i don't know we'll have the money that reordered living defense next year because
[1:39:24.620 --> 1:39:30.380]  we you know we ordered 10 000 bottles of it at the beginning of last year or this year
[1:39:30.940 --> 1:39:35.420]  we're looking at the next year and i said we sold almost all of them at this point we got a few
[1:39:35.420 --> 1:39:44.140]  thousand bottles left and i don't know the money really to buy it into next year to have more for
[1:39:44.140 --> 1:39:48.540]  next year and people love this because i've got to pay bills now with money i'd use to buy more
[1:39:48.540 --> 1:39:53.420]  stuff in the future and then just showing up that guy calls in and we've sold out most of it now
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:40:02.940]  but that's just an example of what i'm talking about here and i need people to think hey we need
[1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:10.540]  to go get t-shirts at m4store.com and spread the word and support the broadcast we need to go get
[1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:14.620]  the ball caps we need to go sign up for the coffee and sign up for the fish oil and the turmeric
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:19.500]  things you're going to use all the time and for auto ship additional 10% off so you don't forget
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:24.060]  because this is really critical to fund plus our coffees right up there is some of the best you're
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:28.540]  going to taste different drugs for different folks but everybody says this is really delicious this
[1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:35.900]  is gourmet what why is it so inexpensive because we don't mark it up even 100% still the same price
[1:40:35.900 --> 1:40:40.140]  i've been selling it for 10 years they sell it under another name and Whole Foods in places for
[1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:43.820]  about five dollars a pound on average more so comes ten dollars more a pound and i wanted to undercut
[1:40:43.820 --> 1:40:49.980]  them so we make like six seven bucks maximum on a pound of this stuff never raised the price on it
[1:40:50.780 --> 1:40:55.020]  a lot of that's i guess my fault problems i've habituated everybody to only buy the product
[1:40:55.020 --> 1:41:02.540]  but when it's a really good price and so i've got to sell a ton of it again if i sell 40 million
[1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:08.620]  dollars worth of product in the year and i've done that before i've got 20 million to run this
[1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:13.660]  place and with bandwidth and crew and legal all things that's not enough money folks get on explain
[1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:22.860]  this vice gets billions a year and they're going bankrupt fox gets 250 million a year from mbc and
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:27.740]  everybody they're they're can't make money buzzfeed gets 400 million dollars a year they're
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:34.780]  going back just given to them just give it that's not 400 million dollars worth of you know of sales
[1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:38.140]  and then they've got you know 20 million dollar i mean 200 million dollars that's that's that's
[1:41:38.140 --> 1:41:45.340]  total money they get to spend so that's what i'm talking about here is info wars is is one of the
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:51.020]  most important resistance points in the world the enemy says it they know it they can't stand it and
[1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:55.580]  i don't want to put on airs here and say we're really important we just are you're important
[1:41:56.940 --> 1:42:04.620]  and i care about staying in this game 110 so i see that excitement by the listeners because

[1:43:02.860 --> 1:43:07.820]  sponsor of those guys that is critical as well please stay with us now what i'm about to say
[1:43:07.820 --> 1:43:12.300]  is incredibly obvious and i'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners
[1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:17.580]  i'm just taking the facts i own a chainsaw i've had it since i was in college and it's a great
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:23.100]  good old chainsaw and i've used it probably 500 times but a few times i've forgotten to oil it
[1:43:23.100 --> 1:43:29.020]  and it seizes up really quick and i feel like an idiot for not oiling it now imagine if somebody
[1:43:29.020 --> 1:43:34.940]  told me to put let's say super glue uh in the oil container on it it would seize up forever
[1:43:34.940 --> 1:43:39.740]  but only an evil person would do that well fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:43.260]  it's going to make it seize up and that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're
[1:43:43.260 --> 1:43:48.300]  doing it to hurt you and your family yes they're really evil iodine is like putting oil in the
[1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:53.180]  chainsaw to help with the gasoline and lubrication it's that simple i know you understand this but
[1:43:53.180 --> 1:43:57.980]  let's warn other people before it's too late it's part of the iodine conspiracy find out more at
[1:43:57.980 --> 1:44:03.660]  infowarestore.com and take action against the globalist carbons everywhere on this planet it's
[1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:10.940]  almost like we're carbon-based live forms folks ask me alex why do you have two different types
[1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:16.620]  of iodine well that's because different types of physiologies different types of metabolic
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:23.820]  systems and people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal
[1:44:23.820 --> 1:44:30.380]  iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure
[1:44:30.380 --> 1:44:36.380]  atomic iodine get both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other
[1:44:36.380 --> 1:44:43.340]  to family or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you
[1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:49.500]  to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's
[1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:56.700]  simple get your high quality iodine at infowarestore.com and help fund the info war infowarstore.com
[1:44:56.700 --> 1:45:01.260]  we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge
[1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:09.660]  both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off together we have strong disagreement on policy
[1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:14.140]  grounds and i hope there's diversity in policy here i don't care what your views are i hope you
[1:45:14.140 --> 1:45:18.300]  articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them that's important but we have something
[1:45:18.300 --> 1:45:23.100]  in common we have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together
[1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:28.940]  clinton deep state bag man comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to
[1:45:28.940 --> 1:45:34.220]  congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident
[1:45:34.220 --> 1:45:40.940]  he won't get indicted but word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him from my new
[1:45:40.940 --> 1:45:49.420]  home in new zealand i will oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to new zealand not so
[1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:53.980]  fast criminal we're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring hillary to justice as
[1:45:53.980 --> 1:45:59.660]  well because if we don't you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy but the
[1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:05.500]  american people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at info wars.com news wars.com
[1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:13.020]  and band video again i'm not talking down to the info wars audience but i've been banging my head
[1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:17.740]  against a wall for a long time on this and i'm talking about fluoride and i'm talking about
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:24.380]  i and i now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glass tron boat and you want to take
[1:46:24.380 --> 1:46:30.220]  it on the lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if you're a human being you've got to have
[1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:36.700]  oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well ladies and gentlemen the bad halogen is fluoride
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:40.700]  that's why in every western nation they put it in the water they're going to teach us christians
[1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:45.340]  lay down and die the chai comms don't put it in the water they'd execute you if you did that they
[1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:50.940]  put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan
[1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:56.060]  and intelligence and everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy at info wars
[1:46:56.060 --> 1:47:00.780]  store.com we have all the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself
[1:47:00.780 --> 1:47:06.060]  because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at info wars store.com
[1:47:06.060 --> 1:47:22.540]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:40.060]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:53.180]  all right i'm gonna go right to your calls ryan and jacob and kathryn and jill paul johnny black
[1:47:53.180 --> 1:48:00.940]  patriot and many many others that are patiently holding and falling out of the broadcast i'm
[1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:07.260]  trying to move through these as quickly as i can in the order that the calls were received now
[1:48:07.260 --> 1:48:14.700]  i had a whole show ready and then i saw more videos of men dresses women spreading their legs
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:20.380]  to children now with no underwear on and i had a convulsion on air which was real and people
[1:48:20.380 --> 1:48:25.100]  save us from pretty riveting radio in the first hour i'm totally exhausted right now and totally
[1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:30.620]  pissed off because this is unnatural it's evil it's out of control and they know it is they're
[1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:38.380]  just getting us ready for it and ganging up on us and taking our free speech i have stacks of news
[1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:43.340]  where they're shutting down people's free speech will johnson went down and to an elementary school
[1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:48.300]  yesterday in fact see if i meant to call will johnson last night this morning i was watching
[1:48:48.300 --> 1:48:53.340]  firepower last night with he and uh tom papper and i just didn't get around to it see if you can get
[1:48:53.340 --> 1:49:02.780]  johnson in here um to co-host with myself and uh constitutional lawyer famous lawyer norm pass
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:06.700]  can be a studio fourth hour see because we're already going to be talking about all these serial
[1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:10.860]  killers and people who now call themselves transgender maybe get him on the last 30 minutes
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:17.180]  with uh paddus here with us he can do that but then there's all this other news i mean there's just
[1:49:17.180 --> 1:49:25.580]  stacks of incredible stuff uh mainline media is questioning whether al bag daddy was killed wow i'm
[1:49:25.580 --> 1:49:29.900]  being sued for questioning public events and saying could it be staged and then the listeners don't
[1:49:29.900 --> 1:49:36.220]  believe something happens so we look at both angles but mainstream media can say they don't think
[1:49:36.220 --> 1:49:43.020]  that trump had killed al bag daddy you know as much as we've been lied to about some of the past
[1:49:43.020 --> 1:49:47.740]  that's totally normal to question that i don't think trump would do that that's not his style
[1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:51.500]  and he wouldn't want to have people having that over his head that they staged it
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:50:01.820]  i with most stuff that you see with trump it's real and we know that guy was deep state being
[1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:06.140]  protected by insiders in our government we know trump didn't tell anybody except select ribs so he
[1:50:06.140 --> 1:50:11.980]  could kill him i believe he was killed but it's totally reasonable to be like the russians everybody
[1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:17.180]  else and and and not believing it because we've been lied to so much that's completely healthy
[1:50:17.180 --> 1:50:23.180]  and normal we've got that where'd you hear this three years ago when she lost and then where did
[1:50:23.180 --> 1:50:28.940]  you hear it ongoing since then from sources that she still runs a democratic party runs the democratic
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:34.060]  party uh phone calls conference calls which is now confirmed and that she tells folks she's still
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:42.220]  running well info wars dot com steve wants an article long time clinton advisor hillary is running
[1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:48.700]  feels she was put on earth to be president yeah don't underestimate her evil her mental illness
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:52.860]  and how she still holds the purse strings she's suing me through these law firms that she runs

[1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:19.980]  that was just one of thousands of studies admitting this you know it's illegal to have even one part
[1:58:19.980 --> 1:58:25.580]  per billion in the water in places like california unless it's part of adding fluoride and then they
[1:58:25.580 --> 1:58:30.860]  have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals

[2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:27.420]  stay right there but here's a report john bound file this is very critical bag daddy was being left
[2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:35.260]  alone by the globalist and others that area of syria trump has stepped aside and had him destroyed
[2:00:35.260 --> 2:00:41.900]  bag daddy has been on the run for many years long before i took office
[2:00:43.900 --> 2:00:51.740]  but in my direction as commander-in-chief of the united states we obliterated his caliphate
[2:00:52.300 --> 2:01:00.300]  100% in march of this year today's events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue
[2:01:00.300 --> 2:01:11.900]  the remaining isis terrorists to their brutal end that also goes for other terrorist organizations
[2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:19.580]  he's ending what obama and hillary started their on record creating isis with saudi arabia
[2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:25.340]  and launching those attacks yes we do need to go after bag daddy and just like we went after
[2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:30.460]  bin laden uh while you were doing celebrity apprentice and we brought him to justice but
[2:01:30.460 --> 2:01:36.700]  that's how donald thinks you know he always looking for some because we don't gain anything now my
[2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:42.700]  next guest claims that back in 2011 that the u.s. military had a major major chance to kill or
[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:49.020]  capture al bag daddy but the bureaucracy put in place by the obama administration let him get away
[2:01:49.020 --> 2:01:53.980]  when the teams had actually located bag daddy and pinpointed into a house on the ground
[2:01:53.980 --> 2:01:59.260]  uh by that time us troops had told been told to get out of iraq they've been told to leave and so
[2:01:59.260 --> 2:02:03.660]  typically a raid that would have occurred that same night by an assault force a team of special
[2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:09.500]  forces guys going in there to extract a target uh from a compound they then had to essentially
[2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:14.860]  wait two weeks for the call to be made to allow these guys to go in and by that time he was gone
[2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:20.700]  bag daddy doesn't stay anywhere for two weeks trump staged a coup operation inside saudi arabia last
[2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:27.500]  year and remove the isis al qaeda backers and told saudi arabia if you do it again i'm going to kill
[2:02:28.300 --> 2:02:36.060]  the leader of saudi arabia we're going to remove you and they jumped and clicked their heels and
[2:02:36.060 --> 2:02:43.180]  said yes sir these are incredible times in saudi arabia there's never been anything quite like it
[2:02:43.180 --> 2:02:47.980]  the fact that they've been these very high profile establishment figures have been removed
[2:02:47.980 --> 2:02:52.700]  and very importantly the head of the national guard prince mitad bin abdallah has been removed
[2:02:52.700 --> 2:02:59.340]  relieved of his command that removes at a stroke the final obstacle to the crown prince having
[2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:04.300]  total control over the country washington post changes al bag daddy obituary headline after
[2:03:04.300 --> 2:03:13.900]  calling isis leader austere religious scholar austere what role did russia play in the operation
[2:03:13.900 --> 2:03:20.620]  why did trump not inform democratic leaders in congress why did he take a lot of credit
[2:03:20.620 --> 2:03:28.700]  to himself specifically alluding to the idea that baghdad's death was bigger than the death of
[2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:33.340]  osama bin lad the reality is we've walked away from the courage right at the time where they were
[2:03:33.340 --> 2:03:37.900]  giving us intelligence that apparently was key to this operational victory according to them
[2:03:37.900 --> 2:03:42.380]  and what my sources are telling me is that takes the counterterrorism pressure off isis and that
[2:03:42.380 --> 2:03:47.180]  risks an isis resurgence and so this may be as you said an operational tactical victory but
[2:03:47.180 --> 2:03:52.220]  strategically donald trump has set the fight against isis back significantly what is your reaction
[2:03:52.220 --> 2:03:56.940]  to the death of al baghdad well obviously it's a major milestone and it's one that we all should
[2:03:56.940 --> 2:04:03.100]  be welcoming quite plainly but it doesn't mean that the fight against isis is over and it doesn't
[2:04:03.100 --> 2:04:09.820]  mean that we can declare mission accomplished and and just walk away obama funded the arab spring
[2:04:09.820 --> 2:04:16.940]  obama funded the attempted islamic takeover through his cousin odinga in tinnya and then for the very
[2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:23.020]  democrats and deep staters and globalists that overthrew qaddafi put al qaeda in charge there
[2:04:23.020 --> 2:04:28.300]  took the weapons invaded syria bragged about it he stabilized the whole middle east in north
[2:04:28.300 --> 2:04:34.940]  africa to turn around and say that trump's gonna cause terror when the so-called terrorists say
[2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:39.980]  they're attacking us normally that a lot of them are globalists handled there's a bunch of cowards
[2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:45.500]  because we're in the middle east but the truth is the globalists have been working with saudi arabia
[2:04:45.500 --> 2:04:50.700]  to turn the world over to radical islam and trump is actually fighting it he's not playing games and
[2:04:50.700 --> 2:04:55.660]  getting our military out of the middle east is exactly what we need to do then if they attack us
[2:04:56.220 --> 2:05:01.180]  we blow the living hell out of them ladies and gentlemen but we have to pivot to communist china
[2:05:01.180 --> 2:05:10.940]  that is the main area folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:17.500]  because different types of physiology different types of metabolic systems and people will like
[2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:24.380]  different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types
[2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:30.700]  because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine
[2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:36.140]  get both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family
[2:05:36.140 --> 2:05:42.540]  or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be
[2:05:42.540 --> 2:05:48.460]  deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's
[2:05:48.460 --> 2:05:54.780]  simple get your high quality iodine in four store dot com and help fund the info war info war store
[2:05:54.780 --> 2:06:00.220]  dot com we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge
[2:06:00.220 --> 2:06:16.140]  both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off together
[2:06:16.140 --> 2:06:30.540]  live from austin texas it's alex jones alexander vidman and his twin brother
[2:06:31.260 --> 2:06:36.860]  they're from ukraine they look at his background big liberal big democrat and he's one of the
[2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:41.420]  supposed people that heard trump on the call say things were wrong funny there's all these
[2:06:41.420 --> 2:06:48.780]  witnesses in a transcript trump would never do that so there you go that's what's going on there
[2:06:48.780 --> 2:06:55.740]  and here's what one of the president's former top lawyers under bush john you had to say about it
[2:06:56.940 --> 2:07:01.740]  national security official his name is lieutenant colonel alexander vidman he's going to tell
[2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:07.100]  impeachment investigators tomorrow and a statement that's been distributed to uh some media outlets
[2:07:07.100 --> 2:07:13.180]  that he twice reported objections over trump's call with ukraine but get this this is buried in
[2:07:13.180 --> 2:07:17.500]  the new york timespiece tonight but i found it very interesting um he's a he's a decorated
[2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:23.260]  colonel by the way in the iraq war but because colonel vindeman emigrated from ukraine along
[2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:28.940]  with his family when he was a child and his fluent in ukrainian and russian ukrainian officials
[2:07:28.940 --> 2:07:37.100]  sought advice from him about how to deal with mr juliani though they typically communicated in english
[2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:47.740]  now wait a second john here we have a us national security official who is advising ukraine
[2:07:47.740 --> 2:07:54.220]  while working inside the white house apparently against the president's interest and usually
[2:07:54.220 --> 2:08:01.340]  they spoke in english isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story i find that
[2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:08.540]  astounding and and you know some people might call that espionage folks the whole new world
[2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:17.260]  order system is espionage against the country globalism is against our country existing
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:24.060]  when trump said we're nationalists and we should be proud of america in his houston speech
[2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:33.020]  last year the national story for a week was that it was white supremacism
[2:08:33.980 --> 2:08:37.500]  but the nation existing is evil let's let's go to your calls i'm gonna go to them fast now
[2:08:38.060 --> 2:08:40.780]  no matter how good the calls are i gotta get to the next person and move on from there
[2:08:40.780 --> 2:08:47.500]  who's been holding the longest is it jill is it paul is it johnny it's a black patriot is it andrew
[2:08:47.500 --> 2:08:56.860]  is it x dalis chip brian the longest-holding person would be paul then we've got a black
[2:08:56.860 --> 2:09:03.260]  patriot jay and others uh go ahead paul in ohio thanks for calling welcome hey alex i love you
[2:09:03.260 --> 2:09:10.300]  you're a brother um i pray for you and your organization um i'm a long-time listener never
[2:09:10.300 --> 2:09:16.060]  called in before but um i've been buying your product since you rolled out silver bullet
[2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:23.180]  and i take quite a few of them i'm in my fifties now but i feel like i'm back in my thirties been
[2:09:23.180 --> 2:09:32.860]  excellent um bodies are amazing uh what i called in about was i've been i can't get this off my
[2:09:32.860 --> 2:09:40.700]  mind i've been thinking about a deep state hail mary and this would be a scenario where
[2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:48.140]  it doesn't really matter who but let's say elizabeth warren is the is the uh candidate
[2:09:48.140 --> 2:09:56.940]  and she gets like an andrew yang as a vp so they go through those months of you know town halls and
[2:09:56.940 --> 2:10:07.820]  debating trump um getting vetted by the media so forth and then they uh they hold a town hall
[2:10:07.820 --> 2:10:17.020]  it's like a big left media um event where warren and yang are on stage with maybe a rachel matta
[2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:23.580]  or uh anderson cooper or boat and they got the transgender basketball star in the front row
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:32.060]  and were maybe 20 30 days out from voting day and all of a sudden a maga hat wearing patsy
[2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:40.220]  rushes the stage and maybe maybe shoots it up maybe blows it up but literally takes out warren
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:46.940]  and yang and your media star rachel matta uh maybe the transgender basketball star too
[2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:58.060]  and now we have a national crisis but the left has no interest in delaying or postponing the
[2:10:58.060 --> 2:11:06.220]  election because they'll say that would make trump a dictator and so in that last few days
[2:11:06.220 --> 2:11:11.100]  before voting day they have a new emergency meeting of the dnc and hillary is nominated
[2:11:11.100 --> 2:11:20.140]  or or i think michelle oh yes even because this way she that way there's no vetting there's no
[2:11:20.140 --> 2:11:25.340]  time for her to face the scrutiny no one questioning after the great loss i i bet money they've got
[2:11:25.340 --> 2:11:30.540]  scenarios like that on the on the blackboard i mean that is exactly the type of crap they pull
[2:11:31.340 --> 2:11:37.740]  yeah and see so there's michelle and you know she's popular and you know there's people that
[2:11:37.740 --> 2:11:44.380]  are leaning to trump but would maybe vote for michelle if she was the candidate and then she
[2:11:44.380 --> 2:11:50.860]  sweeps into office with an unprecedented mandate to go after because this guy once they find out
[2:11:50.860 --> 2:11:55.740]  who he is he's gonna have an alex jones tattoo on his back and there was an air 15 in the trunk
[2:11:55.740 --> 2:12:01.820]  of his car that's plastered with info war stickers and they're going to have a mandate to pursue
[2:12:01.820 --> 2:12:08.220]  you know anybody right of mouth shut down info wars you know really and that's why we've got to come
[2:12:08.220 --> 2:12:14.300]  out immediately when they staged stuff like this because we know they staged um texas in ohio there
[2:12:14.300 --> 2:12:18.700]  were real shooters but they were both antifa said they were going to do it the police stood down in
[2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:24.060]  both cases uh and it was carried out to blame gun owners i mean they were both antifa and they
[2:12:24.060 --> 2:12:28.860]  successfully covered it up in texas they did in ohio they they call the police on him more than a
[2:12:28.860 --> 2:12:34.620]  dozen times he said i'm a devil worshipper i'm gonna go kill a bunch of people uh we're gonna get
[2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:40.380]  i mean it's incredible yes exactly well that's definitely the type of scenario they pull are
[2:12:40.380 --> 2:12:45.420]  they might just detonate a small nuke inside the capital they may shoot up the republicans that
[2:12:45.980 --> 2:12:50.940]  at a baseball game again uh before they do something that elaborate they may just kill
[2:12:50.940 --> 2:12:57.420]  president trump you know claim that al qaeda had a you know serviced air missile and somehow it got
[2:12:57.420 --> 2:13:02.300]  through the defenses and blew up the president's helicopter i mean there's no but i'm just telling
[2:13:02.300 --> 2:13:07.100]  you they're wild eyed they're out of control their pedophile rings are getting busted everywhere the
[2:13:07.100 --> 2:13:12.940]  fbis releasing all this classified info about giant pedophile rings the finders i mean trump is
[2:13:12.940 --> 2:13:18.220]  definitely the real deal and that has got the system in in total panic but trump needs to act
[2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:24.780]  decisively uh so that people know that he's in command with the indictments and with uh antitrust
[2:13:24.780 --> 2:13:29.260]  and all and all the election meddling against big tech or he's going to keep emboldening them he
[2:13:29.260 --> 2:13:34.140]  can't play games uh with them like oh he thinks he's going to win at the election they are going to
[2:13:34.140 --> 2:13:38.540]  make their move the next 13 months they're already doing it they're making their move on every front
[2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:43.260]  with hail mary's and i totally agree with you god bless you how do you think we stop it he's gone
[2:13:43.980 --> 2:13:50.460]  great caller uh let's go to black patreon alabama thanks for calling sir hey alex um

[2:24:11.020 --> 2:24:15.500]  the urgency of my voice on every front uh because we're they're breathing down our throat if you
[2:24:15.500 --> 2:24:20.380]  support us it's no problem but this is very serious and i think about what they're doing to children
[2:24:20.380 --> 2:24:24.140]  right now i think what they're gonna do in the future and i get angry i want to stay in the fight
[2:24:24.140 --> 2:24:27.580]  i want to be stronger than ever and i'm in your hands but i'm gonna stop plugging now i want to
[2:24:27.580 --> 2:24:33.340]  get to all these calls that are uh holding here uh black patriot any other points alex i just want
[2:24:33.340 --> 2:24:39.660]  to say uh it's an honor to talk to you uh and to your listeners if you listen to alex religiously
[2:24:40.300 --> 2:24:46.380]  but you haven't bought any products and you don't support the operation uh there's something

[2:26:23.020 --> 2:26:27.580]  saying we're the twisted ones and we're the races and if you're just going to sit on the sideline

[2:26:40.380 --> 2:26:44.300]  country is in trouble and we've recognized this in trouble and we're trying to turn that around
[2:26:44.300 --> 2:26:50.140]  and to see the federal reserve try to crash the economy to watch the left praise that
[2:26:50.140 --> 2:26:53.820]  to watch them defend i mean i haven't even gotten to this because i want to go to your calls but
[2:26:53.820 --> 2:26:59.820]  i've got npr audio the articles on info wars dot com where they sycophantically for five minutes
[2:26:59.820 --> 2:27:07.740]  praise alex bag daddy and where they talk about how bad trump is i mean it's just bizarre
[2:27:08.700 --> 2:27:13.900]  it's totally bizarre and it shows who these people are okay uh joshua in virginia thanks
[2:27:13.900 --> 2:27:19.900]  for holding joshua you're on the air hey alex i've been listening since 2016 i wanted to
[2:27:19.900 --> 2:27:24.860]  say keep up the great work thank you um so i just wanted the reason i'm calling uh i have i've
[2:27:24.860 --> 2:27:30.060]  noticed i have a lot of friends in the military and i have a lot of friends in general who
[2:27:30.060 --> 2:27:34.140]  are kind of taking a liberal stance they're they're kind of like well we hate trump and we hate the
[2:27:34.140 --> 2:27:39.100]  left but the the message i'm trying to get out to them is that right now it's a fact donald
[2:27:39.100 --> 2:27:43.820]  trump is the only thing that's keeping us from socialism and what what a lot of them are upset
[2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:49.420]  about is uh donald trump and gun control so i was wondering if maybe you could kind of you know how
[2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:54.860]  could we tell how could we get the message out to donald trump that we're not okay about banning
[2:27:54.860 --> 2:27:58.940]  bump stocks because that kind of creates a slippery slope now you're right trump really
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:03.100]  hurt himself with the bump stock and then and then when he said we'll look at red flags which he
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:10.060]  was advised to do that was insane and that put a big chink in his armor uh and he's backed off
[2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:15.100]  that now and says they're not gonna do it but that doesn't get the coverage and so uh he got advised
[2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:20.060]  to like during the crisis of those shootings to go you know okay maybe we'll look at that just to
[2:28:20.060 --> 2:28:24.460]  dissipate criticism he should have gone after the gun grabbers the gun confiscators he should have
[2:28:24.460 --> 2:28:29.660]  said this is mental illness these guys are antifa but he had bad advisors that told him to do that
[2:28:30.540 --> 2:28:36.300]  and uh he really screwed the pooch uh but like you said he's light years better than hillary
[2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:41.340]  he's doing so many other good things uh and i totally and absolutely agree with you stay there
[2:28:41.340 --> 2:28:47.100]  josh you want to get your take on what he should do uh but the big thing is urgency he's got the
[2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:51.500]  neocons he's got the chikons got the democrats hollywood he's got all these people that want to sit
[2:28:51.500 --> 2:28:55.740]  on the fence because they don't like pressure acting like they don't like trump they use excuses like
[2:28:55.740 --> 2:29:00.460]  that to not supporting those folks better stop it right now the democrats are saying they're
[2:29:00.460 --> 2:29:07.180]  going to take all the guns all up door to door if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many
[2:29:07.180 --> 2:29:13.100]  drugs listen to me you don't know me and we'll never meet i had a problem like you once i drank

[2:30:29.660 --> 2:30:34.620]  then once you've learned about it protect yourself and your family the reason i'm so hot on this is
[2:30:34.620 --> 2:30:39.740]  the globalist put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine in china they
[2:30:39.740 --> 2:30:43.900]  put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under
[2:30:43.900 --> 2:30:50.540]  their control the globalists are targeting us here please go to info or store.com experience iodine
[2:30:50.540 --> 2:30:55.420]  and bio tricillinium that goes with it together and then once you see the great results warn others
[2:30:55.420 --> 2:30:59.740]  this is the achilles hill of the globalist it's a win-win situation the only way you lose is not
[2:30:59.740 --> 2:31:09.820]  taking action take action now again i'm not talking down to the info wars audience but
[2:31:09.820 --> 2:31:14.940]  i've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and i'm talking about fluoride
[2:31:14.940 --> 2:31:21.580]  and i'm talking about iodine now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glass tron boat
[2:31:21.580 --> 2:31:27.740]  and you want to take it on the lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if you're a human being
[2:31:27.740 --> 2:31:34.140]  you've got to have oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well ladies and gentlemen the bad halogen
[2:31:34.140 --> 2:31:38.220]  is fluoride that's why in every western nation they put it in the water they're going to teach
[2:31:38.220 --> 2:31:42.460]  us christians lay down and die the chai comms don't put it in the water they'd execute you
[2:31:42.460 --> 2:31:47.980]  get at that they put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility
[2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:53.500]  and lifespan and intelligence and everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy
[2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:58.300]  at info or store.com we have all the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for
[2:31:58.300 --> 2:32:03.500]  yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at info or
[2:32:03.500 --> 2:32:14.860]  store.com hello here my name is Bethelman i work for my father lucifer and he doesn't like the fact
[2:32:14.860 --> 2:32:21.820]  that god gave you all families and children and so we want to tell you something right now
[2:32:21.820 --> 2:32:27.020]  christian countries we took control of you over a hundred years ago we've been spiking your water
[2:32:27.020 --> 2:32:33.820]  with fluoride and lower your fertility and it hurts you and it's worked so well but now because of
[2:32:33.820 --> 2:32:39.100]  liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening the journal of
[2:32:39.100 --> 2:32:44.380]  american medical association and others are admitting what we've done and it makes me so angry so
[2:32:44.380 --> 2:32:49.100]  whatever you do just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children
[2:32:51.180 --> 2:32:56.860]  and don't visit info or store.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60 off on
[2:32:56.860 --> 2:33:05.100]  x2 and x3 together with bio-persilidium from the mustard seed submit to us info or store.com
[2:33:05.100 --> 2:33:24.780]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:26.780 --> 2:33:34.620]  you are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[2:33:34.620 --> 2:33:35.900]  you are the resistance
[2:33:41.420 --> 2:33:45.900]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide i'm your host alex jones we're taking your phone calls right
[2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:52.380]  now and all hell's breaking loose and now we know all the fake whistleblowers are just a
[2:33:52.380 --> 2:33:59.420]  bunch of anti-trump insiders lying saying they heard things that never happened big surprise
[2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:07.420]  we know they're gonna do more of it it's gonna get a lot worse the way i've seen them
[2:34:07.420 --> 2:34:13.260]  doctor stuff about myself in the nose where you think you know they lie but when they do entire
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:24.060]  compendiums i mean here's an example there's a big article out today saying that i agreed to
[2:34:24.060 --> 2:34:32.780]  speak at stanford college and that i then canceled it
[2:34:35.980 --> 2:34:38.140]  and they write the article like it's a true story
[2:34:41.020 --> 2:34:45.500]  and they know 90 of people only look at the headlines at the bottom they say it's satire
[2:34:46.140 --> 2:34:49.740]  and i went and looked it up turns out that school paper doesn't do satire and people are going what
[2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:55.820]  is this fake news what is this but it's like that stuff every day
[2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:04.460]  and so it's one thing to deal with lies but to deal with completely fabricated things
[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:15.260]  they take your life over having to respond to the disinformation and then you don't even know
[2:35:15.260 --> 2:35:21.980]  what's true anymore because there's so much lying so when a president who's done a really good job
[2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:29.820]  doing what he said he'd do overall says they killed al-Baghdadi nobody believes it because
[2:35:30.700 --> 2:35:32.620]  the enemies of the president are such liars
[2:35:35.500 --> 2:35:41.100]  but trump would never go do something like that and say it was fake because that's not
[2:35:41.100 --> 2:35:46.380]  how he operates a but b he knows the people around him can't be trusted if it was a pr thing to help
[2:35:46.380 --> 2:35:52.140]  us get out of that war and make us feel good he can't trust them to pull something off like that
[2:35:52.700 --> 2:35:59.340]  that's not his style i wouldn't do it that's why they really fear info wars getting to the president
[2:35:59.340 --> 2:36:04.940]  they admit this in the news internal documents came out the general kelly said do not let him see
[2:36:04.940 --> 2:36:10.380]  alex jones or his articles or paul watson keep it away because the president already knew what i
[2:36:10.380 --> 2:36:21.900]  was saying was true he clicks were sympatica a lot alike and trump's a lot like just average americans
[2:36:24.220 --> 2:36:29.100]  doesn't have an elitist attitude he's got a masculine attitude a confident attitude
[2:36:30.300 --> 2:36:36.220]  a manly attitude a straight shooting attitude so i don't think trump would stage that but i mean
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:41.580]  i see it all over the news saying it's fake with no evidence but that's good because we shouldn't
[2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:50.780]  believe anything not from trump but from these people see they can't have their cake and eat it too
[2:36:53.660 --> 2:36:59.900]  mainstream media is a joke and they know they are but all they can do now is just disrupt with
[2:36:59.900 --> 2:37:04.300]  incredible lies and take our time up responding to them so more and more i'm just not responding
[2:37:04.300 --> 2:37:09.900]  to the stuff every i mean literally i get google alerts and there's 20 30 40 50 articles a day
[2:37:09.900 --> 2:37:13.500]  sometimes it's syndicated in thousands of publications you know a big lie they'll put
[2:37:13.500 --> 2:37:17.020]  everywhere so just remember that that
[2:37:22.940 --> 2:37:25.500]  they went and said that i lost a sandy hook lawsuit
[2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:31.260]  for a book called nobody died at sandy hook that i wasn't in that i didn't read that i'm not a part
[2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:40.300]  of in the associated press and wall street journal and they use that to sure up g2 credit rating
[2:37:40.300 --> 2:37:47.580]  agency in boston because they know we're getting ready to sue to put in the news in my credit that
[2:37:47.580 --> 2:37:54.620]  i lost a major judgment the lawsuit and none of it's true so that they can hurt my corporate
[2:37:54.620 --> 2:38:00.220]  credit rating in case i try to go borrow money and so they can take our merchant accounts away
[2:38:00.220 --> 2:38:06.940]  and take our good uh money transfer right away for credit card processing which they did that cost us
[2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:14.380]  half a million dollars a year basically tripled the amount i mean these people are evil ladies and
[2:38:14.380 --> 2:38:19.100]  gentlemen and now they're doing that to the nra you see it's alex jones last year now it's the
[2:38:19.100 --> 2:38:26.460]  nra these people are coming for everything and a lot of folks even the nra kind of halfway rolled
[2:38:26.460 --> 2:38:29.900]  over and said we don't want to be political now we don't want to be so close to trump
[2:38:29.900 --> 2:38:34.460]  defending him you saw all those internal fights there the global sample traded the nra all hell
[2:38:34.460 --> 2:38:44.300]  broke loose i can't tell you the details of it i was foreign to secrecy but the nra is still a
[2:38:44.300 --> 2:38:50.220]  good organization but all their big political stuff that was hardcore that was all terminated
[2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:56.860]  in a big internal fight inside of it because they're using spies to go into organizations
[2:38:56.860 --> 2:39:00.220]  it's actual espionage okay
[2:39:05.340 --> 2:39:10.460]  it's bad first they offer people that know me money then they start digging into them
[2:39:10.460 --> 2:39:15.180]  and start threatening them and by the grace of god only a few people have lied about me
[2:39:17.820 --> 2:39:21.260]  i'm pretty proud of the folks i've been around over the years but you talk about
[2:39:21.260 --> 2:39:29.500]  Judas Iscariot folks i mean these people these people are pure evil okay pure not not part evil
[2:39:29.500 --> 2:39:33.740]  they love it all right i'm gonna shut up joshua in virginia
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:39.500]  you're right trump coming out and saying yeah we'll look at red flags that's his tactic to try to
[2:39:39.500 --> 2:39:43.660]  take away from the gun grabbers and then so they'll come out and want everything and say let's ban
[2:39:43.660 --> 2:39:48.380]  all the guns that's his tactic but i said i didn't like that tactic because if people take him very
[2:39:48.380 --> 2:39:54.460]  literally uh and i think it hurt trump how does he really how does he rehabilitate that so uh what
[2:39:54.460 --> 2:40:00.140]  i would do definitely not before the election under the assumption trump takes 2020 what i would do
[2:40:00.140 --> 2:40:05.100]  is i would actually go the opposite route going further loosen gun laws now that might sound
[2:40:05.100 --> 2:40:09.740]  a little bit crazy but listen no no that's what texas did that's what texas has done absolutely
[2:40:10.700 --> 2:40:14.940]  yeah they look at the mexican drug cartel they've got 50 cal machine guns they've got grenade
[2:40:14.940 --> 2:40:19.260]  launchers look at uh chicago they've got they've got rocket launchers and machine guns down there
[2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:25.100]  absolutely so at this point time all that's going to do is that's going to arm the good guys with
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:29.500]  the right materials that they would need in case we you know we have something like the drug and
[2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:35.340]  that gets us going in the right direction uh of uh getting rid of all the hoaxes and not putting
[2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:40.380]  up with the gun control issues the democrat every city they run is like you know as bad a crime
[2:40:40.380 --> 2:40:47.260]  rate as mexico absolutely we should get on the offense not be on the defense absolutely what else
[2:40:47.260 --> 2:40:53.420]  should president trump do i mean i agree he should call for national uh reciprocation national
[2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:59.820]  concealed carry um and i mean i think that's the way to go because as you said mexico has a total
[2:40:59.820 --> 2:41:04.540]  prohibition on civilian ownership of firearms they have the highest crime rate in the world well
[2:41:04.540 --> 2:41:09.180]  then maybe maybe he shouldn't go on the offense after the election maybe he should go on it now i
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:14.300]  mean he's all he already is he's already going after a crooked democrats trying to expose them
[2:41:14.300 --> 2:41:20.140]  i think now's the time to go on offense and show his support base right exactly where he stands the
[2:41:20.140 --> 2:41:23.900]  same reason he got well i totally agree with you i've been saying trump should come out and say
[2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:28.700]  these people are antifa they covered it up they're mentally ill their devil worshipers keep doing this
[2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:34.060]  the answer is guns to stop these type of scumbags uh you know the the idiot in florida that killed
[2:41:34.060 --> 2:41:39.660]  all those people the the fbi had been called three times the police 44 times he was called
[2:41:39.660 --> 2:41:43.820]  the school shooter he went around saying he's gonna kill people he was expelled from school when it
[2:41:43.820 --> 2:41:50.540]  happened my gosh i mean that cruise guy was a freaking demon and but notice they had liberal
[2:41:50.540 --> 2:41:56.300]  law in florida and in broward county they were enforcing it where if you had a name that wasn't
[2:41:56.300 --> 2:42:02.220]  a a anglo-saxon uh surname he had the name cruise even though he was white he was adopted by his
[2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:07.580]  panics both his parents have recently died he was a white kid that he committed all these
[2:42:07.580 --> 2:42:12.700]  crimes but he couldn't go to jail because they passed laws to try to rehabilitate some minorities
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:19.100]  don't go to jail he literally had to get out of jail free card yeah it's sick and i and i see all
[2:42:19.100 --> 2:42:25.260]  the time uh you know in democratic you know poor income areas they're shooting zero all the time
[2:42:25.260 --> 2:42:29.900]  no one has anything to say about that not a thing well members cnn is caught on tape by veritas
[2:42:29.900 --> 2:42:34.540]  saying we don't want to make it big as those are democrat areas we only do it in republican areas
[2:42:34.540 --> 2:42:41.740]  we only hype it up right right because if there's 2 000 killed a year in chicago on average 95
[2:42:41.740 --> 2:42:46.780]  percent of them black black on black they don't want to humanize that because 2 000 dead there well
[2:42:46.780 --> 2:42:51.740]  how's that look with 20 something dead at walmart see that blessed you great points i absolutely
[2:42:51.740 --> 2:42:58.540]  properties to go on the offense offense offense major misstep with that tactic i just explained

[2:43:17.980 --> 2:43:23.260]  lowered icu's massive infertility and a lot of babies dying the womb and it causes cancer that
[2:43:23.260 --> 2:43:27.980]  was just one of thousands of studies admitting this you know it's illegal to have even one part
[2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:33.580]  per billion in the water in places like california unless it's part of adding fluoride and then they
[2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:38.860]  have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals
[2:43:38.860 --> 2:43:44.540]  love you and they want to sexualize your children so whatever you do drink lots of fluoride and
[2:43:44.540 --> 2:43:51.020]  don't get the thing that counters an iodine at infowarstore.com drink fluoride and die drink

[2:44:18.860 --> 2:44:25.260]  this place together clinton deep state bag man comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:30.140]  and that he lied to congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if
[2:44:30.140 --> 2:44:36.940]  he acts confident he won't get indicted but word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him

[2:46:17.660 --> 2:46:25.580]  body if people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to live the engine
[2:46:25.580 --> 2:46:30.220]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it but it would seize up the engine
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:35.580]  pretty much instantly well if they put fluoride in the human body it causes cancer dumps us down
[2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:40.860]  and destroys fertility if you put the good halogen in the body high quality iodine it's like putting

[2:49:00.700 --> 2:49:05.740]  to the board so i wanted to thank you very much well thank you listen the churches are designed
[2:49:05.740 --> 2:49:09.580]  to turn you off from god they're the biggest concentration of evil you're going to find on
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:15.260]  average and i'm just i'm just saying all we got to do is like christ said call out to god god is
[2:49:15.260 --> 2:49:20.380]  all about free will and then god will touch us and it's just the power and and and and even their
[2:49:20.380 --> 2:49:25.180]  cultists will tell you the name jesus is what all these things flee from and that's why they're
[2:49:25.180 --> 2:49:29.740]  trying to eradicate it it's why they're persecuting it and look at the manifestation of evil openly
[2:49:29.740 --> 2:49:37.420]  coming out to the children this is textbook biblical i know and it's disgusting and it's
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:43.660]  giving me a new sound fire of course i'm gonna i'm going to strengthen myself before i start
[2:49:43.660 --> 2:49:48.220]  speaking out and doing what i can down here in canada but uh thank you very much well thank you
[2:49:48.220 --> 2:49:53.420]  no please are you kidding uh i'm a very humble person just like you and i've done wicked things
[2:49:53.420 --> 2:49:59.100]  and i'm not the thing is we love god and we don't want to be part of this this energy force
[2:49:59.100 --> 2:50:04.460]  that is trying to take over and it's energetic we just have to decide spiritually which side
[2:50:04.460 --> 2:50:10.700]  we're going to go with you cannot be in the middle you have to choose a side yes absolutely and i
[2:50:10.700 --> 2:50:16.860]  felt the calling to come come back to god and well that's wonderful news and um it's all because
[2:50:16.860 --> 2:50:20.860]  of you so thank you so much well please it's not because of me it's because the holy spirit
[2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:29.980]  no but you know you your your manliness and your fortitude um helped a lot and i i was
[2:50:30.540 --> 2:50:37.660]  in contact with you and listening to you like 18 years ago and um after that there was a lot
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:43.180]  that went on in my life that caused me to backslide as you said the church and everything but um i
[2:50:43.180 --> 2:50:48.940]  didn't lose my faith it was just you lost your faith in the corrupt system oh yeah most these
[2:50:48.940 --> 2:50:55.740]  churches are just filled with evil that's because the devil knows to get control of that absolutely
[2:50:55.740 --> 2:51:01.820]  because i was uh indefinitely studying the bible and i went to college and i got right up to the
[2:51:01.820 --> 2:51:08.540]  master's degree and i was seeing so much that was being twisted and put towards the pastor or other
[2:51:08.540 --> 2:51:15.020]  people's own interest and i just couldn't abide by it so i had to leave well i'll tell you what's
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:21.020]  happening is i've i believe in god i've had spiritual experiences but it's the world it's
[2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:24.780]  what's happening the microchips are being announced for the brain the attack on the
[2:51:24.780 --> 2:51:28.700]  children the world government's all being announced and as the spirit of evil comes in it's
[2:51:28.700 --> 2:51:33.180]  Newtonian physics and god designed this for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction well
[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:38.300]  as evil comes in the world god's spirits coming in as well and so energetically
[2:51:39.660 --> 2:51:44.700]  a lot of people fall away because energetically they weren't picking up on it now you cannot miss it
[2:51:44.700 --> 2:51:50.620]  i mean now it's just the psychic energy just is just explosive right now everybody can feel it
[2:51:50.620 --> 2:51:55.980]  everybody can see it and that's why people that are serving the dark side are just becoming
[2:51:55.980 --> 2:52:01.180]  animated with wickedness because it's powerful it's real it's it's coming into the world right now
[2:52:02.540 --> 2:52:06.620]  it absolutely is but i'm so pleased that the lord called me back to him
[2:52:07.340 --> 2:52:11.980]  absolutely because we can't control the psychic powers we all have the only the holy spirit
[2:52:11.980 --> 2:52:18.540]  can be asked in and then then god is in control man is fallen we cannot control this level of power
[2:52:18.540 --> 2:52:23.180]  and that's all it means to be fallen is that we have not gotten anywhere near the level of being
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:30.780]  able to even imagine how advanced we already are we are incredible but we are babies we're like babies
[2:52:30.780 --> 2:52:36.380]  with any matter weapons or something i mean we can do anything look what we've already built
[2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:40.300]  and we're babies we're not even out of the crib right now look at what we built do you have any
[2:52:40.300 --> 2:52:47.980]  idea how powerful you are sorry go ahead and finish up no no i do i do um i do understand how
[2:52:47.980 --> 2:52:57.420]  powerful we are because i've had many um visions when i was before and then they started to pour in
[2:52:57.420 --> 2:53:03.500]  again and that's because the evil's making us move god bless you i can talk to you for hours i
[2:53:03.500 --> 2:53:10.060]  gotta get to everybody please call again look everybody's feeling it it's here folks let me
[2:53:10.060 --> 2:53:14.620]  tell you the evil is scared evil feels god that's why evil wants to get god out of the world because
[2:53:14.620 --> 2:53:21.420]  evil feels that power and and and it's like whoa it's pretty awesome well if you openly serve evil
[2:53:21.420 --> 2:53:27.500]  it's frightening and so they want to declare they have power over god by doing the worst things they
[2:53:27.500 --> 2:53:34.940]  can hurting children as just a total act of self-destruction to them to their own selves the
[2:53:34.940 --> 2:53:39.900]  devil wants to make sure they're destroyed so the devil promises them if you go out and make it all
[2:53:39.900 --> 2:53:44.620]  about yourself and hurt innocent people you will be given power and you look at these people they
[2:53:44.620 --> 2:53:50.380]  look like dead zombies they're not being given power that's the big con of this thing no one in
[2:53:50.380 --> 2:53:55.740]  their right mind would serve satan i'm preaching i'm sorry i'm gonna go to your calls uh jill in
[2:53:55.740 --> 2:54:01.660]  georgia thanks for holding it on the air hello alex welcome i've been a long time
[2:54:01.660 --> 2:54:10.220]  listeners since well not long time since 2015 enjoy your antics every day and shows like this are
[2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:17.020]  kind of hard to deal with especially when you talk about the children and the the d-class on the
[2:54:17.020 --> 2:54:24.860]  finders and then the the drag queen story time and all this satanic stuff in our face in our faith
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:30.380]  now this morning and i know it's hard hey i know how you feel everybody else feels like it and that's
[2:54:30.380 --> 2:54:33.980]  what we're going to work towards getting this fixed but i know it enrages you doesn't it that's
[2:54:33.980 --> 2:54:37.900]  righteous anger and i'm sorry you think i don't want to cover it either believe me i don't want
[2:54:37.900 --> 2:54:41.900]  this going on either but you know what they're doing it to our kids so we got to cover it you
[2:54:41.900 --> 2:54:47.100]  agree with me right what you you had a call to us you said we have to do something or it's on us
[2:54:47.100 --> 2:54:54.300]  what can we do you know it's up to god to to to give you discernment in your area and i just think
[2:54:54.300 --> 2:54:59.740]  if you just go and you go organize reading the stories to kids so you can just kind of watch
[2:54:59.740 --> 2:55:05.500]  what's going on at the library or maybe you go to church and teach sunday school and while the
[2:55:05.500 --> 2:55:09.260]  little corrupt preacher is doing his thing you're you're you're you're talking to the kids do what
[2:55:09.260 --> 2:55:16.140]  the left does but do it from a godly perspective or maybe you just go you know you see a veteran just
[2:55:16.140 --> 2:55:19.660]  died and we'll just randomly go to the cemetery when the family's having the thing and just talk
[2:55:19.660 --> 2:55:24.540]  to them or have a barbecue and talk to your neighbors or go speak at the city council against
[2:55:24.540 --> 2:55:30.300]  gun control or you know just just just you never know just go out and just ask god what you should
[2:55:30.300 --> 2:55:36.380]  do maybe get in a car or go to dc uh you're in uh you know georgia flight to dc pick your congressman
[2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:42.300]  or senator or lady and then go in and talk to him you know you i'm telling you once you just step out
[2:55:42.300 --> 2:55:48.940]  and ask god to guide you what it's it's it's it's like the devil has his fake magic well magic
[2:55:48.940 --> 2:55:53.820]  just is the crazy way the universe works you'll see more doors open and more i've never gone out with
[2:55:53.820 --> 2:55:58.300]  a camera on a mission where wild stuff didn't happen and i'm always just guided without even
[2:55:58.300 --> 2:56:02.460]  thinking about it right to whatever i need to catch i mean literally i've learned how to like no one
[2:56:02.460 --> 2:56:08.620]  could find where sundar pachai was no one could find where uh jack dorsi was and everybody was
[2:56:08.620 --> 2:56:12.460]  running this way around that way and i'm literally with all these you know vets that are with me or
[2:56:12.460 --> 2:56:16.940]  good guys and they're like let's follow our nose he's gonna come out that way let's go this way
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:21.100]  now he's going that way and boom we caught him and it's like it's it's it's you know they make
[2:56:21.100 --> 2:56:26.060]  stupid movies about like star wars and the force and all that but really it's just the spirit and
[2:56:26.060 --> 2:56:31.260]  so if you just pray to god and ask what you're supposed to do you don't have to do all of it but
[2:56:31.260 --> 2:56:35.660]  together we'll defeat these people that makes sense everybody everybody do their their part
[2:56:37.260 --> 2:56:42.060]  absolutely then i've learned now and i mean it's crazy though that if i literally just clear my
[2:56:42.060 --> 2:56:47.420]  mind like when i'm out in the field or doing something i mean i can just know what the enemy
[2:56:47.420 --> 2:56:51.580]  is going to do before they do it it's crazy but that's that's the spirit because he was in us is
[2:56:51.580 --> 2:56:58.860]  bigger than you who's in the world that makes sense yes indeed one more thing when you were talking
[2:56:58.860 --> 2:57:05.820]  about you needed money that money bomb you did i guess it was a few months back it was awesome i could
[2:57:05.820 --> 2:57:10.060]  see how much people were given and i think people were excited to give they could see how much it
[2:57:10.060 --> 2:57:15.580]  was increasing but i never saw a story about how much you know you were able to raise well we call
[2:57:15.580 --> 2:57:18.940]  it a money bomb we did a setting sold like seven hundred thousand dollars for the product but we
[2:57:18.940 --> 2:57:22.700]  discounted so much we made like three hundred thousand dollars which sounds like a lot just and
[2:57:22.700 --> 2:57:26.860]  all the stuff we're just the bandwidth here's the deal we launched our own bandwidth and our own
[2:57:26.860 --> 2:57:32.140]  audio and video streams exclusively because we're banned everywhere and we've got five ten times the
[2:57:32.140 --> 2:57:37.660]  traffic is exponentially growing at bandot video but then i literally and we've gone out and found
[2:57:37.660 --> 2:57:41.660]  some of the cheapest bandwidth but imagine we're paying millions and millions and millions just on
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:47.660]  ban with millions on it so there's just we have to have security now uh you know here at the office
[2:57:47.660 --> 2:57:51.020]  because i'm not going to get into why but obviously there's a lot of new expenses but it's okay we're
[2:57:51.020 --> 2:57:57.660]  going to win together thank you and god bless you jill it is now an admitted fact fluoride out of
[2:57:57.660 --> 2:58:03.020]  the water has caused tens of millions of americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and
[2:58:03.020 --> 2:58:07.900]  low IQs and it doesn't matter if the journal of american medical association comes out and says it's
[2:58:07.900 --> 2:58:13.500]  terrible still the city's put in the water because the ruling globalists want you and your family
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:20.140]  poisoned and stupid and they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely
[2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:25.580]  increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness your
[2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:31.260]  mind everything thank god thank god i discovered this eight years ago of course the enemy knows
[2:58:31.260 --> 2:58:35.340]  all about it and they hope you don't discover it they hope you just roll over and die so whatever
[2:58:35.340 --> 2:58:41.180]  you do don't visit info or store.com and get 60 off right now on the wake up the world to the iodine
[2:58:41.180 --> 2:58:47.020]  conspiracy combo 60 off with x2 and x3 together with your bottle of biotrystallineum whatever you
[2:58:47.020 --> 2:58:52.060]  do don't go to info or store.com just give up america give up christians drink your fluoride and
[2:58:52.060 --> 2:59:00.060]  die give into satan give him again i'm not talking down to the info wars audience but
[2:59:00.060 --> 2:59:05.260]  i've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and i'm talking about fluoride
[2:59:05.260 --> 2:59:11.820]  and i'm talking about iodine now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glasstron boat
[2:59:11.820 --> 2:59:17.980]  and you want to take it on the lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if you're a human being
[2:59:17.980 --> 2:59:23.820]  you've got to have oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well ladies and gentlemen the bad
[2:59:23.820 --> 2:59:28.220]  halogen is fluoride that's why in every western nation they put it in the water they're going to
[2:59:28.220 --> 2:59:32.780]  teach us christians lay down and die the chi-coms don't put it in the water they'd execute you if
[2:59:32.780 --> 2:59:38.220]  you did that they put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility
[2:59:38.220 --> 2:59:43.740]  and lifespan and intelligence and everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy
[2:59:43.740 --> 2:59:49.100]  at infowarstore.com we have all the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself
[2:59:49.100 --> 2:59:54.380]  because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at infowarstore.com
[2:59:54.380 --> 3:00:00.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:00.860 --> 3:00:09.340]  from
[3:00:09.340 --> 3:00:25.820]  the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:00:30.860 --> 3:00:34.300]  i didn't notice we had a caller in peru you know when you call in from overseas i
[3:00:34.300 --> 3:00:38.460]  tend to go to you first but i i didn't look at the number how long you've been holding so
[3:00:38.460 --> 3:00:42.780]  not where you're calling from uh so i apologize to john who knows how much he's been holding for an
[3:00:42.780 --> 3:00:49.020]  hour john in peru where the u.s government for 30 years injected over 100 000 people with live
[3:00:49.020 --> 3:00:55.420]  syphilis but we should trust him down to take the shots uh john in peru go ahead sir hi alex
[3:00:55.420 --> 3:01:00.060]  thank you so much um my name is john marshall i'm the uh great great great grandson of the chief
[3:01:00.060 --> 3:01:05.500]  justice of the supreme court so um i called you and i've got some fireworks i truly believe this
[3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:12.220]  will be the most powerful call you've heard all year well lay it on me i'm all ears okay um
[3:01:12.220 --> 3:01:17.020]  i've got three topics i'd like to discuss how to increase your product sales by at least 100
[3:01:18.300 --> 3:01:23.980]  how to get seen by 10 to 20 000 liberals a day and number three how to beat the censorship
[3:01:25.420 --> 3:01:31.900]  so i'm just going to start off with a quick one um i noticed x2 is your number one selling product
[3:01:31.900 --> 3:01:39.900]  and um and you've got a great marketing strategy you sell products that solve a problem well there's
[3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:46.300]  one problem that you haven't um attacked yet and that is tumors there's a there's a site you should
[3:01:46.300 --> 3:01:51.900]  check out on um it's just do a google search 31 powerful herbs and supplements for treating
[3:01:51.900 --> 3:01:57.100]  and preventing cancer naturally well sir here's how this works um
[3:01:57.100 --> 3:02:05.980]  um obviously there are a lot of things that are known to help people not get cancer but
[3:02:05.980 --> 3:02:12.060]  then if you say if someone takes this it'll stop it and then somebody dies you've contributed
[3:02:12.060 --> 3:02:17.580]  to their death and they come and arrest you for that i know they're suppressing how powerful
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:23.340]  turmeric is uh and things like that so we just say hey tumor is really good for anti-inflammatory
[3:02:23.340 --> 3:02:27.980]  hey fish roll is really good for your heart i mean my gosh it's psychoactive for me i mean i took
[3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:32.940]  like three big juicy fish rolls last night and just had like you know better than a trip on acid
[3:02:32.940 --> 3:02:38.300]  or something i mean you know joke around there but the the system is scared of what is in mother
[3:02:38.300 --> 3:02:42.220]  nature and it doesn't want people to know i mean my daughter came to me my 11 year old yesterday
[3:02:43.740 --> 3:02:50.140]  and she said dad we're we're in chemistry class and uh we're in science class and they had a study
[3:02:50.140 --> 3:02:56.300]  iodine on the periodic table and look my it's a tablet but the textbook says the number one cause
[3:02:56.940 --> 3:03:03.660]  of uh you know people having low IQs and the exact quote was it was uh intellectual disabilities
[3:03:03.660 --> 3:03:08.780]  is lack of iodine and two billion people on earth have lower IQs are mentally retarded
[3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:13.580]  currently from lack of iodine she said dad that's exactly what you say but i've seen the news my
[3:03:13.580 --> 3:03:18.380]  daughter's seen the news saying i'm a cook and that iodine's not good or whatever she was totally
[3:03:18.380 --> 3:03:23.500]  blown away that her textbook was still teaching science and the number one thing on the earth is
[3:03:23.500 --> 3:03:27.740]  iodine deficiency of course i sell something that you need that's great that also is amazing
[3:03:28.380 --> 3:03:31.500]  and we sell the best stuff that's out there x2 and x3 or apples and oranges but they're both
[3:03:31.500 --> 3:03:37.820]  excellent uh and so yeah absolutely they keep saying oh cancer's way up because of bad genes
[3:03:37.820 --> 3:03:42.700]  yeah people have genes where if you don't have something you've got to have that it's essential
[3:03:42.700 --> 3:03:47.820]  then it will trigger and your body will mutate the cells will mutate to operate on fluoride
[3:03:47.820 --> 3:03:53.420]  and bromide and bromine and the cells will mutate and your liver will mutate and you will die because
[3:03:53.420 --> 3:03:57.580]  your cells will mutate so they keep living a little bit longer on what they've got and the
[3:03:57.580 --> 3:04:02.940]  system knows that they know that your body will move over to whatever it has to to keep operating
[3:04:02.940 --> 3:04:07.660]  and it will mutate at the cellular level but they won't tell people why cancer's off the
[3:04:07.660 --> 3:04:11.980]  chart they won't tell women why it's all happening they give you glyphosate and they give you fluoride
[3:04:11.980 --> 3:04:16.620]  to grow the tumors and then they take the iodine away to make sure your body absorbs it so you
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:24.780]  die so you die yes john they're evil aren't they right well hold on hold on i got more
[3:04:24.780 --> 3:04:28.140]  pat is coming here but i'm gonna go back to your call and we'll get to these other ones x and
[3:04:28.140 --> 3:04:32.460]  dallas jake brian eric we'll get to all of your wild cards it's gonna be wild we're coming back on
[3:04:32.460 --> 3:04:37.740]  the other side good lord ladies and gentlemen you notice most of the products we don't even say what
[3:04:37.740 --> 3:04:43.100]  they do that's because i've got the fda breathing down my neck at every other damn agency on the
[3:04:43.100 --> 3:04:48.380]  planet i've got the left running around thinking i don't pay taxes and they're gonna get me on
[3:04:48.380 --> 3:04:54.300]  that when you think i'm a moron they'll break your legs you don't pay those phony taxes i am
[3:04:54.300 --> 3:05:07.980]  literally a boy scout we'll be right back folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of
[3:05:07.980 --> 3:05:14.060]  iodine well that's because different types of physiology different types of metabolic systems
[3:05:14.060 --> 3:05:21.340]  and people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine
[3:05:21.340 --> 3:05:27.340]  and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure
[3:05:27.340 --> 3:05:33.340]  atomic iodine get both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other
[3:05:33.340 --> 3:05:39.740]  to family or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist
[3:05:39.740 --> 3:05:45.740]  want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as
[3:05:45.740 --> 3:05:51.580]  long it's simple get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war
[3:05:51.580 --> 3:05:57.420]  infowarstore.com we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about the end it's the iodine

[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:14.080]  event with a fat man with a red wig on
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:21.860]  Screaming at women and children and men who do not want this guy talking to their children at school
[3:08:24.920 --> 3:08:31.040]  You see if you try to creep around kids at the park you get arrested but not if you come to the school and demand equal rights
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:33.760]  And then read off a list of black men
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.200]  Who were transvestite prostitutes shot and killed in places like Chicago by other black men?
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:43.260]  And then you blame a bunch of elementary students that you don't have access to to quote groom them
[3:08:50.160 --> 3:08:54.260]  Get that Rob do compilation ready from earlier today. I'm gonna play that for norm pass right now
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:06.040]  You go to turn norms my con change everything they want to destroy
[3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:12.520]  Everything that is good. So this is where we are right now. You have these people that are completely
[3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:17.120]  Nasty, you see this demonic demon. He can't even control himself
[3:09:17.400 --> 3:09:22.320]  He has to keep walking around look at him. Look at him. Jesus loves everybody
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:26.400]  She does Jesus doesn't want people like this to be turned over to a reprobate mind
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:31.800]  He doesn't want them to be lost doesn't want them to be disgusting doesn't want to turn over to themselves over to
[3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:38.280]  Perverted actions. We cannot allow these demons to win. It's not gonna end. It's only gonna get worse
[3:09:38.560 --> 3:09:41.280]  My name is will Johnson firepower news.com
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:45.200]  Will Johnson's coming in towards the other hour house his own show
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:47.880]  seven o'clock central
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:52.280]  With the great Tom Pappert of national
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:54.960]  calm
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:56.520]  Okay, now norm
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:03.960]  Pat is is a leading criminal defense divorce lawyer, but mainly number first amendment. I've probably seen him all over the news for years
[3:10:03.960 --> 3:10:09.360]  With big cases. He does be like F. Lee Bailey. You name it and he was here
[3:10:09.360 --> 3:10:14.760]  He flew in to talk about some other things were up to in our ongoing battles with the deep state to stay on air
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:17.280]  But this morning I said, what do you want to come on about?
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:21.000]  And I figured to be all these attacks on the first amendment the rest of you as well
[3:10:21.560 --> 3:10:24.600]  Let's talk about Cheshire home invasion killer
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:28.960]  Who's a transgender and the mother got killed the two little girls?
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:31.600]  so I guess
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:33.920]  Let's do a document cam shot of this
[3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:36.040]  young lady here
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:41.920]  What a man with a beard. So this is the type of stuff going on. We've got new video out
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:48.240]  Out of control drag queen flashes crotch the kids at library story in Minnesota
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:55.320]  And we also have photos that stations have complained about and listen stations. I've been on air 25 years and we are not a show
[3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:57.720]  That shows bad things, but I
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:04.680]  Remember being about 10 years old watching PBS showing documentaries and it showed naked kids running down the street with napalm
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:08.000]  Burned their skin off now how at 7 o'clock at night at the dinner time hour
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:13.160]  They showing kids with napalm in a Walter Cronkite show those kids naked with their skin burned off
[3:11:13.160 --> 3:11:18.560]  Little boys and little girls now. Why could they show that and it wasn't x-rated because it was
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:24.160]  Documentary and later I learned about that being in the media. So I don't show this with pleasure
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:27.040]  in fact some of it I'm
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:30.040]  It's so horrible that I'm not gonna show it
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:34.000]  We've got stuff even worse than we've showed today of men
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:39.800]  With large genitalia and people say what's the point? It's large. I mean, it's hanging out. Okay
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:45.360]  Okay, okay with glitter on it hugging and kissing little kids at public events
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:50.080]  The mothers bring them to it like you bring your kid to a spider and it's all just sick
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:56.920]  Moonshowsen by proxy Stockholm syndrome, whatever you want to call it and the stations weren't a lot of TV stations and cable
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:11:58.680]  They call me go listen
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:02.320]  This happens every time it's relations phones ring and they go listen. Can you not show that?
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:05.200]  We're getting a lot of complaints from the community here
[3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:11.640]  They're doing it in the elementary schools without asking parents in many cases. I've shown the newscast
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:13.960]  I've been
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  Drag Queens go to Denver
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:19.440]  Elementary without parental consent and the kids sit on their laps
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.600]  Yes, I know men dressed like women spreading their legs in front of kids is bad
[3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:28.000]  We've learned it out. The little kids are looking at their genitalia
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:32.680]  So you think you are pissed off. You're supposed to get pissed seeing that
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:34.680]  You're supposed to
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:40.200]  Not want to see it because it's not happening and as soon as it's not happening. I won't show it
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:44.000]  Respectfully to the stations. What the hell do you want me to do?
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:47.600]  I've got four children three of them daughters one of them's two and a half
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.280]  You know what I want to do when I see stuff like that. You know what I want to do with an ice pick, don't you?
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:58.000]  But we're gonna beat them politically. Norm Pattis. It's good to have you here. What do you think of this crap?
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:12:59.360]  I'm stunned by it
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:03.600]  I mean, I guess I haven't been paying much attention to the news. I was looking at some of these clips in my jaw dropped
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:09.400]  As it did when I saw the Cheshire home invasion piece Steven Hayes was convicted for the rape murder and homicide
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:15.240]  And arson death of a mother and two children. They beat the father not quite to death
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:18.160]  He was sentenced to death Connecticut revoked the death penalty
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.520]  He's been on death row or death row or doing life since 2007 at one point
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:27.800]  He converted to orthodox Judaism and now he wants to convert to being a woman and I've got a pay for this
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:31.880]  I mean at what point do we say, you know, what you were born is what you are?
[3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:37.000]  Look at all the discussions about the gender war and the trans phenomena raise. Well, let's let's humanize
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:43.400]  Who these people where he killed? I mean, it's all folks with them. Well, dr. Pettit was a popular physician his wife
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:48.720]  The I don't know a whole lot about her. He had two daughters 11 and I believe 17 and
[3:13:49.560 --> 3:13:53.400]  Mr. Hayes and mr. Commissar's f-commerce commerce are Jebsky
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:59.440]  Targeted them. They they saw the Mercedes that Jennifer drove and they the next night. They went to the home
[3:13:59.440 --> 3:14:02.440]  They held people hostage. They took her to the bank to take
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:07.880]  $15,000 out then they set the house on fire after raping the wife and daughters
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:12.960]  Mr. A doctor dr. Pettit was asleep on the back porch
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:16.120]  They beat him to death with a beat him half to death with a baseball bat
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:20.760]  He stumbled out of the house. So it was this horrible a crime as has occurred in Connecticut in my lifetime
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:28.000]  And there was really no doubt about the defendants. Well, I mean, why don't we let why don't we have taxpayer funded execution for him?
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:33.680]  Instead of you know paying to cut his way bows off. Well, I'm not a fan of the death penalty
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:34.880]  I was relieved to see it repealed
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:42.600]  But candidly the notion that this guy serving six life terms plus 130 years needs to have his gender changed at taxpayer
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:46.560]  Expense makes me wonder when we've got people out there that aren't getting the nest well
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:51.280]  It's like Elizabeth Warren exactly like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie. They want to pay for criminals
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:58.440]  To have their genitals cut off what type of upside-down sicko people go. Oh, that's just a fringe thing. No, that's the Democrat religion now
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:02.280]  Well, let's get philosophic about it. Let's talk about the identity wars going on
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:08.920]  We say that race and gender are social contracts constructs. They're not really real people can be what they want to be
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:11.800]  This is what comes of taking that thinking too far
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:18.680]  We you are what you were born to be and if you want to be feminine as a man be feminine as a man
[3:15:18.720 --> 3:15:22.600]  But the notion that you've got to get it cut off reassigned changed around
[3:15:23.360 --> 3:15:26.040]  It didn't make any sense to me and what's more we're doing it with kids
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:31.920]  I read a fascinating book that I talked about last time I was on I believe was last week on Skype by a guy named Murray out of Britain
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:37.540]  About the our confusion about identity. We say that identity isn't real
[3:15:37.540 --> 3:15:43.660]  Um, but yet or that it's socially constructed and we let little kids six and seven years old decide that they want to get their
[3:15:43.660 --> 3:15:49.780]  Gender reassigned and physicians are willing to do this. What happens when they wake up at 12 and decide they want to go back?
[3:15:49.780 --> 3:15:53.940]  Well, it's total. It's total abuse. It's total abuse and that's why they drug them all up, too
[3:15:53.940 --> 3:16:00.700]  And most of them commit suicide. It's unbelievable phone calls coming up. Norm Pattis here will Johnson went down and face these crazies
[3:16:02.300 --> 3:16:03.580]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:08.980]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one
[3:16:08.980 --> 3:16:13.900]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:16:13.900 --> 3:16:17.500]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems. They thought might never be solved
[3:16:17.500 --> 3:16:21.700]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day

[3:16:31.060 --> 3:16:37.980]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the Empire of the world
[3:16:38.260 --> 3:16:41.060]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[3:16:41.220 --> 3:16:48.500]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken its former colony
[3:16:48.500 --> 3:16:52.180]  The US had to save the Empire was there ever a vote?
[3:16:52.220 --> 3:16:59.540]  Who do we fight for the deep state began with World War one the United States of Empire by James Dunn
[3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:05.180]  available at Amazon books one of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer services
[3:17:05.460 --> 3:17:08.740]  What is the real red pill and what is the real red pill plus?
[3:17:09.300 --> 3:17:14.980]  Well, real red pill is a vitamin mineral multivitamin high quality with preglonone
[3:17:15.260 --> 3:17:21.380]  Real red pill plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well
[3:17:21.540 --> 3:17:26.780]  That kicks in in 30 minutes, but the preglonone kicks in in about a week or so
[3:17:26.780 --> 3:17:29.420]  Folks look into preglonone for yourself

[3:17:49.420 --> 3:17:52.740]  Preglonone you need to learn about preglonone

[3:18:12.940 --> 3:18:17.260]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible

[3:19:06.620 --> 3:19:10.980]  Look at look see and it looks like it's becoming very serious from what I'm hearing
[3:19:10.980 --> 3:19:12.980]  Investigate the investigators
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:16.180]  Whether it's struck and paid
[3:19:16.740 --> 3:19:21.340]  Whether it's flopper and whether it's homey and all of these people

[3:19:50.380 --> 3:19:55.700]  I leave it all up to the people that are working with the attorney general who I don't know
[3:19:56.260 --> 3:20:03.180]  But I will say this I think you'll see things that nobody would have believed this was the worst hoax in the history of our country
[3:20:03.180 --> 3:20:09.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:33.180 --> 3:20:36.380]  Seeding as the globalists didn't want it to
[3:20:37.900 --> 3:20:43.100]  We're going your phone calls here right now with Norm Pattis. We're getting the first amendment and more with him in the next segment

[3:20:55.500 --> 3:20:56.780]  incorrect
[3:20:56.780 --> 3:20:58.260]  That's coming up
[3:20:58.260 --> 3:20:59.780]  Just briefly
[3:20:59.780 --> 3:21:07.060]  We had one caller Sunday calling and go. It's incredible. I was in the V8 61. They said I was gonna die and
[3:21:07.940 --> 3:21:14.140]  I heard you guys talking about living defense that flushes out the guts and goes out of the parasites both tiny and large
[3:21:14.260 --> 3:21:19.100]  He took it just one of the ingredients and this is black walnut and he says he's great now
[3:21:19.100 --> 3:21:22.180]  Well, that's what it's designed for and I'm not saying it's a blue of medical treatment
[3:21:22.180 --> 3:21:27.340]  I'm not saying any of that. I'm saying what God gave us the medicine chest is incredible 100% reviews

[3:21:38.580 --> 3:21:41.020]  There's a lot of other big specials right now that are about to end

[3:21:53.380 --> 3:21:59.860]  Because at the level we're selling a ton of product, but we don't have big markups on these especially when it's 50% off
[3:22:00.180 --> 3:22:04.500]  Some of these we make mistakes like the skin cream 50% off that was below cost
[3:22:04.500 --> 3:22:08.580]  And no wonder it's sold out in a couple days. We have the little tubes at 25% off

[3:22:29.860 --> 3:22:34.020]  That is a famous lawyer here riding shotgun with us today
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:36.620]  What do you make of this?
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:39.300]  All the things that are happening
[3:22:39.420 --> 3:22:44.660]  In the world today and the open attack on free speech by the supposed guardians of it liberals
[3:22:44.660 --> 3:22:48.980]  I think we've descended to the politics of pathos. We all want to feel special
[3:22:48.980 --> 3:22:55.540]  We all want to feel cherished and the result is anybody who has anything to say that hurt somebody's feelings is regarded as a criminal
[3:22:55.540 --> 3:22:57.620]  I I find it very dangerous
[3:22:57.620 --> 3:23:04.580]  I'm told that there's legislation pending in perhaps Massachusetts or at least one lawmaker who wants to make the the w-word with a B
[3:23:04.580 --> 3:23:08.540]  I know you've got family viewers on a crime to assert
[3:23:08.540 --> 3:23:11.820]  Well, she's just the name of a female dog and it can be used offensively
[3:23:11.820 --> 3:23:14.860]  That's the way the world works, but you know when it's used offensively
[3:23:14.860 --> 3:23:20.340]  It's a crime or we talked last week in Connecticut about ridiculing people and some youngs and Yukon students being
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:25.140]  Arrested for them. Yeah, I talked to the prosecutor in fact since I spoke to you. I called him up. I know him
[3:23:25.140 --> 3:23:29.380]  I'm gonna want to use his name here. I said, did you really sign a warrant for those kids?
[3:23:29.380 --> 3:23:35.100]  He said he did I said well, what happened? He said here's what happened three boys were out one night college kids playing a game
[3:23:35.100 --> 3:23:36.260]  I guess it's a drinking game
[3:23:36.260 --> 3:23:41.500]  You pick an offensive word and you say it and then the next guy has to say it louder and it goes louder and louder
[3:23:41.500 --> 3:23:47.420]  The person who backs down in the end has to take a drink so they were talking about a certain portion of the male anatomy
[3:23:47.420 --> 3:23:52.220]  The third leg as it were when that word ran out of they ran out of time with that word
[3:23:52.220 --> 3:23:56.620]  They switched to the n-word so they're walking through a park and somebody started the film when they were hollering penis
[3:23:56.900 --> 3:24:03.780]  Because they thought it was funny when they switched to the n-word that person suddenly became enraged and upset and they were saying
[3:24:03.940 --> 3:24:10.580]  You know nigger louder and louder and louder that person then sent the video to her mother who called the NAACP
[3:24:10.580 --> 3:24:15.820]  He created a storm and had the kids arrested for ridiculing people. No one was ridiculed
[3:24:15.820 --> 3:24:21.540]  That's the real but the law is wrong. Well, the law is unconstitutional and it's a danger to everyone
[3:24:21.540 --> 3:24:26.420]  The law I'm glad we got the inside scoop now. The what was funny is you know, I looked at the lawn of things
[3:24:26.420 --> 3:24:29.660]  When did they pass that it has to be brand new? I've been practicing law for so long
[3:24:29.660 --> 3:24:34.260]  I can't remember how long it is. Um, it's been on the books apparently since 2008
[3:24:34.380 --> 3:24:39.980]  So we did a we did some research to see whether anybody had ever challenged that law and the Connecticut Supreme Court is on
[3:24:39.980 --> 3:24:45.660]  As a violation of the First Amendment right to speak no one has so I was hoping one of those young men would have called our
[3:24:45.660 --> 3:24:51.220]  Office to represent them. They haven't so we're not but the next time somebody gets charged under that statute on my watch
[3:24:51.220 --> 3:24:54.660]  We're on our way to the Supreme Court getting that thing declared unconstitutional
[3:24:54.660 --> 3:25:00.220]  Well mystery of the men arrested for offensive word in Connecticut now solve a normed paddus
[3:25:00.220 --> 3:25:05.740]  We got to put a little three-minute video out because that's that's pretty interesting and an incredibly dangerous
[3:25:05.740 --> 3:25:08.420]  I had heard the story that that's what happened and I didn't believe it
[3:25:08.420 --> 3:25:12.020]  I've known the prosecutor forever and you know when he called that was incredulous
[3:25:12.020 --> 3:25:15.780]  I said have you actually prosecuted people under that statute before he says well?
[3:25:15.780 --> 3:25:22.580]  Yeah, I have and nobody's ever challenged that unconstitutional. Well, it just shows we have to stand up against it amazing norm X in Dallas
[3:25:22.580 --> 3:25:24.580]  You're on the air X. Thanks for holding. Oh
[3:25:25.340 --> 3:25:29.260]  Well, I just want to say I'm black and I'm not offended one bit by that last piece
[3:25:29.260 --> 3:25:35.580]  You know the liberals are like to take what norm paddus said and go. Oh my god. He just said it. Let me move on from there
[3:25:35.580 --> 3:25:38.220]  Um, thank you for that by the way
[3:25:38.220 --> 3:25:43.500]  I went I went to Hollywood. I went to Hollywood and I'm from Texas and they told me, you know
[3:25:43.500 --> 3:25:46.940]  First thing they told me was you need to act more black. I didn't understand it
[3:25:46.940 --> 3:25:53.220]  This was this was before Trump then they told me when I got to Hollywood after they took me to a dispensary at 18 years old
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:25:56.060]  they said well
[3:25:56.260 --> 3:26:01.460]  You one of the guy one of the guys at the label introduced me to said you need to hang out with this guy while we're here in Hollywood
[3:26:01.460 --> 3:26:06.420]  He said you can call me mess this though for short, which everybody knows is short for Memphis Duffield
[3:26:06.420 --> 3:26:10.100]  So if you think if you think that the if you think the Satanism is fake, you're wrong
[3:26:11.180 --> 3:26:15.940]  Secondly Kanye West not only shod you out. He was talking about Edward Bernays
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:20.220]  He was talking about cigarettes and women and the whole movement
[3:26:20.220 --> 3:26:24.380]  So when people think Alex Jones is lying about Kanye West listen to the show
[3:26:24.380 --> 3:26:28.580]  Not only does Kanye West listen to the show he repeats what Alex says in live interviews
[3:26:28.580 --> 3:26:32.340]  And this wasn't on the big boy interview. This is on another interview done by a British guy
[3:26:32.340 --> 3:26:36.740]  So you can have a crew look that up and get some more footage. Oh, I know he tunes in we've talked to his folks and
[3:26:37.380 --> 3:26:41.820]  The security didn't want him to come here. So that's what it's in was your security gonna give us problems
[3:26:41.820 --> 3:26:44.700]  We hear there's snipers on the roof and you know, we're like, oh, yeah
[3:26:44.700 --> 3:26:48.460]  We got snipers and they're we're you know, our and then they go and like freaked out
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:53.940]  So that wasn't Kanye. That's his security people keep him from coming on the show, but hopefully he'll come on soon. Oh
[3:26:53.940 --> 3:26:57.420]  He has to he has to so I've got to ask did you act?
[3:26:57.420 --> 3:27:00.980]  I mean, what would it what did it mean to you when they said you don't act black enough?
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:04.860]  Were you insulted by that? And was it a white guy that told you you didn't do that?
[3:27:05.860 --> 3:27:12.340]  It was it was a white woman who was the wife of the record label owner who who came up to me and said this to me
[3:27:12.340 --> 3:27:14.340]  Did you ask her what that meant?
[3:27:15.060 --> 3:27:21.140]  Well, this was okay, so keep in mind this was before Trump and yeah in my mind. I'm half white. I'm half black
[3:27:21.140 --> 3:27:26.300]  I thought I was a liberal when this happens when that happens. I was like, wait, what and so then I start hearing
[3:27:26.300 --> 3:27:29.820]  I was Jones talk about social engineering and I'm like, okay
[3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:34.380]  Well, I get it. So they want me to paint a picture because I'm not stupid. You know, I mean, they want me to drag the pants
[3:27:34.380 --> 3:27:39.420]  They want me to say, you know, they want me to act a certain way. And it's to me. It was just it was like, why do you think at about
[3:27:39.420 --> 3:27:46.540]  1987 suddenly all the heavy metal and rock bands started doing gangster rap. I've talked to top famous musicians
[3:27:46.540 --> 3:27:49.980]  You've seen some I'm here on the show and they said no behind the scenes
[3:27:49.980 --> 3:27:53.220]  They were told by Viacom that owned MTV back when it was powerful
[3:27:53.220 --> 3:27:57.620]  You will do gangster rap or you're not going to be on air anymore. We're getting rid of rock and roll
[3:27:57.620 --> 3:28:01.260]  We're bringing in gangster rap and they literally didn't just get black kids
[3:28:01.260 --> 3:28:06.620]  But everybody into it to then prime them for prison. Why so you talk about a pipeline to prison
[3:28:06.620 --> 3:28:08.620]  That was all part of the Clinton crime bill that came later
[3:28:08.860 --> 3:28:14.260]  All of that was literally just tell black folks your culture is gangbanging murder
[3:28:14.260 --> 3:28:16.740]  And death when that was not the culture
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:20.700]  That's that's shocking. I still I would if you had it to do all over again
[3:28:20.700 --> 3:28:23.540]  I'm sorry to beat a dead horse. Well, if you had it to do all over again
[3:28:23.540 --> 3:28:27.740]  What would you say to that record producer's wife today if she if she said you didn't act black enough?
[3:28:28.740 --> 3:28:33.500]  I just said the same thing I said to her back then and then you're not beating that horse because this is something
[3:28:33.500 --> 3:28:36.140]  I've been wanting to call into infowars for a long time job
[3:28:36.140 --> 3:28:42.740]  But I told her I said I said, well, that's the end of this and whenever whenever we got back from home
[3:28:42.740 --> 3:28:48.660]  I told them I said, I don't want to do this anymore. Hey, I'm gonna get to Jake Brian Eric and John to but to stay there
[3:28:48.660 --> 3:28:52.020]  I want you to finish up with metastopheles. That's what they tell you in Hollywood
[3:28:52.020 --> 3:28:57.100]  Hey, you got to get down with Satan first Bob Dylan told people that hey, we're gonna get will Johnson here too. Stay with us
[3:28:57.100 --> 3:28:59.100]  We'll be right back

[3:30:15.780 --> 3:30:22.780]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine
[3:30:22.780 --> 3:30:28.780]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly
[3:30:28.780 --> 3:30:33.780]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumps us down, and destroys fertility
[3:30:33.780 --> 3:30:41.780]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it

[3:30:48.780 --> 3:30:52.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency
[3:30:52.780 --> 3:30:54.780]  It's the key to everything
[3:30:54.780 --> 3:31:02.780]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high-quality iodine and biotrystallinium at m4store.com today
[3:31:04.780 --> 3:31:07.780]  Here are the facts
[3:31:07.780 --> 3:31:13.780]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies
[3:31:13.780 --> 3:31:16.780]  Including the American Medical Journal
[3:31:16.780 --> 3:31:22.780]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer, and destroys fertility
[3:31:22.780 --> 3:31:24.780]  That's the facts
[3:31:24.780 --> 3:31:27.780]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy
[3:31:27.780 --> 3:31:30.780]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family
[3:31:30.780 --> 3:31:36.780]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine
[3:31:36.780 --> 3:31:42.780]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control
[3:31:42.780 --> 3:31:44.780]  The globalists are targeting us here
[3:31:44.780 --> 3:31:46.780]  Please go to m4store.com
[3:31:46.780 --> 3:31:50.780]  Experience iodine and biotrystallinium that goes with it together

[3:31:52.780 --> 3:31:54.780]  This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist
[3:31:54.780 --> 3:31:56.780]  It's a win-win situation
[3:31:56.780 --> 3:31:58.780]  The only way you lose is not taking action
[3:31:58.780 --> 3:31:59.780]  Take action now
[3:32:02.780 --> 3:32:07.780]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here
[3:32:07.780 --> 3:32:09.780]  I don't care what your views are
[3:32:09.780 --> 3:32:12.780]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them
[3:32:12.780 --> 3:32:13.780]  That's important
[3:32:13.780 --> 3:32:14.780]  But we have something in common
[3:32:14.780 --> 3:32:18.780]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together
[3:32:18.780 --> 3:32:23.780]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey, thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[3:32:23.780 --> 3:32:25.780]  And that he lied to Congress in the world
[3:32:25.780 --> 3:32:27.780]  He thinks committing crimes are funny
[3:32:27.780 --> 3:32:31.780]  And he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get indicted
[3:32:31.780 --> 3:32:35.780]  But word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him
[3:32:35.780 --> 3:32:38.780]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[3:32:40.780 --> 3:32:44.780]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand
[3:32:44.780 --> 3:32:46.780]  Not so fast, criminal
[3:32:46.780 --> 3:32:48.780]  We're going to bring you to justice
[3:32:48.780 --> 3:32:50.780]  And we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well
[3:32:50.780 --> 3:32:55.780]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy
[3:32:55.780 --> 3:32:57.780]  But the American people know how much you hate us
[3:32:57.780 --> 3:33:01.780]  And we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com
[3:33:01.780 --> 3:33:17.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:17.780 --> 3:33:24.780]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top
[3:33:24.780 --> 3:33:27.780]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast
[3:33:27.780 --> 3:33:32.780]  But we're miles above them, on our journey to hell
[3:33:32.780 --> 3:33:37.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:37.780 --> 3:33:40.780]  So, Will Johnson's here with us, riding shotgun Tony
[3:33:40.780 --> 3:33:43.780]  And what's coming up on his show, with Tom Papert, Firepower 7 o'clock
[3:33:43.780 --> 3:33:46.780]  Central here at band.videoinfowars.com
[3:33:46.780 --> 3:33:49.780]  The radio and TV satellites for fine stations out there to pick it up
[3:33:49.780 --> 3:33:50.780]  A lot of mar
[3:33:50.780 --> 3:33:55.780]  And of course, one of my great counselors is here as well, famous lawyer Norm Pattis
[3:33:55.780 --> 3:34:02.780]  We're going to finish up these five or six calls, Eric John, X Dallas, Jack and Brian
[3:34:02.780 --> 3:34:04.780]  Before we end this transmission
[3:34:04.780 --> 3:34:10.780]  But here's a little bit of a large man with a reddish-blonde wig
[3:34:10.780 --> 3:34:14.780]  Charging around in front of men, women and children trying to stop their free speech
[3:34:14.780 --> 3:34:18.780]  Getting arrested in Austin last night, here it is
[3:34:18.780 --> 3:34:25.780]  Black trans, life matter, black trans, life matter
[3:34:29.780 --> 3:34:34.780]  Trans women's matter, black trans women's matter
[3:34:34.780 --> 3:34:37.780]  Black trans women's matter
[3:34:37.780 --> 3:34:40.780]  I think that got bigger than all three police combined
[3:34:42.780 --> 3:34:45.780]  So Will Johnson's here to tell us exactly where this was and what happened
[3:34:45.780 --> 3:34:48.780]  I mean, this is happening everywhere, we're now that's coming in the schools
[3:34:48.780 --> 3:34:53.780]  Not just the libraries where these men come, we plug the clubs
[3:34:53.780 --> 3:34:56.780]  They say, we're going to groom your children, you're not going to stop us
[3:34:56.780 --> 3:35:01.780]  Now there's video on inforwars.com where they spread their legs with no underwear on in front of children
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:08.780]  And the liberals all clap and it's a lot of fun to introduce your children to these nice people
[3:35:08.780 --> 3:35:11.780]  That really want to get close to your children
[3:35:11.780 --> 3:35:16.780]  So again, Will Johnson, thanks for popping in with us, what in the hell's going on?
[3:35:16.780 --> 3:35:17.780]  What happened here?
[3:35:17.780 --> 3:35:24.780]  So I went to this event yesterday thinking that we're just going to get some good information about how they're trying to prevent the school district
[3:35:24.780 --> 3:35:29.780]  Are these liberals from teaching kids about homosexual sex?
[3:35:29.780 --> 3:35:31.780]  That's what I was going there to cover
[3:35:31.780 --> 3:35:34.780]  Shouldn't we teach them about sex, period?
[3:35:34.780 --> 3:35:38.780]  Somebody walks up to your kid in a park and wants to talk about sex, we call him a pedo
[3:35:38.780 --> 3:35:43.780]  Yeah, exactly, but it should be up to the parents to teach them about sex and how the parents want to go along
[3:35:43.780 --> 3:35:47.780]  But what they're wanting to do is indoctrinate the children that homosexuality act
[3:35:47.780 --> 3:35:50.780]  Or something that everyone should be embracing
[3:35:50.780 --> 3:35:54.780]  So I was at this event thinking that, hey, this is just going to be information, we're going to get information
[3:35:54.780 --> 3:35:58.780]  And I'm going to be able to relate it to everyone so they can see that we have people in Austin, Texas
[3:35:58.780 --> 3:36:02.780]  Trying to prevent this perversion from taking over the school district
[3:36:02.780 --> 3:36:08.780]  Well, as a result, we got people to show up that started acting crazy because they didn't want people to have their voices heard
[3:36:08.780 --> 3:36:14.780]  Not only were they censoring their freedom of speech, they want to make sure that no one can hear their message
[3:36:14.780 --> 3:36:16.780]  Can you talk about the bottom of the barrel zombies?
[3:36:16.780 --> 3:36:25.780]  And I'm not disagreeing with you, but when we say that the homosexual sex, quite honestly, the quote gay people you don't see down there
[3:36:25.780 --> 3:36:28.780]  They're like running companies and stuff or whatever
[3:36:28.780 --> 3:36:32.780]  This is worse, this is pedos wanting access
[3:36:32.780 --> 3:36:36.780]  And then pedos can't followers on the left that believe it's cool
[3:36:36.780 --> 3:36:41.780]  And we can play the clips where they say, we're grooming your children and these very groups, a lot of them are convicted pedophiles
[3:36:41.780 --> 3:36:45.780]  Yeah, and you're not thinking that who's going to protest against protecting children
[3:36:45.780 --> 3:36:46.780]  That's what I'm thinking
[3:36:46.780 --> 3:36:49.780]  Who's going to protest against protecting children?
[3:36:49.780 --> 3:36:50.780]  But here it is
[3:36:50.780 --> 3:36:53.780]  And the school is going to teach the kids that they're really another gender
[3:36:53.780 --> 3:36:55.780]  So they can take them away from the parents and chop the labels off
[3:36:55.780 --> 3:37:03.780]  Exactly, so they're going to have videos, pictures, documentation on how to actually have the anal sex
[3:37:03.780 --> 3:37:08.780]  So they're teaching little boys how to get with other little boys and how to have
[3:37:08.780 --> 3:37:09.780]  And people don't believe that
[3:37:09.780 --> 3:37:10.780]  They don't believe it, yeah
[3:37:10.780 --> 3:37:16.780]  Boy Scouts of America is going bankrupt because three years ago at the Jamboree they hand out even to seven-year-olds condoms
[3:37:16.780 --> 3:37:21.780]  And then the pedophiles just rape them and mash at the Boy Scouts of America
[3:37:21.780 --> 3:37:23.780]  They did the same thing in California
[3:37:23.780 --> 3:37:27.780]  So I'm living in California thinking I'm with the Texas, okay, I'm going to be away from all of that
[3:37:27.780 --> 3:37:28.780]  I don't have to worry about the children
[3:37:28.780 --> 3:37:30.780]  But here it is in Austin, Texas
[3:37:30.780 --> 3:37:31.780]  They just passed it yesterday
[3:37:31.780 --> 3:37:37.780]  It says Texas School District mandates teaching kids how to have anal sex
[3:37:37.780 --> 3:37:39.780]  And California just passed this
[3:37:39.780 --> 3:37:42.780]  Yes, California had already done it a while ago
[3:37:42.780 --> 3:37:44.780]  And they're saying parents can't opt out
[3:37:44.780 --> 3:37:46.780]  Yeah, I was getting ready to say that, you beat me to it
[3:37:46.780 --> 3:37:48.780]  Parents can't opt out on providing
[3:37:48.780 --> 3:37:51.780]  Let's be clear, we're talking about elementary students
[3:37:51.780 --> 3:37:54.780]  I mean, I remember Jocelyn Elders when she was a third-general
[3:37:54.780 --> 3:37:56.780]  She said, reach down and talk to them
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:37:58.780]  Help the master bride
[3:37:58.780 --> 3:37:59.780]  That's her voice
[3:37:59.780 --> 3:38:00.780]  So this is an old creepy woman
[3:38:00.780 --> 3:38:05.780]  Wants to put her hands on your daughters and your son's private parts
[3:38:05.780 --> 3:38:08.780]  But it's okay because they're liberal
[3:38:08.780 --> 3:38:11.780]  Yeah, so yesterday when we were at the event
[3:38:11.780 --> 3:38:16.780]  The LGBTQ plus P community showed up and went to
[3:38:16.780 --> 3:38:17.780]  Oh, the P showed up
[3:38:17.780 --> 3:38:18.780]  Oh, the P, yeah
[3:38:18.780 --> 3:38:20.780]  It was primarily the P
[3:38:20.780 --> 3:38:21.780]  I guess I don't get out enough
[3:38:21.780 --> 3:38:22.780]  What's the P stand?
[3:38:22.780 --> 3:38:23.780]  The pedophile
[3:38:23.780 --> 3:38:25.780]  Yeah, originally it came out as a pedophile
[3:38:25.780 --> 3:38:27.780]  But then they changed it to pansexual
[3:38:27.780 --> 3:38:28.780]  They put the P on
[3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:30.780]  Yeah, so they changed it to pansexual
[3:38:30.780 --> 3:38:33.780]  Because it was too evasive, right?
[3:38:33.780 --> 3:38:35.780]  It was too much in our face, you know?
[3:38:35.780 --> 3:38:37.780]  Right there, pansexual
[3:38:37.780 --> 3:38:38.780]  So now they changed it to pansexual
[3:38:38.780 --> 3:38:41.780]  And you've got a 50-minute report at band.video
[3:38:41.780 --> 3:38:43.780]  And at your site, firepowernews.com
[3:38:43.780 --> 3:38:44.780]  Yes
[3:38:44.780 --> 3:38:45.780]  Yes
[3:38:45.780 --> 3:38:46.780]  Let's get Norm's take on this
[3:38:46.780 --> 3:38:47.780]  Then I want to take some calls
[3:38:47.780 --> 3:38:49.780]  I'm speechless
[3:38:49.780 --> 3:38:51.780]  I mean, you know, I'm speechless
[3:38:51.780 --> 3:38:54.780]  You're going to show your photos of men with no clothes on
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:56.780]  In Austin with small children in public?
[3:38:56.780 --> 3:38:57.780]  Sure
[3:38:57.780 --> 3:38:58.780]  I mean, start rolling it
[3:38:58.780 --> 3:39:02.780]  We're going to teach children how to have anal sex in school
[3:39:02.780 --> 3:39:03.780]  First graders
[3:39:03.780 --> 3:39:04.780]  First graders
[3:39:04.780 --> 3:39:07.780]  No, no, no, that you can't be serious
[3:39:07.780 --> 3:39:08.780]  This is the world
[3:39:08.780 --> 3:39:10.780]  These people mean business, bro
[3:39:10.780 --> 3:39:11.780]  Yeah, this is the world we live in
[3:39:11.780 --> 3:39:14.780]  In first grade, we're going to teach people about
[3:39:14.780 --> 3:39:15.780]  Well, they got to confuse them early on
[3:39:15.780 --> 3:39:18.780]  Mainly in England, half the autistic kids are now
[3:39:18.780 --> 3:39:19.780]  Caught by the pedophile now
[3:39:19.780 --> 3:39:22.780]  You've seen this regulation with your own eyes?
[3:39:22.780 --> 3:39:24.780]  I'm sorry, Alex, I'm not calling you a liar
[3:39:24.780 --> 3:39:25.780]  Maybe see news, put it up
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:27.780]  They've already done it in California
[3:39:27.780 --> 3:39:30.780]  Now it's here in Texas, of all places
[3:39:30.780 --> 3:39:31.780]  And you know what?
[3:39:31.780 --> 3:39:33.780]  They got to start rolling Rob Do's report without audio
[3:39:33.780 --> 3:39:35.780]  And again, be your discretion advised
[3:39:35.780 --> 3:39:38.780]  This is what is going on in Austin with small children
[3:39:38.780 --> 3:39:41.780]  Start rolling Do's report and play in the first hour, guys
[3:39:41.780 --> 3:39:42.780]  Go ahead
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:44.780]  Okay, so the main reason why they're doing it
[3:39:44.780 --> 3:39:46.780]  They're giving an excuse like this
[3:39:46.780 --> 3:39:49.780]  By the way, those guys on screen say we're here to groom your children
[3:39:49.780 --> 3:39:50.780]  There are, sorry, go ahead
[3:39:50.780 --> 3:39:52.780]  Yeah, they're saying they want to
[3:39:52.780 --> 3:39:54.780]  This is in elementary school, it's right here on screen
[3:39:54.780 --> 3:39:57.780]  So the children will have, will be safe
[3:39:57.780 --> 3:39:58.780]  That's how they're saying it
[3:39:58.780 --> 3:39:59.780]  Safe from what?
[3:39:59.780 --> 3:40:01.780]  So they will have, they will be safe
[3:40:01.780 --> 3:40:03.780]  That's exactly how they're pushing, you have to think about it
[3:40:03.780 --> 3:40:04.780]  Now watch, they start spreading their legs
[3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:06.780]  They're probably little kids right here
[3:40:06.780 --> 3:40:08.780]  You think I'm joking
[3:40:08.780 --> 3:40:12.780]  I know, when somebody first sees this, they can't believe it
[3:40:12.780 --> 3:40:14.780]  This guy says we're grooming your children, you can't stop us
[3:40:14.780 --> 3:40:16.780]  Yeah
[3:40:16.780 --> 3:40:19.780]  And he goes and does, he spreads his legs for little kids
[3:40:19.780 --> 3:40:25.780]  Now you're going to see children riding men with erect genitals through their pants in a moment
[3:40:25.780 --> 3:40:30.780]  And then you're going to see men naked except glitterers on their genitals hugging little children
[3:40:30.780 --> 3:40:33.780]  And this is becoming the norm, which is really insane
[3:40:33.780 --> 3:40:35.780]  And then you want us to show the new thing that's on national TV
[3:40:35.780 --> 3:40:39.780]  HBO is teaching how to have sex with, with, with earthworms
[3:40:39.780 --> 3:40:44.780]  You're not messing with me, are you?
[3:40:44.780 --> 3:40:45.780]  No, I'm not joking, keep going
[3:40:45.780 --> 3:40:47.780]  This is the word we live in
[3:40:47.780 --> 3:40:49.780]  Man, why are you against sex with earthworms?
[3:40:49.780 --> 3:40:52.780]  I guess I'm just not species sensitive enough
[3:40:52.780 --> 3:40:54.780]  Call me a speciesist, you know
[3:40:54.780 --> 3:40:56.780]  Well, yeah, you're very bigoted of you
[3:40:56.780 --> 3:40:59.780]  Well, no, the guys, they're raping them, but they say it's okay
[3:40:59.780 --> 3:41:00.780]  You see that?
[3:41:00.780 --> 3:41:01.780]  So disgusting
[3:41:01.780 --> 3:41:03.780]  Now we're blurring this for chill, for people right now
[3:41:03.780 --> 3:41:04.780]  This is in an elementary school?
[3:41:04.780 --> 3:41:05.780]  Yeah
[3:41:05.780 --> 3:41:06.780]  And, and, and libraries
[3:41:06.780 --> 3:41:09.780]  And public libraries, and then parents are taking their children
[3:41:09.780 --> 3:41:12.780]  And in some cases they don't tell the parents
[3:41:15.780 --> 3:41:16.780]  It's crazy, it's crazy
[3:41:16.780 --> 3:41:18.780]  We have that poor kid, no wonder she looks confused
[3:41:18.780 --> 3:41:21.780]  No, watch this, spread their legs to them, this is the spread in the legs part
[3:41:23.780 --> 3:41:25.780]  And then they have the kids clapping to them
[3:41:25.780 --> 3:41:29.780]  And some, some videos they show even the kids taking and putting money
[3:41:29.780 --> 3:41:31.780]  So let me see if I get this right
[3:41:31.780 --> 3:41:34.780]  If you wear the wrong Halloween costume
[3:41:34.780 --> 3:41:36.780]  You can be targeted for prosecution
[3:41:36.780 --> 3:41:39.780]  But if you're a guy and you dress up as a chick
[3:41:39.780 --> 3:41:42.780]  And you, and you, and you writhe in my child's face
[3:41:42.780 --> 3:41:43.780]  That's okay?
[3:41:43.780 --> 3:41:44.780]  Yeah, yeah
[3:41:44.780 --> 3:41:48.780]  And today, how do we distinguish between what's prohibited and what's prohibited?
[3:41:48.780 --> 3:41:53.780]  Hey guys, show the, show eight-year-olds twerking with the men with erections behind them
[3:41:53.780 --> 3:41:54.780]  No, come on
[3:41:54.780 --> 3:41:58.780]  No, no, no, this is public, and the media said, hey, kids like King too
[3:41:58.780 --> 3:42:00.780]  Major media praised this right here
[3:42:00.780 --> 3:42:02.780]  That's an eight-year-old boy
[3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:06.780]  And then watch this guy with the erection comes over behind him
[3:42:07.780 --> 3:42:09.780]  This is terrible, this is terrible
[3:42:09.780 --> 3:42:10.780]  This is liberal
[3:42:10.780 --> 3:42:14.780]  I mean, I don't know where I have a little kid, a little boy out here twerking
[3:42:14.780 --> 3:42:16.780]  And he only has on shorts
[3:42:16.780 --> 3:42:18.780]  And he's grown men
[3:42:18.780 --> 3:42:20.780]  And by the way, a bunch of newspapers said this is good
[3:42:20.780 --> 3:42:22.780]  Good for what?
[3:42:22.780 --> 3:42:26.780]  Well, because it said, it said, kids like King too
[3:42:26.780 --> 3:42:28.780]  Look, I mean, we're all here because of sex
[3:42:28.780 --> 3:42:32.780]  We're all, you know, if sex is a sin, we're all circumstantial evidence of other people's crime
[3:42:32.780 --> 3:42:36.780]  Yeah, but children aren't supposed to be involved until they're older because they're not even thinking about it
[3:42:36.780 --> 3:42:37.780]  That's exactly right
[3:42:37.780 --> 3:42:41.780]  You know, my kids are all grown, I guess, I should be thankful, I should be worried about my grandchildren
[3:42:41.780 --> 3:42:42.780]  You go to school, I don't want you coming home
[3:42:42.780 --> 3:42:44.780]  Well, that's why we're showing this
[3:42:44.780 --> 3:42:47.780]  We're gonna come back with calls, I promise, but I wanted to cover this
[3:42:47.780 --> 3:42:52.780]  I promise, X, Jake, Brian, Eric, John, I'm getting to you, I will get to all five of those callers
[3:42:52.780 --> 3:42:55.780]  But we're not playing, if you're a radio listener, you're lucky you didn't have to see this
[3:42:55.780 --> 3:43:00.780]  Remember, while you're busy about your life, they want your children, they're hunting your children
[3:43:03.780 --> 3:43:06.780]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:43:06.780 --> 3:43:14.780]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[3:43:14.780 --> 3:43:16.780]  It's just that simple
[3:43:16.780 --> 3:43:26.780]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine
[3:43:26.780 --> 3:43:33.780]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends
[3:43:33.780 --> 3:43:37.780]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it
[3:43:37.780 --> 3:43:41.780]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons
[3:43:41.780 --> 3:43:44.780]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long
[3:43:44.780 --> 3:43:49.780]  It's simple, get your high quality iodine at InfowarsStore.com and help fund the Infowar
[3:43:49.780 --> 3:43:52.780]  InfowarsStore.com
[3:43:52.780 --> 3:43:56.780]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end, it's the iodine challenge
[3:43:56.780 --> 3:44:00.780]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together
[3:44:01.780 --> 3:44:09.780]  Again, I'm not talking down to the Infowars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this
[3:44:09.780 --> 3:44:12.780]  And I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking about iodine
[3:44:12.780 --> 3:44:17.780]  Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass-tron boat
[3:44:17.780 --> 3:44:22.780]  And you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in
[3:44:22.780 --> 3:44:25.780]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live
[3:44:25.780 --> 3:44:27.780]  Okay, it's the same thing
[3:44:27.780 --> 3:44:33.780]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride, that's why in every western nation, they put it in the water
[3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:35.780]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die
[3:44:35.780 --> 3:44:39.780]  The chai comms don't put it in the water, they'd execute you if you did that
[3:44:39.780 --> 3:44:47.780]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else
[3:44:47.780 --> 3:44:51.780]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfowarsStore.com
[3:44:51.780 --> 3:44:53.780]  We have all the documents and articles linked
[3:44:53.780 --> 3:44:57.780]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't
[3:44:57.780 --> 3:45:00.780]  Again, get iodine at InfowarsStore.com
[3:45:02.780 --> 3:45:06.780]  Infowars presents Alex Jones
[3:45:06.780 --> 3:45:11.780]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association
[3:45:11.780 --> 3:45:14.780]  The most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh
[3:45:14.780 --> 3:45:18.780]  Just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility
[3:45:18.780 --> 3:45:21.780]  And a lot of babies die in the womb and it causes cancer
[3:45:21.780 --> 3:45:24.780]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this
[3:45:24.780 --> 3:45:29.780]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California
[3:45:29.780 --> 3:45:31.780]  Unless it's part of adding fluoride
[3:45:31.780 --> 3:45:35.780]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water
[3:45:35.780 --> 3:45:39.780]  Because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children
[3:45:39.780 --> 3:45:42.780]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride
[3:45:42.780 --> 3:45:46.780]  And don't get the thing that counters iodine at InfowarsStore.com
[3:45:46.780 --> 3:45:48.780]  Drink fluoride and die
[3:45:48.780 --> 3:45:51.780]  Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over
[3:45:51.780 --> 3:45:55.780]  Do not visit InfowarsStore.com and get high poly iodine to counter it
[3:45:55.780 --> 3:45:58.780]  No, roll over and die dirty Americans
[3:45:58.780 --> 3:46:02.780]  Infowars.com forward slash show
[3:46:02.780 --> 3:46:05.780]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious
[3:46:05.780 --> 3:46:08.780]  And I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners
[3:46:08.780 --> 3:46:09.780]  I'm just stating the facts
[3:46:09.780 --> 3:46:12.780]  I own a chainsaw, I've had it since I was in college
[3:46:12.780 --> 3:46:16.780]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times
[3:46:16.780 --> 3:46:21.780]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick
[3:46:21.780 --> 3:46:23.780]  And I feel like an idiot for not oiling it
[3:46:23.780 --> 3:46:29.780]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say super glue in the oil container on it
[3:46:29.780 --> 3:46:33.780]  It would seize up forever, but only an evil person would do that
[3:46:33.780 --> 3:46:37.780]  Well, fluoride's like putting super glue in a chainsaw, it's gonna make it seize up
[3:46:37.780 --> 3:46:39.780]  And that's why they put it in the water
[3:46:39.780 --> 3:46:41.780]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family
[3:46:41.780 --> 3:46:42.780]  Yes, they're really evil
[3:46:42.780 --> 3:46:47.780]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication
[3:46:47.780 --> 3:46:48.780]  It's that simple
[3:46:48.780 --> 3:46:52.780]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late
[3:46:52.780 --> 3:46:53.780]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy
[3:46:53.780 --> 3:46:58.780]  Find out more at InfowarsStore.com and take action against the globalist
[3:46:58.780 --> 3:47:00.780]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet
[3:47:00.780 --> 3:47:29.780]  It's almost like we're carbon-based live forms
[3:47:29.780 --> 3:47:34.780]  We're now only 13 months out from the most important elections in human history
[3:47:34.780 --> 3:47:36.780]  I'm your host Alex Jones, riding shotgun with me
[3:47:36.780 --> 3:47:38.780]  This is, of course, Will Johnson from Firepower
[3:47:38.780 --> 3:47:40.780]  Week night, 7 o'clock Central, banned on video
[3:47:40.780 --> 3:47:44.780]  Infowars.com, syndicated out on the radio and TV satellites
[3:47:44.780 --> 3:47:46.780]  All of those fine affiliates out there picking it up
[3:47:46.780 --> 3:47:48.780]  And, of course, Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer
[3:47:48.780 --> 3:47:52.780]  He'll be on The War Room coming up in about 12 minutes
[3:47:52.780 --> 3:47:55.780]  With Owen Schreuer at Infowars.com for his last show
[3:47:55.780 --> 3:47:57.780]  And banned on video, remember
[3:47:57.780 --> 3:47:59.780]  These scumbags want to silence us
[3:47:59.780 --> 3:48:02.780]  So they can roll out their takeover, but it's not going to happen
[3:48:02.780 --> 3:48:05.780]  We are here as the modern ball of ears
[3:48:05.780 --> 3:48:07.780]  Broadcasting worldwide and ringing the alarm
[3:48:07.780 --> 3:48:11.780]  We're promoting a pro-human future against the technocracy
[3:48:11.780 --> 3:48:13.780]  All right, X in Dallas, finishing up with you
[3:48:13.780 --> 3:48:16.780]  You were saying when you went out there for a music career
[3:48:16.780 --> 3:48:21.780]  The record label told you to basically try to act like a thug is what they meant
[3:48:21.780 --> 3:48:23.780]  Very racist, you were saying
[3:48:23.780 --> 3:48:28.780]  And you need to get down with methistopheles, which, of course, is the name of the devil
[3:48:28.780 --> 3:48:31.780]  And the Faustian riddle where you need to sell your soul
[3:48:31.780 --> 3:48:34.780]  Describe that for us
[3:48:34.780 --> 3:48:39.780]  Well, right, the first day they said, hey, we got a guy named
[3:48:39.780 --> 3:48:43.780]  I'm not going to say his name, but we got a guy who's a friend of the label
[3:48:43.780 --> 3:48:44.780]  Who's going to show you around Hollywood
[3:48:44.780 --> 3:48:46.780]  I went over to his house, long story short
[3:48:46.780 --> 3:48:49.780]  He said, you know, you can call me Mephisto for short
[3:48:49.780 --> 3:48:51.780]  And I said, well, I don't know who that is
[3:48:51.780 --> 3:48:53.780]  And he said, look up, look up my sister
[3:48:53.780 --> 3:48:55.780]  I looked it up, it was methistopheles
[3:48:55.780 --> 3:48:58.780]  Later on that night, he asked me to pray to Satan
[3:48:58.780 --> 3:49:00.780]  And I was just kind of like, ha, ha, ha, this is funny
[3:49:00.780 --> 3:49:04.780]  But then, so I finished the album up
[3:49:04.780 --> 3:49:09.780]  And whenever we were done with the album, I got back to Texas
[3:49:09.780 --> 3:49:11.780]  And I told him, you know what, I'm done with this
[3:49:11.780 --> 3:49:12.780]  I don't want to do this anymore
[3:49:12.780 --> 3:49:16.780]  And just so people know, I'm a real person, you can go look up the album
[3:49:16.780 --> 3:49:17.780]  If you want me to name the album, I'll name it
[3:49:17.780 --> 3:49:19.780]  Sure, go ahead
[3:49:19.780 --> 3:49:21.780]  It's called Halfway Across the Stars
[3:49:21.780 --> 3:49:23.780]  And it's by Chester Rushing
[3:49:23.780 --> 3:49:26.780]  And if you looked up the album
[3:49:26.780 --> 3:49:27.780]  Oh, listen, that's standard
[3:49:27.780 --> 3:49:29.780]  Mark Dice, they were going to have a national show
[3:49:29.780 --> 3:49:31.780]  With a very big rock star
[3:49:31.780 --> 3:49:33.780]  And they just said, listen, we worship the devil here
[3:49:33.780 --> 3:49:34.780]  And that's really who runs things
[3:49:34.780 --> 3:49:36.780]  We need you to, you know, pray to Satan with us
[3:49:36.780 --> 3:49:39.780]  And that's standing, Bob Dylan's giving speeches
[3:49:39.780 --> 3:49:43.780]  He says, I signed up with the chief master and commander, Lucifer
[3:49:43.780 --> 3:49:45.780]  And I went to the crossroads and sold my soul
[3:49:45.780 --> 3:49:47.780]  That's really what these people are into
[3:49:47.780 --> 3:49:49.780]  It's not a game, it's not a joke
[3:49:49.780 --> 3:49:50.780]  God bless you
[3:49:50.780 --> 3:49:52.780]  And, of course, this idiot saying, sign up
[3:49:52.780 --> 3:49:53.780]  Wasn't really Methodistopheles
[3:49:53.780 --> 3:49:55.780]  They're a bunch of slaves
[3:49:55.780 --> 3:49:56.780]  That's why Hollywood...
[3:49:56.780 --> 3:49:58.780]  Listen, this all...
[3:49:58.780 --> 3:50:00.780]  You know, you live by skull and bones there
[3:50:00.780 --> 3:50:03.780]  So, I mean, you're pretty close to one of the little satanic temples
[3:50:03.780 --> 3:50:05.780]  And believe me, it looks like it
[3:50:05.780 --> 3:50:06.780]  I mean, it's a secret...
[3:50:06.780 --> 3:50:08.780]  You know, it yields oldest secret society
[3:50:08.780 --> 3:50:11.780]  And arguably one of its most prestigious
[3:50:11.780 --> 3:50:14.780]  It has a building located just off downtown
[3:50:14.780 --> 3:50:16.780]  Nobody ever gets to go in it
[3:50:16.780 --> 3:50:18.780]  But one day they left the door open
[3:50:18.780 --> 3:50:19.780]  And I wanted to sneak in
[3:50:19.780 --> 3:50:21.780]  Oh, the tomb? You stuck in the tomb?
[3:50:21.780 --> 3:50:22.780]  Well, I didn't quite get in
[3:50:22.780 --> 3:50:24.780]  The gate was ajar
[3:50:24.780 --> 3:50:25.780]  The door was open
[3:50:25.780 --> 3:50:27.780]  And I thought, well, if the door is open
[3:50:27.780 --> 3:50:29.780]  I should go and check and make sure everything's okay
[3:50:29.780 --> 3:50:31.780]  And about the time I got to the door
[3:50:31.780 --> 3:50:33.780]  An armed guy came out and said, you can't come in
[3:50:33.780 --> 3:50:34.780]  Now, I didn't smell garlic
[3:50:34.780 --> 3:50:35.780]  I didn't see a cloven hoof
[3:50:35.780 --> 3:50:37.780]  The music from the exorcist wasn't playing
[3:50:37.780 --> 3:50:38.780]  But it was creepy
[3:50:38.780 --> 3:50:40.780]  Well, I know it goes on there
[3:50:40.780 --> 3:50:43.780]  Because Charlotte Isherby's dad was in it
[3:50:43.780 --> 3:50:47.780]  And he released the info to Anthony Sutton
[3:50:47.780 --> 3:50:48.780]  And the church committees
[3:50:48.780 --> 3:50:50.780]  And so we know exactly what goes on
[3:50:50.780 --> 3:50:52.780]  Well, there is a lot of recruitment that goes on
[3:50:52.780 --> 3:50:53.780]  And there are two secrets
[3:50:53.780 --> 3:50:54.780]  I mean, it's a secret society
[3:50:54.780 --> 3:50:57.780]  And you pledge to keep those secrets forever
[3:50:57.780 --> 3:50:58.780]  And you...
[3:50:58.780 --> 3:51:02.780]  But we do know that they channel a spirit
[3:51:02.780 --> 3:51:05.780]  Well, you know, that's where I listen to you
[3:51:05.780 --> 3:51:06.780]  And I respect you
[3:51:06.780 --> 3:51:08.780]  But I'm tone deaf to spiritual realities
[3:51:08.780 --> 3:51:11.780]  I mean, I believe in grace and the power of redemption
[3:51:11.780 --> 3:51:12.780]  But in terms of evil
[3:51:12.780 --> 3:51:13.780]  I see its consequences
[3:51:13.780 --> 3:51:14.780]  I don't see the spirits
[3:51:14.780 --> 3:51:15.780]  Sure
[3:51:15.780 --> 3:51:16.780]  But what I'm telling you is
[3:51:16.780 --> 3:51:18.780]  It's on record that they do rituals
[3:51:18.780 --> 3:51:20.780]  But I know they have ritualism
[3:51:20.780 --> 3:51:22.780]  Have you ever seen The Good Shepherd?
[3:51:22.780 --> 3:51:23.780]  Yeah, I have
[3:51:23.780 --> 3:51:25.780]  It was produced by Robert De Niro
[3:51:25.780 --> 3:51:26.780]  Right
[3:51:26.780 --> 3:51:27.780]  It's got Ned Damon in it
[3:51:27.780 --> 3:51:28.780]  Yeah
[3:51:28.780 --> 3:51:29.780]  But that's based on a true story
[3:51:29.780 --> 3:51:32.780]  And the rituals where they're in the big vats of feces
[3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:33.780]  That's real
[3:51:33.780 --> 3:51:34.780]  Wow
[3:51:34.780 --> 3:51:36.780]  And they get in coffins and are reborn
[3:51:36.780 --> 3:51:38.780]  Have a spirit come into them
[3:51:39.780 --> 3:51:41.780]  I said it before on this show
[3:51:41.780 --> 3:51:43.780]  Just moments ago, I'll say it again
[3:51:43.780 --> 3:51:44.780]  I don't get out enough
[3:51:44.780 --> 3:51:45.780]  How do you know all this?
[3:51:45.780 --> 3:51:46.780]  Well, this is right down the street from me, brother
[3:51:46.780 --> 3:51:48.780]  It is, but I guess I'm not awake
[3:51:48.780 --> 3:51:50.780]  I guess I need to get woke, right?
[3:51:51.780 --> 3:51:53.780]  Yeah, well, you can say info wars is actually woke
[3:51:53.780 --> 3:51:55.780]  You're like Kanye West at Alex Jones level
[3:51:55.780 --> 3:51:56.780]  No, I hear something
[3:51:56.780 --> 3:51:58.780]  But I mean, seriously, though, that's not...
[3:51:58.780 --> 3:51:59.780]  Let me tell you something
[3:51:59.780 --> 3:52:01.780]  This stuff's real, okay?
[3:52:01.780 --> 3:52:02.780]  Yeah
[3:52:02.780 --> 3:52:04.780]  Okay, let's take a few more calls here
[3:52:04.780 --> 3:52:05.780]  Who's been holding the longest
[3:52:05.780 --> 3:52:06.780]  I appreciate Brian in Iowa
[3:52:06.780 --> 3:52:07.780]  You're a trooper
[3:52:07.780 --> 3:52:08.780]  Brian's been holding so long
[3:52:08.780 --> 3:52:10.780]  Make sure we get his name addressed
[3:52:10.780 --> 3:52:11.780]  Send him a free t-shirt
[3:52:11.780 --> 3:52:12.780]  Brian, thanks for holding
[3:52:12.780 --> 3:52:13.780]  Go ahead
[3:52:13.780 --> 3:52:15.780]  Hey, Norm, if you want to be woke up
[3:52:15.780 --> 3:52:17.780]  Take X2 with some brain force
[3:52:17.780 --> 3:52:20.780]  It'll defibrillate your brain
[3:52:20.780 --> 3:52:21.780]  That sounds good
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:24.780]  And you've really been holding since the 2016 election
[3:52:24.780 --> 3:52:25.780]  Yes, sir, go ahead, Brian
[3:52:25.780 --> 3:52:27.780]  Pretty much, pretty much
[3:52:27.780 --> 3:52:32.780]  So Tim Poole did a video on Katie Hill Stepping Down
[3:52:32.780 --> 3:52:36.780]  And he kind of tied it in to Ilhan Omar
[3:52:36.780 --> 3:52:40.780]  Saying that since Nancy Pelosi was saying
[3:52:40.780 --> 3:52:42.780]  That it was a good thing that she had stepped down
[3:52:42.780 --> 3:52:44.780]  Why isn't she putting the pressure
[3:52:44.780 --> 3:52:46.780]  On Ilhan Omar to do the same
[3:52:46.780 --> 3:52:49.780]  Because they essentially have done the same thing
[3:52:49.780 --> 3:52:52.780]  Yeah, Katie Hill's in trouble for, I guess, having some
[3:52:52.780 --> 3:52:55.780]  Swinging parties or whatever
[3:52:55.780 --> 3:52:58.780]  And now Ilhan Omar
[3:52:58.780 --> 3:53:00.780]  I mean, that woman is not just doing that
[3:53:00.780 --> 3:53:03.780]  She's engaged in fake marriages, all sorts of fraud
[3:53:03.780 --> 3:53:06.780]  Whatever they're going to lose support from the Muslim community
[3:53:06.780 --> 3:53:08.780]  If they start going after Ilhan Omar that way
[3:53:08.780 --> 3:53:10.780]  She gets a pass, she gets a piece of pass
[3:53:10.780 --> 3:53:12.780]  That can be as nasty as she wants to be
[3:53:12.780 --> 3:53:13.780]  Yep
[3:53:13.780 --> 3:53:15.780]  It infuriates me because I got a brother-in-law
[3:53:15.780 --> 3:53:18.780]  That lives up there and he's blind to it
[3:53:18.780 --> 3:53:20.780]  And his sister's blind to it
[3:53:20.780 --> 3:53:22.780]  Well, that's just political correctness
[3:53:22.780 --> 3:53:24.780]  It's confirmed now
[3:53:24.780 --> 3:53:26.780]  Even Fox News has covered that there are gangs
[3:53:26.780 --> 3:53:28.780]  Of anti-white Somalis
[3:53:28.780 --> 3:53:30.780]  Going around attacking, beating, even killing people
[3:53:30.780 --> 3:53:32.780]  And the media is covering it up, that's wrong
[3:53:32.780 --> 3:53:34.780]  There are gangs of white people going around killing black folks
[3:53:34.780 --> 3:53:35.780]  That's horrible too
[3:53:35.780 --> 3:53:38.780]  But that's what the liberal media has created this atmosphere
[3:53:38.780 --> 3:53:40.780]  Where people say whites are so evil now
[3:53:40.780 --> 3:53:42.780]  That they're getting racially attacked all over the nation
[3:53:42.780 --> 3:53:44.780]  I know you cover a lot of that will on firepower
[3:53:44.780 --> 3:53:47.780]  I talk about that all the time and I want to address that issue all the time
[3:53:47.780 --> 3:53:50.780]  Because, you know, back in the day they used to attack black people
[3:53:50.780 --> 3:53:52.780]  And this was the Democrats
[3:53:52.780 --> 3:53:54.780]  And now the year 2019, about to be 2020
[3:53:54.780 --> 3:53:56.780]  They're attacking white people
[3:53:56.780 --> 3:53:58.780]  They're ruling, they want to put white people out in the street
[3:53:58.780 --> 3:54:01.780]  And hose them down with fire hose, sick dogs on them
[3:54:01.780 --> 3:54:03.780]  That's the way the Democrats did in the past
[3:54:03.780 --> 3:54:04.780]  They're wanting to do it today
[3:54:04.780 --> 3:54:06.780]  You're right, they're definitely trying to create racial division
[3:54:06.780 --> 3:54:09.780]  And it hasn't worked so far, but they're sure as hell trying
[3:54:09.780 --> 3:54:11.780]  Thank you, Brian, great point
[3:54:11.780 --> 3:54:13.780]  Okay, who's up next here?
[3:54:13.780 --> 3:54:17.780]  Let's go to Jake in California
[3:54:17.780 --> 3:54:19.780]  Thanks for holding it, go ahead
[3:54:19.780 --> 3:54:21.780]  I'll bring out the stone
[3:54:21.780 --> 3:54:23.780]  You wake up my whole family
[3:54:23.780 --> 3:54:25.780]  You're a bad American
[3:54:25.780 --> 3:54:27.780]  I'll fit them on here
[3:54:27.780 --> 3:54:34.780]  Hey, Alex, oh my gosh
[3:54:34.780 --> 3:54:36.780]  It's so amazing to talk to you
[3:54:36.780 --> 3:54:37.780]  You have no idea
[3:54:37.780 --> 3:54:38.780]  It's amazing talking to you, brother
[3:54:38.780 --> 3:54:42.780]  Yeah, if there's anybody in the world that could just meet
[3:54:42.780 --> 3:54:45.780]  It wouldn't be any celebrity or any world leader would be you
[3:54:45.780 --> 3:54:47.780]  Well, brother, you're meeting me right now
[3:54:47.780 --> 3:54:49.780]  And I'm honored to talk to you as well
[3:54:49.780 --> 3:54:51.780]  All right, okay
[3:54:51.780 --> 3:54:54.780]  Actually, Brian, if you really want to be woke up
[3:54:54.780 --> 3:54:57.780]  Ask Alex what he really saw
[3:54:57.780 --> 3:54:59.780]  When he broke into Bohemian Grove
[3:54:59.780 --> 3:55:02.780]  If he really saw a human sacrifice
[3:55:02.780 --> 3:55:05.780]  Oh, yeah, Norm, it was Brian's last caller
[3:55:05.780 --> 3:55:07.780]  But I'm sure you've heard of Bohemian Grove
[3:55:07.780 --> 3:55:08.780]  I have, I have
[3:55:08.780 --> 3:55:10.780]  I mean, it's mainly a gateway into the occult
[3:55:10.780 --> 3:55:12.780]  But the practitioners take it real serious
[3:55:12.780 --> 3:55:14.780]  Everybody else is like, what the hell's going on
[3:55:14.780 --> 3:55:16.780]  But it's a simulated fauciating human sacrifice of a child
[3:55:16.780 --> 3:55:17.780]  Wow
[3:55:19.780 --> 3:55:21.780]  I hate to sound naive, I like to think
[3:55:21.780 --> 3:55:22.780]  I got footage of it
[3:55:22.780 --> 3:55:24.780]  I'd like to see that because, I mean, look
[3:55:24.780 --> 3:55:27.780]  I'm not saying you're a liar, it's not my style
[3:55:27.780 --> 3:55:30.780]  But if that's what people get into and get off on
[3:55:30.780 --> 3:55:32.780]  I mean, it's an important thing to tell us about it
[3:55:32.780 --> 3:55:33.780]  There it is, that's real strength
[3:55:33.780 --> 3:55:34.780]  It's wrong
[3:55:36.780 --> 3:55:38.780]  I remember seeing that
[3:55:39.780 --> 3:55:41.780]  That's why they want me off YouTube and all that
[3:55:41.780 --> 3:55:43.780]  So we can't show people this stuff
[3:55:43.780 --> 3:55:44.780]  Wow
[3:55:44.780 --> 3:55:45.780]  Two people in the black robes
[3:55:45.780 --> 3:55:46.780]  Yeah
[3:55:46.780 --> 3:55:47.780]  They got the high priest
[3:55:47.780 --> 3:55:48.780]  Did you take this film?
[3:55:48.780 --> 3:55:49.780]  Yeah, I did
[3:55:49.780 --> 3:55:52.780]  Yeah, they are burning the child in effigy
[3:55:53.780 --> 3:55:55.780]  I don't think they're killing a real child, but
[3:55:55.780 --> 3:55:56.780]  Yeah, no, I hear you
[3:55:56.780 --> 3:55:58.780]  But I mean, it's the thought that counts, right?
[3:55:58.780 --> 3:56:00.780]  It's the intent that counts
[3:56:00.780 --> 3:56:03.780]  Jake, I gotta jump, call me again, I apologize, love you
[3:56:03.780 --> 3:56:05.780]  Okay, real quick, John in Canada
[3:56:05.780 --> 3:56:07.780]  You say Canada's the wet dream of the globalist, go ahead
[3:56:08.780 --> 3:56:09.780]  Hey, Matt, how's it going?
[3:56:09.780 --> 3:56:11.780]  I'm gonna be really quick here
[3:56:11.780 --> 3:56:14.780]  But you look at what's going on right now up here
[3:56:14.780 --> 3:56:18.780]  We just had all the stops pulled out in this last election with Justin Trudeau
[3:56:18.780 --> 3:56:20.780]  Yeah, there's the voter fraud
[3:56:20.780 --> 3:56:23.780]  There's been total ownership of the media
[3:56:23.780 --> 3:56:27.780]  This is setting the stage for what you guys are gonna go through in 2020
[3:56:27.780 --> 3:56:30.780]  Oh yeah, they arrest pastors that read from the Bible in Canada
[3:56:31.780 --> 3:56:35.780]  Yeah, now Alex, you gotta listen to this, okay?
[3:56:35.780 --> 3:56:36.780]  You gotta pull all the stops
[3:56:36.780 --> 3:56:40.780]  If you actually look at us, we're USA minor, okay?
[3:56:40.780 --> 3:56:43.780]  You gotta think globally, you gotta think in the little regions, right?
[3:56:43.780 --> 3:56:45.780]  We're part of the US region
[3:56:45.780 --> 3:56:49.780]  You're gonna take everything they've used here and learn and they're gonna double and triple it on you guys
[3:56:49.780 --> 3:56:50.780]  I agree
[3:56:50.780 --> 3:56:53.780]  Okay, Matt, we have a good day and thank you very much
[3:56:53.780 --> 3:56:55.780]  God bless you for holding your real trooper
[3:56:55.780 --> 3:56:56.780]  Eric and Arkansas, we got to everybody
[3:56:56.780 --> 3:56:59.780]  Eric, take us out of here, tell Gunner
[3:56:59.780 --> 3:57:03.780]  Alright, okay, big time fan, first time caller
[3:57:03.780 --> 3:57:05.780]  Three key points, I wanna get it
[3:57:05.780 --> 3:57:08.780]  One of them is the UN gun agenda
[3:57:08.780 --> 3:57:13.780]  It probably fits into the other Agenda 30, 2030
[3:57:13.780 --> 3:57:19.780]  But can you tell me the first time when they started taking guns away from people in America?
[3:57:19.780 --> 3:57:21.780]  They started in the 60s, right?
[3:57:21.780 --> 3:57:22.780]  Yes
[3:57:22.780 --> 3:57:24.780]  Well, they took it from black folks at the end of the Civil War
[3:57:24.780 --> 3:57:26.780]  That's when the NRA was founded to stop that, but yeah
[3:57:26.780 --> 3:57:31.780]  1960s, they started where no felons can't have fire on
[3:57:31.780 --> 3:57:32.780]  So when did that start?
[3:57:32.780 --> 3:57:34.780]  They started in the early 60s, right?
[3:57:34.780 --> 3:57:36.780]  It was a UN funded agenda, it was all brought on
[3:57:36.780 --> 3:57:39.780]  7277, you're absolutely right, I'm out of time
[3:57:39.780 --> 3:57:40.780]  Get his number
[3:57:40.780 --> 3:57:43.780]  But listen, coming up, Norm Pattis is gonna be on the war with the destroyer
[3:57:43.780 --> 3:57:47.780]  And then firepower tonight, 7 o'clock central, infowars.com
[3:57:47.780 --> 3:57:49.780]  And please, keep spreading the word about the broadcast
[3:57:49.780 --> 3:58:11.780]  Great job, crew, thank you all so much
