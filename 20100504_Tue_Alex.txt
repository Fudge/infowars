[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:29.840]  law enforcement officials don't know who left the Nissan Pathfinder behind but at this point
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.520]  the mayor believes the suspect acted alone if i had to guess 25 cents this would be exactly that
[00:37.520 --> 00:43.280]  somebody who's homegrown maybe a mentally deranged person or somebody with a political
[00:43.280 --> 00:50.080]  agenda that doesn't like the health care bill or something it could be anything well there you go
[00:50.080 --> 00:59.840]  ladies and gentlemen that's mayor bloomberg yesterday on cbs evening news with katie currick
[01:00.480 --> 01:08.240]  bloomberg says that he thinks it's a homegrown type tea party or anti-government run health care
[01:08.240 --> 01:17.120]  group of course now they're saying they have a pakistani suspect in custody in pakistan as arrested
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.320]  eight people number one you can't believe anything that comes out of the government
[01:23.440 --> 01:30.160]  there are real terror attacks there are staged terror attacks there are provocateur terror attacks
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.920]  and we'll have to wait and see until evidence starts coming out in court but that's why they
[01:35.920 --> 01:42.080]  have these special military kangaroos secret of court so you can't ever find out see that's the beauty
[01:42.080 --> 01:51.200]  of what our republic offers us the ap reports of course they've had to uh now order the release on
[01:51.200 --> 02:00.480]  bond of all of the hatari militia because their case is falling apart they've got one audio recording
[02:00.480 --> 02:07.040]  in a car of the leader of the hatari a tiny nine member militia two of which were feds one an FBI
[02:07.040 --> 02:14.560]  agent the other an informant and you can hear them provocaturing on the tape whoever is goading him
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.160]  and asking the questions is clearly the fed who they admit was surreptitiously recording it
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.960]  and they are now ordering the federal judge is ordering that they be released on their own
[02:28.960 --> 02:38.080]  reconnaissance but that they be monitored by ankle bracelets but that's because we have some
[02:38.080 --> 02:42.480]  type of court system yes it's corrupt yes it's got problems but it's the best in the world and we
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.960]  need to defend our bill of rights our constitution because that's what court is about it's about
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.640]  showing the proof why did they bust a tari why did they set them up because they want to create
[02:54.640 --> 03:00.080]  not because they want to create the illusion that gun owners and conservatives and libertarians are
[03:00.080 --> 03:05.200]  going to carry out terror attacks i mean you've seen the media frame yours truly frame ron paul
[03:05.200 --> 03:12.800]  frame bob bar frame chuck baldwin and claim that you know we're involved with a terrorist or extremist
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.080]  and that well you've seen the media specifically with yours truly say that i'm calling for the
[03:18.080 --> 03:26.560]  murder of police and military which is the absolute 180 degree opposite i am for having state grand
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.720]  juries indict criminals in government and corporate structure who've committed crimes and
[03:30.720 --> 03:36.560]  i do want them brought to justice and we do have spp north american union documents that are treasonous
[03:36.560 --> 03:42.400]  and uh you know if a jury finds them guilty of treason well you know what the penalty for that
[03:42.400 --> 03:48.880]  is but again that's through the court system they get a trial i get a trial everyone is supposed
[03:48.880 --> 03:56.000]  to get a trial and a jury of their peers but you're not going to get that in this case and we've
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.080]  seen the feds cook the bomb train the driver deliver the bomb in 1993 that is on record new
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.840]  york times cbs news and they've now last year released the audio tapes because they the informant
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.200]  knew they were setting him up he said look first it wasn't going to be a real bomb then you said
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.160]  make another one so it's sticking court now you're saying let the bombing go forward i know this is
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.640]  disgusting i'm not going to be part of this and the feds are like you've been keeping receipts
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.720]  you've been telling other fbi agents don't don't you shouldn't be talking about this because they
[04:24.720 --> 04:31.120]  were planning to set up a mod salon so we don't know what happened here it is so shoddy the bomb
[04:31.120 --> 04:39.040]  is so ridiculous and so mindless uh that it may be real i mean you heard jerry solente what two

[08:05.760 --> 08:11.840]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:17.520 --> 08:22.640]  coming up we've got our once a month visit with mike revero always informative and then
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.200]  steward roads of oath keepers on a host of issues the media's attempt to demonize
[08:27.840 --> 08:34.160]  oath keepers is basically terrorist he's also in an interview with raw story where he talked about
[08:34.160 --> 08:38.720]  how you know they were exposing bush how he was exposing bush when he worked for ron paul
[08:38.720 --> 08:47.680]  how we have a bipartisan problem in this country he will be joining us coming up today steward
[08:47.680 --> 08:55.920]  roads of oath keepers okay i want to give the phone number out and take phone calls in this hour
[08:55.920 --> 09:03.440]  and cover the arrest reportedly in pakistan and the united states of this faisal
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.400]  i don't know how you pronounce it faisal shazad
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.000]  who reportedly is the prime suspect in the
[09:16.000 --> 09:26.080]  the failed dud gasoline propane bomb on mayday in time square
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.360]  i don't know if this is real i don't know if it's provocateur i don't know if it's staged
[09:34.640 --> 09:40.320]  all i do know is that our supposed government has a long history of staging events and they've
[09:40.320 --> 09:46.240]  been caught red-handed many times so we have to look at this uh from a very very suspect point
[09:46.240 --> 09:55.200]  of view but because it was so ridiculously inept and unsophisticated it looks like something that
[09:55.200 --> 10:00.480]  could be real i mean just out of the gates it could be real and jerry solenta who's got a great
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.560]  brain one of the best trans forecasters out there one of the best track record said 2010 he said
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.040]  this two weeks ago on the show in fact he said it a month before that he comes on once a month
[10:11.040 --> 10:16.720]  so he said that several times the last few months the 2010 will be the year of terrorism
[10:17.360 --> 10:24.160]  and he predicted it would be low intensity uh type car bombs in the united states out of pakistan
[10:24.160 --> 10:29.600]  and that it would be real and he agrees there is some stage government terror but he said that the
[10:29.600 --> 10:35.440]  predator drones flying around killing people i mean they'll kill a wedding of 140 plus people
[10:35.440 --> 10:41.280]  just to kill one person and that makes these tribal groups very angry they believe an eye for an eye
[10:41.840 --> 10:49.520]  and they will try to strike the united states i mean what would you do if somebody no judge no
[10:49.520 --> 10:56.640]  jury no nothing just dropped a hellfire missile down in the middle of your wedding or into your
[10:56.640 --> 11:04.640]  mosque or into your business or into an apartment building who cares about collateral damage now
[11:04.640 --> 11:13.040]  remember bush making jokes what was it four years ago about no wmds here no no wmds there at the
[11:13.040 --> 11:20.480]  white house correspondence dinner even if you believe the war was righteous and just you don't
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.560]  sit around and make jokes about the fact that they lied about wmds to launch the war you don't make
[11:26.560 --> 11:33.520]  jokes about war that has killed what is it 5000 plus us trips and over a million iraqis it's it's
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.960]  disgusting it's evil and the washington post is asking today was it insensitive that barack obama
[11:40.960 --> 11:48.800]  made jokes about predator drone attacks in pakistan well of course it was insensitive i mean can you
[11:48.800 --> 11:59.120]  imagine if uh the leader of a foreign country was at a big press dinner wearing a tuxedo making
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.560]  jokes about truck bombs killing hundreds of americans the outrage would be off the chart and the
[12:06.560 --> 12:15.520]  outrage would be real but this arrogance is meant to incite people it is meant to enrage individuals
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.800]  this is psychological warfare obama also made jokes about you know we played clips yesterday
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.440]  we'll play him again today saying uh look the republicans say there are several hidden provisions
[12:25.440 --> 12:32.720]  in the health care bill no there are hundreds and that's actually true and he went on to make a joke
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.480]  he said at least my approval rating is higher in my country of birth kenya well that's actually true
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.120]  he's got like a 97 percent approval rating in the numbers i've seen in kenya i mean it's all over
[12:43.120 --> 12:47.920]  the newspapers there that he was born there and his grandmother talks about it uh michelle sataro
[12:47.920 --> 12:53.760]  known as uh michelle obama brags at multiple speeches saying you know when we go back to this
[12:53.760 --> 13:02.720]  country of birth uh his home country of of kenya it's a sickening joke in our face and he went
[13:02.720 --> 13:08.240]  further he said uh all of this tonight is brought to you by goldman sacks and they don't care if you
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.600]  don't laugh at the jokes because they're making all the money that was another true statement his
[13:13.600 --> 13:19.760]  number one contributor goldman sacks most of his cabinet goldman sacks his entire economic team
[13:19.760 --> 13:26.320]  from larry summers uh to geithner uh to the fed chair they're all goldman sacks i mean it is brought
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.880]  to you by goldman sacks and they don't care if you're angry they don't care if you're upset
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.840]  they're going to throw it in your face so see everything these presidents now say in these
[13:35.840 --> 13:44.960]  disgusting uh press dinners is a in your face rub your face in it that's what they're doing
[13:44.960 --> 13:55.760]  and they rub the face of their enemies in this arrogance they know exactly what they are doing
[13:55.760 --> 14:04.720]  now going back to faisal shazad uh who has been arrested and they're saying he's the prime suspect
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.280]  and they're supposedly eight been arrested in pakistan but you can't believe anything the pakistani
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.400]  government says you talk about a barrel of snakes uh i mean it's one of the most corrupt governments
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.640]  on earth so corrupt the global escape of nukes they're like wow you're evil here we'll just give
[14:18.640 --> 14:26.080]  you some nukes and and you know to menace india it's all part of balkanization we've got to
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.040]  attack iran someday they might get a nuke there's no evidence of that but we've got to attack them
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.200]  meanwhile pakistan run just a few hundred miles away has a whole bunch of nukes and medium range
[14:37.200 --> 14:44.320]  missiles that can deliver them more than 3000 kilometers they can get their missiles off the
[14:44.320 --> 14:51.680]  ground they can get their missiles into orbit north korea can't do that pakistan can smart folks
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.200]  over there and see the smarter the government the smarter the people they have to pull from the more
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.400]  evil why do you think the globalist system based out of europe in the united states and england is
[15:02.400 --> 15:11.280]  so evil because they've got their you know what together you get evil people into power
[15:12.160 --> 15:21.440]  and they expand their empires now what i do know is there's non-stop fear mongering in fact cue that
[15:21.440 --> 15:25.840]  bloomberg clip up again i want to play it again in a moment bloomberg on cbs news last night
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.280]  saying he believes that someone in the tea party probably did this if he had to bet
[15:31.280 --> 15:39.840]  he would say it was a tea party or anti-obama person think about that and i have another article here
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.560]  the curtain emo wrote for info wars dot com where he links to scores of a supposed left-wing
[15:48.560 --> 15:54.240]  george soros type funded blogs left media bloggers blame time square bomb on tea party
[15:54.240 --> 16:02.960]  and this was going on on may 3rd yesterday so the hype is now intensifying and bloomberg is
[16:02.960 --> 16:09.440]  out there saying he thinks that tea party type people are behind this let's go ahead and play that
[16:09.440 --> 16:18.480]  clip law enforcement officials don't know who left the Nissan Pathfinder behind but at this point
[16:18.480 --> 16:26.000]  the mayor believes the suspect acted alone if i had to guess 25 cents this would be exactly that
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.880]  somebody who's homegrown maybe a mentally deranged person or somebody with a political agenda that
[16:32.880 --> 16:40.640]  doesn't like the health care bill or something it could be anything there you go and so remember
[16:40.640 --> 16:48.640]  that america when there are terror attacks in this country the system is going to do whatever it can
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.160]  to blame it on americans that support the constitution you could be anti-war and you
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.320]  want war declared and you don't want to aggressively preemptively invade a country
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.200]  they're going to imply you're a terrorist or you could be a constitutionalist against the
[17:03.200 --> 17:08.240]  patriot act or a constitutionalist who wants to control our borders and our sovereignty
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.800]  they're going to call you a racist and a terrorist you could be against the government taking over
[17:12.800 --> 17:21.520]  health care by the way i've got articles here from all over the nation in fact rob do i think you
[17:21.520 --> 17:28.240]  rob do i think you took that article out of here where the levy official who were going to get on
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.360]  tomorrow uh said that he was in a meeting with fema and they admitted this this insurance that
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.560]  they're forcing everybody to buy this flood insurance uh is simply uh just a bailout to the
[17:38.560 --> 17:42.720]  insurance companies that they've been ordered to do it we bring that article back in thanks because
[17:42.720 --> 17:57.920]  i was hearing my stack the point is that anybody who opposes the out of control looting that is
[17:57.920 --> 18:04.240]  going on at every level of society anyone who is against that is going to be labeled a terrorist
[18:04.240 --> 18:10.160]  or racist or criminal and that is the essence of tyranny when the government starts demonizing
[18:10.720 --> 18:17.760]  citizen opposition to legislation and laws and implying that you you are evil and dangerous
[18:17.760 --> 18:22.560]  if you oppose it and that you're going to carry out terror attacks you better believe the government
[18:22.560 --> 18:29.360]  own by foreign offshore banks criminally fraudulently is getting ready to frame you and listening to
[18:29.360 --> 18:37.920]  fox news listening to cnn just randomly driving in this morning on xm it was the same script
[18:37.920 --> 18:43.120]  they had congressman israel on fox saying it's a new way of life in america we've got to give
[18:43.120 --> 18:50.000]  our rights up you know things have changed get ready for more of this uh same stuff we heard
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.800]  within 20 minutes of 9 11 the exact same talking point if it's a new world order we've got to give
[18:56.800 --> 19:06.080]  up our liberties now that's just the way it is you see the preconditioning immediately and then
[19:06.080 --> 19:12.640]  i tuned over to cnn and they they were saying citizens are scared we talked to this new york
[19:12.640 --> 19:17.360]  mother who says she's afraid to go out now and it's just so frightening and she doesn't know when
[19:17.360 --> 19:22.880]  the terrorists are gonna hit even if the terrorism is real and most of it isn't you got a better chance
[19:22.880 --> 19:29.040]  to be struck by lightning twice literally you got but you you've got a many many better times chance
[19:29.040 --> 19:35.600]  of drowning thousands of times better chance of dying in a car wreck or having a tree fall on
[19:36.320 --> 19:42.480]  or dying in an earthquake i mean it's ridiculous you've got the media just squeezing every ounce of
[19:42.480 --> 19:49.040]  fear and hyperventilation out of it they can and just constantly talking about oh thank god the
[19:49.040 --> 19:55.680]  authorities saved us not public servants the authorities the officials what would we do without
[19:55.680 --> 20:03.520]  them what would we do is we're in so much danger are you considering taking herbal supplements

[28:52.000 --> 29:02.240]  our lives so much better well i mean look college is just just it's complete brainwashing it's all
[29:02.240 --> 29:08.080]  financed by the government with our tax money to to to sell everyone on giving up our liberties and
[29:08.080 --> 29:14.320]  freedoms it is it's they they've designed it to where instead of having free thinking americans
[29:14.320 --> 29:21.120]  like myself and you they've designed it to where we all come out of this this educational system as
[29:21.120 --> 29:29.040]  as zombies as their their tools to get their agenda through and without your movies and other
[29:29.040 --> 29:35.840]  people like you getting the message out where we're doomed well it's up to all of us to get the
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.960]  message out and to ring the alarm this tyranny is so egregious so out in the open if we simply show

[33:10.880 --> 33:19.760]  chicago tribute reports state senate approves daily backed gun bill and it's mandatory sentencing
[33:19.760 --> 33:25.280]  and if you're caught with a firearm and don't have the state license because there you have to
[33:25.280 --> 33:29.760]  have a license period and they've created special state police teams you see it in the news all the
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.200]  time where generally it's some old man or old woman a lot of times it's widows because you know
[33:36.240 --> 33:41.840]  women won't own guns but their husband will you know their husband's into guns but they're not
[33:41.840 --> 33:49.280]  their husband dies because he's 85 years old yet i've seen countless numbers of these cases
[33:49.280 --> 33:56.240]  and then a few days after the yearly gun permit runs out a state police swat team hits the house
[33:56.240 --> 34:03.200]  takes all the guns and arrests the old lady but uh the way the law was written previously
[34:03.200 --> 34:06.880]  they could go to court and show that they weren't aware of it and they would just get probation
[34:06.880 --> 34:16.400]  which is bad enough this is mandatory mandatory at least one year in prison and the judge instructs
[34:16.400 --> 34:22.960]  the jury that they have no other choice that you will go to jail mandatory one year you could serve
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.880]  as long as three years if you have a gun and then they just start making it harder and harder to get
[34:28.880 --> 34:33.360]  the license unit it'll just be like chicago or new york city where basically there is no second
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.600]  amendment they want to have that statewide and daily the mob boss the son of one of the most
[34:37.600 --> 34:42.800]  famous mob bosses in u.s history of course once his slaves disarmed uh the criminals of the nation
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.600]  you know all run to new york and chicago because there they can have their way with the public
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.960]  they are having multiple shootings and deaths per day it's almost as violent as south of the
[34:52.960 --> 34:59.040]  border mexico up there it is just crime ridden the police are amongst some of the most corrupt in
[34:59.040 --> 35:06.800]  the nation and that's not debatable that's on record and now statewide they want to go after
[35:06.800 --> 35:15.200]  the gun owners and so the next few days i'm going to get to illinois um state rifle association on
[35:15.200 --> 35:21.680]  the broadcast i was on their website just scrolling through the different bills and it says press
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.040]  release bill that would effectively prohibit african americans and hispanics from buying guns
[35:27.040 --> 35:35.280]  advances in the illinois general assembly and it's hb 6123 and i i'm actually reading the text of
[35:35.280 --> 35:41.760]  the bill and i can't believe this uh it says that the gun shop will be liable if they do not
[35:41.760 --> 35:48.480]  racially profile hispanics and blacks uh and check police databases to see if they're affiliated
[35:48.480 --> 35:56.320]  with a gang i mean this is incredible as if the gang members are walking into stores and buying
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.160]  guns most of them already have felonies you already go through a next system when you go in to buy
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.240]  the gun you're put through a federal database to begin with so they've already got you there
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.520]  you know it was the kook lux clan and the democratic party they passed the first gun laws
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.160]  in the 1870s after the civil war because we're not going to let these black people have guns
[36:18.160 --> 36:22.560]  we're not going to let them protect themselves there were a few cases of where the clan and
[36:22.560 --> 36:27.040]  others were trying to lynch blacks and they would fight back effectively and so they said well
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.000]  well we're just going to pass some gun laws here and that's what they did
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.960]  and here it is hb 6123 promotes racial profiling and it's worse commented isra executive director
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.640]  richard pierce and popular culture has branded urban minorities with a gangster stereotype
[36:46.640 --> 36:51.840]  that is pervasive well beyond the confines of actual criminal enterprises and we've actually
[36:51.840 --> 36:57.520]  played news clips and actually interviewed guests from arkansas uh kansas and other states
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.040]  where they're going into small towns and saying if someone's missing a finger
[37:03.040 --> 37:10.240]  or someone has tattoos black white it doesn't matter uh don't sell them a gun and call homeland
[37:10.240 --> 37:15.760]  security do you know how many people in rural areas are missing fingers they actually work for a
[37:15.760 --> 37:22.640]  living and metal shops or on tractors or i mean i've i've worked on several ranches they're in
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.760]  the summers they would send me down to work on the ranch i was in high school five years one
[37:27.760 --> 37:32.800]  year my dad just pulled me out of school and said you're in too much trouble fighting and you know
[37:34.080 --> 37:38.960]  carousing around with women when i was 16 he said i'm just taking me out of school i'm sending you
[37:38.960 --> 37:46.160]  down here to work and so i've i've seen it i mean i'd i'd have to say one out of 10 cowboys is missing
[37:46.160 --> 37:54.240]  a finger a lot of people are missing arms it said if you have burns on your hands have you ever seen
[37:54.240 --> 38:02.000]  a rancher or a farmer's hands battery acid burns all over them uh cuts all over them i mean i got
[38:02.000 --> 38:10.480]  cuts all over my hands from maybe all total a year and a half of working on a ranch i mean i got cuts
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.520]  i got scars all over my hands and when i worked i had thick quarter inch thick calluses i mean it
[38:17.520 --> 38:22.640]  was like the soles of my feet on my hands and it says in these manuals that we posted up at info
[38:22.640 --> 38:29.280]  wars dot com that if you've got rough looking hands or cuts on your hands or burns on your hands
[38:29.280 --> 38:36.720]  you don't get a gun no judge no jury of course they have the bill introduced by uh chairdoff's
[38:36.720 --> 38:45.120]  minion um the white house chief of staff rome manual you've got congruency there saying that if
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.520]  we think maybe this is a quote if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist that's a quote
[38:49.520 --> 38:56.480]  if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist and you're on a no fly list no judge no jury they
[38:56.480 --> 39:00.880]  won't tell you how you get on it they just throw now it's a million and a half americans on it now

[39:57.520 --> 40:01.120]  and shave your head you know so you might be part of a white supremacist uh
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.400]  gang and how many americans have tattoos now it's got to be half the people i know have got tattoos

[40:24.320 --> 40:32.000]  of bills at the state level all over the country but a gaggle of them in illinois
[40:33.920 --> 40:41.440]  as that mafia system prepares to take over okay let's uh go back to your phone calls here
[40:41.440 --> 40:47.920]  here uh let's talk to mike and indiana you're on the air mike how you doing alex i guess i'm
[40:47.920 --> 40:54.480]  doing okay buddy what's up yeah this seems like a lot of circumstances and uh this seems like a
[40:54.480 --> 41:01.760]  lot of things are going on all at once as far as i know coincidental i mean distractions and
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.040]  i don't know this this car in new york or van or whatever it is smoking and i mean what caused
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.520]  the smoke why is it smoking what is the smoke from i mean you know i see that nem have you
[41:15.520 --> 41:24.480]  been to the website what does it mean dot com before yes okay you're pretty interesting article on
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.480]  there i don't know how valid they are or not but you might want to check into that on the website
[41:30.480 --> 41:39.040]  yeah i'm not gonna say anything okay uh but go ahead there's a there's just a lot of circumstances
[41:39.040 --> 41:45.920]  going on and i just i don't know it drives you crazy i i just i don't know i've probably
[41:45.920 --> 41:49.200]  shouldn't have called but i don't know mike i mean it's good questions you have and i appreciate
[41:49.200 --> 41:55.840]  your call uh look we have operation a jacks we have operation northwoods we have the gulf of
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.840]  tonkin uh we have operation gladio we have the nato option we have the army field manuals
[42:02.560 --> 42:10.560]  it is standard operating procedure for the crux that have taken over our society to stage terror
[42:10.560 --> 42:19.440]  attacks or to find unstable people and to protect them i mean look at the underwear bomber i said
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.800]  for a few weeks i didn't know exactly what was happening but it was very suspicious the way it
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.360]  was being hyped the way they were promoting naked body scanners within minutes of it happening
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.360]  saying they just now ordered them when they'd ordered them a year before and then it came out
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.840]  that thing was completely and totally 100 stage and i looked at this new video of the underwear
[42:35.840 --> 42:42.080]  bombers supposedly in an al-qaeda training camp and anybody looking at it can tell it's a fake video
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.840]  you can see that they just inserted a shot of his face underneath the black hood and you can even
[42:47.840 --> 42:53.040]  see the edges it's not even a good computer morph and they've been caught putting out
[42:53.040 --> 42:57.760]  on record fake bin laden audio tapes and videos i mean that's been confirmed
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.840]  that's how dumb they think we are they announce that they've killed you know certain al-qaeda
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.640]  leaders over and over and over again and never retract the last time that they've killed them
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.640]  but this could be real this could be real the point is they're certainly hyping it
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.200]  and on fox and cnn those are the channels i was able to sample and check on today
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.880]  and it was the same thing this is a new way of life get ready for more attacks we've got
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.920]  to give up our freedoms let's cut to this new yorker i'm just scared to go out my gosh they
[43:29.920 --> 43:34.000]  could hit us anywhere i'm so scared what am i going to do i mean what are you going to do
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.280]  like you get in a car every day number one cause of death those 300 plus thousand people a year
[43:39.280 --> 43:46.080]  you get on trains that kill hundreds and hundreds of people a year
[43:47.920 --> 43:51.920]  you get on elevators that fail every year and kill people you swim and swim and pools you get
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.640]  in a shower that kills tens of thousands of years slip and fall and bash your brains out
[43:56.640 --> 44:02.320]  you walk downstairs that kill thousands a year you take a government you know pushed
[44:02.320 --> 44:08.880]  uh big pharma drugs that the side effects are worse than what they supposedly treat
[44:10.080 --> 44:12.960]  you eat aspartame that fries your brain you drink uh
[44:16.160 --> 44:22.960]  and eat msg you're eating gmo food that's sterilizing you and causing cancer on record
[44:22.960 --> 44:28.080]  but see the government doesn't tell you to hyperventilate and just relish getting all upset
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.920]  it's like a big coward fest a big niny fest that's how they've converted us from the strongest
[44:33.920 --> 44:42.640]  smartest hardest working uh people that weren't scared of anything to just a nation of potbellied
[44:43.600 --> 44:50.240]  couch potatoes who who shake at their own shadow i can't tell you how many congressmen
[44:50.240 --> 44:54.240]  and state reps and business people go well we know what you're saying is true alex but aren't
[44:54.240 --> 45:00.160]  you scared the government will get you or some say all this stuff's all made up but you better
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.920]  watch it the government's going to get you you know they're living in fear stop living in fear
[45:07.600 --> 45:13.520]  stop living in fear i mean if the muslims really are all a bunch of terrorists and want to get us
[45:13.520 --> 45:19.040]  and want to kill us have a moratorium on immigration for muslim nations but they're not going to do that
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.680]  they're going to bring even more muslims in and then they're going to allow them to be radicalized
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.120]  in the prisons they're going to go in and provocateur them they're going to play a saw
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.600]  off against each other that's how the new order rolls that's how they operate in fact
[45:31.600 --> 45:39.680]  after micro vero leaves us in the next hour i want to play a video clip from a few years ago
[45:39.680 --> 45:51.920]  and again i could play hundreds of clips of the mayor of la and of hispanic
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.320]  members of the congress and state reps that that if you if you put a coat of white paint on them
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.600]  it sounds worse than the kukluks clan in arian nations but see that's how this is supposed
[46:05.600 --> 46:11.600]  to work it's okay if i'm against the kukluks clan in arian nations most of them are feds but when i
[46:11.600 --> 46:19.760]  come out and say look i mean tens of millions of people in latin america have been talked to hate
[46:19.760 --> 46:24.000]  the united states not the majority but a large portion actually i found some zogby polls where it
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.120]  is the majority and a large portion of people from mexico have been taught to hate this country
[46:29.120 --> 46:34.240]  they're righteous in it the media never criticizes them never tells them it's wrong so that this
[46:34.240 --> 46:39.920]  can fester and grow and it's the same thing with these black leaders who are funded by the
[46:39.920 --> 46:43.920]  ford foundation and in the university saying all whites must be killed
[46:46.720 --> 46:53.360]  i mean i after i learned about the plan of san diego six seven years ago the plan by mexico to
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.760]  kill all whites in the u.s above the age of 14 i was wrong last week when i said 16
[46:58.880 --> 47:03.440]  then i found a ut professor in dalis who said the plan of san diego and everybody starts
[47:03.440 --> 47:08.080]  laughing in the audience of chicano studies and he says you know what that means don't you
[47:08.800 --> 47:13.920]  ha ha ha and i mean you've got the average white person is just wandering around trying
[47:13.920 --> 47:18.640]  to make a living and has been taught all this guilt and feels bad about themselves i mean i'm a white
[47:18.640 --> 47:30.080]  guy i know okay and again it's it's meant to neutralize a political block of people to never
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.960]  stand up against government takeovers of the second amendment of sovereignty of any issue
[47:38.640 --> 47:43.680]  because you will be demonized if you do and they'll use these labels we have to stop caring
[47:43.680 --> 47:49.600]  about the labels and so i'm going to talk about this coming up in the third hour today and explain
[47:49.600 --> 47:55.440]  what racism really is it's tribalism we've all got it in us ladies and gentlemen and the only
[47:55.440 --> 48:03.360]  thing that will save this country is converting those tribal instincts and energies into the
[48:03.360 --> 48:08.160]  constitution and bill of rights and liberty and freedom and a freedom culture and then we can all
[48:08.160 --> 48:15.920]  be part of the same tribe who is into freedom and health and education and and and and truly
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.520]  being healthy and truly seeing ourselves as a human race reaching out towards the stars
[48:21.520 --> 48:27.200]  but the globalists don't want that so so so the controllers of society the social engineers
[48:28.320 --> 48:34.240]  they invoke racial and religious division and then they play the part as the arbiter or the
[48:34.240 --> 48:42.640]  referee or the savior against the system that they have conjured using our natural instincts
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.280]  that's what's going on that's what's happening let's go to john in texas go ahead you're on the
[48:49.280 --> 48:54.880]  air elixir hey buddy you know that bomb in new york if those were the real terrorists you think
[48:54.880 --> 48:59.040]  they could have put together a more credible bomb than uh that chunk they thrown in the back of that
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.360]  truck i mean you can go to the internet there's all kinds of information on explosives you can go
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.320]  to youtube and watch junior high school kids blowing up junk cars with pipe bombs you think
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.320]  you think if they were real terrorists especially pakistan terrorist they would have the knowledge
[49:12.320 --> 49:17.120]  to put together something well there's also think of how many busts there been the last 10 years
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.480]  of junior high and high school kids blowing up a trash can in their backyard how many of the cops
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.920]  busting those kids did the same thing a few years before i mean how many of you went and
[49:27.920 --> 49:33.680]  sawed off the backs of daddy shotgun shells and put them in a can and ran a black powder fuse in
[49:33.680 --> 49:38.880]  there i mean how many people would now be charged as a terrorist just because you're screwing around
[49:38.880 --> 49:45.760]  on the back 40 well i was saying all that that uh that wasn't no that wasn't uh that there was another
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.920]  reason for doing that because uh that wasn't a bomb that was just a big mess well i agree with you
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.560]  but but that could mean it was a staged event or it could mean the person was acting alone and
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.560]  pakistan just claimed they've arrested eight people they've done that in the past and it turns
[50:00.560 --> 50:06.160]  out it's not true to just act like you know they're fighting you know lcaa to ride along with us
[50:07.520 --> 50:11.040]  because of pakistan doesn't do what they're told you saw what happened to
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.720]  the budo uh when the cia gunner down and then said she died by hitting her head on the car
[50:16.720 --> 50:20.720]  and there's video over being machine gun and they said she hit her head but look what do you think
[50:20.720 --> 50:25.920]  about bloomberg coming out and saying it's basically anti-healthcare people that did it
[50:26.640 --> 50:31.200]  well they're gonna demonize they want to demonize the tea party or anybody it's against their agenda
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.280]  that's probably reason that that they stage that to begin with because they want to demonize
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.800]  the their opposition that's you know an old communist trick basically you know well i agree
[50:40.800 --> 50:45.600]  with you and the bankers run the communist system that solidate our wealth anything else john
[50:46.240 --> 50:52.880]  no i thought it alex appreciate the call good points tim hulio steve tim and others your calls

[54:07.280 --> 54:27.280]  okay i always reserve judgment in terror attacks
[54:27.280 --> 54:38.480]  aborted terror attacks but now a very clear picture is starting to come out turns out cbs tv and it
[54:38.480 --> 54:45.200]  turns out somebody was smart and recorded it interviewed a sheriff that day on the ground
[54:45.200 --> 54:53.040]  and they said they were running a drill in time square on mayday of a truck bomb we'll get this
[54:53.040 --> 54:59.600]  video up on prisonplanet.com in the next few minutes and up on info wars.com in the next
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.200]  few minutes and i will play this video coming up in the next hour when mike revero joins us
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.560]  now we know they were running a drill uh with the underwear bombing we know the government
[55:13.120 --> 55:18.640]  got him on the plane without a passport or visa no they the u.s. government got him the visa
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.400]  under orders that's the undersecretary of the state department mr kennedy on record
[55:26.320 --> 55:31.360]  and so it's the same story over and over again what are the mathematical chances
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.920]  that on 9-11 they were running tripod to drill of the exact same buildings being attacked at the
[55:35.920 --> 55:41.440]  exact same time and the cia was running a drill and the pentagon was running a drill and norab
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.560]  was running a drill of the same targets being hit the exact same time in separate exercises so all
[55:46.560 --> 55:50.720]  of their agencies were confused because 99 percent of the people involved in these agencies are not
[55:50.720 --> 55:57.520]  involved in the entire attack this is so if any of their agency people catch uh their
[55:59.280 --> 56:05.040]  cohorts in running the operation the guy sitting right next to him in a terminal running the op
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.560]  i could say oh this i'm just part of the drill too what is the chance that happened with oklahoma
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.320]  city with drills and the head of fbi counterterrorism there for the week before the attack then lying
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.040]  and saying he wasn't and it came out in federal documents he was what are the chances of the
[56:21.040 --> 56:26.400]  exact same trains an exact same bus being attacked at the exact same time and location
[56:27.200 --> 56:35.600]  in a drill being run by scotland yard on 7 7 in 2005 that is on record we have the head of
[56:35.600 --> 56:41.680]  visor consultancy admitting it on the news it was also formerly the head of pr for scotland yard
[56:41.680 --> 56:48.480]  peter powers what are the chances of the government running drills in and around the 1993 attack
[56:49.840 --> 56:56.320]  they run drills every single time that shadow and mirror the real attack
[56:58.720 --> 57:09.200]  and so this went from being 50 50 that it was in one column muslims and or communist mayday people
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.760]  because it happened on mayday i said 50 chance in that column that's one of those groups and
[57:13.760 --> 57:22.240]  is real and 50 chance historically that it's a government on well it just went to 90 percent
[57:22.240 --> 57:29.520]  oh i forgot as well joe stack we had callers that day when he supposedly flew his plane in the
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.360]  building saying that they looked into the plane and didn't see anyone in it then it came out on
[57:35.360 --> 57:39.440]  the news multiple witnesses said yet flew over no one was in the plane you can look right in
[57:40.160 --> 57:44.400]  and then we got callers saying we're running a drill the fire department was all there and the
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.960]  fbi was already in the parking lot and then it turned out that that was true on the local news
[57:50.400 --> 57:56.240]  oh the biggest county city drill ever they just so happened to be in the parking lot next door
[57:56.240 --> 58:02.240]  oh they're just so happened to be an attack drill and then of course we got an fbi source
[58:02.240 --> 58:07.520]  that told us out of the dallas office i'll just leave it that that they were dispatched and told
[58:07.520 --> 58:15.200]  it was going to be an attack the night before and then it turns out joe stack is landing in
[58:15.200 --> 58:21.040]  highly secure military bases he's doing military contract work his family says he didn't do it
[58:21.040 --> 58:25.760]  and it was made up he didn't write the letter and then he has a small hangar with five other planes
[58:25.760 --> 58:33.600]  with the top homeland security expert in remote control aircraft hmm hmm and they were running
[58:33.600 --> 58:38.800]  a drill at the echelon building and they were running one in time square saturday

[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.080]  excellent news website what really happened dot com again if you're just joining us i'm alex
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:30.080]  jones with prison planet dot tv and info wars dot com there has been an arrest that has been made
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:39.840]  of a faisal shazad who reportedly is a naturalized citizen who had traveled back to pakistan
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.560]  and they're saying that he may be behind he's he's the main suspect in the failed mayday
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:56.640]  uh truck bomb in time square in new york city now the issue here is we have seen the federal
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.240]  government stage other events in the past events where the government completely stages the attack
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.600]  or provocateurs groups and allows them to attack like the u.s. government on record saying they
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.000]  helped the underwear bomber get on the plane and ordered the state department not to block him
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.920]  from getting on the plane and we know that a security personnel helped him get on the plane
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.280]  witnesses told us this the fbi denied it and then later they had to confirm that it was true
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:31.440]  that's just another example of the history of this we know on seven seven there was a drill
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.640]  being run in london of the exact same trains and exact same bus being bombed the exact same time
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.880]  we know there were drills in oklahoma city drills on 9 11 we know that there have been
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.960]  drills in and around staged events in almost every case witnesses reported this and the police
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.520]  later admitted it the fire department that in austin they had their biggest countywide drill ever
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.520]  in the parking lot next door to the echelon building that supposedly joe stacked flew his
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.800]  plane into multiple witnesses said there was no one in the plane multiple witnesses said the fbi
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.360]  was already out there on the street and that was later confirmed and so there was a drill going on
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:20.720]  that day of some type we need to investigate this development with cbs news uh and this
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.200]  sheriff's deputy who was there part of some type of training let's watch this clip and then go to
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:33.680]  mike revero and get his take on it here it is can you sure if mike scott was in time square the night
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.640]  of the attempted attack he talked to wait news today about what happened somebody asked me why
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.160]  didn't start taking pictures of the car i was not in tourist mode at that time i was i was in cop mode
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.760]  and you know you just sort of spent the um spent the danger scott says he had just been with the
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.720]  new york city bomb squad for training earlier in the day but had no idea they'd be called to work
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:03.440]  this case just ours and i guess the clip cuts out early there we need to find that full clip
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.440]  i know we were sent that clip by a listener but we need to try to find the full clip uh so the way
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:16.560]  that appears is that he was there for training with the bomb squad i mean he said i was there
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:23.040]  for training with the bomb squad just a few hours before and that he was in cop mode as part of that
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.800]  training in time square and then you have the almost instant response of the bomb squad and
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.960]  that's not saying the bomb squad was in on this government intelligence agencies will have other
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:43.680]  agencies involved in drills so that when the nsa picks up chatter about an attack uh it's missed
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:51.200]  because this this this this fog of the drill this confusion has been injected and we know
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.880]  this is the case on 9 11 7 7 and so many other cases separately and we'll play this clip again
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.240]  coming up in a few minutes uh we have mayor bloomberg yesterday on the nightly news on cbs news
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.680]  nationally saying that it well if he had to bet he would guess it was some anti-government health care
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.040]  individual that had done this and we have a whole bunch of left-wing blogs trying to
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.800]  to blame uh the american people and curtain demo wrote an article about that so we know
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.520]  that any time there's an event or a failed event the first group are going to try to blame
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.920]  is the american people and we have the director of the fbi on record saying the number one focus
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.600]  is now the american people not even al ciaida so they set up this whole police state the name
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.040]  of fighting al qaeda and then they're now swinging it around to use it on the american people let's
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.400]  go to mike revero and get his take on this situation mike thanks for joining us thank you for having
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:54.080]  me uh give us your take on uh the whole situation unfolding well you know you you pointed out a
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.960]  very cogent observation there with michael bloomberg's comments here because uh looking at what i like
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:05.760]  to call the sideshow that is going on surrounding this event uh everybody uh in politics and the
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:12.960]  media seems to be viewing every news event no matter what it is not as another uh situation of
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.600]  finding out what the facts and truth are but is merely another opportunity to propagandize whatever
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.200]  their agenda happens to be when this fizzle bombing first came out we had site intelligence group
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.880]  saying they had a video from from al qaeda claiming responsibility then it was being blamed on
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:35.520]  muslim anger against south park for uh for one of their programs uh because this bomb was supposedly
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.000]  near the offices of viacom then you have bloomberg saying uh it was probably somebody that was
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.560]  opposed to health care other groups are saying it was probably the tea party activists on and on
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.200]  and on you see everybody trying to grab onto this news event and spin it to support whatever their
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.760]  particular agenda happens to be now we're hearing basically that this uh perpetrator they've arrested
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.400]  for it apparently lost his home to foreclosure uh about a month ago and was basically you know
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.040]  it would make sense he was selling his van and going back home to uh you know basically try
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.400]  and get his life back together so it's kind of interesting we you know we saw this videotape
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:17.120]  of the guy taking off his sweater and and he was the white guy that was supposed to be the suspect
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:24.000]  and it just seems like we have had this continuous parade of possible suspicions and i'm not
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.520]  i'm not sure where the truth lies right now because the waters are so muddied but it's just
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.160]  an interesting study in propaganda to see how this incident has been exploited by so many
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.360]  different people to push so many different agendas well exactly and it's it's like a catch
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:49.120]  all uh just you know this vague nebulous event and now no one knows who's behind it so we'll
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.320]  just blame everyone but the good guys are the authorities they're the officials you just
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:02.560]  heard that uh video clip mic what do you make of the sheriff's uh deputy uh being interviewed by
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:10.560]  the news and saying yeah we were there working with the bomb squad at time square a few hours before
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.920]  so i was there in cop mode i don't think you can take anything away from that but that they were
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:23.360]  doing a drill we're putting calls in right now uh to new york to the county uh two different
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:31.440]  agencies and and that should be public information were they running a drill uh in time square
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:38.160]  proceeding this well i'm i want to be very very careful about this because listening to the clip
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:45.280]  just then it sounded like he was in new york to work with the bomb squad i didn't get that he said
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.960]  the the the the training with the bomb squad was in time square it may have been or not
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.840]  it seems a little vague to me and i'd like to nail that down before we start uh you know
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.160]  basing conclusions on it um but i think if he's in cop mode and he's suspicious that's all the
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:08.080]  more reason to be taking pictures so that comment about i'm not taking pictures because i'm a cop
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.720]  and i'm suspicious of the guy seems strange i mean everybody's cell phone's got a camera
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.600]  and uh you know it that that struck me as kind of an odd statement yeah no i think it's it's
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.200]  nebulous um we need to get to the bottom of it um i had the guys rush in right at the end of the
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.440]  last hour and said we've got a cbs clip they were having a drill and then once i watched the clip i
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:36.560]  realized that it was uh a bit uh a bit nebulous but we need to investigate this because if there
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.400]  was a drill i mean it's not like we're trying to blame the government out of the blue here i mean
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.720]  they admittedly cooked the bomb trained the driver in 93 there well we know they're covering up in
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.560]  new york what happened on 9 11 we know they covered up the fact that they blew up building 7
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.400]  and now they're admitting well we weren't looking at blowing it up but we didn't because it just fell
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:58.240]  on its own for us at freefall speeds microvaro stay there uh let's continue on a host of issues

[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:24.480]  join us is 1-800-259-9231 micro vero is our guest next hour i'm going to personally spend quite a
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.400]  bit of time on the holy legal alien situation i believe we're a nation of immigrants i believe
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.680]  we need more immigrants to the country legally but when the government brings in these groups
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:41.440]  and then uses it to divide and conquer and gives them all this welfare and then makes them dependents
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.000]  of the state i mean i've looked at the voting numbers i mean you know the many of the immigrant
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.720]  populations uh almost 90 10 to vote for bigger government gun control and so the government
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.520]  is basically using them as a political weapon now i look at the arizona law it's questionable
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.040]  whether it's constitutional but then what does arizona do when they're beginning to collapse
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:09.600]  in southern arizona just like mexico is mexico is a failed state because of their phony drug war
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:15.680]  20 plus thousand deaths the last two years alone they're in a serious crises micro vero where do
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:22.240]  you see this going well i agree that uh again various politicians and political groups are
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.960]  trying to exploit the situation for their own immediate political gain one of the issues that
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.000]  i have about this sudden flare-up of the arizona law and the reaction to it i mean the arizona
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.640]  law really is just a state implementation of existing federal law and a promise of more
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.520]  rigid enforcement which the federal government has been sort of lacks in doing uh but i think
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.000]  one of the reasons they're trying to fan this up as an issue is as we head into this election season
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.680]  this is the issue we're going to see more and more politicians campaigning on uh rather than
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.360]  to allow any discussions about the economy or the wars in iraq and afghanistan and wherever else
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:03.680]  uh to come to the fore and we've seen this in years past as an ongoing pattern where the the
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.960]  politicians will decide we're going to run the campaigns on this issue over here because nobody
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.480]  dares talk about these really important things that are affecting everybody's lives over here
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.920]  and so i think one of the reasons we're seeing such a furor whip up about this thing uh is again
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:26.880]  so to take the heat off of the economy and the wars now one thing i did know is that over this last
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.240]  weekend when we had these pro illegal immigration rallies uh we've seen videotapes of the rioting
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.040]  that took place in arizona uh when the law was passed over this last weekend there was vandalism
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.080]  of damage up in santa cruz to for which the corporate media has basically turned a blind
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:48.160]  eye if it had been the tea party in santa cruz breaking windows and uh damaging retail
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:53.200]  uh establishments i think it would have been headline news across the country uh i mean let's
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:27:00.080]  face it the the the immigration riots in santa cruz did more real physical damage than this bomb
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.960]  in times square and yet the bomb in times squares getting the headline news that's right i mean to
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.200]  be specific they had burning torches and set fire to a restaurant with people in it who
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.200]  had to escape i mean that is an act of attempted murder and then the local abc news channel
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.480]  interviewed two people who agreed with the rioters and said they have a reason to be upset
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.600]  and so these illegal alien groups and their supporters feel like they're righteous and so not
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.600]  only is the national media blacking this out local media is egging it on like this was george
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:40.880]  washington and the tea party meanwhile they're claiming that oathkeepers myself ron paul many
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.760]  others yourself and some of the documents are basically terrorist enablers and that we want
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:52.400]  all this violence when we're doing the opposite they've tried to keep hispanics blacks and asians
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.720]  from joining the tea parties by saying it's racial in the last year and a half when it
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:02.960]  never had anything to do with that so we see this divide and conquer taking shape well my main
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.760]  concern of course is that following the riots that took place in the arizona and we started
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:13.520]  seeing obama talking about coming in and intervening and interfering with the arizona law my concern is
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.960]  that if there is any interference in the arizona law after the rioting took place the message that
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.520]  will be received is that rioting works and people all across the country are going to be looking at
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.320]  what happened with oh they riot in arizona they get the immigration bill overturned by the federal
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.200]  government they're gonna say well let's riot for what we want taxes too high let's have a riot uh
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.880]  don't like the wars let's riot let me stop you absolutely key what did obama do when he was a
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.200]  u.s senator with odinga we have the emails their public he told his cousin burn buildings attack
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.520]  the muslim minority did not win the election so they created a prime minister ship along with the
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:57.520]  president for odinga so he would stop burning down churches and so exactly the media is saying
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.480]  you burn things down as our political army and we'll protect you and not talk about it
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.880]  but then we'll blame the tea parties and claim their burning things down what never happened
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:12.720]  yeah it is it's manufactured terror and it's going to be put onto a scapegoat it's it's
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.840]  nazi tactics all over again and they're turning it basically against those of us who want to
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:24.240]  restore the republic well we're going to go bankrupt if we don't stem the tide uh of of
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.800]  illegal immigration i mean that's why roam fell and it'd be one thing if there wasn't welfare
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.360]  for these people and if we you know taught them about the bill of rights the constitution they
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.480]  joined the freedom tribe because we're all tribal so we better have a tribe of freedom and liberty
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.680]  and get past skin color but if we don't do that then we've got to kick these people out we've
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.920]  got to shut the borders down because the globalists are using them as a political weapon great points
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.720]  mike stay there we're gonna come back talk about this and other subjects we're on the march the

[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  to go to calls mike but i wanted and i haven't even asked you but i want to see what you think
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.720]  is important any other political issues any other items things that the media isn't focusing on
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:07.040]  things you think we should be focusing on things that you're concerned about well my major concern
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.640]  on a global scale as we watch the situation unfold in greece is that so far everybody's
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.240]  solution to every problem in government is to basically take more money away from the people
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.720]  and to simply move it around and because of the very nature of the reserve banking system
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.560]  the problem is that people are running out of money to tax in fact it was an article we ran
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.040]  this morning over at what really happened dot com where california is bemoaning the fact that
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:38.640]  because their state tax revenues have fallen despite numerous tax increases in fact right
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:43.760]  now california is considered the most business unfriendly state in the entire country but because
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.880]  tax revenues continue to fall they don't see a recovery going on and what we're seeing is this
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:55.120]  kind of of willful government blindness where they still see the the american people as this vast
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.160]  pool of untapped capital that they could just go out and grab some more when they need it
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.200]  and unfortunately the money has become so concentrated in just a few pockets there isn't
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.360]  enough money out here for commerce to be taking place i'm seeing whole segments of the economy
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:15.120]  begin to shut down because everybody is holding you know invoices for everybody else we're owed
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.360]  money by people they can't pay us because the people owe them can't pay them because the people
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.880]  who owe them can't pay them and for an economic system to be a system money has to be flowing at all
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:30.720]  levels and we've lost that and our government doesn't seem to see it and even worse and this
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.200]  is another article we linked to from what really happened dot com it's coming out now that even
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.360]  as our congress was badmouthing derivatives and short selling they were personally invested in
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.560]  them and for those who like me were wondering why we didn't seem to see the government do anything to
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.760]  try and improve the economy as a whole we're now learning this is coming from business insider
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:57.360]  that our congress were right there with goldman sacks putting money in their pocket as america
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.000]  collapsed and this is probably why they were laughing so outrageously when they they pushed
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.280]  tarp through congress isn't a solution they're part of the problem they're profiting from the
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:13.120]  destruction of the american dream right now and they know what they're doing i mean the biggest
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.720]  funders on record of the fake environmental movement there are real environmental issues folks get
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:24.960]  that straight but but what controls and dominates the modern environmentalist movement is a system
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.480]  of taking private property shutting down industry because you have the banking cartel waging war
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:37.680]  against the real economy against the individual generation of private wealth and so they want
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.480]  a financial vat they want an overall economy wide vat on top of income taxes multiple states every
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:52.000]  month are passing laws to jack up taxes on food for everyone they are ordering police to write
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.320]  more tickets while they lay off police to actually respond to crime they're ordering police to only
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.080]  go out and generate revenue so it's shifting to a pure parasite economy and the more they wreck the
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.440]  economy the more people go on welfare the more people are dependent and so this is really a form
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:16.000]  of slavery that is taking place uh and i guess the only silver lining here is the elites for the
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.680]  last three years have been moving out of western europe and the united states uh and and and buying
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.800]  armored redoubts and private security forces so that shows me they're planning to fully implode it
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.160]  and leave that's a little better i guess than fully imploding and then sitting on top of us
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:38.000]  so it looks like it's it's it's there's some method of the madness but it's more just a pel mel
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:44.800]  final looting and and and robbery that's going on well basically the problem is that we're dealing
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.440]  with a segment of our society who are addicted to money they've already got more money than
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.080]  anyone human could ever possibly need for an entire lifetime but it's never enough and if you really
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.880]  look at their behavior from the point of view of addiction where you know they got to have more than
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.240]  the guy next to them they got to have more than uh than they had last year i mean i i tell this joke
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.320]  about you know they're piling up all these these uh these notes in their living room and they take
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.760]  off their clothes and roll around on the money and and have a really good time and everything
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.280]  but the reality is it is addictive behavior and you know this is why they're we're almost in need
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.960]  of an intervention here because like any other addict they're perfectly blind to the damage
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:30.080]  they caused to everybody around them in their quest for the next fix and so as a result i think
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.880]  what's going on here we're seeing this accumulation of complete greed and it's part of a larger
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:40.720]  evolution when this country was started the the founders went out of their way to avoid private
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.560]  central banks as any at all involved with the currency of the people we've had three private
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.760]  central banks even so when i was a kid i remember it was still possible to go through your life
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.160]  without involving the bank except for a mortgage in her car loan now we've reached the point where
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.520]  the banks are trying to move so that everything you do in life has to go through them they want
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.320]  a cashless society they want everything on the plastic so everything that you do they get a few
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.360]  pennies they get a piece of the action like the mafia and it and it's just this desire
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:16.640]  to absolutely have all of life go through the clutches of the banking system and you're right
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.160]  it is a form of slavery and i think the i think people are getting very angry about it which is
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.440]  you know we're starting to see the uh uh the expressions of outrage and rage against the
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:34.480]  banks now but the government is saying in all these manuals if you criticize the banks you're a
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:40.560]  violent terrorist if you criticize the bailouts they are directly training the police and military
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.960]  you work for wall street you work for the banks and i and i remember uh a professor uh one of the
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.400]  heads of the army war college uh what was it on c span about seven years ago he gave a speech and
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.000]  said we're setting up a new world order the pentagon works for wall street we don't work for
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.400]  the american people so at the highest levels of the pentagon this is a guy addressing generals
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:09.360]  they are just admitting the reality of what they've done and it's a big sick joke to them
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:17.360]  and we're going to get uh rob rash uh ceo and chief engineer of the levy district made his
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.480]  accudations saturday during a candidate forum and he said that uh he told candidates that fema
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:28.080]  officials told him the agency owes 20 billion to the u.s treasury and the only way they can get it
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:33.280]  is through flood insurance premiums and i'm getting calls about this in austin and all over the
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.880]  country people with hilltop houses are being told they've got to buy flood insurance and fema's
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.120]  and fema's ordering them to do it just like we're being ordered to buy overpriced insurance from
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:50.240]  the insurance companies who wrote the uh health care bill i mean it it this is a mafia situation
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:55.680]  where private interests come in lobby the government to make you buy their product and
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:01.360]  then they're bringing in hordes of illegal aliens to menace the public into going along with this
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.880]  i mean this this is a horrible recipe it really really is and what is really sickening about
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.960]  this whole thing is when you understand that because the federal reserve is at the top of
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.840]  this whole corrupt pyramid they're doing it all with counterfeit money it's not like they're
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.200]  putting anything of real value into the pockets of the politicians they simply print up whatever
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:27.440]  they need it's a counterfeiting system and they've used it to subvert the entire u.s government to
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:32.560]  their own personal corporate interests everybody's trained to worship those little green paper notes
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.920]  but that's all they are pretty printed pieces of paper they don't represent real value Bernanke
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:44.080]  is just printing them up as he needs a false economy admits they are waging war against the real
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.880]  economy and consolidating it's about power and criminal consolidation and again here is bloomberg
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:57.600]  yesterday saying that it's probably somebody who's against the health care bill a nut so so you're a
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.760]  nut now 80 of the american people in major polls you are a car bomber basically is what he's saying
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.840]  here it is law enforcement officials don't know who left the Nissan Pathfinder behind but at this
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:17.760]  point the mayor believes the suspect acted alone if i had to guess 25 cents this would be exactly that
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.600]  somebody who's homegrown maybe a mentally deranged person or somebody with a political
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  agenda that doesn't like the health care bill or something it could be anything it could be anything
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.400]  now let's go to another clip from a bugs life that i played yesterday when i play this again
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:40.400]  because this is all about intimidation this is why the banks want to wreck the economy
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:47.120]  this is why in their own memos they engineered it to cause the implosion because then they're the
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.000]  only ones flush with bailout money they shut off all the loans the states the counties the cities
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.400]  the individuals all go bankrupt and the grasshoppers are in command here it is
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:03.360]  there was that ant that stood up to me yeah but we can forget about him yeah it was just one
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:18.080]  right it's just one ant yeah boys they're puny puny say let's pretend this grain is a puny little
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:27.520]  ant didn't that hurt nope well how about this one are you kidding how about this
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.120]  but he dumps a whole load out of him
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:48.400]  you let one ant stand up to us then they all might stand up those puny little ants out
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:54.640]  number us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:03.680]  it's not about food it's about keeping those ants in line that's why we're going back does
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:15.280]  anybody else want to stay okay so let's be clear what what mike brought up earlier illegal aliens
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:22.000]  attack police set buildings on fire with people in them run around with torches like frankenstein
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.480]  or something coming up to the castle and the media says on abc these are good people they
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.520]  interview people who agreed with them and said they have a right to do it now imagine if the tea
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.480]  party did that so what do you need to know about the illegal aliens folks the media and the globalist
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.480]  are for them that's all i need to know and meanwhile they're saying anyone who's against the banks
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:50.240]  oh you're just a right-wing tea party person to keep hispanics and blacks and asians from feeling
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.760]  like they can be with the rest of the american people against the illegitimate banking cartel
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.600]  that's taken over and you have the media demonizing anyone who doesn't want health care as a racist
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:09.200]  to invoke racial division when we should all be together against globalist policies period they
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.760]  know what they are doing and the problem is the illegal aliens could be a great ally for freedom
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.880]  and many of them are hardworking good people but a large portion have been taught via the federal
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.880]  government and ford foundation that's where it started the u.s government funded this in mexico
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.640]  50 years ago and the u.s that the u.s belongs to mexico the southwest does and that americans are
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.760]  evil i saw a zogby poll where 70 plus percent of the immigrants from mexico hate america but 80
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:44.080]  plus percent of americans like mexico see this is the brainwashing so mexico can be used as a weapon
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:50.400]  not to give the mexicans freedom but to turn us into a corrupt plutocracy like that micro vero
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.400]  well you know it's rather interesting it's your classic divide and conquer tactic we've seen it
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:02.720]  so many years before uh you know there's always a divide being imposed on our society black against
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.360]  white rich against poor young against old men against women i remember during the 1990s this
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:13.360]  very obvious fanning of hatred between the genders and uh to me that was kind of the warning sign
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.000]  that our government was getting ready to launch a major campaign of wars because men were being
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.320]  recast as disposable in our society all the focus was put on on women in business and women as heads
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:29.360]  of household and women as the as the providers and caregivers for the family and men were being
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.000]  treated as disposable and it was pretty obvious to me that the agenda then was somebody is getting
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.560]  ready to put a bunch of rifles in the hands of men and ship them off and not have the american
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.360]  uh uh people remaining behind the women and the children care that much about it because they're
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:49.600]  just icky poo men that's right they were neutralizing women's natural love and defense of their men
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:56.480]  when when families are the species men and women a man isn't the human race a woman is the human
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:04.320]  race we are the fusion of humanity and they know that so they drive that wedge in there well it's
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.960]  been declassified admitted that miss magazine was funded by the cia to get women into the workforce
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:16.880]  so that the government could have the kids and work people to death again it's all so cold blooded
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.800]  they've destroyed the natural human order well you know if you go back and you look at world war
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.360]  two and there was that whole rosy the river campaign and you know get the women into the factory
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.440]  so the men could go to the front lines and then once the war was over we saw all these tv shows
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.640]  like father knows best that and and and betty crocker that just extolled the virtues of the
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.960]  woman going back into the home and being the the housewife and the mother to get her out of the
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.360]  factory so that the returning soldiers could have jobs again and it was all this very cynical
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.720]  manipulation of the general population and i'd like to hope that americans are now sophisticated
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.960]  enough to recognize when it's being done again exactly then the bankers said look we can have
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:02.560]  double the tax money and have their kids now get them in the factories hi this is alex jones did
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.960]  you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near

[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:54.320]  her on the air hi mike alex yes sir events over this pack weekend were the perfect illustration
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:01.280]  of your new phrase propaganda placement you know i worked in tv news over 12 years and november
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:07.760]  july february and may are sweeps months for ratings used to set the advertising prices
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.000]  so i was always extremely suspicious a story that breaks at the beginning of a sweeps month
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.600]  because all sunday long the news channels were just beaten the drum about terror attacks
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:27.520]  and then on sunday night simpsons was about the city finding plutonium and suspending civil liberties
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:34.080]  putting cameras up everywhere i have a really cryptic clip and i have a six minute promo video
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:40.080]  put out by news corps bragging that they are placing propaganda in the simpsons and the federal
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:47.360]  government is paying now openly they were always doing it but now openly to brainwash go ahead i
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.360]  got a little clip ready for it's about 60 seconds from the show you want to hear it go ahead here it
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.960]  comes this just in the suspicious bag detonated at springfield union station today contained
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:05.760]  deadly plutonium which can only mean one thing a terrorist plot i admit it everything i've said
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:12.160]  about terrorism till now was fear mongering but today i monger the truth to protect our city
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:19.040]  from all future bombings dirty clean dive or carpet we have hired an outside consultant from
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:26.480]  london england london is now ringed by the most comprehensive array of surveillance cameras mankind
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:32.960]  has ever seen excuse me is this what the framers of the constitution would want well i'm walley of
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:39.040]  walley's framers and this is exactly what i want how many personal freedoms are we willing to give
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:47.200]  up in the name of security that blonde girl thinks she's smart now all in favor of these cameras say
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.640]  cheese cheese those opposed say i hate america
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.440]  ocean carries is that cryptic enough for you well and it's sold like their ford liberties but what
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:10.000]  it does is condition micro vero yeah it is uh actually i think it was uh quite an interesting
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.200]  commentary on there i'm not sure it's entirely uh in support of surveillance cameras there with
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.160]  the humor involved in everything but i think it it does illustrate the kind of processes that are
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.840]  going along with trying to scare people into a certain point of view and especially that last
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.160]  part we're seeing that already anybody who doesn't go along with the government hates america or their
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:35.520]  racists or or the rest of it i think i'm safe in saying that every one of us out here in the
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.880]  alternative media you me all these other people who are trying to basically say we need to get back
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:46.800]  to the constitution we love america or we love america as it's supposed to be and we recognize
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:54.000]  that we've got this this oligarchical fascistic economic uh uh cancer at the heart of america
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.960]  that is taking us down a path we don't want to go down towards what inevitably is going to be
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.040]  collapsed or a new world war and i don't think i want to see either one of them in well i read
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.760]  the synopsis of the show i didn't have time to watch it jason bermus did watch it and he said they
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:14.240]  basically frame homer uh in it and that and that mr burns was involved in it and so that's why i'm
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.880]  saying it was conditioning so they're even throwing it in our face that they're basically framing people
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.720]  but if somebody else saw the show you can correct me on it unfortunately i don't have time to watch
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:29.840]  the simpsons uh tim great call appreciate uh the info we'll be back with julio tim shannon

[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:16.720]  media and uh you know just got done seeing eric holder and uh big sis uh miss napolitano on tv
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.760]  talking about uh how this was a huge terrorist attack it was a deadly bomb but hearing you
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.240]  the other day and hearing you know some people on the news this was that was like a phony bomb it
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:31.680]  was it was kind of uh you know a pretty bad job they're now calling for registering buying gasoline
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.760]  and propane uh because everybody could be a terrorist i mean you know if you use a baseball
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:41.040]  bat you're a terrorist and and and interviewing people going i'm so scared i'm i'm scared to go
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.360]  out i mean we know whether it's stage provocateur to reel the way they're hyping it that is the
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:53.520]  psychological terrorism right there to sell the police state micro vero yeah absolutely it almost
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:57.680]  doesn't matter if it's a real event or staged as i pointed out earlier in the show everybody's
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.080]  going to use everything that happens as an opportunity to push whatever their agenda
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:07.360]  happens to be it's like everything that happens it's raining day how can i use this to sell my
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:12.400]  agenda uh the bus is late how do i use this to sell my agenda nobody's thinking facts and
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.920]  truths anymore we're a nation entirely of propagandistic opportunity they've divided
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:23.440]  his seven ways to sunday and it's all about group identity and then all the groups have
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.400]  their little pimp leaders over them republicans democrats whites hispanics blacks
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.320]  we're i mean where is it headed micro vero well uh you're right it's they're trying to keep the
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.040]  uh the population badly factionalized and keep us quarreling amongst ourselves because the
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.520]  instant we all unite and recognize that government itself is the biggest threat to our lives uh
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:51.760]  they have to keep us fighting amongst ourselves or we're going to start fighting against them
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:55.760]  there was a recent poll that came out i think it was pure research i may be wrong on that
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.560]  but it basically said 80 of respondents viewed the federal government as the biggest danger
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.440]  to their lives and uh and so the governor no you're right it was pure pure research
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:12.080]  and gallup and other polls have shown 75 to 81 percent so it's all in the 75 are low 80 numbers
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:17.680]  and they had other headlines like now it's cool to hate the government now it's mainstream now
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:22.960]  ron paul's views are mainstream it's not that ron paul or you or i or julio hate the government
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:29.200]  we hate this illegitimate unconstitutional government that's violating the law why do we
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.720]  have these laws to restrain government because our founders had gone through a big corrupt pushy
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.080]  government you know it's interesting obama did that speech at that university the other day and
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:46.560]  he spent a huge portion of it telling these kids you've got to be polite you've got to tone down
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:50.720]  the anti-government rhetoric because you're just going to build support for the extremists and he
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:54.960]  really spent more time on that issue than anything else in his entire speech which shows their week
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.800]  which shows their week exactly i want you to finish up without me come back they are panicking

[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:20.560]  want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:26.960]  alex jones mike revero joins us for one more segment and he was bringing up the fact that
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:32.000]  obama gave his commencement speech we played some clips of it yesterday and he said don't
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.440]  criticize the government the government is you the people so whatever the government does that's
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:43.840]  what you wanted but wait a minute don't criticize because you're the people and so you can't criticize
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.560]  the government that's double think if we're the government then we have a right to tell the government
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:52.720]  when it's doing something we don't like or something that's illegal or unconstitutional he
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:59.440]  went on to just for most of this long speech say don't be extreme don't be rude be passive sit down
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:04.240]  and take it you know and then he had that other white house correspondence dinner and made jokes
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:08.800]  about you know this whole event is brought to you by goldman sacks they don't care if you don't
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:13.120]  like the jokes because they're getting all the money he made jokes about predator drones killing
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:20.880]  people just like bush made jokes about no wmds here nope not under there uh so this incredible
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:28.000]  arrogance meanwhile government is running tv ads all over the country i mean they have announcements
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.880]  here in austin every year and over 10 of texas has warrants out for their arrest saying it's
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:37.120]  roundup time roundup you better pay your fines and fees we're coming to your door we know where you
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.280]  live it's roundup so when they have a real political roundup people will just say oh it's another
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.680]  roundup but they have these ads they also have similar ones in england where the government's
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:50.880]  watching you from satellite their god uh you know i i covered the fox news story where all these
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:57.520]  police chiefs are saying we wear black masks to intimidate you to instill sense of fear so the state
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.720]  is trying to intimidate us so they can rob us i mean i mean it's very elementary this is what
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:08.160]  happens every other time in history liberty and freedom is incredibly rare it's a jewel that must
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.800]  be protected as thomas jefferson said and he said if you let private central banks come in
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.520]  you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered so i wanted to play this clip
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:24.720]  of pennsylvania uh fear mongering where the government is is is like we're god we're omnipresent
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  we know where we where you live nice car nice house tom what's not not nice as you tom so again
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:39.600]  we're government we're god uh we we're the big uh skynet above you controlling everything this is
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:45.440]  government terrorism this is big brother this is authoritarian tyranny here's the clip your name
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:53.120]  is tom you live just off of fifth street nice car tom nice house what's not so nice is u o pennsylvania

[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:18.960]  are find us before we find you pa tax pay up now imagine the mafia coming to your door and saying
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.040]  nice car nice house we're gonna make this easy on you uh the condescending voice the of the
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:32.800]  borg voice you will be assimilated you know dave i i had to you know kill the other astronaut and
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:38.800]  now i'm going to kill you that's the message here microvera yeah absolutely i mean this is a direct
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.440]  contradiction to obama's claim that the people are the government which is complete nonsense
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:49.520]  the people have been screaming for years lower taxes stop spending money on war stop giving our
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:54.880]  money to israel the government isn't listening to the people the the congress that passed tarp
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:00.000]  proved that and the bottom line is you're absolutely right the biggest terrorist in our lives right
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.120]  now is the federal government i'm not worried about osama bin laden who's actually dead despite
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:10.080]  this latest documentary uh you know we're all worried about the federal government even the
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.880]  people who still got the money to pay their taxes they're worried the government is going to totally
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:22.000]  destroy the economy uh and and wreck our lives a year from now it's it's really reached a point
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.920]  where everybody is very very concerned about what the federal government is doing the government
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.640]  does not represent us and now you've got the president up there saying please don't criticize us
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.080]  you're not supposed to do that i find it hard to believe that obama was a constitutional scholar
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:41.200]  or professor because he seems to have forgotten that the original intent of the first amendment
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:46.160]  gives every american citizen the right to stand up and tell the government they're full of it
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.760]  without fear of reprisal no now they're saying you're the government so sit down and shut up
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:56.160]  well if we're the government then we have a right to speak this is so elementary he's expanding
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:04.400]  secret arrest torture wars and now like bush making jokes about dead people uh with the drones uh
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.800]  this is done on purpose to enrage foreign enemies so that people do actually strike us well yeah
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.360]  they our government needs to have real acts of terror to keep us under control and when they
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:21.440]  don't get the real acts of terror uh they're going to fake them uh and and again adolf hitler did
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.560]  exactly the same thing to his people and the end result was world war two and the end result of
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.920]  our government doing it to the american people is going to be world war three and folks we will
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.560]  lose this one and by the way that's what many government heads are saying we're really going
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:42.000]  into world war three they are planning to hit iran uh they've got a martial law scenario here
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.360]  domestically uh and it won't be announced as martial law it'll be civil emergency just like
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:53.280]  mexico and and it's so elementary they bring in 30 million plus illegal aliens who would be hard
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:58.240]  working good parts of society if they weren't given all this welfare and told to hate america
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.400]  because they know the american people are waking up so they're trying to get as many foreigners
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:08.480]  here to fill up the military and everything else to be used as a weapon because uh they can have a
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:14.320]  willing group that they pay off to do it i mean this is high treason this is a completely
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:19.440]  bankrupt out of control group of criminals i mean the mere fact that they're slapping golden sacks
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:24.720]  on the wrist and focusing on a few low level traders uh when they ran the whole financial
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.280]  implosion not just here but worldwide by design and we have the documents i mean
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.880]  where does it end though i mean i don't i think the average americans waking up mic
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.720]  but i don't think the average american knows just how bad it really is no the average american
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.880]  does not we we had a friend over here the other day who's involved in the local democratic party
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:50.720]  and is still basically drinking the kool-aid for 90 of what they see on the corporate tv networks
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:54.800]  the bottom line is what i you know they're they're pushing for this global government i don't think
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.800]  they're going to get it the end result is these bozos could bring about a whole new dark ages by
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:05.040]  collapsing the world government and not having or collapsing all the governments of the world
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:09.200]  and not having anything credible to take it well look what corrupt government's done in mexico it
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:15.440]  is collapsed mexico is collapsed right now even the small areas they kept safe for tourists have
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.720]  now collapsed i mean this is what corrupt government does it look at north korea i mean
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:27.040]  i mean this is what we're going to turn into and and and it's absolutely horrible and it's
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:31.600]  painful to watch for those of us who grew up in this country with this very wonderful idea of
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:36.960]  what america was supposed to be to see america being murdered by the government itself not foreign
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:42.080]  terrorists not for an invasion but destroyed from within by a government that has sold us out
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.520]  to private interests and foreign interests it's painful to watch it really is it is timon new
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:54.320]  yorker on the air go ahead but it's a pleasure to speak with you um here already off gets good
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.680]  to talk to you turn your radio off uh... okay i'm in uh... i'm in a warehouse okay i'm sorry
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:04.720]  it was just real noisy go ahead okay first of all in new yorker i want to say since you played
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:11.200]  that clip the false flags are at half mass in time square uh... i just want to go over with you the
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:17.040]  propaganda wait a minute wait a minute they put the flags at half mass when no one died
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.080]  no no i was just making an analogy of all flags are at half mass
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:28.720]  got it in time square uh... the propaganda that i've seen on the local news here last night fox
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:33.600]  news uh... since they didn't have a suspect yet we're talking about how great it was
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:40.480]  to have video surveillance and it's a lot like the show twenty four and they kept using the word
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:49.120]  sexy to describe watching video after video trying to find a terrorist how sexy it is
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:56.640]  and another term that the reporter used last night was that we need a world class surveillance
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:01.200]  was the words used and i've been hearing that i've been hearing everywhere we need
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:06.400]  we need cameras everywhere or or my gosh we might have a person or two die a year we better
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.360]  give up our whole way of life and give trillions of dollars to the chertoff group and i had some
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.640]  cia veteran part of the chertoff group on fox saying our way of life is ended
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.640]  yeah and then they had congressman israel on saying our way of life is ended this is a new way
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:28.480]  you know oh my gosh a truck full of gasoline it's over but every couple days some house
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:34.240]  blows up from a gas main kills a bunch of people you know it's the end of the world somebody died
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:42.160]  my revero uh yeah it is it's it's fear mongering and it's uh it's it's panic it they're basically
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.640]  the government is trying to keep us afraid and the problem with that is once the government
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.440]  starts using fear to control their people they're going to have to keep using fear to keep them
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.400]  under control if the government ever lets the fear subside if they ever let the people calm down
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:01.920]  to where they can start thinking again uh then it's really going to start falling apart on them
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:07.360]  and i think that's what's happening now because fear is very tiring fear burns itself out and i
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:12.160]  think people are too tired to be afraid anymore and let me add let me add exactly let me add the
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.920]  caveat let's not forget governor ridge came out and wrote a book last year admitting that they
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:20.080]  were issuing the terror alerts and that they were fake as we said five six years ago yourself and
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:25.360]  myself and many others admitted that the terror alerts were fake for political gain and they've
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.640]  been caught over and over and over and over and over again doing this yeah it is it's all about
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:35.120]  the manipulation i mean they used to be able to wave communist at us and we just pay taxes and
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:39.920]  send our kids off to die in wars then the cold war was over and ever since then there's always
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:46.640]  going to be a new monster a war on drugs a war on terror a war on carbon dioxide a war on whatever
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.800]  they're always going to come up with something new that we're supposed to be afraid of and give
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:57.760]  them money to protect us from and the new york times uh also has an opinion article uh on their
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:05.040]  website today finding the terrorist next door in which uh they support a police state and the term
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:09.840]  that is used throughout the article as well yeah i know i've been hearing it it's just our way of
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:16.000]  life is over america had to we've got to give all the money to the banks of the military sorry
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:20.480]  but again we have an elite that's used our government and our military and our tax money
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:25.760]  to dominate the globe of course they're going to rob us too if they'll kill a million plus iraqis
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.480]  for some weapons sales and and and oil and and for strategic interest of israel
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.560]  of course they'll do anything to us i mean they see us as just as worthless

[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:24.800]  uh to your phone calls here uh dealing with race uh all the arizona law and i've now had a chance to
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.880]  read it several times says that the feds won't enforce this law uh if we pull somebody over
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:35.920]  for drunk driving or whatever uh or we have probable cause that they're illegal aliens
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:39.680]  we're going to ask them for their id and if they're illegal aliens we're going to take
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:43.760]  them into jail now that's what every other country on earth does except for western europe
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.000]  and the united states and canada and australia because they want to break down our sovereignty
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.600]  because we're the wealthy countries we're being robbed by the banking class but this story out of
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:58.720]  chicago and out of illinois bill that would effectively prohibit african americans and
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:04.720]  spanish from buying guns advances in illinois general assembly see i don't
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:12.800]  want to be overrun by foreigners at the globalist control because almost to a man they're voting
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:18.480]  to take our liberties as a client group of the government i don't at the same time want to see
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:24.960]  blacks and hispanics aborting most their kids i they're human beings i care about i want them to
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:30.160]  be patriots i want to wake them up i want to be able to reach out to them but with the latin americans
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:35.680]  because they don't speak english and because mexico lost two wars with the us they are particularly
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.320]  angry and have been taught to hate this country that that's why it's such a problem is that saying
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:46.320]  all of these people have that view no but a large portion do and you could just go google
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.760]  oslin or go to youtube and you'll see hundreds of videos of mayors and congressmen and the mayor of
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:26:00.800]  la just the most racist stuff you can imagine go home pilgrim die white race you're scum you're
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:07.120]  evil you need to die we need to plan a san diego uh it's disgusting meanwhile you don't hear the
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:13.120]  hispanic and black leaders criticizing this no they're authoring it law abiding african americans
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.560]  and hispanics would take it on the chin under a bill now moving through the illinois general assembly
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:29.920]  sponsored by representative harry osterman democrat district 14 it's hbs it's hb 6123 hb 6123
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:37.040]  would prohibit any person or entity from selling a firearm to a so-called street gang member
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.800]  this prohibition applies even if the individual has passed a brady law fbi background check
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:47.840]  making a prohibited sale would result in a class one felony charge and possibly jail time with
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:53.200]  the seller although the isra supports genuine efforts to curb criminal violence the organization
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.920]  is strongly opposed to the bill as the bill's revisions are arbitrary and pose an unreasonable
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:04.000]  intrusion on the rights of law abiding illinois citizens but the feds are coming in and it's
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.280]  threatening atf arrest of gun shops all over the country if they sell to someone missing a finger
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:13.120]  because that means they're a bomb maker uh no they got their finger chopped off in a factory or
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:19.360]  running a combine uh or an engine block fell on their hand working at a shop i mean how many
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:27.440]  craftsmen how many farmers ranchers woodworkers steelworkers factory workers um
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:35.040]  um carpenters do you know that are missing a finger or two and we've shown you those training
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:42.000]  manuals whereas your responsibility not to sell to them and to call us so uh and and under this
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.920]  bill it provides racial profiling and it says you know if you're wearing baggy pants or you know
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:56.720]  have tattoos uh given the provisions it says it established no test for determining street gang
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:01.840]  membership given the harsh penalties for violating the proposed law is understandable that retailers
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:07.840]  would shy away from selling farms to a persons whose speech dress mannerisms or taste in music
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:14.320]  reflect an urban lifestyle so i mean this is targeting black people mainly i just don't sell
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:20.640]  guns to black people and that's the democratic party the same one in the 1870s who passed laws
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:28.640]  in the south to not sell guns to black people oh it makes me sick it just it just absolutely
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:35.360]  makes me want to throw up and just the arrogance the over the topness of this shannon in mississippi
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:41.600]  you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how you doing pretty good what's on your mind i just wanted to

[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:10.240]  go up and ask some of these you know are you legal or illegal and 95 percent of them will
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:15.280]  they'll just look at me as small and say i'm illegal and then a week down the road i'm getting
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:20.960]  laid off of my job they're squeezing me to death with all these new taxes and a question i wanted
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:28.320]  to ask you Alex today is this national id is coming out when do you think this will hit

[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:16.720]  what does this have to do with illegal aliens i'll explain before we go back to him
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:29.600]  mexico china india malaysia taiwan over 160 nations under the agreement have to make no
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:39.280]  carbon dioxide cuts the west has to make cuts of at least 20 so what's going to happen to the few
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:45.840]  factories and jobs and businesses we have they're going to leave china has no environmental standards
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:52.000]  no insurance no workers compensation no environmental uh cleanup bills they just do whatever they want
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:59.760]  same thing with india and it's not that we're against the people of india or mexico or china
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:05.760]  or eastern europe they're being exploited as well and the globalists have stated
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:10.320]  that they want to drive down wages and they lie to the public and said nafta and gatton
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:14.320]  the wto are going to be great for you they've known exactly what would happen
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:22.480]  and mexico in the last 17 18 years since nafta for the first decade they did well
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.840]  they got to move up to the maquiladoras they got paid low wages but it was still better than some
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:32.240]  of the things they had in mexico city the government used environmental laws to drive most of the
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.520]  indigenous people off their land on record up to those factories now almost all those factories
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:43.760]  are shut down because it can't compete with china where the average salary is about 55 cents
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:52.320]  an hour we're talking about people maybe making a couple thousand dollars a year now you can never
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:58.960]  compete with that now what you're dealing with in construction and i've talked to chefs in dallas
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:07.440]  chefs in houston chefs in uh los angeles where now if you can't speak spanish you're just
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:13.120]  basically kicked off they won't work with you so there's also a view of whether you're hispanic
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:20.160]  american uh black white doesn't matter you you're not wanted so it's also very very tribal perfect
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:24.560]  for the government because the average people can't hear the language don't understand it don't know
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:31.280]  what's going on under the surface so the government also gives massive welfare to these groups i've
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.840]  seen reports of the average illegal being on three forms of welfare under three fake consulate
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:40.320]  matricula ids that the government just issues to their people because that money gets set back home
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:45.520]  but on the issue of construction and other jobs including cities counties and states
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.480]  and the feds remember the border fence part of it was being built by legals just the 50 something
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:57.520]  miles of show fence they built and then they never finished it of course the illegal aliens
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.920]  are there to undermine jobs there to bankrupt people there to drive wages down that's what
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:10.880]  globalization is and so the illegals can live 5 10 15 to an apartment or a house they avoid most
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.600]  the taxes they're supplemented with welfare they don't have to show all the forms of id that
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:19.440]  citizens do they get let go when they're drunk driving they get let go when they're caught with
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.520]  105 thousand dollars of drug money in noxville tennessee like that we covered yesterday because
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:33.280]  they are on the government team they are needed to deindustrialize and break the united states
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:38.800]  to get rid of the middle class which is what global elites always in modern history push to do
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.040]  they don't want you independent they don't want you doing well they don't want the next generation
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.120]  doing better what does the head of the imf say last week the good times are over you're gonna be poor
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.400]  or get used to it we've broken up your families you're all working now the state's got your kids
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:57.040]  this is just the further process of domestication so it's the same thing with the illegals
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:03.200]  they're brought in to undermine jobs and to drive down the standard of living and to bankrupt the
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.400]  states so the federal government which is itself controlled by the offshore banks can come in
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:14.080]  and take over and so that's why there'll be no enforcement on the illegal aliens they're not
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:19.360]  going to have to get ids but it's going to be felonies for citizens and that's in the immigration
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.320]  bill if you don't have this federalized worker ID card that tracks everything you do and ties into
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:29.600]  the irs and the health care bill and even before the health care bill passed three months before it
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:37.120]  passed illinois was already implementing the provisions of it so they just do whatever they want
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:44.880]  and that's only one dimension of it then the illegals again will vote for bigger government
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:49.520]  more handouts gun control as long as the party in power gives them some goodies
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.760]  and the system's always been worried about uh immigrant populations waking up they've
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:59.920]  been really worried about keeping blacks on the democratic party reservation not the republicans
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:09.040]  would save them uh you know they took what you had almost 90 percent in the 1940s and 50s of blacks
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.720]  in america were quote legitimate meaning there was a mother and a father and blacks owned their
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:21.840]  own businesses and uh were very very wealthy and they were just a lot of a very large black middle
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:30.240]  class okay and um it's on record the cia began shipping in cocaine heroin they would only allow
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:36.800]  the hooker operations to be in the black neighborhood as a way to decorate the society i mean this is
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:44.800]  a weaponized system a war going on but it isn't even so much that the globalists hate blacks
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:50.960]  they do but it's mainly they always pick a minority to beta test it like they told you
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:55.360]  the police state was for Arabs and Muslims and foreigners but now we get the internal
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:58.400]  documents and now they openly announce it's for the american people period
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.080]  and so they've got the average black person loving the democratic party
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:09.280]  well the democratic party uh under the Rockefellers and others is there to abort their babies more
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:12.560]  than half of them they're to poison their food and water they're to shoot them up with deadly
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:17.600]  shots they're to ship drugs in and then put their kids in prison uh the media is there to sell the
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:23.440]  gangster you know gangster rap culture it's all crafted but they sell the same culture to everybody
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:29.200]  else they've just had the blacks where they want them longer because they came out of slavery and
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.640]  never had a middle class well they developed one by the 30s 40s and 50s and that's gone now
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.400]  you have 90 plus percent illegitimacy people say oh well you're attacking single parents
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.480]  no i'm not i'm stating the fact that you're four times more likely ended up in prison
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:49.520]  are on drugs if you come from a single home you need two parents there
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:54.880]  uh i mean you know my kids don't behave that good for my wife that they behave better for me
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:59.600]  and everybody knows that's just the natural order of things and if i wasn't there i mean it's not
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:03.840]  that my wife my wife's a wonderful person harder working than i am in many respects it's just it's
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:10.560]  a lot to take care of and imagine if my wife had to work then the state gets my kids so that's the
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:20.720]  goal and that's a long answer shannon uh to your question but they have and it's also multi-pronged
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.400]  the globalist always run the same operation four or five or six or seven different ways
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:32.080]  knowing that it's like firing 10 torpedoes at a ship you know you know the submarine pops up floods
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.840]  the tubes fires it's a big capital ship they want to fire every torpedo they've got so that they are
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:44.240]  sure they you know sink the bismarck or whatever it is and so they already passed a national ID card
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:50.240]  under bill clinton 1994 and i covered my first film america destroyed by design it's federally
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.040]  standardizing driver's license they didn't get around to telling you that until 2006 it's the real
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:01.200]  id act now though they're passing separate legislation in banking and immigration where
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:05.280]  citizens have to have it and then the government's in your bank account and that's in the new
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:09.040]  legislation where the government has just taken money out whenever they want and track
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:14.400]  in every deposit and purchase you make that's in the banking reform bill again they always
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:20.560]  create the crisis their solution is more power for them uh and so i mean if they're able to
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:25.440]  break the border if they're able to legalize these illegals because that's the other issue
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:32.400]  if illegals want to take the national ID card they're instantly nationalized they're instantly
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:38.320]  uh uh you know basically given the green card makes it very easy you want it boom you got it
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:43.520]  but most of them are smart uh unlike the american people because they've been had to be more street
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:48.640]  smart uh and i mean i mean who can even blame these people they're down there in total squalor
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.640]  in police state they come up here and the government gives them everything they know how to manipulate
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:58.240]  the system and they are left alone if a citizen black white whatever tried to milk the system like
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:03.440]  this hispanic american whatever it'd be over all right i said i'd get into the whole racial
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.680]  politic thing and i haven't got into that yet but i hope that answers your question shannon
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:12.000]  what i've been looking for is discrimination lawsuits in fact we guys i can't find it we
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:18.480]  reprint me that uh knocks news uh article about a hundred and five thousand dollars
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.440]  they pull the illegals over they're illegal aliens they don't have visas they're here illegally
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.880]  they got a hundred and five thousand dollars and they just let them go they just let them go
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:36.400]  and i see this all the time how does the city of austin how does bank of america take one form
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:41.040]  of id and i've had employees try to go in there they want three forms to get a bank account
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.200]  why does austin energy ask for two forms of id from a citizen one form from an illegal
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:51.120]  and it's a consulate matricula that you can literally get out of a cracker jack box they
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.680]  don't even check that and i've talked to former austin energy employees they've had big fights
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:02.640]  over it it's discriminatory and so the way to go at this but but see you can't call ice ice won't
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:08.000]  go pick up these illegal aliens and if you tried to in louisiana the illegals will go burn stuff down
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:14.160]  and it won't even be on the news they'll go i mean that's because again they've got the full backing
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:19.600]  of the banks now once they've sewed this country up and broken and ribboned on the wages uh they're
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:24.000]  going to fully domesticate the illegals and they get the added benefit of once the illegals are in
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.160]  the medical system they take the shots they do what they're told so they'll flop around and die of
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:34.320]  cancer and the government will pay for the cancer treatment which will be taxpayer paid for when
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.520]  they kill them with the cancer treatment so it's so it's just it's just a total system of evil
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:45.440]  shannon does that answer your question yes sir it sure does alex may i ask you one more question
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:53.280]  sure uh i refuse to get the national id card and i've got a few other listeners here with me
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.720]  that i'm trying to wake up and talk to if we refuse to get this id card i understand it's a
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:06.640]  felony but say i walk into a store to buy something now do i have to have this national id
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:12.080]  yes yes yes they're going to have a vat a national sales tax it's been it was officially
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:17.200]  released by the government 12 years ago or 13 years ago now i got 98 you know 12 years ago
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:24.240]  and uh so see it's all going to be selectively enforced and and again
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:30.960]  it's just so evil go ahead yes sir uh
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:35.520]  and this healthcare bill they've got coming out we're not
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:43.440]  right if i don't buy that if i say no to that i say no to this ridiculous healthcare bill
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:49.920]  they are going to take it out of your paycheck a seizure bank account and if you try to and and
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:55.600]  put you on an arrest warrant list and put you in federal prison bottom line but that they've
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:45:00.400]  announced it yeah bottom line and and of course it won't be on the news it's just you know where
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:06.400]  did shannon go he spent four years in the federal pen he didn't buy the insurance and if you try to
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:10.960]  resist they'll send by SWAT teams that think it's tough and macho to kill americans and they'll
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:17.280]  just gun you down so what i've been trying to tell other people they might be tanks driving
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:21.440]  up down the streets here shortly well they're already giving tanks to every police department
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:26.560]  in the country and training them to take on americans americans are the enemy america our
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:32.240]  government has been seized by offshore banks and the entire military and police are being trained

[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:17.760]  the with what you've been talking about for the last 10 minutes um i had to kind of write it down
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:24.880]  because i uh i have bad memory but i'm uh i okay so here goes i'm very proud of my mexican heritage
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:29.840]  but i'm even prouder to be an american i probably served in the navy i love america i love the
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:36.000]  constitution the problem with the my fellow hispanics that i see in in the news is that they
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.680]  don't know why they're there they're told by the spanish radio stations that it's anti-racism and
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:46.240]  that uh that the people that are against them are are racist and they don't care about them
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:51.440]  they don't care about their issues their families but obama loves them you know and um
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:57.040]  um that they're gonna have tamales and burritos and stuff and you know music and everything
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:00.960]  make it like a festival and the people are there under false pretenses they don't know
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:04.720]  really why they're there they just know that there's a mob and you know they're gonna they're
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:10.320]  gonna be seen it's gonna be on the news and notice notice the dominant the dominant corporate media
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:16.080]  the spanish media most of it owned by us and global corporations and a lot of it owned by
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:22.720]  a big money launderers and drug dealers out of mexico that's on record notice that the the spanish
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:28.880]  speaking media the english media covers up when they burn stuff when they attack people but then
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:34.800]  they tell americans hispanic black white don't be part of the anti-new world order movement
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:40.240]  or you're a racist they're scared to death of us ever getting together against this they're scared
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:44.880]  to death of us ever reaching out to these people they don't know the ford foundation the federal
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:51.360]  government taught them about la raza and matcha and oslon and plan of san diego and all of this
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:59.680]  brainwashing and uh so i mean it is an emergency situation and but but i mean go ahead and make
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:06.160]  your point i'm sorry right um my question though is uh on the arizona law i mean i i kind of agree
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:11.120]  with it but i don't know where i stand on this because um what's gonna happen i mean when i
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.400]  take my wife and my kids the peaceful demonstration and the federalities tea parties what's going
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.760]  to happen when the police look at me and you know i i look at spanish uh and they interpret me as a
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:26.560]  potential danger everybody knows when the police stops you you you don't it's not a debate it does
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:30.800]  even if you even if you're right you know it's not a debate they're gonna tell you how it is
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.520]  well let's be clear let's be clear every major city in arizona has said they're not gonna enforce
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:43.600]  this um and the police are not going to just and they will have some staged horror stories
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:48.720]  you know when the police corner a hispanic american black american white american whatever and and
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:53.360]  violate their rights it doesn't even make the news but believe me you're gonna hear the few horror
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:49:00.880]  stories that are out there uh but i mean you know that's like saying if i go to mexico to some resort
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:05.920]  are they gonna arrest me as an illegal alien no but if i fit the profile of a guatemalan
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:12.560]  sneaking in they're gonna grab me and put me in a political prisoner camp i mean mexico is hard
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:16.880]  core on illegals uh because you know they understand their sovereignty and i'm not even saying that's a
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.720]  good thing again this is all much to do about nothing like the like the car bomb you know and
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.320]  they're actually like it's the end of the world in time square we better give all our rights up
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:33.920]  it's a bunch of hype the point is the fed look look the way to enforce this arizona is just doing
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:37.920]  this out of desperation it's not going to be successful and it will be a pr nightmare it
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:46.400]  already is the way to enforce it is yeah i mean the feds all the time go shake old ladies down for
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:52.080]  you know claiming they owe income tax they don't or the case of sacramento a four cent in fact pull
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:50:01.280]  that up a four cent bill of unpaid taxes from some tax mistake for a car wash headline four cents to the
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:07.520]  irs uh you know causes a armed visit and they came and yelled at the guy and were very rude to him
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:12.880]  so see be rude to the citizen be rude to the business owner keep that scum in line let them
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:17.600]  know you're sucking off of them but because you want the illegals to drive down the wages
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:26.400]  red carpet them so so the way to enforce it is uh you start charging business owners with felonies
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.280]  for hiring illegals and they're violating tax laws on top of it most of the time that they're
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:36.960]  doing it because it's under the table cash charge them with tax laws you do that you fix the problem
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:42.800]  i mean that there's six billion plus people that want to come here and we can't have them all here
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.760]  and even if we did have them all here we've got a welfare system it's bankrupting us you know stay
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:52.080]  there george i want to get your response to what i just said uh nobody's going to grab you and your
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:57.200]  wife well actually that's not true they have 100 mile in border checkpoints where they harass

[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:20.240]  of citizens 50 to 100 miles in saying no you're not going to search my car and the border patrol
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:26.160]  beats the living daylights out of them illegals they just roll right on through here's the sacramento
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:31.920]  b irs visit sacramento car wash in pursuit of four cents they talk about how rude they were to them
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:36.880]  how they got in their face i want to get this car wash owner on i mean that's the kind of stuff
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:40.800]  because they they want the enforcers out there whether you believe in the law or not it's a
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:46.880]  fraud unconstitutional they don't go after the big money people they go after the low level people
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:53.680]  to keep us in line now it's simple if you're a citizen no matter what color you are what religion
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:59.680]  or if you're an illegal here more illegals is going to hurt your job right it's going to hurt
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:04.080]  your employment it's going to hurt your future and it's going to bankrupt this country and so
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:11.120]  yeah it's an ugly situation but the globalist or four open borders that's all i need to know
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:15.840]  then i go look at the evidence i'm right to be against him anything the globalist or four
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:20.000]  is a fraud anything the mainstream media is pushing no matter how they dress it up
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.240]  is a fraud this is a criminal system it's 180 degrees the opposite direction of the bill of
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:31.360]  rights and constitution so let me be clear you go to arizona and you argue with them when they want
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:35.920]  to search your car 75 miles over the border or 100 miles they're going to knock your teeth out
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:42.560]  okay uh now that's what goes on my grandfather he's dead now i remember him complaining back
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:46.800]  when i was in college that he was out driving around the hill country and got pulled over by
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:53.600]  border patrol 200 miles uh from the border uh so and i mean and i mean he's a white guy
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:56:00.320]  you know german ancestry so this is going on of course they're going to use this to run checkpoints
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:04.480]  and have a police state of course it's going to be against everybody that's why it's probably not
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:09.840]  the way to do it but if you do pull somebody over for drunk driving and they're an illegal alien
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:14.640]  well no matter where they're from you take them to jail but they don't even do that in most cases
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:21.440]  they admit it so that's the issue is that the sanctuary cities and the feds have an open door
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.320]  policy and are engaged in political warfare so we have to stand up against it does that answer
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:32.240]  your question george yes another thing i wanted to say regarding that is that i'm i'm just really
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.400]  torn because i mean i want them to enforce the law i mean we don't need any more laws that you
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:43.120]  know that that nobody you know nobody follows but i want them to enforce it but if they enforce it
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.960]  they're kind of infringing on my rights because i am mexican i am brown but if that if they don't
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:55.280]  enforce it then i i mean if they do enforce it like what's going to happen i mean that they're
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:00.240]  going to take away my you know they see you in a in the you know you're protesting you're at
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:03.840]  you're at the end of that you know you're anti-government they're going to take my kids away
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:07.680]  they're going to you know i have a traditional relationship with my wife then they come in
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:14.000]  and then they tell you that your relationship is not right that you're that huge machismo and things
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.240]  like that you know and oh yeah that's the new thing it's abusive if the woman stays home with
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:22.240]  the kids because the state owns those kids let me ask you this question you know my wife speaks
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:26.400]  spanish because she lived in spain and i mean certainly you're aware of the oslan movement
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:31.360]  the signs these people've got and and and the fact that a lot of these illegals have been taught
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:38.560]  that the southwest belongs to mexico i am aware of that but i also know my people very well i mean
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:45.120]  i have i have 12 uncles you know and i know that that they work they get home from work and they're
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:50.320]  tied most of them most of the people that i know will not go out there unless they're told is unless
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:55.360]  it's uh propagandize unless it's hyped up they're gonna have music they're gonna have food and stuff
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:58.720]  and the people most of the people especially immigrants they don't they don't speak the
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:02.800]  language so they don't know so they just get out there and they think that it's it's you know
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.880]  they're fighting the races they're fighting the white guy and it's not like that you know that's
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:11.280]  what i'm saying they're out there under false pretenses but the media goes out there and then
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:17.200]  you know they put that out there that exactly the globalist have created a situation that's
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:22.400]  meant to have us all divided and conquered fighting with each other but it's a real threat
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:29.440]  it's illegal it's unconstitutional so what do you do again uh bottom line it is going to hurt you
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:34.560]  and your family if this continues and it must be reversed and we have to have a national debate

[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.360]  of the adl and southern poverty law center and mayor bloomberg trying to say that the car bomb
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:29.280]  dud in time square saturday that he thinks it's people that are against health care
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:34.000]  government takeover of health care uh i mean it's just amazing what they're doing stir we
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:38.880]  must be getting under their skin absolutely you know you get a lot of flock when you're
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:43.200]  you're right on top of the target how it goes and i'm proud to be on me at the uh some of the
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:49.520]  probably law centers list of patriots uh right there with ron paul and judge the politics i'm a
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:55.360]  good company absolutely and of course yours truly i'm on there is particularly that's right that's
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:02.240]  right you are that's right and we're on the white house enemies list as well i i mean this is really
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:08.080]  an act of desperation they're trying to divide the american people uh by by saying you know if you
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:14.720]  say the sky's blue you're a racist uh and and and obama gave a commencement speech um last week
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:20.160]  where all he talked about was don't be angry do what the government says they're really concerned
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:25.680]  absolutely and as you said you know if you just if you just quote the founding fathers
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:30.880]  and and stick to the constitution that's a threat to them and so they're going to try to demonize
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:38.160]  me but they're jumping the shark now i mean it's it's getting the absurd oathkeepers is just exploding
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:43.200]  it seems like it's backfired on them in a few years since you founded the organization uh now
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:48.400]  it's it's just all over the place yeah it's exactly right every time they attack us like they had a
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:54.000]  recently they had no clip of all people uh talking to keepers by name mentioning us along with three
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.960]  percenters the gun owners and in a speech and in several interviews so when they started the
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:03.920]  herald x president that you i think you're doing something right so i think they're just a flay to
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:08.400]  the constitution and they're afraid of our message and trying to shut us up it's just not gonna work
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:14.000]  well bill clinton two weeks ago said uh the tea party people are gonna cause another oklahoma city
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:19.200]  and when it happens it's gonna be your fault i think if another oklahoma city happens we better
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:25.120]  look at bill clinton i mean that's i mean that's a frame up in the making oh yeah definitely and
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:29.600]  and one thing to keep in mind also look you look you was sponsoring the event he was speaking at
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:35.520]  it was a george soros sponsored event and these are you know he's he's the knockcase in the puppet
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:40.800]  but the people who are pulling the strings are far higher up as you know and who is george soros
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:45.360]  he's one of the big investment bankers involved in all the derivatives robbing us seven waves of
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:51.040]  sunday that's right and it's no party that's why that's why i get the interview to ross dory i said
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:56.000]  look you know that there are conservatives who are sincere and are real constitutionalists
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.160]  that's who are you know that's the that's the grassroots of the tea party movement i have
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:05.360]  those respect for that but all the fake ones all the neocons i have no i have a other contempt
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:09.840]  for them and no respect for them whatsoever well we're about to break let's let's come back and go
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:14.880]  over the points uh that you made there because he absolutely oath keepers was founded against the
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:19.440]  patriot act what happened in katrina you've been very critical of both show us ron paul
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:24.880]  which who you worked for and the media has spun it and said basically you're some type of republican
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:29.440]  operative so i'm glad you're out there explaining this because when the republicans come back into
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:33.840]  power we're going to be right back in the same situation because they're owned by the same people

[03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:09.840]  is so threatened by him but we've had the southern poverty law center uh stewart attack us we've had
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:15.760]  the adl attack us and ron paul and judge napolitano and yourself and myself and say we're calling for
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:21.280]  violence and imply we're enabling terrorist and just just just asinine tyranny meanwhile illegal
[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:26.800]  aliens rioted in santa cruz set fire to a restaurant with torches uh knocked out the
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:32.560]  windows of more than 20 businesses no national news coverage bloomberg's trying to blame the tea
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:39.280]  party for the uh failed truck bomb even though they've already arrested a pakistani uh in in
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:45.280]  new york i mean you're you're an american so you don't even want me to make this point because
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:48.960]  black white is spanish it doesn't matter but you're you know you're half hispanic what do you
[03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:54.960]  think about the fact that they're really trying from my point of view to stir up racial tensions
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:11:00.880]  in this country well sure it's all part of divide and conquer and and they don't pay attention to
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:07.280]  anybody else's threats the only thing they find to be a threat is is americanism is is bedrock
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:12.880]  constitutionalism that is their great enemy it's like dracula being afraid of garlic or
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:18.720]  the cross that's what they fear more than anything else is that americans will come together on the
[03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:23.120]  bedrock common ground of the bill of rights they don't want you to do that they want to divide
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:28.000]  conquer police against the citizens black against white brown against white they want you all
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:33.360]  dividing you know left versus right they want you to divide and fight amongst yourselves so you
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:37.600]  don't see what they're doing they're destroying the republic they are let me bring up one more
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:42.720]  point on this issue and then get into so-called right-wing hypocrisy uh i don't know if you saw
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:46.880]  this it just came out friday but i know you've seen all the other confirmed drills and reports
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:53.840]  they're they're training brigade homeland and the national guard in drill scenarios where the tea
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:59.040]  party is going to attack military and police and in the drills they describe us as drunken
[03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:06.240]  racist and they even talk about taking us to detention centers uh i mean this is really scary
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:09.840]  what type of reports are you getting from all of your oath keeper members
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:16.800]  in the military and law enforcement on this front that the parallels going on it's no accident i
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:22.880]  think it's total hogwash and a whitewash to say that one officer inserted that scenario into the
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:28.160]  four knocks training that's just nonsense we're getting feedback that they are being trained
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:34.080]  multiple reserve units for both marine corps and army you're telling us they're being trained
[03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:40.800]  by by command of dorkoff for domestic disturbances and it's not because it's kind of future
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:46.080]  hypothetical it's because there's something coming down the pike and they they're they know this and
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:50.240]  the gut feeling among the troops is that they don't like the training they're being given
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:55.040]  and then understand that it's for something short term it's not just way in the future and
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:00.480]  that we think we have a two star general retired who is doing he just retired last year who's going
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:05.760]  to go do some looking around and he's talking to other other current serving uh general officers
[03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:10.400]  and so we're hoping to get some feedback again this next week well police are a breakdown the
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:14.240]  type of intel you're getting i mean we know in the john mourner defense authorization act
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:21.360]  passed in 2007 and concurrently though the three years after it its states north com is for domestic
[03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:28.320]  disturbances and even putting down governors and states that say no to the feds and we see hardball
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:34.720]  with slimeball matthews and others saying that you know uh obama may have to be like lincoln
[03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:40.160]  and that the federalism issue has been settled uh via the civil war i mean this is serious
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:47.360]  absolutely and what north com has done is handed him a fema has done an run around the states
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:52.720]  and the body of the country up into the 10 zones under fema which are the same 10 zones that are
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:58.880]  north com and now with the council of governors i mean it's it's really it's really a it's putting
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:03.440]  in place a shadow government infrastructure that during emergencies they can just bypass the states
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:08.720]  you know nullify the state governors and just you know if you under the under the reign of fema
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:13.360]  uh mesh with north com together and that's what that's what's happening you know the city is
[03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:18.320]  putting this up and now the training is becoming much more focused and much more overt and but
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:22.320]  the thing is is the troops don't like it either and we're here and as you heard here on the call
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:26.320]  ends you've been getting uh from active duty they don't they don't like this they understand
[03:14:26.320 --> 03:14:30.640]  what's happening that's that's the big difference is they're not able to just pull the wool over the
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.600]  the uh current servings off of their eyes and that's checkmate i mean tyranny will come to your
[03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:41.120]  door in a uniform we don't want to fight the military and police we want them to relearn their oath
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:46.800]  commit and decide what side they're on uh clearly the financial collapse is what ron paul believes
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:53.680]  they're getting ready for open marshal law and an attack on iran uh so this is very very serious
[03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:58.320]  if they attack iran they're not going to need to stage attacks there's going to be real attacks
[03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:02.560]  and then we get the internal mayac and homeland security reports two weeks ago the head of the
[03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:08.320]  fbi uh robert mewler said the new threat is the american people well we've known with the internal
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:15.920]  docks for eight years the full the focus of this has been on we the people absolutely and and we're
[03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:21.920]  seeing that even with the notekeepers we've got now confirmation that uh basically the fbi and htf
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:26.960]  are being picked on us and they're being targeted told to go out and find you know find a way to
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:32.480]  bring us as a militia find a way to you know make us look bad at the eyes of the current sort of
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:37.360]  military so i mean of course it's happening to you too all all these mere campaigns are
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:42.320]  being done against anyone who speaks up anyone who stands for the constitution it's not done
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:48.560]  against fake conservatives against the neotrons only done against true constitutionalism because
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:54.400]  we are their actual enemy yeah let's talk about well well first let me just get any other intel
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:57.680]  that's important that you're getting from the troops right now when we have the documents
[03:15:57.680 --> 03:16:02.400]  them it's not just the phone calls we know what's going on but but specifically what
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:07.920]  percentage is a dead reckoning of the forces you're talking to are really waking up to what's
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:13.120]  happening well it's tough to say i mean it's kind of like an iceberg we're we're really here you
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:17.760]  know from a tip and there's a great mask beneath but but you hear so many different pains from so
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:22.560]  many different directions that you know the big picture starts to come together but basically
[03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:26.880]  they don't like the training they're getting they understand what's for they understand that that
[03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:33.280]  is it's predominantly for uh coming economic collapse and and so and in fact um others still
[03:16:33.280 --> 03:16:39.040]  thought we heard is that uh they were police police who told us that during their training
[03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:44.320]  so they were told by prior military i can't tell you who but just prior military that an economic
[03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:48.640]  collapse is coming the government is aware of it and the government is preparing for it of course
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:53.920]  you know that but but the but the average police officer is is is stunned by the Smiths and so
[03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:59.200]  when they hear that from the first time from very credible military personnel who you know
[03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:04.000]  it in private conversations between between professionals when they hear this for the first
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:08.560]  time and they're floored by it but they don't like it and they understand that what's happening is that
[03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:15.040]  an economic collapse will be used as a pretext and a catalyst for shutting down the constitution
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:20.480]  for sidestepping the state to be given break there's there's there's nothing about state sovereignty
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:26.240]  that is being respected or preserved by north com or by fema it's just not going to happen
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:31.280]  well you're absolutely right and we have the internal goldman sacks and other documents
[03:17:31.280 --> 03:17:36.320]  where it was engineered by design i had greg palest bbc reporter on who got the internal
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:43.200]  imf documents where they plan to cause riots as a pretext to come in and take over well i've
[03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:49.360]  seen that i'd like to see that oh absolutely well that actually came out in 2002 but uh
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:57.200]  absolutely had greg palest on yesterday now expanding on this uh on on tea party day you
[03:17:57.200 --> 03:18:04.080]  canceled an event in dc because of provocateurs tell us about that well one of those provocateurs
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:10.400]  we canceled because it was off our mission i mean i like as i said the press conference i gave in dc
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:15.760]  we have the utmost respect back daniel allan the organizer that event is an outkeeper he was he was
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:21.120]  one of our guys in georgia and so i have the utmost respect for him um but the rhetoric started
[03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:26.400]  the shift from being just to help a carry event which is fine and started to be much more confrontational
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:30.560]  but i i did say look it's important for the government to get that message that there are
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:35.600]  people out there who are not going to just you know roll over and give up their liberty they're
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:40.240]  willing to fight they have to i think it's an important message to government yet but it's not the
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:45.280]  other message our mission is to focus on the people within the government not on you know us
[03:18:45.280 --> 03:18:49.840]  they're outside of the government and so i thought it was incompatible with what we're trying to do
[03:18:49.840 --> 03:18:54.000]  just in the sense that we want to make sure we can reach the current serving and we put ourselves
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:59.200]  in a posture of making it easy for everyone to attack us and make us look like a militia because
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:03.520]  that way they can have the do d you know make us a banned organization that active duty cannot
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:08.480]  belong to them because they're so demonized the word militia that's now they and they can use
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.920]  counterterrorism funds to really run an operation against you so absolutely so we don't want to
[03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:17.920]  make ourselves vulnerable to that so that's why we didn't do it i've gotten a lot of flak for it
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:23.200]  but hey i want i want to take my lumps and whatever i gotta deal with to stay on mission my focus is
[03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:28.320]  on the current serving and my message to people out there who are you know they want us to become
[03:19:28.320 --> 03:19:32.000]  you know they want to actually become like a militia they want oathkeepers to stand up and
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:37.680]  go stop government abuse or or go stand the front lines and do this for that and my message to them
[03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:43.520]  is hey do you want the police and military on your side or not if you do let me do my mission you
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:48.480]  go do your mission i'm not going to knock what you're exactly we don't need people telling you

[03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:12.320]  steward roads the founder of oathkeepers is our guest rule about 40 after then i want to play a
[03:24:12.320 --> 03:24:19.200]  clip of a black studies professor saying exterminate the entire white race well that's just part of the
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:24.480]  human race but i want to illustrate how you've got some of the white supremacists saying this you
[03:24:24.480 --> 03:24:29.440]  got black groups Hispanic groups saying it i want to explain how tribalism works now the globalist
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:33.120]  manipulators through this but going back to steward roads the next segment we're opening the phones
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:41.040]  up just four steward roads take a few calls 1-800-259-9231 uh and i'm not saying everybody
[03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:46.560]  steward that's trying to get you to you know become this organization that gets the military
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:53.440]  to go out and confront people but the minute you tell i mean obviously get military active duty
[03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:58.720]  to start going out and confronting people they will call that sedition and i'll guarantee you
[03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:03.680]  that's provocateurs it's like when i told hitari of the hundreds of militia groups i could tell
[03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:08.240]  they were being infiltrated because of their rhetoric i got one of their members on uh back
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:13.920]  in august of last year and i said you're about to be set up i mean it's just so clear to see this
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:18.560]  they hate your mission of reaching out to the millions of vets and hundreds of thousands
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:22.720]  of active duty and police the millions of police because you're having such an effect
[03:25:22.720 --> 03:25:27.280]  showing them what's happening that of course they want to get you off a mission of course
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:33.680]  they want to get you uh to i mean i mean they would have as you said you've already got atf
[03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:38.640]  and fbi trying to go and find stuff on your members already so they can create this uh
[03:25:38.640 --> 03:25:43.920]  you know this false picture of that you guys are you know this evil group right yeah they're not a
[03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:50.720]  deal with militias unfortunately the the pr battle uh was lost back in the nineties for for those
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:55.120]  citizens of militias and so they know how to spare them they don't know how to deal with what we're
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:26:00.320]  doing it's very difficult then to attack us directly and so they have to make us into something
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:07.040]  we're not to be easier to attack they're certainly doing that shifting gears with your interview with
[03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:12.560]  um raw story oathkeeper founder slams conservative media hypocrisy why is that so important and
[03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:19.520]  break it down well i mean the the last time since oathkeepers began has had this city mantra like
[03:26:19.520 --> 03:26:24.720]  with the mother jones um interview she she told her totally misproted me she says in the article
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:30.640]  that i that i said i trusted bush to only grab the terrorists i never trusted bush to do anything
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:35.120]  and so it was it was i think it was a willful misquote and what it does is make me look like a
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:40.400]  political hack and make me look like i'm just another republican that doesn't like the fact that
[03:26:40.400 --> 03:26:44.640]  throughout of power and so it's very much you've always been critical of bush i've been interviewing
[03:26:44.640 --> 03:26:49.680]  you for what almost three years now i mean this is from since the time you started this is pure
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:56.000]  deception you needed to to demand a retraction i did i emailed her and she said she would fix it
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:27:00.640]  and i haven't seen a retraction yet so but that's but that's how they do it they want to
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:05.360]  but it's once more the divided conquer they're not even walk people on the political left
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:11.040]  to understand that there are people on the political right who are consistent and they
[03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:16.960]  have good will like i heard i heard an interview uh with nemy wolf a few weeks ago she's fairly
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:22.480]  consistent she actually defended the g parties and and she's saying look they do have some points
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:27.760]  and all the powers that bush put in place are still there and so there are people of good will
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:33.040]  on both the so-called left and the so-called right but they don't want each camp to know that
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:38.480]  they want you all to divide and conquer and hate each other as though you were just opposing sports
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:43.920]  teams you know and sports fans and that's what the republicans are doing uh right now they've come
[03:27:43.920 --> 03:27:48.960]  in and take try to take over the tea parties so that so that democrats and others don't join to
[03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:53.920]  have a true populist constitutional movement that's right they don't think they want to be
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:28:00.320]  um about gop and and just to steer you back into voting for them they don't want to be a populist
[03:28:00.320 --> 03:28:05.040]  or a an independent movement many americans now are registering independent i just heard
[03:28:05.040 --> 03:28:09.280]  say things happening in the military in fact i was talking to a guy from army times uh just
[03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:13.200]  yesterday i've been interviewing with them tomorrow and he was saying that the new phenomena
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:18.800]  in the military is that more and more of them are registering as independent and that is gotta be
[03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:26.320]  scaring that the deal two-headed monster and so they're going to try to stage and provocateur
[03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:31.200]  events to demonize us so the american people don't get together because they're gearing up for their
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:36.560]  total financial collapse they think they're going to be able to win but i'm seeing the confidence
[03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:43.280]  drain out of their eyes drain out of their faces and and just bleed out of their spirit they are
[03:28:43.280 --> 03:28:49.920]  losing the initiative well of course the big danger is like a corner rat that's when they become
[03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:55.520]  more dangerous in some way it's got to be going on shows but a good sign is like the uh i got an
[03:28:55.520 --> 03:29:01.680]  article i've interviewed with um with common common dreams of coming out and also the one
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:06.480]  just came out with raw story so there are some people on so-called political left who are starting
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:12.160]  to reach out to people like me and like you um on so-called right and trying to find that common
[03:29:12.160 --> 03:29:17.360]  ground because they understand what's going on they look at the banksters and what they did during
[03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:20.880]  during the obama administration and the bush administration they understand that nothing's
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:28.160]  really changed yeah i mean actually a lot of neocons are praising obama for wars torture
[03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:36.080]  secret arrest military tribunals uh so i tell democrats i mean if you like obama you should
[03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:42.640]  absolutely love bush uh and it's no surprise the neocons don't like us at all either i mean
[03:29:42.640 --> 03:29:47.120]  it's not like john you certainly is not going to be happy about oath keepers well stay there stay

[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:26.960]  out uh well that sounds extreme that an evil campers we've got to watch them uh you were going
[03:35:26.960 --> 03:35:31.040]  to make a point about reaching out more to the military staying on mission you were telling me
[03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:34.640]  how they're trying to infiltrate you guys off air how they're trying to set you up but it's not
[03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:40.080]  going to work staying on mission tell us about the billboard well we want to focus in right on
[03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:44.800]  the combat brigade at fort steward georgia which has been the one attached to the north com for the
[03:35:44.800 --> 03:35:48.720]  first of a third infantry division and so we're going to put the billboard up in front of in front
[03:35:48.720 --> 03:35:53.520]  of their kitboarders in front of their base that this is on your own or remember your own
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:58.960]  and point them to our website when they go there we're going to have an online hose keepers university
[03:35:58.960 --> 03:36:04.320]  they can plug into and just learn all the no nonsense stuff they should have learned in high
[03:36:04.320 --> 03:36:08.960]  school they should have learned from their command but they're not being taught state sovereignty
[03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:13.760]  respectful of rights the fundamental structure of our of our of our constitution republic
[03:36:13.760 --> 03:36:19.760]  and that billboard will get media attention it'll get all the troops talking about it it'll get a
[03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:24.320]  dialogue with the officers talking about it and all of you as listeners who have friends family
[03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:29.040]  neighbors who are in the armed services or who are police officers you are in a key position
[03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:34.080]  to reach out to them and educate them with films like police state for the rise of fema that documents
[03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:39.680]  and proves just how evil this globalist takeover is and how they plan to use the police and military
[03:36:39.680 --> 03:36:46.400]  to carry this out before we go to calls one other point we need a public above board group that's
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:51.440]  mainstream and just calls for the bill of rights and constitution and defense of the republic against
[03:36:51.440 --> 03:36:56.400]  gun confiscation to just educate the military and the feds hate that that's why they're trying
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:02.080]  to infiltrate you trying to rattle collage you if people want to be secretive and individual
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:10.320]  that's good but we also need a public arm to reach out and educate people uh and that's just the way
[03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:17.280]  it historically works that's the winning combination and so i just commend you stewart
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:23.200]  roads for staying on message and that's why the system is so scared of you and we have to think
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:28.800]  is we're disciplined enough that they they have to go and stuff up about us because we're not making
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:34.240]  it easy for them to attack us we're doing this we possibly can but i make mistakes once in a while
[03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:40.880]  but i i i do my best to get back on mission and focus on the current survey and if they do what's
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:46.000]  right then we will win so they can't do without well they don't want it to be made they don't
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:50.960]  want it to be mainstream to be constitutional and bill of rights and mom and apple pie they want to
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:57.120]  make it dirty and secretive so they can tell the public oh look this is secretive that's right
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:00.720]  that's what that's what i think that's what it's like just a balladato but here's a guy
[03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:06.800]  a straight way so you can get a judge what respected judge um you know for years he's
[03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:12.480]  criticized bush he criticized the obama he's a pure constitutionalist and yet he's on the hit list
[03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:17.600]  or something probably lost there and it's absurd yeah they're really discrediting themselves
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:22.800]  let's talk to bev and canada you're on the air go ahead hi alex thanks for taking my call
[03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:29.840]  uh we love you up here in canada i'm canadian my father's american who served two tours in vietnam
[03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:36.800]  i'm wondering why can we not you know we can't force these people to the billboard but we can
[03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:43.040]  reach out with recordings from oath keepers why can oath keepers not record for us a good copy
[03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:48.960]  recording for playing for officers and soldiers uh saying their oath so that we can continuously
[03:38:48.960 --> 03:38:56.240]  play this during peaceful protests at the g8 yes well ma'am ma'am the the uh extra uh on um
[03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:03.440]  fall the republic is the oath keepers giving the oath and explaining it in what a uh little
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:09.520]  15 minute video and they do have videos that i've seen where they're reciting uh the oath in the
[03:39:09.520 --> 03:39:15.680]  code don't you us do it we do have some but but she definitely writes it's a very powerful medium
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:21.680]  and we want to get more uh video testimonials so i do encourage people to you know throw it
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:27.600]  up on youtube make one and well listen listen i mean i can do it tomorrow i can uh you know
[03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:33.760]  read in a broadcaster voice the declaration of orders we will not obey i i can read that and
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:40.880]  then put say you know drum beat music to it i mean again this is a team effort this is not
[03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:47.120]  top down right story obviously not and we really want those i think she's talking about uh veterans
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:52.880]  and current serving um talking about their oath and and and pledging themselves and reaffirming
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:59.120]  their oath what exactly are you saying ma'am need to remind the officers on the line that are bashing
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:05.760]  their shields towards us what their oaths really are pertaining to it's not for these corporations
[03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:10.560]  or the government it's pertaining to we the people regardless of if we're in the u.s or if
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:15.040]  we're in canada no i know but specifically what are you calling for i mean are you saying
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:20.320]  a recording that that can be played at events of the oath what are you saying yeah well they're
[03:40:20.320 --> 03:40:26.320]  hitting us with sound waves why don't we retaliate with hitting them with what our rights are what
[03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:31.840]  they made a nose towards us well lucrodowski did do that in pittsburgh and he got arrested and so
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:36.240]  did rob do for no reason and those police when they were going into even the university and
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:41.120]  attacking peaceful groups of people and attacking old ladies with police dogs uh you've seen that
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:45.840]  footage stewart do you think that was a violation of the military and police oath that what you saw
[03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:52.000]  in pittsburgh absolutely and luc did a great job i mean he's he's one of our forum um uh
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:57.040]  forum users and he did a great job of trying to do that but it's tough to do that on the spot
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:02.000]  i'm not saying you shouldn't do it but our goal is to reach them before they're suited up and
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:06.480]  before they're put that mindset you want to reach them before they're out there on the line yep
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:11.120]  but everyone's got to do their fights their own way so she's she's more than welcome to to you know
[03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:17.520]  get that tactic and try and luc did his best so i'm not not knocking it absolutely he just peacefully
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:22.240]  with a bullhorn as they were beating people said please follow your oath and and so they arrested
[03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:26.240]  him and then tortured him at a military facility they took him to an old prison room of the military
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:31.600]  and tort and beat him up and tortured him uh let's go ahead and talk to a general in california
[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:36.160]  you're on the air go ahead
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:40.560]  okay he just dropped off cliff in kansas you're on the air with steward roads of
[03:41:40.560 --> 03:41:46.480]  healthkeepers.org go ahead cliff i just want to make a couple statements basically um i do appreciate
[03:41:46.480 --> 03:41:51.600]  you guys what you're doing i think uh a lot of what is happening too you know i'm just i live here
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:56.400]  in little old kansas and uh we're starting to see a lot more of the police state stuff going on and
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:01.280]  in uh of course trying to educate people on that i really appreciate you guys giving us your
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:06.320]  you know your hard work and stuff and we take your stuff and give it out to people that kind of blows
[03:42:06.320 --> 03:42:11.600]  my mind how people uh i mean even people that are supposed christians and in the military
[03:42:11.600 --> 03:42:17.040]  and stuff like that they're they've really worked hard at brainwashing these people you know i mean
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:22.880]  you gotta you think you're overcoming years of of propaganda machine working hard on these people
[03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:27.040]  and my family they're kind of starting to really open up a lot of stuff but uh well it takes time
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:34.480]  and listen to this uh uh cliff again you plant the seeds and then when they see the tyranny later
[03:42:34.480 --> 03:42:43.360]  they will sprout don't expect an immediate response uh in fact and i appreciate your call cliff
[03:42:44.080 --> 03:42:49.680]  going back to steward roads your comment on that steward absolutely i mean he's right it's it's
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:54.720]  it's been a long time conditioning and it is definitely difficult to to counter it but you
[03:42:54.720 --> 03:42:59.600]  gotta do something and it is making an effect i mean i know it's making an effect otherwise you
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:04.800]  would be attacking me and so and you're having an effect we're all of us working together we are
[03:43:04.800 --> 03:43:10.080]  having an effect and given enough time we will win and they know that that's why they're worried
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:14.160]  that's why they're doing they're pulling out every druid trick we possibly can to shut us down
[03:43:14.160 --> 03:43:18.240]  but i don't think it's gonna succeed well they're like chickens with their heads cut off i mean i
[03:43:18.240 --> 03:43:23.200]  don't even watch much tv but i'll be at my parents house or my grandma's they got the tv on i randomly
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:29.600]  turn the tv on this weekend all they talk about is demonizing americans that want freedom demonizing
[03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:34.240]  americans that want liberty i've talked to so many military people and police in these briefings when
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:39.680]  they specifically demonize me by name and and you know say i'm the worst and the most dangerous
[03:43:39.680 --> 03:43:43.760]  and that i want them dead and i hate them well the military and police then go and actually
[03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:49.760]  hear what i have to say so i also see their demonization backfiring steward absolutely it is
[03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:55.200]  i mean they're now demonizing basically leased half the country it's not it's not three quarters
[03:43:55.200 --> 03:44:00.480]  of the country and anyone who believes in america they're demonizing and if they're jumping the shark
[03:44:00.480 --> 03:44:05.600]  they're just going so far it's becoming absurd well they're really showing us that they are that
[03:44:05.600 --> 03:44:10.080]  the people running the government really are the bad guys i mean here they are saying that
[03:44:10.080 --> 03:44:16.320]  that the traditional good guys are bad and and i really think it's but they've got so much arrogance
[03:44:16.320 --> 03:44:24.880]  so much hubris that i but as i said now it's hubris is giving way to desperation final question
[03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:30.000]  steward how do you think the cornered rat is going to strike back well i really worry about
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:34.960]  economic collapse i think i think dr evan vieris was correct he wrote last month i believe
[03:44:34.960 --> 03:44:39.680]  where he said that that's our greatest weakness we don't have sound money and we don't have a
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:45.520]  militia in our states to to fill the vacuum or help assist the police during an emergency and
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:51.520]  some people are susceptible if there's an economic collapse many americans may may ask a clamor for
[03:44:51.520 --> 03:44:56.080]  FEMA to come in and so that's a that's a great concern i have is that's where you know under
[03:44:56.080 --> 03:45:01.600]  those conditions you might get more of the military and police going along because believe in their
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:07.440]  heart it's a it's a true emergency and you might get many americans who are who are asking for the
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:13.280]  for the federal government step in so it's a very serious uh a chilly feel for us now notice the
[03:45:13.280 --> 03:45:18.800]  conditioning's really intensifying the government's your mommy it's going to protect you and fema for
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:24.800]  years says get ready bad things are coming be prepared so that when it happens they say see
[03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:30.560]  we told you uh it's incredible steward roads we appreciate your courage and the great effect
[03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:35.760]  that you're happening with oath uh keepers dot org and we appreciate you going through the storm
[03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:41.360]  and we're all here right beside you uh together and as you said all of us working you know towards
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:46.800]  liberty and freedom and to warn people and to put out an alternative to tyranny to to tell people
[03:45:46.800 --> 03:45:52.400]  the other side of the story the rest of the story as paul harvey would say uh in the end
[03:45:52.400 --> 03:45:59.040]  we're going to win history shows that a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man on the right
[03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:03.680]  who keeps on a common we have to keep on a common and whatever happens to you individually or me
[03:46:03.680 --> 03:46:10.480]  individually or ron paul or judge napolitano or anybody else regardless in the end the message
[03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:17.600]  of freedom and liberty is bulletproof it it is transcendent and again i salute you go with god
[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:24.960]  my friend vacadios like last couple us thank you so much sir okay you know i'll have to do this tomorrow
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:32.720]  because i said that i was going to get into race-based politics and there's so many facets to this
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:41.120]  this morning i happened to just run across some la raza and matcha videos and saying we're
[03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:46.000]  going to take over the u.s and all hispanics are for basically killing the whitey and which
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:52.720]  isn't true it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy but white people hear this then they get radicalized
[03:46:53.200 --> 03:46:57.680]  hispanics then go well i guess this is the way it's going i better you know choose a side the
[03:46:57.680 --> 03:47:02.400]  media says you know all hispanics want open borders when polls show upwards of 80 percent of american
[03:47:02.400 --> 03:47:06.000]  hispanics they're not they're not stupid they're smart they know it's killing their jobs their
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:10.880]  future they know there's 600 million people in latin america they can all come here and they've
[03:47:10.880 --> 03:47:16.960]  got common sense and so they're invoking this invoking this but then i ran across a video clip
[03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:25.920]  i've seen years ago and i've seen a lot of this talk by comma cam bonds most excellent speech is
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:34.800]  the name of the youtube video from c span not pronouncing that right uh comma or comma how do
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:44.560]  you say it kamu kabon and i mean this guy said he was a big professor and i don't have time now to

[03:48:03.280 --> 03:48:09.040]  government funded lorazo stuff not because they ever intend to have some mecha group actually
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:13.360]  take over the us they want us all having a war with each other then the feds play the part
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:20.400]  of the referee of the arbiter of the group that comes in and saves us from ourselves but i ran
[03:48:20.400 --> 03:48:26.480]  into this video and everything he says in the first part of the video is true the government's
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:33.040]  poisoning your food your water your vaccines their shipping drugs into the country uh the banking
[03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:40.000]  system is meant to make you a slave but then he says white people are the ones that invented this
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:49.600]  and run this and white people are a cancer and all white people must be killed and you
[03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:53.840]  and you remember khalid muhammad uh the black panther leader who would say we kill the men we
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:57.680]  kill the women we kill the babies oh we kill the little babies you bet what you do because they're
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:01.520]  going to grow up to be you know devils and we kill the white women because of the military
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:09.280]  manufacturing center i mean you've all heard it but here he is in this group of uh of black
[03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:14.400]  academics and they're not in their head and and and and agreeing and getting tears in their eyes
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:21.120]  with this exultation to kill whitey and then i come out and i say i'm against that well then see
[03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:29.600]  i'm i'm the blue-eyed devil this is asinine ladies and gentlemen but the point is the media comes
[03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:35.760]  out and says this is all condonable this is all okay this is good you know when the illegals set
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:41.120]  fire to restaurants and attack people with torches last weekend it's only in a few california tv
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:45.200]  stations and the tv stations interview people that say well they have a reason to be mad i think it's
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:50.720]  good but again then they lie about oath keepers and all these other groups that are totally
[03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:56.160]  inclusive and want everyone to join and to be part of the fight for freedom and property rights and
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:04.400]  what produces so much wealth and we're called racist i mean again it the people posing as the
[03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:08.880]  anti-racist they are the racist and i'm not even talking about this black professor saying kill
[03:50:08.880 --> 03:50:17.840]  every white on the planet but see it's true that age was created to kill third world populations

[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:33.760]  in every major study that it was meant for everybody you think a white cop or do you think
[03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:39.440]  a white judge or do you think a white talk show host gets a memo saying hey don't drink the water
[03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:45.600]  pal you're white no no i mean there's a little white kids all over austin dying from vaccines

[03:54:19.440 --> 03:54:26.160]  guy walked by the car but look i'll talk more about this tomorrow i've studied anthropology
[03:54:26.160 --> 03:54:30.720]  i've studied archaeology i've studied just basic history the japanese ruling class
[03:54:31.360 --> 03:54:36.560]  enslaved their underclass and had laws in place where samurai could kill anybody they
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:42.000]  wanted anytime they wanted for no reason and the people were slaves the chinese ruling class
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:47.280]  enslaved chinese black tribes always enslaved their neighbors arab groups always enslaved their
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:53.440]  neighbors uh most of slaves the roman empire were white from what's france and germany today gall
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:55:02.320]  and germanium this is how it works okay groups come in and they enslave other groups but that's
[03:55:02.320 --> 03:55:06.720]  not taught you know we're taught oh the founding fathers are back and some of them own slaves
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:12.160]  yeah and most of us spoke out against it and it was being phased out at the time that doesn't
[03:55:12.160 --> 03:55:18.320]  matter that was the history they were in that's like saying mexico owns texas to california
[03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:23.600]  in all states in between up to colorona mexico had a few forts here couldn't hold any of it
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:28.720]  mexico was more racist towards the native groups and still are today they have the same
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:33.200]  extermination programs i'm not saying that's good it's bad it's bad that both groups did it
[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:37.280]  this but but it's that we had a free market system here to some extent
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:43.200]  that created all this wealth okay i'm gonna go ahead and play this black professor who talks about
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:52.640]  how white people are running this no evil people are running this every government on earth
[03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:57.760]  tries similar things it's that europe had the renaissance had more freedom than any other
[03:55:57.760 --> 03:56:02.960]  culture and so it produced the most wealth then evil people took over and had that wealthy system
[03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:09.360]  and were able to dominate with it that's why freedom created a war chest for evil to fund
[03:56:09.360 --> 03:56:14.880]  its operations that's what's going on and why didn't this guy tell black people not abort their
[03:56:14.880 --> 03:56:20.560]  kids 50 plus percent kill me let's go out of the show with this disgusting clip saying exterminate
[03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:26.800]  white people and this is main line i would say in about five six seven percent of the black
[03:56:26.800 --> 03:56:31.520]  population in this country this is very popular kill why and they say it all over the message
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:36.800]  boards on my website they say kill whites and we'll be safe yeah right you go to africa and see
[03:56:36.800 --> 03:56:43.360]  how those tribes treat you they don't know you you'll be their slave tomorrow here it is now what
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:53.600]  we have to do is we have to devise a system or a plan for ourselves and i said earlier that each
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:59.760]  one of you is a system and everything that you do every thought that you think either you are
[03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:08.000]  supporting white world terror domination by your actions what you buy what you wear where you go
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:13.520]  what you eat how you use your time you are either supporting the white people in their
[03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:20.800]  process of death or your for african liberation is one of the other and if we don't use our time
[03:57:21.760 --> 03:57:29.520]  wisely then we are engaging in a form of subtle suicide because as i said earlier
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:33.920]  their system is still going on they still have these images on tv that are going on
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:37.760]  they're still where it has now children in the special ed giving them riddling
[03:57:38.480 --> 03:57:45.520]  that no jobs we fill in the hospitals so their system is not stopping and then finally i want
[03:57:45.520 --> 03:57:52.640]  to say that we need one idea and we're not thinking about a solution to the problem
[03:57:52.640 --> 03:57:58.800]  we're dealing with all these other things but these are diversions from the solution to the problem
[03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:05.360]  and we have to start to think about a solution to the problem so that these young brothers and
[03:58:05.360 --> 03:58:13.040]  sisters who are here now who are 15 16 and 17 are not here 25 years later talking about these same
[03:58:13.040 --> 03:58:19.200]  problems now how do i know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution
[03:58:19.200 --> 03:58:25.920]  to the problem i know it because they have retina scans they have what they call ratio profile
[03:58:26.560 --> 03:58:31.760]  dna bank all right folks we ran out of time i'm gonna have the it i'll play it tomorrow he says
[03:58:31.760 --> 03:58:36.160]  exterminate all white people and it's been on the news you know about it but the globalists
[03:58:36.160 --> 03:58:50.000]  are doing it to everybody see he's divided and conquered
