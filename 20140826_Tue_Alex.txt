[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:38.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.480]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and broadcasting worldwide on this 26th the
[00:43.480 --> 00:51.520]  day of August 2014 edition Larry elders indicated talk show host who's been
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.920]  eloquently exposing what's really happening it's really going on in
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.880]  Ferguson and other hot spots around the country will be popping in for 30
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.440]  minutes we're also going to be talking to Leanne McAdoo and John Bowne who are
[01:06.440 --> 01:17.080]  reporting from the epicenter of the six point one earthquake that hit and even
[01:17.080 --> 01:22.160]  mainline analysts are saying is a harbinger of much larger earthquakes and
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.680]  we have top regulators saying that there are many reactors in southern and
[01:27.680 --> 01:33.120]  northern California that if they're hit by a seven point zero or more will
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.440]  probably melt down and explode so we're going to be talking to folks on the
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.720]  street see if they're concerned about that because why build reactors on a
[01:43.720 --> 01:49.680]  fault line and in a tsunami zone why build reactors on one of the biggest
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.920]  most unstable fault lines in the world out in California not just the San
[01:55.920 --> 02:02.200]  Andreas fault line but others we're gonna be looking at that today also we're
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.320]  gonna be looking at the latest on Islamic State now we're hearing they got
[02:06.320 --> 02:12.960]  some type of stinger missiles from Syria not from Benghazi not from our
[02:12.960 --> 02:18.000]  traitorous government and that Obama wants to bomb Syria to protect the
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.840]  world from ISIS directly out of 1984 we've always been at war with Eurasia
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.080]  we've always been at war with East Asia we've never been at war with Eurasia
[02:30.080 --> 02:38.840]  war is peace that's a quote from a radio broadcast in 1984 we're mid-sentence
[02:38.840 --> 02:44.680]  we've got to attack Assad he's evil he's horrible we've got a bomb Syria to
[02:44.680 --> 02:50.720]  protect Assad he's wonderful Putin is right on and on and on it is total
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.160]  manipulation I want to break that down also Bill Gates his wife and he donate
[02:56.160 --> 03:00.880]  1 million to just one gun control initiative in Washington state they're
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.240]  doing this all over the country but this is in the Associated Press so I thought
[03:05.240 --> 03:09.080]  I'd point out what Warren Buffett and people are up to Warren Buffett speaking
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.480]  of that is helping Greece the skids and financing moving Burger King ownership
[03:15.480 --> 03:25.880]  and Burger King I guess you'd say where it's based to Canada and that's the type
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.680]  of thing that upsets the public Warren Buffett that's all he does he's the guy
[03:31.680 --> 03:37.040]  with George Soros that financed the killing of the Keystone pipeline so
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.000]  that Canadian oil would not be brought down through pipelines the United States
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.360]  to lower our prices but that it would be shipped by train which he makes money
[03:45.360 --> 03:50.240]  off of Soros to Canada's West Coast loaded on super tankers and taken to
[03:50.240 --> 03:57.440]  Japan and China so how does Warren Buffett make money by controlling
[03:57.440 --> 04:03.200]  government regulators shutting down his competition how does general electric
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.920]  make money they go out and have federal regulators shut down the power plants
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.160]  they don't own what happens then they can up capacity and charge you more
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.160]  because there's not what did John D Rockefeller the first call it a sin
[04:19.160 --> 04:26.160]  there's no sin there's no heresy there's no heretics here in the New
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.960]  World Order competition is a sin then they blame the collapsing system on
[04:31.960 --> 04:39.240]  capitalism when what did what did George Arwell who was MI6 will OSS what did he
[04:39.240 --> 04:46.120]  call it what did he call the system we're under he had a name he had a name
[04:46.120 --> 04:54.000]  for it and we're gonna be going over that coming up today but it is

[08:43.800 --> 08:51.480]  Tuesday the 26th day of August 2014 I am your host Alex Jones the news websites
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.400]  are info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[08:56.400 --> 09:03.080]  there's a lot of news obviously to cover today from new anti-gun initiatives
[09:03.080 --> 09:09.880]  here in the United States to the latest migration of corporations from the
[09:09.880 --> 09:16.240]  United States with Burger King leaving working with Warren Buffett to transfer
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.560]  itself to Canada we have the feds announcing you will not be allowed to
[09:21.560 --> 09:28.680]  board an airplane by 2016 without a national ID card that dovetails with the
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.480]  illegals allowed to fly without IDs we're going to be breaking it all down
[09:34.480 --> 09:41.040]  here today but first off if you just tuned in we intro to the transmission
[09:41.040 --> 09:53.520]  with a movie trailer for 1984 the 1950s version based on the 1948 book by Eric
[09:53.520 --> 09:59.480]  Blair pen name George Orwell he came from an elite technocratic science
[09:59.480 --> 10:05.360]  family was in British intelligence and then in propaganda at the BBC during
[10:05.360 --> 10:14.560]  World War two and the book itself is a decoding by an interparty member of
[10:14.560 --> 10:26.920]  exactly the Ingsock or Thabian socialist mindset for the world and Orwell
[10:26.920 --> 10:31.960]  before he died about a year after publishing the book wrote essays that
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.280]  you can pull up online or buy in different volumes where he pointed out
[10:36.280 --> 10:42.160]  that the book is what he believed the world would end up looking like you can
[10:42.160 --> 10:49.080]  then also hear a famous speech he gave trouble before his death in 1962 in
[10:49.080 --> 10:56.280]  Berkeley by Aldous Huxley who wrote Brave New World describing the fact that he
[10:56.280 --> 11:02.600]  and Orwell debated which future would become reality and Huxley said that it
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.520]  would be his future of the technotronic genetically engineered drugged population
[11:09.520 --> 11:14.840]  but you have to understand when you read Brave New World written in 1932 and you
[11:14.840 --> 11:19.200]  think man a lot of this has come true when you read 1984 with black
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.160]  helicopters flying around looking through your windows and microphones hidden
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.520]  in your walls and on street corners inside lamppost you have to understand
[11:27.520 --> 11:34.360]  both men worked in the highest levels of global government both men were Thabian
[11:34.360 --> 11:42.120]  socialist in the inner halls of the elite Huxley's brother Julian ran the UN's
[11:42.120 --> 11:48.360]  UNESCO program as director general and so when you read those there's a reason
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.040]  you see so many movies and so many other books basically based on that template
[11:54.040 --> 12:02.440]  because you're reading a parable or a gestalt a revelation of the method of
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.840]  what is going to be done to you now Orwell said he was against it Huxley would
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.080]  say I'm against it if you're good enough to stop it and then he laughed at the
[12:14.080 --> 12:21.080]  graduate students the PhD students people going for their PhDs you hear the
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.400]  whole hour-long speech at Berkeley and basically said I don't think you're
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.960]  smart enough to do anything about this you'll probably just go along with it
[12:28.960 --> 12:33.560]  so they have this weird rule where they've got to tell you what they're
[12:33.560 --> 12:42.120]  doing to you before they do it just like in metaphysical laws in the
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.720]  allegory of the vampire which is where the allegory of the sociopath the
[12:45.720 --> 12:52.120]  allegory of the psychopath the allegory of the borderline personality disorder and
[12:52.120 --> 13:01.640]  and that whole constellation of anti-human humans they've got a hey I'm
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.160]  here next-door neighbor would you like to invite me in for tea
[13:07.160 --> 13:16.960]  yeah come on in they've got to tell you what they're going to do that's why
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.360]  there's hundreds of movies and hundreds of books and more than 10 TV shows the
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.600]  last decade where the end of humans the world without us book on tape how
[13:26.600 --> 13:31.960]  beautiful how wonderful you there's too many of us I mean who can deny we the
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.520]  work the earth would be better off without all these people getting us to accept
[13:37.520 --> 13:50.200]  this brave news slash 1984 slash THX 1138 slash hunger game when you read the
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.600]  UN biological diversity assessment the full document I have screenshots of it
[13:55.600 --> 14:07.040]  in my 1996 TV show but also in the film in game 2001 where I mean I zoom in on
[14:07.040 --> 14:13.160]  it on the document I show it to you where they say we may just use war to
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.240]  exterminate most the people are a bio weapon or we may have like a Logan's
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.640]  run type deal where you have a lottery for who gets killed or we may just go
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.880]  like with the Aztecs and have ritualized sacrifice cities that's probably the
[14:25.880 --> 14:32.840]  best model with these big execution games like the Romans had when you read
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.400]  the biological diversity assessment and what they propose for the new culture
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.960]  it's hunger games districts and only certain districts are allowed to
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.640]  produce certain goods so the globalist control all the districts and all the
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.720]  districts need each other so that we then need the elite because they are the
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.560]  only ones that know how to run the interlocking districts you see that in
[14:54.560 --> 15:03.760]  the film with James Kahn from the mid-1970s rollerball where each district
[15:03.760 --> 15:15.080]  is run by a main city and one city is energy one is technology one is
[15:15.080 --> 15:22.440]  military that's globalism that's the modern mercantilism system where they
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.200]  would not let things like the colonies in 1770 or so produce any finished
[15:28.200 --> 15:34.520]  goods that all the raw goods had to be sent back to London England where they
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.320]  were then finished so that they had dominance and control over the world
[15:39.320 --> 15:45.520]  of course you don't let people have their own factories so that's the system
[15:45.520 --> 15:58.520]  that we're going under and the reason I open the broadcast today with 1984 is
[15:58.520 --> 16:06.400]  because if you look at what's happening in the news just a year ago in fact
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.840]  less than a year ago last summer at the end of summer and into September and
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.280]  into October they were on the news saying we've got to attack Syria right now
[16:17.280 --> 16:21.720]  or they're going to attack the United States or Israel when Syria was doing
[16:21.720 --> 16:27.720]  nothing and we've got to take the government out and then now a year later
[16:27.720 --> 16:32.480]  we're being told we've got to take out and have bombings inside Syria because
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.400]  Assad and Putin were right about ISIS being bad we've got to bomb them and
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.760]  then we're being told oh my gosh ISIS broke into Syrian military bases they
[16:41.760 --> 16:46.920]  have M-pad Stinger missiles no they got those from the West but now everyone's
[16:46.920 --> 16:50.720]  going to ask why did the Al Qaeda people that's who they are have the
[16:50.720 --> 16:56.480]  stingers oh they got them from Assad see we've got to go in and bomb these bases
[16:56.480 --> 17:02.560]  because Al Qaeda is in them this is how dumb they think you are here are the
[17:02.560 --> 17:09.160]  headlines Islamic State might have taken advance M-pads from Syrian airfield
[17:09.480 --> 17:16.400]  that's in the Associated Press ISIS demands 6.6 million ransom for 26 year
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.760]  old American woman oh we've got to do something Louis Gohmert warns of terrorist
[17:20.760 --> 17:25.880]  threat along Texas Mexico border US forces move into Syria Obama paves ways
[17:25.880 --> 17:35.160]  for airstrikes sending in surveillance jets despite Assad warning that any
[17:35.160 --> 17:40.400]  attack will be seen as aggression oh yeah they'll bomb Assad forces who are
[17:40.400 --> 17:44.600]  fighting ISIS because they know the public is so not even dumbed down but
[17:44.600 --> 17:51.480]  just so accustomed to being lied to with this little quote we've always been at
[17:51.480 --> 17:56.680]  war with Eurasia we've always been at war with East Asia we've never been at
[17:56.680 --> 18:03.720]  war in Eurasia and that's from 1984 as Winston is listening to a radio
[18:03.720 --> 18:11.600]  broadcast in his kitchen and they change midstream just to train the public to
[18:11.600 --> 18:16.920]  live in fantasy land what does Obama say two plus two equals five that's taught
[18:16.920 --> 18:25.080]  in school perpetual war 1984 there is a perpetual war among Oceania Eurasia and
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.440]  East Asia the super stage which emerged from the atomic global war the book the
[18:29.440 --> 18:35.720]  theory and practice of oligarchal collectivism by Emmanuel Goldstein which
[18:35.720 --> 18:42.120]  is really what 1984 is it is the book explaining oligarchal collectivism and
[18:42.120 --> 18:47.240]  and and Orwell's telling you that in the book explains that each state is so
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.440]  strong it cannot be defeated even with the combined forces of the two super
[18:50.440 --> 18:55.280]  states despite changing alliances to hide such contradictions history is
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.520]  rewritten to explain that the new alliance always has been so and that
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.160]  populaces are accustomed to double think and accept it so they practice lies
[19:04.160 --> 19:09.600]  openly training you the war is not fought in Oceania Eurasia or East Asia
[19:09.600 --> 19:14.800]  territory but in the Arctic waste and other disputed zones just like we fight
[19:14.800 --> 19:21.280]  the Middle East the sea and land in North Africa and Australia at the start
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.680]  Oceania and East Asia are allies combating Eurasia in northern Africa and
[19:25.680 --> 19:30.440]  the Malabar Coast that alliance ends at Oceania allied with Eurasia fights East
[19:30.440 --> 19:34.840]  Asia a change which occurred during the hate week dedicated to creating
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.680]  patriotic fervor for the party's perpetual war the public are blind to
[19:38.680 --> 19:42.600]  the change in mid-sentence an orator changes the name of the enemy from
[19:42.600 --> 19:47.400]  Eurasia to East Asia without pause we've always been at war with East Asia

[24:27.320 --> 24:34.480]  greasy Burger King to quit USA over taxes Buffett to finance the move and the
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.880]  12 or 11 million dollar purchase of the Canadian company they're buying US tax
[24:39.880 --> 24:48.360]  rate over 40% versus Canada's 26 that's right
[24:48.560 --> 24:54.840]  hatch the senators calling for an overall Canadians are squeamish over
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.720]  takeover well it's going home Burger King's always been a Britishly held
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.960]  company I'm not against the British I'm on an England file either but the Queen
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.440]  of England divested five years ago in her majority ownership of it so the pun
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.400]  is really true that it is a royal company just like Dutch Royal Shell and BP are
[25:18.400 --> 25:22.040]  both majority owned by the Queen of England the other owner is then her
[25:22.040 --> 25:26.800]  cousin Queen Beatrix I'm not kidding you can't make this stuff up but their
[25:26.800 --> 25:32.080]  state money is a state secret and of course their tax exempt you know who
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.600]  else is tax exempt of course that's Warren Buffett most of his companies are
[25:36.600 --> 25:40.880]  already tax exempt that's why he's the biggest lobbyists in the US on record
[25:40.880 --> 25:47.400]  underwriting this week on ABC News and other programs on CNN I see news articles
[25:47.400 --> 25:50.800]  all the time and read the bottom and it's finance by Bill and Melinda Gates
[25:50.800 --> 25:56.960]  Foundation that he heads up and then he's given about 40 billion to tax free so
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.280]  he can then leverage out all the other businesses he only gives the profit
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.320]  ladies and gentlemen into those companies and then uses it to be able to
[26:04.320 --> 26:13.720]  take over other companies so continuing these are not the altruistic people that
[26:13.720 --> 26:20.440]  they claim they are you always read on elitist bios that they are what's the
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.360]  term you use for somebody that gives money as their profession yes yes a
[26:26.360 --> 26:29.680]  philanthropic philanthropist I was having one of those brain
[26:29.680 --> 26:35.120]  flatulations as they call it here's just an example today they've been doing
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.280]  this since the 80s most of the IRS criminal investigators go after blue
[26:40.280 --> 26:45.280]  collar you can look that up they're almost no white collar investigators the
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.580]  few that are there are used politically to target libertarians and
[26:48.580 --> 26:53.200]  conservatives and and family held companies that aren't globalist you
[26:53.200 --> 26:59.680]  merge with a globalist company you play ball with them you get left alone your
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.960]  company gets bought out by a big globalist company that's one of the
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.240]  fringe benefits you still get to head it up you still get your paycheck you lay
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.920]  off most your employees and then you don't have to pay taxes anymore you're
[27:11.920 --> 27:15.520]  just left alone that's why it's come out in the news that over half of Congress
[27:15.520 --> 27:22.960]  doesn't pay taxes or is a decade or more behind see that's a 1984 folks where
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.680]  where Warren Buffett is constantly hyping raising taxes on quote rich
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.440]  people he means people making a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.200]  or more that's the middle class the upper middle class for most people that's
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.640]  the folks that actually keep the economy going that group is dwindling Warren
[27:39.640 --> 27:49.040]  Buffett is in a jihad or I guess you'd use the term crusade an all-out war on
[27:49.040 --> 27:55.000]  the middle class and he gives money hundreds of millions to abortion every
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.880]  decade hundreds of millions to gun control do you know who the biggest
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.600]  financiers because I read who underwrites the violence policy center handgun

[28:09.520 --> 28:13.720]  turn it blue and take the guns Warren Buffett Bill Gates but you never hear of
[28:13.720 --> 28:17.920]  the big national talk show I was talking about somebody say you don't mess with the
[28:17.920 --> 28:27.820]  big king pence I mean here's a KOMO news AP article Bill Gates and his wife

[34:02.600 --> 34:08.360]  Oklahoma City with a big new affiliate that is coming up so get your pens and
[34:08.360 --> 34:16.200]  paper ready for that information I want to go to our reporters who are on the
[34:16.200 --> 34:26.840]  ground in Napa Valley where as you know that earthquake hit on Sunday here are
[34:26.840 --> 34:33.640]  some of the headlines dealing with that this is out of Reuters today and this is
[34:33.640 --> 34:40.000]  why I sent our reporters out there to begin with because I was aware of this
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.840]  information US inspector wanted reactors shut down on quake fears report a
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.320]  federal nuclear inspector urged US regulators to shut down a California
[34:53.320 --> 34:58.840]  nuclear power plant until tests showed its reactors could withstand shocks from
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.160]  nearby earthquake faults according to the Associated Press and an
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.080]  environmental group William Peck's calls to close the Diablo Canyon power plant
[35:09.080 --> 35:13.240]  in St. Louis Obispo County that'll love the name of where it's at the oblo
[35:13.240 --> 35:19.800]  canyon was in a report he made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013
[35:19.800 --> 35:25.520]  the AP reported on Monday a day after a strong earthquake shook California's
[35:25.520 --> 35:33.880]  Napa Valley region and I'm not against nuclear power if it was done right but
[35:33.880 --> 35:41.320]  why did they build six reactors on a fault line in a tsunami zone in Japan
[35:41.320 --> 35:47.120]  why do we have a bunch of reactors on fault lines in California it's not like
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.440]  they're built in the Midwest or something where they don't really have
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.760]  earthquakes very often and don't have big fault lines there are a few and some
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.840]  of those have become active and all the major earthquake experts mainline
[35:58.840 --> 36:07.200]  geologists mainline seismologists are on record saying that all those plates are
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.880]  basically colliding with each other right now there hasn't been a big
[36:11.880 --> 36:15.920]  earthquake in many areas of northern California since the 80s but that the
[36:15.920 --> 36:24.320]  whole region the whole region is due for a major event in fact the whole of
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.880]  North America that's why we're suddenly seeing earthquakes in Missouri and
[36:28.880 --> 36:33.200]  earthquakes in Oklahoma and earthquakes in Texas and earthquakes in New York and
[36:33.200 --> 36:41.840]  we're seeing all these weird sinkholes and we're seeing most importantly that's
[36:41.840 --> 36:50.240]  why we're seeing most importantly things unfold like the Yellowstone Super
[36:50.240 --> 37:01.520]  Volcano as that begins to just basically rise and fall at the same time and most
[37:01.520 --> 37:07.880]  mainline analysts say that it's literally literally time for folks to
[37:07.880 --> 37:13.840]  brace for that thing to go sky high and if it does it could destroy most of the
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.680]  United States and cause a new ice age it is predicted and that's mainline
[37:18.680 --> 37:22.760]  scientists now when they say it's due that's in the next hundred to a thousand
[37:22.760 --> 37:31.880]  years they're not sure the big issue here is our universe is always changing is
[37:31.880 --> 37:40.200]  always going through volatility so in the United Nations says we need global
[37:40.200 --> 37:43.800]  carbon taxes because this summer is hotter than last summer or this winter is
[37:43.800 --> 37:48.360]  colder than last winter it's asinine they've gone from global warming to
[37:48.360 --> 37:57.400]  quote climate change saying that any type of change is unnatural the only thing
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.920]  that's not natural is change and so we better all appreciate being alive today
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.920]  we better all appreciate God's gift of consciousness and being here with our
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.840]  families and all the great experiences and all the great art and literature and
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.800]  food that we're able to have but more importantly our relationship we can have
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.600]  with our creator and the fact that we have a soul it is so wondrous to be
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.840]  alive but anybody that tells you they can take your liberties away and keep you
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.080]  safe is going to deliver one thing and that's tyranny so here are some of the
[38:31.080 --> 38:36.000]  headlines US inspector wanted reactor shut down on quake fears we're sending
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  our reporters down there in two days to go specifically to that southern
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.280]  California plant this is the same plant where they have had it leaking before a
[38:46.280 --> 38:50.200]  few years ago and they have alarms that go off and it was scaring the local
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.760]  beachfront town and so the fed said well we're gonna turn the alerts off because
[38:56.760 --> 39:03.040]  it's scaring people so they're violating federal law I'm not against nuclear
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.280]  power but I'm against it now because they don't care and let them leak and let
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.480]  them melt down and don't maintain them and the regulations have been watered
[39:12.480 --> 39:18.080]  down because these corporations running them are crazy our earthquakes on the
[39:18.080 --> 39:23.240]  rise CNN asked is California's big one coming then they go through the
[39:23.240 --> 39:30.160]  analysts saying yes that the computer models show that from Peru to Chile to
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.960]  Iceland worldwide the great ring of fire that California borders and the
[39:35.960 --> 39:42.720]  Pacific Rift is heating up ladies and gentlemen we're just saying be aware of
[39:42.720 --> 39:47.320]  it Los Angeles awaits earthquake that could be the big one the London
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.400]  Telegraph reports a mega quake in America's second most popular city is
[39:52.400 --> 39:56.200]  long overdue and the 50 year old buildings could come crashing down
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.280]  killing thousands oh yeah they've had earthquakes in India and Pakistan and
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.600]  Afghanistan and Iran that killed 10 30 40 thousand at a pop by the way earlier
[40:07.600 --> 40:10.520]  when I said Warren Buffett has given over a hundred million dollars last few
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.720]  years to abortion I was wrong Fox News has the headline it's 1.2 billion to
[40:15.720 --> 40:22.640]  abortion and over 500 million to groups that want to ban our guns I mean I don't
[40:22.640 --> 40:26.280]  try to demonize Warren Buffett but man he's got this PR image the sweet little
[40:26.280 --> 40:30.800]  man this guy runs the Democratic Party basically that he out sorrows the
[40:30.800 --> 40:37.120]  sorrows you know wonder twins activate well how about wonder quad you know
[40:37.120 --> 40:43.360]  triplets activate you got Warren Buffett Bill Gates and George Soros are
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.960]  just are a menace to this country in the world's freedoms here's another one
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.440]  Napa earthquake hastens call for warning system the other warning system that
[40:54.440 --> 41:02.480]  cost billions gave people a 12-second warning what is that gonna do but what's
[41:02.480 --> 41:08.720]  really important AP Reuters also reports Napa Valley bottle shock as quake
[41:08.720 --> 41:17.880]  shatters prize wine collections oh you as GS records 125 North Bay earthquakes
[41:17.880 --> 41:28.080]  following Napa tremor with more to come with a 2.0 aftershock today that some of
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.520]  them that was right in San Francisco summer as high as 3.0 so this is all
[41:32.520 --> 41:39.400]  going on right now I want to tell you about one of our new affiliates I'll
[41:39.400 --> 41:46.440]  tell you about some more coming up later in the broadcast KZ LS KZ LS please tell
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.160]  your friends and family about KZ LS if you don't live in Oklahoma but you have
[41:50.160 --> 41:56.720]  friends and family that do tell them to tune in to KZ LS 1640 a.m. Oklahoma City
[41:56.720 --> 42:03.480]  now carrying the Alex Jones show live 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time and
[42:03.480 --> 42:08.760]  I want to send a tweet out at real Alex Jones telling folks that they can tune
[42:08.760 --> 42:14.040]  in with a link to KZ LS his website so folks can find their audio streams there
[42:14.040 --> 42:20.120]  and again we always do this is why so many new affiliates are picking us up we
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.480]  need listeners in Oklahoma City because we've been on the air there years ago we
[42:24.480 --> 42:28.760]  in the station sold we need folks to become sponsors immediately station
[42:28.760 --> 42:32.880]  didn't ask for that but I want people to step up local businesses and don't just
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.880]  tell friends and family about the station step up and become sponsors today
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.920]  and then tell your entire email list your Facebook your Twitter you got an old
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.040]  MySpace account whatever you're using your Pinterest your Instagram to tune in
[42:47.040 --> 42:53.600]  to KZ LS 1640 a.m. Oklahoma City carrying this show live ladies and
[42:53.600 --> 43:03.040]  gentlemen the Eagle a.m. 1640 be sure and get that done we will retweet their
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.480]  Twitter and be sure and follow that station right there very exciting getting
[43:08.480 --> 43:12.680]  new affiliates all the time but I tell you Oklahoma some of the most
[43:12.680 --> 43:19.560]  libertarian patriotic conservative folks out there and it's time to really get
[43:19.560 --> 43:23.400]  the word out so that's another major victory in the info war and we think the
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.240]  good Lord above Larry elders coming up at the bottom of the next hour to talk
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.440]  about race relations now the Democratic Party in his words is trying to stir
[43:33.440 --> 43:36.440]  black people up and make them angry we've got loose fair con making some of the
[43:36.440 --> 43:43.240]  most incendiary comments I've ever heard out of his mouth and this is a guy who's
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.240]  plugged my radio show the nation I don't know what that means I mean I think
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.400]  listen I don't want to get in the fire with Lewis Farrakhan he actually talks
[43:51.400 --> 43:54.240]  about the private fellow reserve back when nobody did he does a lot of good
[43:54.240 --> 43:58.120]  things but for everything good he does he does something just as incendiary
[43:58.120 --> 44:05.840]  just isn't wild is it to get attention because Farrakhan attacks Arabs
[44:05.840 --> 44:11.400]  Chinese Koreans Indians whites in Ferguson rant and you know I disagree
[44:11.400 --> 44:14.080]  with him because you know you got a white guy that got shot and killed by the
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.280]  cops out in California right around the same time Dylan Taylor no one's been
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.240]  talking about that you don't see people rioting and it does look like the
[44:26.240 --> 44:30.480]  police told the truth in the brown case that does that mean that police aren't
[44:30.480 --> 44:35.760]  militarized and things are not a control no the fair con and others know that I
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.880]  criticize the police state but just criticizing police individually or
[44:39.880 --> 44:46.840]  making it a black versus white thing I really that that is not the case I mean
[44:46.840 --> 44:50.120]  I've been in New York City and had black and white cops treat me just as bad as
[44:50.120 --> 44:56.040]  I've seen them treat black people on television clips and you do see black
[44:56.040 --> 44:59.720]  folks getting choked to death and he can be in rape with plungers and everything
[44:59.720 --> 45:04.000]  else I got some bad news for you you got bad cops doing that for everybody
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.720]  because they're not held accountable and it's very scary so that's coming up as
[45:07.720 --> 45:12.640]  well but we're joined by Leanne McAdoo then coming up will be joined in the
[45:12.640 --> 45:15.840]  start of the next hour by John bound to give us his take on things who's there
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.800]  with her they're both taking turns behind camera and they're on screen Leanne
[45:20.800 --> 45:23.560]  McAdoo I know you're gonna go down to Southern California in a few days and
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.480]  investigate this nuke plant right on this fault line that's set to go any
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.200]  time stand a we never even played the clip you're gonna play it later in the
[45:31.200 --> 45:36.160]  next hour he predicted three months ago we have the date that this would
[45:36.160 --> 45:41.600]  happen and even pick the region and he's just saying get ready because the
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.360]  blink of an eye is a couple year period but sometime the next few years he and
[45:45.360 --> 45:50.160]  others believe and I've been mainline seismologists believe the big one we're
[45:50.160 --> 45:57.080]  talking an 8.0 9.0 who knows is gonna hit California and possibly could
[45:57.080 --> 46:03.200]  actually create an island I mean California bridges could be cut areas
[46:03.200 --> 46:06.800]  could actually slide into the ocean and we know historically this does happen
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.240]  and hope it doesn't happen while you're out there Leanne well that's what we were
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.640]  thinking John actually just let me know that there was another earthquake early
[46:15.640 --> 46:20.200]  this morning that we slept right through so they're happening all the time more
[46:20.200 --> 46:26.720]  than 125 have happened within 24 hours after this quake so Leanne McAdoo
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.760]  reporting for info wars calm I'm standing right at the corner of Maine and
[46:30.760 --> 46:35.800]  second Street here in downtown Napa behind me you can see the crumbling
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.800]  facade of some of the city's oldest buildings and about a square mile area
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.280]  is all roped off you can see buildings everywhere with yellow tape or red tape
[46:45.280 --> 46:49.560]  meaning that those buildings will probably have to come down the building
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.400]  directly behind me we were told that they had about a 35 year moratorium where
[46:54.400 --> 46:59.360]  they didn't have to upgrade and retrofit their building to comply with the
[46:59.360 --> 47:03.880]  earthquake standards but of course that just recently expired and I guess they
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.960]  didn't have time to get them retrofitted you can see some of the
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.520]  buildings are standing and that business owner there told us that he just
[47:11.520 --> 47:15.880]  recently completed his retrofitting earlier this year it was obviously money
[47:15.880 --> 47:20.440]  well spent because you can see these gorgeous historic buildings just in
[47:20.440 --> 47:29.160]  crumbles behind me all right reporting from downtown Napa now continuing here
[47:29.160 --> 47:34.720]  with Leanne McAdoo Leanne California is already seeing a huge exodus of their
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.920]  entertainment industry they're seeing a huge exodus of people period because of
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.960]  the high taxes and regulations I was reading in this report out of the LA
[47:43.960 --> 47:51.240]  Times that upwards of half of Los Angeles is 1950 or earlier and they predict
[47:51.240 --> 47:57.040]  will collapse or partially collapse quote killing thousands that's my big
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.520]  concern I know you're going to go talk to some professors and others have you
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.800]  had a chance to talk to locals yet yes we spoke with a few locals a few families
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.300]  here some of the locals men were brought to tears just recalling their
[48:10.300 --> 48:14.240]  experience saying if they had lived through other earthquakes before but
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.480]  this was the one that they thought was going to crush them this was the one
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.960]  they thought was going to kill them and then we have families where the fault
[48:22.960 --> 48:28.880]  line it just is going directly through their neighborhood streets from street
[48:28.880 --> 48:33.200]  to street you can see the direct fault line just going right through people's
[48:33.200 --> 48:38.400]  homes raising the sidewalks in some areas three feet off the ground pushing
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.200]  their homes off the foundation a foot to up to three feet for some of the older
[48:43.200 --> 48:49.640]  homes it's just been pretty incredible people are not entirely with water but
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.640]  they do have power but what we saw it was pretty remarkable because so many
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.560]  people were dumping off their television sets that were broken and and all of
[48:58.560 --> 49:02.040]  their things people were outside they were helping their neighbors they were
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.440]  playing outside the kids weren't you know huddled around the TV set so what
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.520]  we've seen is families just opening up their homes they invited us in for
[49:10.520 --> 49:14.440]  something to drink and really just rebuilding their community and that's
[49:14.440 --> 49:18.280]  kind of the testament like when the stuff hits the fan the only thing these
[49:18.280 --> 49:23.000]  people have is each other because there really is no way to you can't evacuate
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.480]  there's no warning signal that an earthquake is coming so they're testing
[49:27.480 --> 49:33.520]  beta testing one of these equipment that will give a warning signal and it was
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.360]  here in Berkeley which is about 40 miles away and that was successful it did
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.280]  give the lab there a 10-second warning but that would have been completely
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.320]  useless to people here in Napa they would have had a one-second to half of a
[49:47.320 --> 49:53.160]  second warning sure putting the shocks in putting in the anti earthquake
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.120]  systems has some effect from what I've read in with bigger buildings but
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.320]  California just doesn't have the money to retrofit all these buildings that's
[50:02.320 --> 50:06.520]  part of building a modern civilization on the edge of an area that has
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.400]  earthquakes and that's my concern and top regulator's concern is that
[50:11.400 --> 50:15.840]  California's built a whole bunch is more than seven nuclear reactors on or
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.080]  right beside fault lines and and if there's a major earthquake we're talking
[50:20.080 --> 50:26.240]  about meltdowns here and then the winds blow across from west to east the trade
[50:26.240 --> 50:33.200]  winds we're all gonna be radiated right mother nature bats last that's what
[50:33.200 --> 50:36.800]  we're hearing around here I mean who cares about Ebola who cares about Isis
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.360]  who cares about Obama's failed policies when you've got mother nature to worry
[50:41.360 --> 50:44.360]  about well government wants us to think about them all day because they can act
[50:44.360 --> 50:48.840]  like they control reality but hey you know having Google spy systems doesn't
[50:48.840 --> 50:53.800]  allow them to control the earth's magnetic type activities we'll be back

[56:44.640 --> 56:49.640]  might hit the earth a new ice age may come not in our lifetimes earthquakes
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.240]  happen sure but now we've got nuclear reactors if there's a new Pompeii or a
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.000]  new Mount St. Helens or a new mega quake and I think about the government
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.120]  response in California with what is it 35 37 million people how many live there
[57:04.120 --> 57:09.520]  let's look that up I mean it it's gonna be a time bomb because I believe the
[57:09.520 --> 57:13.840]  people would help each other but if it's like Katrina the feds are gonna come in
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.440]  and just go door-to-door taking the guns Leanne McAdoo absolutely well Leanne
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.400]  McAdoo reporting for info wars.com I'm out here covering the aftermath of this
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.160]  6.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the epicenter here and you're in Napa you're
[57:28.160 --> 57:32.960]  in the center in Napa absolutely right here downtown this this particular
[57:32.960 --> 57:37.240]  main street caught the brunt of it because it has the most of the historical
[57:37.240 --> 57:42.160]  buildings here and you can see just bricks covering the streets here and
[57:42.160 --> 57:47.120]  this we're seeing this all over the area homes just shifted three feet off of
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.480]  their foundations and the mayor was actually here earlier San Francisco mayor
[57:51.480 --> 57:56.880]  Ed Lee and he was in town not only to lend his support but also to learn the
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.320]  lessons of how they can go ahead and retrofit San Francisco because San
[58:02.320 --> 58:06.320]  Francisco has nothing but historical buildings and that's part of the charm
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.560]  of San Francisco or cities like Napa they have all these historical structures
[58:11.560 --> 58:16.400]  but they're not properly retrofitted and that just like you're saying it could
[58:16.400 --> 58:21.280]  be devastating for millions of people there San Francisco has a huge
[58:21.280 --> 58:25.240]  population most of them living in these older homes when they have earthquakes
[58:25.240 --> 58:29.720]  in populated cities in Asia sometimes 40,000 die I mean this is just a time
[58:29.720 --> 58:34.040]  bomb but meanwhile we're worried about Al Qaeda which our own government's

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.120]  also the center of the 6.1 earthquake that hit Sunday and what we do is cover
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.040]  issues that are important in my view sometimes it's mainstream type stories
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.120]  like this because I think it's important my crew thinks it's important
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.120]  sometimes it's stories that nobody else is covering so sometimes you'll see us
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.600]  chase like a heat-seeking mishold to quote Matt drudge whatever the big
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.480]  story is but sometimes you'll see us hammering something that we think is
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:01.560]  important to make it the big story coming up Republican candidates are
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.000]  hyping up the Foley beheading implying that Democrats aren't doing enough to
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.360]  fight terror it's bipartisan at the leadership level funding al-Qaeda just
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.040]  want to point that out white Marine beaten by black mob in Michael Brown
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:22.640]  revenge attack racial attacks are popping up all over the country but
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.400]  meanwhile a black cop shoots a white team in California this happened a week
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.880]  ago and with Dylan Taylor and you don't see anybody rioting because I mean a lot
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.080]  of times folks have a white cop shoots a black person it's not racially
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.400]  motivated it doesn't have to turn into a race war each and every time this stuff
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.440]  goes on most of the white people in this country I'll assure you are not racist
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.320]  but if you watch MSNBC and all their race baiting you would believe that so
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.000]  we'll talk about this and more with Larry Elder always informative black
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.720]  talk show host best-selling author who's been making big international headlines
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.000]  with his standoffs he's been having on CNN and others that's coming up but Leigh
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.800]  and Maca that we're gonna talk to John bound coming up to get his breakdown of
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.320]  things they're in Napa in a moment our other reporter where are you going next
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.600]  so you guys are planning a lot of stuff some man on the street interviews to see
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.400]  what people are concerned about you're gonna put some reports out about
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.600]  Californians helping each other my big issue is you know is the next
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.160]  Californian Fukushima coming I don't think it's a question a California
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.200]  Fukushima is coming if they don't mothball these reactors I mean I'm not
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.680]  even the big fan of coal but they're shutting off our coal plants while
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.000]  keeping reactors that are 35 years old that should already been shut down
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.120]  running Leigh and Macadam Leigh and Macadam for info wars comm again I'm
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.000]  here in downtown Napa at the epicenter of this 6.0 magnitude earthquake
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.800]  covering this destruction and yes it is pretty it just doesn't make much sense
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.640]  that they're here building these nuclear facilities along the ring of fire it's
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:09.800]  got 75% of the earth's volcanoes 90% of the earthquakes and yet here there are
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.520]  families and cities built all along these fault lines and we spoke with some
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.360]  families last night we're gonna go back and speak with them again today you know
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.680]  it's running right through their neighborhoods and these are not you know
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.480]  a lot of people might think oh it's Napa they're just rich people out there
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.360]  drinking wine all day these are actually the working-class families who run this
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.320]  whole wine industry they're the ones that are out there at the vineyards and
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.360]  and helping and the restaurants it's a huge tourism industry here so these are
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.480]  working-class families that don't know how they're going to get fix their homes
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.120]  or find new water heaters or you know hopefully not be taken advantage of by a
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.520]  lot of the scam contractors that are out here trying to bid on jobs so this is
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.360]  this is gonna affect all of us Leigh Ann what's the schedule I know you're
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.360]  gonna go up and report on the Rothschild era that died the day before the
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.640]  earthquake and tie that into Bohemian Grove and if we're a separate report is
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.680]  it's so interesting you're very close to where Baroness Rothschild lived in
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:16.040]  Bohemian Grove I guess that's gonna be tomorrow or is that today because I want

[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:42.360]  whole story pretty interesting to think about that occultic tie that here this
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.800]  one powerful Rothschild dies and then we have this huge earthquake right here

[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.640]  to totally ban guns in California they are moving to have forced inoculations
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.640]  which have already begun only state doing it they are moving to claim that
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.320]  parental consent ends at 12 that the state can tell your kids what to do your
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:11.800]  child that is an adult at 12 the state takes your child at 12 this is all
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.000]  happening in California and then they're using the same political model to then
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.920]  flood surrounding states with a political block that will vote how they're
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:31.440]  told because they've branded quote Hispanic victory to leftist globalist
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.560]  policies and it is game over for this country just everybody knows the southern
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:41.600]  border is completely wide open we are now eight months into it being totally
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.800]  open six months into the border patrol going public about it and it's not even
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:53.280]  in the news anymore felons are released 30 plus thousand a month who have
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:01.920]  aggravated felonies carjackings assaults child molestation every day I see
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.320]  regional news articles where they catch some guy who'd already killed two or
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.800]  three people or rape four or five women or rape six or seven little kids or rob
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:18.840]  four or five banks you see the headlines and they're just released again this is
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:26.280]  the end of the country this is the order out of chaos this is the plan and isn't
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.680]  it fitting that California the state that's killing America is on the
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:38.000]  teetering edge of fault lines that are set to go at any time every expert I've
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:46.320]  got CNN right here with their own experts seismologists geologists saying
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.280]  that the big one is set to come Los Angeles awaits earthquake that could
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:59.960]  be the big one a mega quake is long overdue is the headline is California's
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:11.040]  big one coming singing in and what is Obama worried about Obama looks at
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:18.360]  introducing transgendered troops Washington examiner regardless what you
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:25.200]  think about transgendered people this is just a political joke oh we'll pay for
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:32.840]  your $50,000 sex change in most states but we'll take an old lady's house if she
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.000]  doesn't pay income taxes
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.240]  oh the IRS is laying off the rest of their criminal fraud investigators for
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:49.760]  rich people for white-collared criminals but audits of blue-collar workers are
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:56.760]  up oh lemonade stands are illegal neighbors calls cops on boys lemonade
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:04.920]  stand boys entrepreneurial spirit angered at least one neighbor Tampa Bay
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.760]  Times see you want to blame the police for all this here's a headline
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.800]  Americans have little confidence or trust in police survey shows because
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.800]  they're quote increasingly militarized yeah who militarized them who opened the
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800]  borders who shipped in the drugs who destabilized the country I love how
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:29.080]  Congress will come out and criticize the TSA who funded and created the TSA who
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:35.840]  could defund them who could change their policies in a day Congress what they
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:43.000]  act like with their 6% approval rating that oh it's the TSA oh it's the cops
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.520]  yeah it's the compartmentalized cops who they've been transforming into a thug
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.880]  army without complete success see if we attack the police I figured this out
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.640]  about five years ago I was playing into the plan if we get mad at the armored
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.000]  vehicles and the checkpoints and the violations of our rights and just blame
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  them the globalist win you know why because that's meant to gang mentality
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.200]  put them into their own thin black ski mask line thin blue line and be a
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.800]  self-fulfilling prophecy as society collapses they'll circle the wagons in a
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:23.040]  civil war will erupt who federalized the police who gave them the training who
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.080]  put the population on welfare who shipped the jobs overseas who dumbed
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.600]  the education down the globalist the new world order the people on top not the
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.560]  police and I'm not even defending the police here I'm giving you cold hard
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:44.160]  facts Bill Gates runs American education Warren Buffett George Soros who
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.720]  funds billions every decade for abortion who funds billions for gun
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.120]  control every decade these people look at this headline Bill Gates his wife in
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.640]  just one of hundreds of initiatives per year give one million of six million to
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:06.320]  pass a gun show shutdown of Washington state when this guy has a troop of armed
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:13.400]  bodyguards these are predators and now they want a bunch of desperate starving
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.760]  people from collapsed third world countries to come in and to be given
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.040]  driver's license and voter IDs and be allowed to go out and vote and then the
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.680]  illegals until that happens they're allowed to fly without driver's license
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.640]  that was confirmed by the TSA last week the document was made public via foyer
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.720]  what we already witnessed for a year and said why is that important because now
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.760]  the feds are announcing you've got to have a federally approved ID card a
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:43.080]  national ID card by 2016 or you won't be allowed to fly if West Virginia and
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.760]  other states passed laws saying we're not gonna have biometric systems it's
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.080]  already verified and checked the fetches give the illegals the cards then you
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.200]  can't fly so citizens can't fly but the illegals can and they have the nerve to
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.400]  have governor Jerry Brown to all Mexicans to illegals come here
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.200]  governor Brown to Mexican illegals you're all welcome you're all our children
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.600]  even though 70% are teens or children Mexican president calls for immigration
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:24.480]  reform but I can't come to your country I can't come to pretty boys country I
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:32.880]  can't come to Nito's country is that a pronounce it penning Nito I'm
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.320]  pronouncing it wrong this is at an end it's about and only about a matter of
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.760]  justice for those that contribute so much to the development of the American
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.360]  Society yeah no it's true these immigrants on average worked their butts
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.880]  off they're not a spoiled a third or fourth or fifth generation Americans I
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.520]  don't care what color they are but doesn't matter I've seen the statistics
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.920]  their kids get even more spoiled and we should kick everybody off welfare so
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.640]  that everybody isn't spoiled it doesn't matter because the folks brag they work
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.600]  the system the illegals brag they work the system the dad goes out and works
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:09.000]  all day and then mom collects welfare and you could say well at least then
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.680]  they've got a nice truck and a nice house I guess in a way it is better than
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.720]  the welfare crowd the problem is and I'm gonna skip this network break no to
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:27.320]  John Bowne is they vote pure research 92% of the time for everything the
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.920]  globalist want open borders gun control on into private property forced an
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.120]  oculation abortion which isn't even Latin American culture of the good parts
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.240]  of it have been pro-life pro-family a lot of common sense stuff man you're gonna
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.880]  take the corrupt Latin American culture and merge it with the eugenics culture
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.600]  you're gonna take the corrupt parts of it man this is a nightmare this country
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:59.760]  will be a living hell hole but let's set all that aside no other countries
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.080]  open his border up like this this is lawlessness the feds are getting away
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.640]  with literal felonies smuggling of humans as the heads of the board patrol
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.840]  have said the board patrol completes the smuggling process but you or I
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.440]  regardless of what color we are when we got the insurance got the driver's
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.720]  license pay all the taxes played by the rules we are thrown into the system
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.200]  because we're known as chumps Warren Buffett doesn't pay taxes he wants you
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:34.320]  to pay more Warren Buffett pays to move Burger King to Canada but talks about
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.320]  buying in America it's all a sick joke now joining us from California ahead of
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.360]  Larry Elder we're skipping this network break is John bound reporting from Napa
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.720]  to give us his breakdown on what he's witnessed since he's been there and we
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.400]  got a lot more coming up in the next few days they're going to Bohemian Grove
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.680]  they're going to check out the Rothschild area she just died last Saturday
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.440]  the day before the earthquake one of the heads of the Rothschild dynasty who
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.960]  openly wore devil necklaces and and bathroom at necklaces and the rest of
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.360]  it it's just important to do a focus on this family while we're out there and
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.520]  then we're also to go down to the nuclear reactor that the feds say should
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.080]  have been shut down but didn't shut down right on a major fault line John bound
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.640]  John bound reporting for infowars.com we're here in the historic Napa
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.360]  California downtown district where just earlier this morning a 3.9 aftershock
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:33.040]  hit around 5 a.m. as you may well know or you may not but people need to realize
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:39.440]  that the ring of fire is exploding it is getting worse the cancer is growing the
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.120]  doctors if you will the seismologists the scientists that are out there saying
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.800]  look the other way are now saying yes the big one's coming we are 150 years
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:55.320]  overdue in the ring of fire for a 7.0 or greater the ring of fire if you're
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.960]  not aware of it extends from Patagonia all the way up to Alaska all the way
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:08.280]  over through Asia to Australia and Iceland is right now seeing a volcano of
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.800]  magnificent proportions and we may be feeling that here in California the
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.040]  people that we spoke with yesterday these neighborhoods that have been
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.600]  affected the folks that are getting together and realizing that they have
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.680]  to work together in order to take care of their neighborhoods and take care of
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:32.040]  each other when you look at their streets small town America working class
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.120]  blue collar folks dealing with the fact that they've got to help their neighbor
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.040]  get his house together then he's got to after he's worn out come back and fix
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.120]  his house woman was injured the injuries are escalating around here they
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.280]  they weren't just 100 what was it 120 injuries it's escalating they're more
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.280]  and more people that are injured and with the aftershocks there may be more
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:00.320]  injuries but we're gonna head towards Berkeley later on tomorrow we're gonna
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.600]  also go to the Rothschilds later today and head over to Bohemian Grove and
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.320]  take a look at the symbolic nature of the earthquakes if you will we'll have a
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:17.200]  deep report on that and the history of the Rothschilds and their significance
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.720]  here in this part of California the significance of these earthquakes that
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.720]  people need to realize is that they are growing especially in 2014 they've grown
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:34.480]  and with a super volcano that we just realized is actually twice the size of
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:41.680]  what was reported in Yellowstone could lay a 10-foot layer of ash over this
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.480]  entire country it completely destroy knockoff California and send that into
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.480]  the ocean of course we've always joked about California going to the ocean but
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.360]  people need to realize that that may be coming very soon it is undoubtedly in the
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.400]  cards doesn't mean it's gonna happen it could be another 5,000 years but there
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.560]  are a lot of islands off the coast of California that have elephant skeletons
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:08.040]  on them mastodon skeletons on them pig me mastodons pig me all sorts of other
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.120]  animals where parts of California have broken off before there's all sorts of
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.280]  underwater islands that are pieces of California that have been breaking off
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.800]  for a very long period of time and so the point is we're just letting people
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:24.760]  know this is happening here's singing in his California's big one coming that
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.240]  was the headline last night Los Angeles awaits earthquake that could be the big
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:32.800]  one a mega quake in America's second most populous city is long overdue and
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.600]  50 year old buildings could come crashing down killing thousands that's
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.880]  that's why we're drawing attention to this and why were nuclear reactors built
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:48.080]  on it hundreds of aftershocks in the last three days 125 just in the North Bay as
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.920]  of this morning and as you pointed out one of them was over three on the
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:59.600]  Richter scale 3.6 others above 2 simply amazing that this is happening but
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:07.680]  really not amazing because this is what goes on in these in these zones John
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:15.160]  Bown looking at this talking to the locals my big concern is what's going to
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:21.840]  happen if there was an 8.0 or so to hit LA or hit Southern California or hit
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.640]  San Francisco undoubtedly most the old buildings will collapse with people in
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:33.120]  them you will then have nuclear reactors that will start going critical and the
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.160]  feds won't even try to fix them they'll just say radiation is good for you
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.840]  you're a conspiracy theorist if you think 2 plus 2 equals 4 it's that I have no
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.040]  confidence in the system to respond to something you talk about the super
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:52.280]  volcano in Yellowstone where its giant caldera is part of four states there at
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.880]  that area and we're talking about hundreds of square miles they know the
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.760]  last time it exploded because they've got the ashen and rock cloud in fact
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:07.080]  guys let's pull up of the last eruption if we can up the super volcano back in
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.040]  March of this year there was the uplift it's been it's been coming up but the
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.960]  last time it blew they estimate that it burned about a third of the country
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.680]  completely down shot giant rocks over the equivalent of scores of states and
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.280]  had a dust cloud all the way down to Louisiana of several feet deep like you
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.960]  were just saying and then it caused an ice age so again scientists are now
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.640]  saying it's due for another eruption we're not saying it's gonna happen this
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.840]  year or 50 years from now the problem is though is that it's rapidly rising
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:47.160]  right now there it is shot fire shot rock shot multi-foot dust cloud all the
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:53.880]  way into Canada as far west as southern California into Mexico Arizona Nevada
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:25:01.520]  New Mexico Texas covered all the way over into Louisiana Arkansas Tennessee I
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.080]  mean this is a serious situation is all I'm trying to tell people our earth is
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.520]  not stable Shoemaker Levy that went into one of the big gas giants a few
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:15.960]  decades ago a Jupiter that broke into dozens of pieces blue holes in the
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.520]  atmosphere bigger than the earth scientists had said it was every million
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.120]  years one of those yet now they say it's every few thousand that's why you have
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.920]  Plato reporting on Atlantis saying it existed and and of course Plato was a
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:37.960]  historian this was not rumors we know these disasters happen more often than
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.040]  the establishment saying they know that as well John do you think that could be
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.600]  one of the reasons they're building all these underground bases in places like
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.560]  the Ozarks where they believe they're a lot safer yeah you read my mind they're
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.520]  basically leading everyone into a giant hell pit of their own making because why
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.680]  would you create a nuclear facility called Diablo if you weren't serious
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.040]  about killing all of us putting it on a fault line where you have to put nuclear
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.840]  waste for 10,000 yeah why would you bury a big waste facility in a big reactor
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:15.640]  right on a facility right on a canyon called Devil's Canyon and if everyone's
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.400]  so damn smart out here excuse the language it goes in cycles it goes in
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.880]  150 year cycles but they haven't had a 7.0 since 1680 well it's we're due for a
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.280]  big one
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.960]  well that's what the scientists are saying I mean I I hope that's not the
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.200]  case can you imagine the bedlam and the feds won't be helping anybody according
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.360]  to Katrina logic they'll be going into the nice homes and robbing all the
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.760]  weapons and jewelry yeah while our president golf's and while Dick Cheney
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:53.040]  fishes absolutely now we're gonna play a stand-out clip here in a moment but John
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:57.000]  I mean how many homes have been damaged how many buildings I'm told it's hundreds
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.840]  well we go to this neighborhood later today and finish our interview with
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.160]  these folks it's from one street to the next and a few of the people that spoke
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  with didn't want to be on camera they talked about the fact that the they their
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.280]  neighborhood is right on the nap of fault they built the neighborhood right on
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.720]  the nap of fault so you're gonna see it may have to be rolling maybe rolling it
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.480]  now but you're gonna see this neighborhood and how it was affected now
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.840]  this area here was affected because of the shock and the old buildings there's
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.960]  no retrofitting in these buildings these are newer homes that we were at today
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.760]  or we'll be at today and we're at yesterday and you're gonna see the
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:40.320]  sidewalks are pushed up out of the ground streets are unusable that and the
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.080]  inside the terror that these people experienced 26 seconds of sheer terror
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.760]  and it's hard to even understand what they're trying to explain you it's not
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.200]  like you're just being moved around it's you don't know where you're going you
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.880]  don't know what's falling on you you don't know if the house is coming down I
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.480]  gotta tell you just staying in the hotel last night which we got a raid on be a
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:05.040]  cheaper raid on which had no TVs in it because they were all destroyed and the
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.480]  hotel next to us was closed because the water main broke it's it's an eerie
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.920]  feeling being here knowing that at any second that well John we're gonna check
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.960]  in with you towards the end of the next hour again move on to your next
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.640]  destination but great job for you and Leanne Macadoo will follow with this
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.080]  with you the next few days as you travel up and down the breadth of California
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.240]  thank you thank you all right before we go to break and come back with Larry
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.800]  Elder and shift gears into the social destabilization that's going on
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.520]  Stan Dayo was on yesterday but we didn't play this clip this is him back on
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.920]  April 11th and his predictions have been frighteningly accurate predicting what
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.360]  just happened there in northern California here's Stan Dayo from earlier
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.760]  this year certainly you can see from just looking at that that we have activity
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.440]  starting to increase in the northern part of Oregon southern part of
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.560]  Washington and at the very tip of northern California that's where the
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:08.360]  Wanda Fuca plate is and that's the reason that we have a great deal of
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.000]  concern for the area there for tsunamis and damaged infrastructures because the
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.960]  Wanda Fuca plate all is the only one of all of those earthquakes you see there
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.360]  around the ring of fire the only one that is not released it's Richter 9 plus
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.960]  stress in the last 55 years everyone is watching that site if something triggers
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.400]  it yeah California what will happen conservatively compared to other we're
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.720]  gonna play more of this later after Larry Elder leaves us but that was him in
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.120]  April specifically saying what the next place would be and he was accurate and
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.120]  by the way these earthquakes hundreds of them the last three days did not trigger
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:49.160]  it yet if it triggers I mean it'll be spectacularly destructive we're on the
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:54.160]  March it's what we're watching on the day with us info wars.com prismplanet.com
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.200]  radio network
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.880]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.440]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.440]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.640]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.520]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.640]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.440]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.840]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.520]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.920]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.760]  cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.720]  LarryElder.com and he is a syndicated columnist a talk show host best-selling
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.120]  author broadcasting from K ABC and different parts of the country he joins
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.200]  us lately we've been posting a lot of his articles info wars.com from him on
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:51.840]  MSNBC CNN you name it challenging just the incredible race baiters I've heard
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.440]  the Klan gift speeches I've gone out and protested them many times as folks know
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.360]  you've seen those videos the stuff I hear coming out of MSNBC and Al Sharpton
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:05.040]  sounds like the same race baiting you hear out of white supremacists and it's
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:11.440]  just so obvious what's going on but now we have a case with a young white man
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:16.320]  shot by a black police officer that we're going to be covering a little bit
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.520]  first then getting into some other issues where you have a Ferguson like
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:26.760]  attack in Utah escapes media notice race bias scene I don't think so I mean
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.920]  black cop shoots a white guy I don't think it was racial I don't we don't
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.240]  know exactly what happened yet but we're gonna get Larry Elders take on this
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:37.860]  because what we know is there haven't been burning buildings there hasn't been
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.480]  looting there haven't been racial attacks against blacks by whites everywhere
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:49.380]  as we've seen up on info wars.com white Marine beaten by black mob in Michael
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:53.880]  Brown revenge attack it's happened three times the last week in the same town so
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.880]  what's going on here why do the Democrats want to start a race war Larry
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.400]  Alder thanks for coming on Alex Jones always a pleasure thank you very much
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.760]  for having me with the reason Democrats want black people angry I don't think
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.680]  they want a race war but they want black people angry is because black people
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.720]  will then march like livings and pull that lever 95% for the Democratic Party
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.760]  because the Democratic Party has convinced black people that Republicans
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.600]  hate them Republicans are racist Tea Party is racist John Boehner is racist
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.720]  this McConnell's racist Eric Cantor's the late Eric Cantor meaning he lost his
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.200]  job is racist that's what they do Debbie Wasserman Schultz said during the
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.120]  2012 campaign that Republicans are engaging in a war against women war
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.160]  against blacks brother Charlie Rangel formerly the head of the House Ways and
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.360]  Means Committee said that Republicans don't say S word anymore a slur for
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.880]  Hispanics or in word anymore a slur for blacks in fact he actually said the
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.880]  words Alex they don't say S or in anymore they just say let's cut taxes in
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.640]  other words cutting taxes is racist everything is racist and that's the
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.080]  agenda the agenda is to make sure blacks are pissed off at the world come
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.880]  November the 4th pull that lever 95% however if you're a black guy living in
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.920]  a democratically controlled town they don't want you to riot having told you
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.360]  that the racist criminal justice system is oppressing you so you can't have it
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.880]  both ways Alex I'm used to people like like sharp and yelling and screaming and
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.080]  making all sorts of elation comments about the criminal justice system but
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.960]  Eric Holder and Obama repeat the same nonsense that the criminal justice
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.160]  system is racist that blacks are arrested unfairly their sentence longer
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:27.520]  unfairly which is what Eric Holder has said in a speech at three or four weeks
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.560]  ago why wouldn't the people in Ferguson not believe the official version of what
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.760]  happened why wouldn't the police and the people in Ferguson go to the streets
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.480]  and attack the racist criminal justice system the first black president who's
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.120]  been elected and reelected and his black attorney general have both told black
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.200]  people that the criminal justice system is in fact racist why shouldn't they
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.760]  believe it well just growing up in Texas and growing up in Dallas I do think
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:57.200]  that clearly there has been some discrimination and some over enforcement
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:04.120]  in the black community but when MTV look at Shug Knight getting shot promotes
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:10.080]  for 20 years cop killing music gangster culture I don't know how the police tell
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.280]  one you know real thugs when I want to be and I see cops roll up on white kids
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:22.560]  dressed like thugs or I see cops roll up on rednecks when they're acting in a
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.920]  criminal way I mean quite frankly I've seen police act like this against any
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.960]  subculture that is acting in a thuggish way and the media pushes a thug life
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.640]  thug culture I think the so-called liberal media has more to do with this
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.320]  than anybody else I agree and and Alex you point out something I mentioned on
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.880]  my show the other day I don't know any of my white friends who has not been
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.040]  spoken to in a way that he or she did not like by a cop any of them however
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  because you're white you therefore don't have the convenient excuse that the
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.160]  officer did it because I'm a black person that's the problem a lot of black
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.120]  people have been taught whenever something bad happens to you interpreted
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:02.680]  the worst possible racial way this is not your grandfather's America for crying
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:08.120]  out loud LA and LA your the average street cop is either a female or a
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.440]  person of color they were back-to-back black police chief here in LA during the
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.480]  OJ Simpson case Alex there was a black police chief named Willie Williams
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:19.280]  because of all of the accusations that the officers had planted evidence he did
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.320]  a top-down departmental review to find out whether anybody had done anything at
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.200]  all incorrect during the OJ Simpson case it's during the trial itself the
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.040]  court came back the officers were completely clean no detective no
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.800]  criminologist no cop did anything wrong people didn't care the ones who thought
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.320]  OJ Simpson was a victim of a conspiracy continue to believe that OJ
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.920]  Simpson is a victim of conspiracy I mentioned that because this nonsense
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.680]  about what would happen if the police department in Ferguson were more
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:49.400]  represent representative of the of the people in general really would climb go
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.040]  down we have a far more racially represented police force in Chicago and
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:58.000]  in New York has climbed on down no it has not gone down and Alex you mentioned
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.560]  this black officer who shot this unarmed man in Utah 20 years old a few days
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:08.320]  ago I'll give you an even bigger hypocrisy story 2006 California Long
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.080]  Beach 20 minutes outside of Los Angeles three white girls go to a haunted house
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:18.600]  party they are attacked by a mob of 30 or 40 people beaten savagely one almost
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:25.160]  loses her eye a black Good Samaritan wades in Alex saves the day these mob
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.640]  maybe 10 or 12 of them are finally prosecuted ultimately given a slap on
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.960]  the wrist given home detention it took LA Times a week to write about the attack
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.960]  a week it took NPR a month to mention it Alex and they only mentioned it in the
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.160]  context of whether or not it is true that a black person can in fact commit a
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.960]  hate crime because of the racial history of black people in America that's the
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.000]  only context in which NPR even brought up this beating that took place in Long
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.920]  Beach in 2006 Google it nobody gave a whip because the girls were white the
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.880]  mob was black you reverse it it's international story they're talking
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.640]  about it in Bangladesh remember the whole lacrosse thing the media wanted
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.640]  that to be a racial attack not only that remember the church at the church is
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.520]  burning thing about 10 15 years ago USA Today did a whole bunch of cover stories
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.720]  about black churches being burned because racist arsonists are out there
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.760]  getting them turned out not a single black church was burned because of
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.120]  racial animus more mosques and synagogues have been burned over that same
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:24.960]  period of time but nobody gave a whip and to their credit USA Today issued a
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.320]  front-page apology so that they whip the whole country up into this hysteria for
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.480]  no reason at all and we're talking about hysteria about half of the homicide in
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.240]  this country are by and against black people in Chicago alone last year there
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.280]  were about 10 homicides a week mostly black people and by the way most of
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.200]  those are installed at least in the case of Ferguson the family has at least the
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.200]  smallest of knowing who did it there are a whole bunch of parents in Chicago
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:52.040]  right now Alex who don't have any idea who killed their loved ones and I don't
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.320]  think that the FBI has sent 40 agents there as they did in Ferguson if Eric
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:59.280]  Holder has made a comment about what's going on in Chicago I haven't heard it
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.080]  Larry Elder syndicated talk show host by selling authors our guest you know you
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.280]  said you don't agree they're trying to start a race for I don't mean a full-out
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.600]  nationwide white people kill black people black people kill white people but
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.800]  already in Southern California we've got the phenomenon of the Hispanic gangs
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.920]  targeting blacks that undoubtedly is going on and vice versa but but but
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.520]  mainly the Hispanic against the black I know in East Austin if you want to talk
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.720]  about real racial animus I'll talk to the police it's actually black against
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.880]  Hispanic that's what I see actually flaring up we're talking about real
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.320]  racial stuff and so I want you to elaborate on that because I know you're
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.840]  an expert on it but what are they trying to do because when they're up there
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.200]  hyping all this it's starting to cause kind of a cold race war I think it is
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.640]  and Alex I agree with you that what they want to do though but I wouldn't call it
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.680]  a race or what they want to do is make blacks perpetual the victim doesn't
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.320]  matter how much money you make you're still a victim doesn't matter how
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.840]  successful you are you're still a victim doesn't matter you have a PhD from
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:03.800]  Harvard you're still a victim when Obama first ran I saw him for the first time
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:10.040]  with a lengthy interview on on 60 minutes with Steve Croft 2008 he said
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.160]  senator Obama at the time he wasn't the likely nominee senator Obama if you
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:20.040]  don't win the nomination will it be because of race and Obama said I'll
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.720]  never forget this Alex he said no it will be because I've not articulated a
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.320]  vision that the American people can embrace I'm at my house I said you know
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.640]  what I would never vote for a left-wing Democrat in a billion years but at least
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.320]  his SOP is refreshing at least we can stop this nonsense you're picking on me
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.680]  because I'm black at least you'll have black people no longer saying that
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.040]  automatically in fact it's really gotten the trouble he went that way he said the
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.320]  Cambridge police acted stupidly he re-indicated himself in the Trayvon
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.640]  Martin case and said that if I had a son he would look like Trayvon he'd
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.360]  injected himself in the Ferguson case and every single case Obama had an
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.720]  opportunity to say something he could have said to that Harvard professor
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.400]  professor Gates here's the problem in the inner city we have a bunch of black
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.000]  guys with chips on their shoulder just as you exhibit it to this man who was
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.680]  just doing his job you came to your house you didn't get in because the door
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.400]  was was wacky what are your neighbors called because the neighbor being a
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.600]  good neighbor thought you were breaking into the neighbor's house the cop showed
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.680]  up did his job saw you in the house after ID instead of cooperating you said
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.160]  yo mama this is exactly the problem you have a lot of black guys saying yo mama
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.960]  the cops when in fact the cops are just doing their job rough tough the
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.800]  situation they're in they're in this high crime area because that's where the
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.520]  crime is the problem is we don't have fathers in the black community you said
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:36.680]  mr. Obama that a black kid growing up without a dad is five times more likely
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:39.880]  to be poor nine times more likely to drop out of school twenty times more
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.280]  likely to go to prison you said that 75% of the black kids in America are born
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.120]  without dads in the house do the math that's the problem and Obama had an
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.280]  opportunity to give the country a lecture on this Alex Jones instead what
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.200]  did he do the Cambridge police acted stupidly I was so disappointed in him
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.480]  but I realized here's what he needs when you're in trouble you've got to have
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.760]  that 95% monolithic black vote in 1956 39% of blacks voted for a Republican
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.000]  party that's where I believe we spy is if the republic were smarter Alex they
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.600]  could get that 35 39 or 40% and Obama knows that we've got to keep these black
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.400]  people sure and they've not delivered victim you're a victim exactly they've
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.760]  not delivered on jobs they've not delivered on anything things are getting
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.120]  worse the poverty rate is lower for black people than when Obama took over the
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.240]  poverty the unemployment rate is twice what it is for white as it was when
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.120]  Obama took over it hasn't changed anything if you have a whole bunch more
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.400]  black people on food step and the labor force participation rate the percentage
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.080]  of able-bodied black people in the market are looking for a job is at a 30
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:44.000]  year low all of this is a result of policies tax spend rate that's that
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.600]  chase people away that destroy jobs that don't create jobs and those they get
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.080]  hurt the most are the most vulnerable these are the ones with the lower income
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:54.040]  people these are black and brown people the very people that put Obama in
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:58.040]  office you know that is a good story because I'd forgotten about the
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  different because it was a bunch of people would get mad when they got home
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.400]  and had to break in their own house when the cops showed up that would turn into
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.680]  a big national issue I remember one time about 10 years ago I couldn't find my
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:16.080]  keys so I climbed up to the second floor went in through an open window that I
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:21.440]  knew that I'd had open or cracked and the cops showed up 10 minutes later we're
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:24.600]  walking around the back of the house I came and open the door and they said
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.920]  hey I need to see an ID your neighbor saw somebody break in I go yeah that's
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:33.520]  me and I just showed him my ID I never thought that of course it was a white
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:40.160]  cop but I'd still I mean that just must be so ingrained that you break in your
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.520]  own house which everybody's done at one time or another and then the cops come
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:50.720]  and then you think it's because of racism I think the cops deserve the
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.200]  benefit of the doubt in every situation I first give them the benefit of the doubt
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.920]  they're in a situation where they're willing to take a bullet for somebody
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.480]  they don't don't even know I think we ought to give them the benefit of doubt
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.000]  these are frequently the best trained many that have undergone polygraphs
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.320]  undergone character studies that most people have not had to undergo to get
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.480]  their jobs I think they deserve the benefit of the doubt and you pointed out
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.400]  this black cop in Utah with a black cop he shot a guy at a convenience store 20
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.680]  years old for some kind of encounter and their family of the white guy has
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:23.800]  protested but very quietly and the media has shown indifference but I believe
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.120]  that the proper response is what the Salt Lake police have done that is put the
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.520]  officer administrative leave they said we could not get an investigation that
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.760]  in Salt Lake City by the way the cops do have a camera lapels or dash cams or
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.840]  some sort of video and so there's a video about this but it hasn't been
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.840]  released yet because they're pending the investigation the family hasn't called
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.280]  Sharpton to my knowledge that they protested the media hasn't come in
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.840]  here because the cops sure it's clear manipulation I want to come back and

[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.840]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and

[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.240]  finishing up talking to Larry here today what is your breakdown on the ISIS
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:13.200]  situation and Assad where all that's going well understand this is a president
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.440]  who when he was running for Senate back in 2002 gave a speech which he called the
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.480]  Iraq war a dumb war this is when 90% of Americans thought we were going to get
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.880]  hit again this is after we knew that Obama saying that he was chemical
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.760]  weapons on his own people and on the Iranians this is when he was stealing
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.360]  from the oil for food program shooting at the British and American plane
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.880]  patrolling the southern and northern both flies down with paying $25,000 to
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:40.200]  families of homicide bombers that tried to assassinate President George
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.200]  Herbert Walker Bush and Obama felt we had the real national security interests
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.960]  there and even he was assumed as everybody did that's a bombhead stock
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:53.160]  power for WMD so fast forward this is the same president now who is now doing
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:58.000]  aerial bombing because a journalist got beheaded I don't understand what the
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.840]  what the objective is are we at war are we going to contain them are we going to
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.640]  destroy them what is his agenda do we just do kind of spot airstrikes here in
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.960]  there and maybe move ISIS around here in there can you really think we can do
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.400]  this without putting boots on the ground why the hell do you think we had
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.800]  boots on the ground this first place Obama cut and ran and in December of
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:22.520]  2011 was advised to keep a minimum of 10,000 ideally 20,000 he said no he was
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:25.520]  told it's gonna be a bloodbath he was convinced it wasn't going to be because
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.200]  after all Obama felt that the war on terror was something that George W.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.840]  Bush basically had conceived out of his own mind if he hadn't been a cowboy if
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.480]  he was able to pronounce the word nuclear if he hadn't been such a
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.800]  swaggering person who wouldn't be angry at us I'm gonna come in with an
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.720]  unclenched fist I'm gonna reach out my hand I'm gonna start a new dialogue I'm
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.040]  gonna reset things with Soviet Union I'm gonna get my first interview with Al
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:49.200]  Arabia so the world is a different guy in charge and now they're looking at
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.840]  differently oops they didn't cooperate I guess I didn't get the memo Alex well
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.480]  people can say what they want about the Iraq war and I overall was against it
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.280]  but if you look at what's happening with ISIS being basically armed under the
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:09.000]  name Al Qaeda in Iraq to attack Assad the establishments can have a big problem
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.040]  on their hands when and if there's a terror attack on this country and it's
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.480]  groups that are our president and his cohorts you know John McCain met with
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:22.240]  some of these people as well right it's a very dangerous situation what are they
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.080]  gonna do when Obama's open the southern border and undoubtedly terrorists have
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.440]  come across and probably gonna have a terror attack I mean how are they gonna
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.720]  get out of that Larry I don't think they can get out of it it's just a question
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:36.320]  of time isn't it we're hearing from border patrol people that OTM's other
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.160]  than Mexicans are coming across the border in record numbers some of them
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.520]  appear to be coming from the Middle East the boy's remain poor we're in real
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:47.200]  trouble but I'm gonna get back to the Iraq war I'm tell you why I supported it
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.480]  I know a lot of people didn't I know you didn't George will didn't then and we
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.240]  met Buckley did it first and did they'll get a 180 you can't kill them all there's
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.760]  1.5 billion of these people about 10% or so are kinds of people who either
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.800]  supported or literally with with that bombs on themselves and blow us up what
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.920]  can you do what you can do is hopefully have a nation there that is a
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:11.200]  democratically run nation that shows people it's not the nasty Jews it's not
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.720]  America that's oppressing you get your own freaking government look at Iraq
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.600]  Iraq is a model at the time the economy was growing it was serving as a model for
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.480]  the Larry we can't in here to come back in 60 seconds that little five minute
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.720]  segment I want you to give us your your sales job on this and I'll briefly tell
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.640]  you my take on it but yeah we'll come back and talk about that on the other
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.400]  side that's something callers ought to call in later about and debate this
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:38.840]  whole thing who's really to blame for all this I mean I would say it's the
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:43.440]  radical ideology over there and Western governments funding radicals to
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:47.960]  destabilize the area we'll get Larry elders take in 60 seconds stay with us
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.080]  we'll be back I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:56.720]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:02.480]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:06.840]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:12.240]  developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.080]  that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.680]  think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals

[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:43.080]  forget the nightly news is back tonight seven o'clock central Larry I look at
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:49.280]  Iraq I understand that Saddam was put in by the CIA he actually stabilized the
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.280]  country they had movie theaters music on the radio women could go to college
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.440]  that seems like a reasonable policy going back to Eisenhower Kennedy right
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:04.760]  through with Reagan then you get rid of you know Saddam I understand it's all a
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:08.120]  quagmire Iraq probably should have been in three pieces to begin with it ever
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:13.960]  was one country that's a long story to get into all I know is the Arab Spring
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:17.960]  Al Gore's called for basically a democratic spring here they've been
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:22.480]  working with the radical Islamic groups Saudi Arabia is trying to basically
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:27.720]  take over different areas they're behind a lot of this and I just think it's so
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:32.120]  Machiavellian now that there really is no side it's a total nightmare go ahead
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:36.560]  and make your point it is a total nightmare Alex and ultimately every
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.560]  single country that you talked about their leadership is going to fall
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.880]  ultimately Saudi Arabia is going to fall ultimately all these countries are
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:46.520]  going to fall it may be a hundred years it may be 200 years but eventually I
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:50.720]  believe that people want to be left alone and that people want to be free even
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.640]  these people over there here was the theory the theory was that Saddam was
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.600]  saying has stockpiled a WMD and God forbid he should hand it off or maybe
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.040]  your terrorists to steal one and make what happened on 9-11 look like a picnic
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.440]  so the idea is to go in there first of all tell Saddam to get rid of his stuff
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.120]  you got 15 months to do it he didn't do it United Nations gave him a resolution
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.000]  House Senate gave him a resolution a coalition of 30 nations go we go in
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.120]  there we get rid of the guy we stabilize the country lots of mistakes were made
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  to be sure it took longer than we thought more expensive than we thought
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.280]  more lives lost than we thought but the country was stabilized the economy was
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.960]  growing and for the first time people in the Arab world were going I guess it's
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:31.280]  not the nasty Jews I guess not America that's oppressing us I guess it's our
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:35.000]  own countries maybe we ought to turn to our own leadership and do a change
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.520]  that's what the whole now that may not have happened ultimately but we don't
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:42.160]  know because Obama pulled out before a chance to take root took a long time for
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:45.480]  our country to become stable how do you expect that country to become stable in
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.840]  just 10 years it takes a long time we should have been patient we're still in
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.720]  South Korea we're still in Europe we should still be in in Iraq but we're
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.840]  not because we have a president that lacks a vision that doesn't get it they
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.880]  cause the war on terror and overseas contingency operation he truly believes
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:04.560]  that we stuck a stick in the eye of the of the Muslim Arab world have we not
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.640]  done that they wouldn't be pissed off at it they don't understand that there is a
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:11.320]  radical element within that part of the country in that religion that wants us
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.640]  destroyed and if we don't destroy them they will destroy us well I'll say this
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:19.120]  I mean it's just like the Democrats preach this message that every problem
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.360]  in the black community is because of some white person when white people can
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.320]  barely run their own lives as well and every statistic shows the culture
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:33.640]  period in America is degenerating and meanwhile you've got in these Arab
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.840]  countries constant in fighting constant corruption and then all these different
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:43.080]  Muslim groups she and Sunni killing each other and at the end of the day they
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:48.480]  always end up blaming somebody else and I think the heart of this is these
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.240]  cultures never had a chance to have their own 1776 and to ever have a shot
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.240]  at their own free market and their own open economy but the West is in there
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:03.440]  trying to destabilize you've got some moves to stabilize like in the Eisenhower
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.800]  era you've got other groups that want to destabilize in the CIA so I think it's a
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:11.120]  little bit of both the argument is can you get the Arabs to be peaceful and
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:16.240]  live in peace or do you just destabilize them so they don't come attack you what
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:21.440]  I think you do is make sure that you put a force there so that we fight them over
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  there and not fight them over there I have a lot of friends who fought in
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.920]  Afghanistan and in Iraq and they said at the very least we're killing a whole
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:30.800]  bunch of bad guys better to kill them over there than a speech of Milwaukee the
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.240]  speech of Chicago the speech of Washington DC well we know this the
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.880]  southern borders wide open and when there's a big terror attack in this
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.640]  country will any of these open border people get the blame Larry Elder well
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.160]  they certainly should get the blame and and they should look right in the
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.960]  mirror it wouldn't if we get attacked again and it's just a question of time
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.720]  before we do all right Larry Elder thank you so much for the time appreciate

[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:22.920]  you up and on the air I mentioned this at the start of the broadcast today but
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.720]  hadn't gotten to it yet this is some excerpts of it bright Bart had the
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:34.440]  headline Farrakhan attacks Arabs Chinese Koreans Indians whites in Ferguson rant
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:39.080]  during his latest sermon for the nation of Islam minister Lewis Farrakhan
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:44.760]  addressed the protest and controversy surrounding Ferguson Missouri police
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.440]  officer Darren Wilson and fatally shot Michael Brown and he went on to make the
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:54.840]  point that Ferguson 67% black why are there so few blacks in leadership
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:10:00.240]  positions I would ask the black folks that the are you saying there's election
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:07.640]  fraud or are you not voting because there is election fraud nationally it's not
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:13.440]  total but it's there that's been proven but then everybody should sit there and
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:17.840]  get exit polls and show how everybody voted at each precinct and show there's
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:25.240]  fraud and there's ways to do this and then you can take your town back we just
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.240]  had Larry Elder on last hour who's a black broadcaster and he was pointing
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:35.520]  out that you've got areas where cities are majority black run and you have just
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:38.840]  as many black people statistically getting shot or more under black
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.920]  leadership I'm not here apologizing for the establishment of the police I know
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:49.960]  this though the economic and cultural degeneration we're seeing is hitting
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:55.560]  everybody and if we make it about black or white or cop versus citizen all that
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.440]  does is play into the Balkanization we've got to realize why America is going
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.480]  in the wrong direction get back to the Republic again the toll free number is
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:12.840]  800-259-9231 here is some of those clips of Lewis Farrakhan talking about the
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.520]  Ferguson situation that's starting to wind down but if they don't charge the
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:22.520]  cop there's been a renewed threats of violence here it is with 67% of black
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:30.040]  people you got to live under a white male with 67% of black people you can't
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:46.200]  make the laws that govern that town now if that's the condition let me set the
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:59.480]  stage for Michael Brown see I don't know about the store that they say strong
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:18.560]  arms somebody and took some cigars but I know this I'm coming to Chicago this is
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:35.200]  where I'm on clothes when you live in the hood you don't control no economics so
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:45.400]  you've got Arab store owners that don't give a damn about you and have no
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:54.480]  respect for you you've got Koreans you've got Chinese you've got Indians you've
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:00.920]  got other people all in our community taking the money out but not giving a
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:24.040]  damn thing to this community I
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:38.760]  imagine that blacks in under those conditions suffer every day but not one
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:53.520]  time did they break a window there's been over I think 300 arrests of black
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:02.960]  people in that city and just under 40 whites have been arrested you see the
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:12.040]  picture but you know I've got a question for Lewis fair con and this is a real
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:15.600]  question because I'm not just here to fight with people I can score political
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.440]  points with Lewis fair con is very unpopular a lot of people the majority
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:24.920]  of Americans but popular with some and just attacking but he puts out a pretty
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:28.960]  good newspaper that exposes the Federal Reserve and the New World Order and
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.360]  and vaccines he talks about black people shopping locally not even so much it was
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.240]  just black shopping with blacks but that's good but starting your own
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:44.520]  businesses and supporting them that makes sense I say shop with farmers markets
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:49.360]  and local communities I go in black owned barbecue places buy back when I lived more
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.600]  South Austin I went to black owned barbershop because they had cheap good
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:59.320]  quick haircuts it's got to be 20 years ago but I tell you race relations are so
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:02.440]  bad now you try to go in a lot of black areas I'll tell you get your butt out of
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.840]  there or ask you what are you doing in here and you see when things get so
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:11.800]  tribal ladies and gentlemen across the board with whites blacks whatever
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:16.000]  whites are gonna stay back from blacks now because they dislike black people but
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.200]  because they're scared and loose fair con liked what I said when I got in
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:27.040]  Pierce Morgan's face and so that was a good message that we wouldn't turn our
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.640]  guns in that's the weird thing about him he says a lot of stuff that I agree
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.800]  with a lot I don't agree with let me say what I don't agree with Lewis fair con
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.160]  and let's work on listening to the show we've talked to their people try to get
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:44.240]  them on the show that they listen why would you blame Arab and Chinese
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:50.200]  shopkeepers who I agree are coming into your predominant you know neighborhoods
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.800]  that you were forced into you know a hundred years ago and they're they're
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.640]  taking the money a lot of it out you know that they probably live ten miles
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:04.400]  away because there's a market there no one starting a business there no one's
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:09.280]  starting a shop there big corporations aren't because they you try to people
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:16.040]  say what are you gentrifying things for and people get mad at that so it just
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:20.360]  becomes this thing where everything is seen as bad so nothing can be accepted
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:26.920]  nothing can make things any better and and Lewis Verkon does preach for blacks
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:30.520]  to start their own businesses and support them and that's a good thing but
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:38.120]  where are they where are they because if the blacks shop only at black-owned
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:42.640]  shops and those black-owned shops gave them the products they wanted then you
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.520]  would have black communities again by the way before segregation ended I'm not
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:49.480]  defending segregation the media always says somebody brings this up you're
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:53.480]  defending and I'm not I'm talking about facts here they replace one evil with
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:57.120]  another blacks did own their own shops their own restaurants their own hotels
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.720]  their own bars their own country clubs they're on everything and they were
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:06.200]  getting extremely economically powerful their own universities and so the
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.840]  Democratic Party of the Ku Klux Klan is all on record there's lbj letters came
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.840]  in and took it over and brought money in and community organizers and took you
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.840]  over and did a job on you and now they're going to do a job on everybody
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:32.120]  else with a gangster sick you know murder cop killer culture so that the
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:38.160]  whole country becomes a giant prison that's the game plan you want to be
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:42.560]  successful learn how to be polite learn how to be honorable learn how to dress
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:47.600]  nice learn how to show up on work on time and you will rise in this society
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:53.960]  period may take five years may take ten years but not if you get a big fat
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:58.080]  criminal record which they want you to get yeah the systems predatory yeah the
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.360]  system wants to destabilize the black community and it's not going to Larry
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:05.840]  Elder I could see from his perspective what he's saying about Iraq because he
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:09.680]  believes in the system no the West destabilized Arab nations the West
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.040]  overthrew Mohammed Mosaddek in 53 who was pro-America but wanted to keep the oil
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.720]  money for their people and turn them into an Americanized rich country and so our
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:23.880]  government overthrew him not our government in total but the criminals
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:29.080]  that run it the same government that has MTV deploying gangster hip-hop targeting
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:34.600]  non-inner-city kids I don't call it you'll care what color they are let me
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:38.920]  tell you all the inner-city mannerisms all the thug culture there's a thug
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:42.600]  culture and white people thug culture and black people you name it your kids
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:46.840]  starts adopting that they'll adopt the friends they'll adopt the culture they'll
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:53.520]  end up in jail you want to be successful stay away from anything on MTV you want
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:57.000]  to be successful stay away from anything that the public schools are
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:04.400]  promoting anything that you see on television all the whole agenda the whole
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:08.720]  agenda be selfish only care about yourself be narcissistic the whole
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:12.800]  society is coming down folks and those of us that work hard keep our head
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.240]  screwed on straight we better start joining together and supporting each
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:19.520]  other you better support libertarian media you better support folks that
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:27.680]  promote anti-communism and the rest of it because we have a hierarchical oligarchy
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:32.480]  that's totalitarian ruling over our culture we have rich ultra-rich that are
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:37.040]  offshore above the law tax exempt that wants socialism and collectivism and
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:44.280]  communism to control us to make us domesticated slaves it is the oligarchal

[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.600]  be indicted by a grand jury grand jury's in the state she lives can indict her
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.680]  for stuff like this if the feds won't do it and look at how they've indicted
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:07.880]  rick perry for following state law and threatening to withhold state funding
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:13.640]  of a state-funded program if the head of the group did not step down here in

[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:23.960]  for and everybody knows I'm not a big fan of Rick Perry he'd have been indicted
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:28.280]  for pushing merc vaccine and you could prove he got money then I'd be all for
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:31.960]  it quite frankly but they're attacking constitutional government when they do
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:38.200]  this but no as lowest learners not in any trouble no one remember a grand jury
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:47.600]  indicted bill clinton a grand jury started questioning him specifically and
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:53.920]  then it moved on to impeachment but nothing happened IRS destroys learners

[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.040]  doing by IRS yeah more proof of a criminal conspiracy to cover all this up

[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:12.680]  to talk about the earthquake go ahead hi Alex I've got some very interesting
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:17.240]  information for your audience did you know that Mel Gibson before he was
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:24.840]  shot down in Hollywood was trying to make a movie about Fatima I did know
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:29.280]  that he was making a movie about that yes and do you know what the crux of it
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:35.000]  was it was that the third secret of Fatima portended a natural disaster would
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:41.400]  affect the entire planet I knew he was working on that I know that's what some
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:46.520]  of the Catholics that follow that believe but I think Mel Gibson did get
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:51.200]  ganged up on but I think he kind of shot himself down being drunk and you know
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.280]  saying some of those things I mean you know that that is and then what he did
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:59.840]  with his his wife have you heard those recordings and I'm not I mean again I
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.320]  know the Gibson family I'm not gonna get into it I've liked Mel Gibson I like
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:10.760]  his family they're good people I just think that maybe they did go after as
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:15.320]  he's making that I don't know what do you think well I tried to get a question
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.680]  to you on your Sunday show my theory is as well supported that the terrorism was
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.000]  created to get us under control before this natural disaster they know is
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.720]  coming oh yeah you call next we cut you off that's right well undoubtedly they
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:35.120]  feel like they need total control because society is big and complex and
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:40.360]  there's a lot of danger and I could see some control and contingency plans for
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:44.920]  natural disasters or whatever the case is the problem is the globalist or
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.040]  predatory they've stolen their money they're trying to dumb people down so
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.880]  they have bad will like there's goodwill you and then you do something wrong but
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.600]  was done in goodwill still a problem the globalists are very bad people and of
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.680]  the last folks that I want running things that's that's my perspective on
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:11.280]  that Luciferians we know that and they know their their time is short and they
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:17.280]  know this disaster is coming and they've got to get control of us before they
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:21.360]  retreat down into their underground bunkers to write thing out I know this
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:24.320]  they've never been building more bunkers than now worldwide the elites acting
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.400]  like it's the end of the world or something and they're digging in
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:31.360]  everywhere and they're just don't care what we think anymore and stuff is
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:36.320]  getting weird I agree with you and the super volcano is showing all the signs
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:41.000]  it's active again in Yellowstone and it will basically destroy most the country
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:47.360]  if it goes off I'm not saying that's gonna happen but it is a possibility they
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:51.240]  have shark warnings in Florida when you might get a few dozen people bit on the
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.040]  foot every year maybe one person killed a year off the coast of Florida they have
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:59.640]  shark flags for an imaginary threat but but then if you talk about earthquakes
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:04.600]  you're a weirdo when earthquakes kill hundreds of thousands a year I mean
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:09.280]  tsunamis kill tens of thousands a year and you talk about it all shut up
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:15.640]  fair monger we already had a reactor hit by a tsunami and an earthquake and four
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:20.080]  of the five react of the six reactors totally blew up the fifth was damaged
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:26.600]  and the media covered that up I mean it's just crazy town and I just want
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:30.600]  these reactors shut down that are on fault lines if they want to build new
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:35.240]  modern safer ones somewhere else that's fine just stop building up on every
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.680]  fault line you look at a map of reactors it's like they only build them on
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:43.120]  fault lines it's like a crazy person or the devil I guess this one they're
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:47.280]  really worried about is in the oblo canyons I guess we're gonna come back
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:53.200]  with more calls stay with us we're on the March the empire is on the run Alex
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:30:02.360]  Jones and the GC I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:07.000]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.720]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so

[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:25.440]  all the police state news that's going on around every time I hear somebody talk
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:30.000]  about it they always start with the same opening statement not all police are
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:36.040]  bad but I mean every day it's a new story what was it this weekend the cop
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:40.920]  that was the serial rapist you know when they learn these cops have to go and
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:46.680]  riot patrol or put people down they don't say look all these protesters 90%
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.800]  are good there's only 10% bad no man they you know remember the video where
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:53.880]  they shot the lady with the rubber bullet through the sign they're all
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:59.360]  high-fiving every time you put that hesitation you know what there's some
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:04.120]  most cops are good you know hey they might be but where are they I see no
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.440]  videos I you know I hear them I don't hear any of them coming out oh well
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:14.720]  they might lose their job well if you choose money over during what's right
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:20.840]  then you're just as bad as the evil I mean if they want to step up take a stand
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.520]  say I'm a cop but I don't agree with any of this come out publicly do it great
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.400]  don't be good guy but as long as they you let's go to Star Wars man you can't be
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:38.120]  part of the rebellion and serve the Empire it's impossible I hear what
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:42.480]  you're saying and if you turn into my show ten years ago you was hearing me
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.040]  just yelling and screaming about the police being authoritarian thugs and
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:50.320]  being militarized and predicting everything that would come I know it
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:56.120]  better than anybody what I'm saying is it has been federalization federal
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:01.120]  standards and federal training that have brought us to this point the
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:04.560]  militarization the us against them mentality but you also have the
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.720]  degeneration of the general public and so that's another big manifestation that
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:16.000]  you're seeing inside of the police departments as well and so we'll get a
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.480]  lot further with the police pointing this out from an outside the box spectrum
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:28.280]  then trying to debate it from within either cops are good or cops are bad we
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:33.400]  have a system where the establishment is preparing the country for collapse and
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:38.120]  out of that collapse they will bring the new social order which I like to use
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:46.040]  George Arwell's term is a oligarchal collectivism or a tiny elite using
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:51.840]  collectivism to enslave and control the public a new royalty because what is
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:55.200]  serfdom it's a form of collectivism for the general public with the elite
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.960]  exempt all over the world they've militarized police all over the world
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.520]  they've gone after free speech all over the world they're censoring the internet
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.680]  all over the world it's a global standardized program and they intend for
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.680]  us to have clashes with the police so they give the police the training and
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:16.720]  the missions that will make the public hate them they tell the police attack
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:21.640]  the press and then lie about it and then they begin to be seen as an occupying
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:27.120]  enemy so I'm here just explaining the whole narrative separately I've had
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:32.920]  police send me some of the best info we've gotten over the years both federal
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:39.520]  and local local from different parts of the country I have had military give us
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.000]  some of the best information the military is the most awake group out
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.280]  there period there's not even any yardstick so as bad as the military's
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:52.440]  mission is with its leadership it's the most awake good group because they're
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  so close to it secondarily the most awake group that I've seen and I've
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:04.080]  witnessed not just myself or from others is police so it's a paradox it's
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:09.760]  it's it's an oxymoron because they know I'm not lying because they're in the
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:14.520]  middle of it and it's always like that why do you think Hitler went after the
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:18.880]  police and military when he first got in to make sure he had it all in line why
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.920]  do you think the Soviets did that or the communists in in China or the or the
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.960]  or others the Talitarians or every time there was a coup in Rome they would wipe
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:32.680]  out the whole group under them I'm communicating to the police that I
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:35.520]  believe they're smart enough to understand this a decompartmental eyes
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:41.840]  and understand that they will be thrown away once this thing comes into place
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:46.240]  and to let them see how the globalists are manipulating it if we just come out
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:50.000]  and say we're in a police state I mean I'm Mr. Police State folks I'm known for
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.920]  exposing it I made four films on it it then plays into the us against them
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:59.320]  psychology but if we look at the big picture it will change all of that
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:05.320]  another problem is society is in a depression we now have cell phones and
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:11.680]  cameras so we're seeing things bad cops have been doing forever we're now just
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:17.320]  learning about it so it's a perception that it's getting worse I mean I think
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:23.600]  it's gotten worse in some ways better in some others cities vary some cities the
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:28.960]  police are just unbelievably corrupt the public scared of them they don't care
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:37.480]  other cities they're more you know Mayberry RFD it's just that as the
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.600]  police go and as the military goes so much of the will the country in the
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.280]  world go and I do see I mean look the problem is cities coming out with
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.080]  microphones under federal grants listening to people do we blame the cops
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:56.120]  for that do we blame the cops for having an ordinance against skateboarding down
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:01.240]  the sidewalk so they arrest people no you should change the law people when I'm
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:04.640]  at Barton Springs say Alex get you know the cops are here writing his tickets
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:10.760]  for our dogs off a leash they are sent there by the Barton Springs management
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:16.440]  the aquatics department I checked into it they go and complain to the city to
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:22.000]  tell the police chief to tell the captain that Barton Springs doesn't want
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.160]  competition with people using the free part of the Springs and so the city is
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:31.280]  sending cops who look like they hate their job to write people tickets for
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:35.480]  their dogs off a leash we should change the ordinance and designate that and off
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.840]  the leash park so when I'm there once a week or something with my kids people
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:44.680]  when I walk by Alex Alex through the fence because I'll be in the paid part
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:49.560]  they don't have my dogs with me and because I want to swim lapses deeper
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.680]  and they'll say do something do something they're writing his tickets every day
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:56.320]  they're harassing everybody and I said you need to go to the city council you
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:00.400]  to make an issue out of this and have this declared a dog part the greedy
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.000]  evil city council and the people running the aquatics department who aren't
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.320]  even bad themselves the bunch of our listeners they are literally government
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.520]  sees the free area of the Barton Creek spring coming out into the Colorado
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:20.280]  River they call Lady Bird Lake they see that as a something they don't control I
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.520]  mean for years they wouldn't let you swim in the in the lazy Colorado River
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:30.520]  which is great swimming from the dam down even though you've you lived in a
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:34.240]  house past that you could swim in the lake there was no danger no problem I've
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:38.640]  had cops sit there and say hey I'm gonna write you a ticket for swimming and I
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:42.900]  just go oh come on you know there's the wrong with this lake I'm you know this
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:47.880]  river I'm here's women and I'll laugh at them and say you really want to have a
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:52.560]  big circus go get a dive team and fish me out and then they walk off because
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:56.840]  these will go right tickets to somebody else now if I challenged them and said
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.280]  you can't catch me I'm a gingerbread man they'd probably go get a helicopter or
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:03.680]  something but just laughing at him saying come on man you know what people
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:09.920]  complained they've now designated areas of swimming areas on the river so it's us
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:14.720]  demanding us not playing games us not going along with the fluoride in the
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.160]  water or any of it Austin will have the fluoride out of it when we start suing
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:23.480]  every city council member that's against it when we stop playing mr. nice guy
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:28.360]  when we go oh you add a chemical bought from a Florida company that has
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:31.960]  hundreds of other compounds in it so you're not just put the fluoride in our
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:36.240]  water that Harvard says gives us cancer and brain damage you're putting other
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.680]  stuff in it in violation of the law you have to clean it before it goes but then
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:44.800]  at the last stage you put this in you claim some federal mandate waiver we're
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:49.080]  gonna sue you I can't do all the fighting that's what I tell people I
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:54.720]  can't go down to the city council and wage some crusader jihad for two years
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:59.480]  to make them make this a dog park and let you have your dogs off the leash and
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:04.520]  stick signs there it's been a dog park since I was three years old down there
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:11.520]  visiting my grandparents okay it should be a dog park the damn excuse me the
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:17.240]  city of Austin should stop it but it is a microcosm of the whole thing but do I
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:27.000]  just go oh there's the cops I hate them now no it doesn't do anything and does
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.960]  that mean I'm perfect one day I saw the cops down there when it rained a bunch
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:38.880]  earlier in the year this was last year now on the Barton Creek Trail and people
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:42.560]  were down there with their kayaks and the city had put some swimming band on
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:45.760]  there from two weeks before when it flooded there was no flooding it was
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:49.400]  crystal clear they had cops down there in mass I guess to make money just
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:53.400]  writing tickets to people that were kayaking or swimming and I was just
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:58.920]  gonna throw up I said you're disgusting and I basically said write me a ticket
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:06.360]  and I was jumping in the water and they wouldn't give me one so I get why you're
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:12.000]  angry but we need to change it not just complain about it burning down some
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:16.880]  business doesn't change it we need to change it every day I'm sorry I got a
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:20.120]  lot of callers to go to I'm ranting Robert but is that I mean what do you
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:25.280]  say to that I yeah man I agree with you like I said I've never agreed to call in
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:28.960]  business but it's almost like jury notification what would change the law
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.600]  faster everybody voting or a police force would come and say it same look
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:38.480]  we're not stealing people's money writing tickets for swimming which would
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:47.760]  change that law faster it's you know you're right the police forces not
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.640]  writing tickets and they go well it's the law they knew people didn't go check
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:55.920]  with the city that they weren't supposed to be swimming in the creek and the
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:58.800]  cops should have shown up the first day of they care when it was flooding by the
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:01.680]  way they didn't I was down there hiking they didn't show up when it was flooding
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:06.200]  and all cool like a jungle they showed up two weeks later when it's all sunny so
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:09.720]  they go down and write tickets to people I know it's disgusting foreign bankers
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:14.320]  are robbing the country the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs to fly but
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.520]  citizens do I mean look the country complies the country acts like chumps
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:24.080]  the country bows to any type of government authority and so they're
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:30.940]  running wild on us all I'm saying is I've seen cops in Austin other areas
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:35.280]  bugging their eyes out at me swaggering around I walk over sometimes on camera
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:39.440]  no you're really swaggering like you're a big bully in high school you know what's
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:43.640]  your problem and usually it's so alien to them they just freak out and smile and
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:49.440]  walk off real quick because people are so cowardly so I get it police forces
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.400]  shouldn't be hiring mentally ill thugs a lot of more a lot of forces are run by
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:58.600]  mentally ill people and the country's listen they're all gonna find out when
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:02.080]  the whole country goes belly up which we're getting very very close to right
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:07.800]  now we're getting very very close to that right now and my goodness let me
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.120]  tell you when when the welfare checks don't show up or when there's a major
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:15.920]  earthquake in California the cops can't and won't protect you and it's gonna be
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:19.360]  up to you to protect yourselves I appreciate your call speaking of that

[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:46.560]  I like it it's it's not flavor but I call it the flavor of the water the taste
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:50.040]  of the water I liked that particular 500 year-old spring that they've been

[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:06.200]  results for me as far as my mental clarity goes and I actually called for a
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:11.160]  number of reasons regarding the 1984 and I'm actually a grad student at Texas
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:15.840]  A&M University Kingsville mastering and accounting and I'm actually going to be
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.520]  having a weekly radio show kind of similar to yours and talking about some
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:22.640]  of the same things because we have a college radio station down there where
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:28.120]  they let the students know yes and you guys are doing a heck of a job I just
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:32.240]  wanted to let you know that I was going to be doing that and regarding 1984 you
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:36.840]  were bringing up some key elements and I wanted to add to what you're saying you
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.320]  know how they talk about the telescreen that follows Winston around with the
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.320]  two eyes the records everything you say you do and you can use it as a
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:47.800]  communication device you can use it to get the news oh wait does it sound like
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:52.800]  a smartphone it's already here and another thing that they illustrate is
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:56.640]  called the memory hole where they talk about news whether you put news in or
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:01.360]  out and big brother decides whether it was good or bad you can delete stuff he
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:03.960]  controls the past controls the future controls the present controls the past
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:09.600]  time stamps isn't that Facebook Twitter social media do you see that I like
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.240]  there is it just me yes and they're able through Google and through Bing
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.520]  Microsoft all of them to go in and put in fake time stamps disappear what they
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:23.840]  want change things real-time just like they can have fraud with DNA they can
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:29.560]  have fraud with biometrics all of this is making us less secure not more
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:34.800]  secure and it's being driven by a globalist intelligence a globalist
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:43.160]  mindset a globalist ball a globalist constellation of oligarchal totalitarian
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:48.120]  collectivist and another thing you mentioned was the double-think
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.440]  principle and how it's the art of holding two contradictory thoughts in the
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.560]  mind and simultaneously accepting both of them that's called
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:01.360]  crime stop yes it's a crime to think bad of government or the state so even if
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:04.800]  they lie to you you've got to hold both in your head at the same time we've
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.080]  never been at war with Syria we've always been at war with Syria Syria is
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:14.600]  al-Qaeda now Syria is fighting al-Qaeda 2 plus 2 equals 5 but if a
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:19.280]  mathematician needs to navigate a ship it's okay to say 2 plus 2 equals 4
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:23.680]  exactly and the deeper meaning that they're doing this to Alex playing on
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:28.920]  the subconscious and on the subatomic level a little bit from what I see what
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:32.000]  one of the reasons they're doing this that they dump people down to the
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.440]  points where they're so socially engineered that they're born into
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:39.760]  bondage it's almost like when it if they it says that they have nothing to
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:42.440]  compare freedom to and then they'll probably like that's right they've
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.080]  reduced the language down so much through insoc that people can't even be
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:49.280]  communicated with it's like trying to communicate with a sheep not to go into
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.440]  a slaughter pin it doesn't speak English it doesn't communicate with you it
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.880]  doesn't understand that's what they're doing it is they have people adapting in
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:02.920]  the slivering silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:06.080]  one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver

[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:39.720]  all I'm saying about the police is this the globalists want us to hate them they
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:45.280]  want us to get in fights with them while telling us comply all day so that
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:50.160]  they can continue to have an us against them mentality and they've had the police
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:54.080]  arresting people with video cameras the police violating all sorts of people's
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:55:00.320]  rights clearly the direction and the education of the police is towards an
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:06.720]  authoritarian to tell a terry and state but that's coming from the top down we
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.280]  will get a lot more done at pointing that out and dealing with that with their
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:16.040]  bosses and saying you're the ones in charge of this you need to be held
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:21.160]  accountable instead of all these city and county and state and federal leaders
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.200]  acting like the police are all just doing this on their own look at this
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:31.400]  headline out of the Tampa Bay Times neighbor calls cops on boys lemonade
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:39.520]  stand boys entrepreneurial spirit rankled at least one neighbor now who's bad
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:46.160]  who's bad the cops are the neighbor that called the police well the neighbor is a
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:50.880]  horrible person in my view and the police are idiots too because in a lot of
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:55.240]  cities you can't get the cops out for serious crimes I had a car stolen in
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:58.640]  Dallas and they said we don't come out for cars being stolen I said okay thank
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:02.560]  you hung the phone up in Dallas cops showed up saying why'd you hang the phone
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:07.480]  up and they walked into the apartment my girlfriend's apartment I had a girlfriend
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:10.840]  in Dallas back from high school I was going back to visitor I was like 20 years
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:16.320]  old very nice young ladies you can imagine drives of Dallas from Austin and
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:21.240]  those cops came in we're like looking around so believe me I get it you call
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.480]  the cops need to help you get in trouble but neighbors call cops on boys
[02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:30.120]  lemonade stand it seemed like a scene out of a Norman Rockwell painting TJ
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.800]  served cookies and strawberry country time and his lemonade stand with a wave
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:40.280]  and a smile well that's till the police showed up told them you got to have a
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:44.640]  permit to do that she they want you trained to be based basically political
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:50.680]  slaves here's another one man dies after being tased by police in Florida they
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:54.680]  increased the power of the tasers the last three years they were already was
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:58.880]  already killing hundreds a year now more dying why do they taser you for
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:04.840]  lesser reasons now why are the tasers more powerful there's smoke see we should
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:13.640]  look at that but just hating the police is going to do nothing let's go ahead and
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:16.800]  go back to your calls Kelly in Texas thanks for holding
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.760]  John bless your brother I'm part of the resistance up here in the panhandle of
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  Texas and regardless he's talking about the moving bird team to Canada I work in
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:31.960]  refinery up here old refinery have for the last 31 years before that I worked
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:36.360]  in a steel mill in Pueblo Colorado that shut down due to as they say foreign
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:41.720]  trade which is true because they moved all the steel mills overseas and they're
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:44.960]  in the process of doing the same thing with that's right they have carbon rules
[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:50.560]  here where we can't make steel but everybody in India and China can exactly
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:53.160]  and they're doing the same thing with our oil refineries we haven't built a
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:57.200]  refinery in this country since the 70s that's right and John had just put one
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:02.760]  online here about three years ago as 1.2 million barrel a day charge and they
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:06.920]  are shipping refined gasoline to our east coast and offloading it that's right
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:15.560]  on one of our it is strategic military shutdown of America keep going and I'm
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:19.600]  telling these young guys I'll work with it they'll be lucky if they have a job in
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:24.240]  15 years this refinery is still there because they are systematically moving
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.120]  everything out this country just like they did in Wales there's a deal like
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:30.240]  this Wales that makes it away with all the industry in Wales now there's three

[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.480]  get convicted of a hate law which would restrict free speech well the death
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:39.200]  penalty is as much as you can do to somebody but I've got the statistics
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:43.000]  from the Justice Department they don't publicize them for every racial attack
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:47.920]  whites on blacks there's at least 10 times black racial attacks on whites
