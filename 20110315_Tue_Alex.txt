[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:31.920]  Texas Alex Jones thank you for joining us it is very dire times right now for
[00:31.920 --> 00:37.280]  Japan and the rest of the world as the government of Japan and the media has
[00:37.280 --> 00:45.480]  now stopped denying the magnitude of the greatest nuclear disaster in world
[00:45.480 --> 00:51.120]  history that is now unfolding thank you for joining us it is the 15th day of
[00:51.120 --> 00:55.920]  March the Ides of March when Julius Caesar was killed in the Roman Senate a
[00:55.920 --> 01:05.420]  day known for 2040 plus years as a day of bad luck and it certainly is a ill
[01:05.420 --> 01:15.000]  omen time that we are in right now it is Tuesday March 15th 2011 we are live
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.040]  and we have dr. Bob Bowman nuclear physicist three degrees in nuclear
[01:20.040 --> 01:24.480]  physics former head of the Star Wars program joining us coming up in the
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.880]  middle of the next hour then we have blogger and syndicated talk show host
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.440]  Owen JJ Stone who's here for South by Southwest joining us the last 30 minutes
[01:34.440 --> 01:40.240]  to talk about the TSA sticking their hands down his pants and all the new
[01:40.240 --> 01:46.280]  information that's come out with the federal takeover known as the TSA also
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.320]  the other huge news the White House had signaled several months ago they were
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.600]  going to roll out an anti-gun agenda they have indeed done that dealing with
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.400]  gun registration and the expanded tracking of firearms and the restriction
[02:00.400 --> 02:05.760]  of how many firearms you can purchase by executive Fiat the Justice Department
[02:05.760 --> 02:12.200]  in the last five months has been ordering outside of law in Texas New
[02:12.200 --> 02:18.520]  Mexico Arizona Nevada and California ordering gun dealers to call them when
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.280]  someone buys a semi-automatic firearm Obama is now trying to push to make that
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.520]  law headline Obama starts pushing gun control another headline Obama pins
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.280]  op-ed calling for better gun sale background checks blaming it all on
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.840]  Mexico and we need to turn our eyes now to what came out about three weeks ago
[02:39.840 --> 02:49.600]  that the ATF has been caught on record shipping firearms into Mexico to then
[02:49.600 --> 02:53.800]  trace them back to the United States that's even CBS news in fact I never
[02:53.800 --> 02:58.000]  played that news clip from two weeks ago please dig that CBS up and please print
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.640]  me all the old articles dealing with the ATF caught shipping guns into Mexico
[03:02.640 --> 03:07.800]  this is a false flag attack on the Second Amendment now that said that's
[03:07.800 --> 03:13.040]  coming up later in the third hour but we can't let the nuclear meltdown
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.760]  disaster be an overall distraction from what's happening to the economy what's
[03:17.760 --> 03:21.440]  happening in North Africa the Middle East what's happening with the dollar
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.560]  what's happening with the domestic police state what's happening in our
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.080]  economy we're gonna be breaking it all down today when we come back from break
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.200]  I'm gonna try to compose myself I got a little wild yesterday because there was
[03:34.200 --> 03:39.000]  a lot of media denial and government denial about what was unfolding when I
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.400]  saw Fukushima one blow up on Saturday there was little doubt in my mind that
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.200]  it was gonna expose the containment vessel studied the designs of these
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.080]  reactors they're online they're public they're designed to take a 7.0 direct hit
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.760]  number 9.1 direct hit as they took then yesterday morning when Fukushima number
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.760]  three a mark 1 plutonium driven reactor blew thousands of feet in the air in
[04:05.760 --> 04:11.760]  seconds I said there's no way that that didn't damage the containment vessel and
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.920]  of course they're now announcing it did another reactor at Fukushima and I
[04:16.920 --> 04:20.160]  disagreed with Dr. Bowman yesterday when he said well three of the reactors were
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.400]  successfully shut down I said explosions of this magnitude just looking at it
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.160]  it's so explosive how fast that explosion went up upwards of 3,000 feet in
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.360]  seconds that shows incredible power you don't need to be a demolitions expert to
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.480]  know that though I've interviewed so many and studied it so much I have a
[04:38.480 --> 04:42.160]  layman's understanding of it that that would damage the surrounding reactors
[04:42.160 --> 04:48.360]  number four which is a shut down reactor has now been exposed multiple
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.320]  meltdowns of three of the reactors have occurred and they're now having to admit
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.320]  that more deadly types of radiation are leaking and blowing directly towards
[04:56.320 --> 05:02.160]  Tokyo will break it all down on the other side stay with us hundreds of
[05:02.160 --> 05:06.360]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[05:06.360 --> 05:11.400]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.000]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home have tremendous
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[05:25.400 --> 05:30.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.720]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.440]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.440 --> 05:42.400]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.400 --> 05:48.040]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[05:48.040 --> 05:53.640]  Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[05:53.640 --> 06:00.280]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this
[06:00.280 --> 06:03.760]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[06:03.760 --> 06:07.760]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.760 --> 06:12.000]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.280]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.280 --> 06:20.640]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.640 --> 06:24.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.720 --> 06:29.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.400 --> 06:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.400 --> 06:41.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.200 --> 06:43.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.880]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[06:48.880 --> 06:53.000]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.440]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:59.440 --> 07:04.960]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[07:04.960 --> 07:09.400]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[07:09.400 --> 07:13.840]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even
[07:13.840 --> 07:17.240]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[07:17.240 --> 07:21.520]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[07:21.520 --> 07:25.440]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's
[07:25.440 --> 07:29.320]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.800]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.480]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[07:37.480 --> 07:41.560]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[07:41.560 --> 07:45.280]  online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.720]  can take to protect yourself you can find the video at WWW dot end of

[08:00.800 --> 08:06.120]  is communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[08:06.120 --> 08:16.200]  there's a war on for your mind it is the eyes of March it is the 15th day of
[08:16.200 --> 08:24.600]  March 2011 on this live Tuesday edition Dr. Bob Bowman nuclear physicist will
[08:24.600 --> 08:30.800]  be joining us three degrees in nuclear physics will be joining us to give us
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.760]  expert analysis coming up the middle of the next hour today we're working on
[08:35.760 --> 08:39.400]  getting some other nuclear physicists on the broadcast to give us different
[08:39.400 --> 08:46.200]  perspectives as well today and tomorrow right through into the weekend and as
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.880]  things continue to unfold we may even do special nighttime transmissions that
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.800]  are streamed at prison planet dot TV and info wars dot com we'll be posting those
[08:56.800 --> 09:00.640]  announcements at info wars dot com and sending them over the Genesis satellites
[09:00.640 --> 09:04.840]  if stations want to carry the special reports I just want to put that out
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.480]  there we're not sure if we're gonna do them yet but the winds gyrate over Japan
[09:09.480 --> 09:16.280]  from the northeast and northwest prevailing out to see into the trade
[09:16.280 --> 09:21.600]  winds and jet stream towards the United States west coast California Oregon
[09:21.600 --> 09:27.800]  Washington then above that the western coast of Canada that is the direct line
[09:27.800 --> 09:31.480]  of the fallout it comes in in central California the jet stream turns up and
[09:31.480 --> 09:34.920]  runs up the coast all the way into Canada and then back down through Illinois
[09:34.920 --> 09:41.480]  down into Colorado turning into Oklahoma there is strontium there is
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.840]  cesium there is radioactive iodine being released in massive levels that's now
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.720]  confirmed we're gonna go over all the mainstream media reports the plutonium
[09:50.720 --> 09:57.040]  uranium-based mark one as you know blew up spectacularly yesterday no doubt that
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.760]  damage in my mind the containment vessel I mean the explosion was so horrific
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.640]  and moved so quickly that gives you an idea of the measurement of the blast
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.080]  rate pounds per square inch and we're also gonna get some demolition experts
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.080]  on separately who've been looking at that blast but studying Oklahoma city
[10:17.080 --> 10:21.800]  studying 9-11 with the experts over the years we've gained some knowledge of
[10:21.800 --> 10:27.400]  this and then now it is confirmed that the blast at Fukushima 3 was so big that
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.240]  it damaged the shut down reactor but it's got the rods in there at Fukushima
[10:33.240 --> 10:40.520]  4 a uranium reactor and it has now begun to melt down and there's two other
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.920]  reactors separate from the Fukushima 6 nuclear reactors that are also in the
[10:45.920 --> 10:50.240]  process of melting down and the Japanese government has had a big backlash from
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.680]  the population saying stop lying and so now they're talking about this being an
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.680]  absolute disaster we pray that the uranium and plutonium does not get out
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.520]  but now they're kind of easing the news out to the people that uh-oh we think
[11:04.520 --> 11:11.600]  one or more of the reactor containment systems at 4 and 3 may be exposed
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.760]  ladies and gentlemen if plutonium gets out of there it makes uranium look like
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.200]  mother's milk it is so deadly one microscopic micron of it in your lungs
[11:23.200 --> 11:31.040]  you are deader than a hammer we have got to pray for the people of Japan and the
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.920]  winds have now turned to the south and are driving it into Tokyo and the
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.240]  radiation detectors are going off let me just read to you some of the headlines
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.320]  here my friends and I'm it's unfortunate to be right again Friday
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.160]  Saturday Sunday Monday and to be ridiculed but I've studied other nuclear
[11:51.160 --> 11:57.240]  disasters in depth because there is a reactor facility in Austin an
[11:57.240 --> 12:01.240]  experimental reactor a large reactor and a smaller experimental reactor at the
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.700]  JJ Pickle research facility in north Austin and if I'm gonna live around one
[12:05.700 --> 12:09.480]  of these things I want to know about it and the first thing they pick up is
[12:09.480 --> 12:16.960]  cesium and strontium and radioactive iodide and those are all spewing out of
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.160]  Fukushima and they don't even know specifically which one because they have
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.640]  evacuated the 500 workers from the plant there's only 50 there it's a death
[12:27.640 --> 12:37.480]  sentence and now the Japanese Prime Minister has ordered the workers back
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.040]  in to try to stave off the emergency as Gerald Salente has been proven right yet
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.800]  again he said come on you're seeing giant explosions all over the place two
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.720]  more explosions last night first they said one now they're saying two but it
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.400]  happened in the night so there's not good video of it so we don't really know
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.960]  the magnitude of the situation and Gerald pointed out he said there's no
[12:58.960 --> 13:02.360]  way people are gonna stay in there even though the Japanese are knowing known
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.280]  for being very valiant and stoic and having a lot of courage and you have to
[13:06.280 --> 13:11.680]  commend them for absolutely no known looting going on very genteel cultured
[13:11.680 --> 13:17.000]  civilized people can you imagine watching the footage of black friday
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.160]  when everybody goes out to shop when they have the tax-free day with the
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.000]  riots and people being trampled to death and and and the rioting when
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.640]  people don't get their welfare checks on time 43 million Americans on food stamps
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.960]  in the wonders of globalism and you imagine a disaster like this in the US
[13:34.960 --> 13:38.800]  how people would be behaving I will guarantee you it would not be like the
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.200]  Japanese I'm not trying to bass America but we have turned into a bunch of
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.600]  decadent slobs on average and we should really learn from the Japanese in the
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.480]  way they're handling this we have to commend them Japan Adam plant main
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.720]  vessel may be damaged IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency an
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.760]  explosion on Monday at Japan's disaster hit nuclear plant may have damaged the
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.960]  primary containment vessel of one reactor unit now the reporting could be
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.040]  to the Vienna base UN nuclear watchdog said the International Atomic Energy
[14:14.040 --> 14:20.000]  Agency said the explosion Fukushima Daiachi unit to may have affected the
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.320]  integrity of its primary containment vessel they're also reporting for which
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.840]  was shut down is now experiencing meltdown because of the explosions around
[14:28.840 --> 14:32.760]  it I mean what do you think is going to happen the IAEA said primary containment
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.680]  vessels unit one and three appeared intact spied explosions there it said
[14:37.680 --> 14:47.280]  units at the Fukushima and Anowaya and Tokai nuclear plants were in safe and
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.080]  stable condition okay so we have that report there here's another one that
[14:52.080 --> 14:57.360]  another Reuters report Japan says unsure of nuclear reactor vessel is damaged
[14:57.360 --> 15:00.840]  and I've got other reports are saying they believe that it has been partially
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.600]  unsealed but again that is not confirmed let's hope and pray that's not the case
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.960]  but you've seen the explosions and there's been more now Japan's nuclear
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.580]  safety agency said it was unsure of a fresh explosion and it's quake-stricken
[15:14.580 --> 15:19.480]  nuclear power plant on Tuesday has damaged one of the reactor containment
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.440]  vessels the vessel of the Fukushima complex number two reactor contains fuel
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.200]  rods in danger of melting down development that experts say could cause
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.720]  a major radiation leak if the containment vessels thick vessel walls were
[15:32.720 --> 15:37.400]  breached and again I've been watching listening to the news there's a lot of
[15:37.400 --> 15:45.160]  more dire statements being made again about one three two and four including
[15:45.160 --> 15:53.440]  a containment vessel at four but they're not sure as of right now here are
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.280]  some of the other news reports in order we're gonna go through these London
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.560]  telegraph Japan crisis third explosion raises specter of nuclear nightmare
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.600]  similar to headlines we wrote last night ahead of this the new explosion at
[16:06.600 --> 16:12.000]  Fukushima plant as engineers fought to prevent a meltdown in the second worst
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.360]  nuclear accident in history they're not saying it is the second worst at Richard
[16:16.360 --> 16:19.560]  Noble and if it continues to unfold will be far worse than Chernobyl a huge
[16:19.560 --> 16:22.600]  explosion had another reactor at the earthquake damaged really the tsunami
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.400]  damaged Japanese nuclear power plant early Tuesday so it's just ongoing the
[16:28.400 --> 16:32.440]  third blast since Saturday the plant operator said there was a huge explosion
[16:32.440 --> 16:39.640]  between 6 a.m. 2100 Greenwich meantime and 615 a.m. at the number two reactor
[16:39.640 --> 16:44.960]  and Fukushima number one nuclear power plant a Tokyo electric power co-spokesman
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.920]  said and again I have another report here saying that the explosions from other
[16:48.920 --> 16:52.840]  reactors may have damaged number four the government also reported apparent
[16:52.840 --> 16:57.720]  damage a part of the container shielding the same reactor at Fukushima 250
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.680]  kilometers or 155 miles northeast of Tokyo and previously the wind was going
[17:02.680 --> 17:10.320]  basically out to sea to the two towards the United States to the east now it is
[17:10.320 --> 17:17.680]  changed to the south blowing it down over Tokyo and there are reports that the
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.680]  radiation is climbing there though they're saying that it's safe if you
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.320]  only have brief exposure whatever that means kind of like they said the air was
[17:26.320 --> 17:30.800]  safe to breathe on 9-11 when they knew it was deadly filled with asbestos or
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.680]  kind of like they told the atomic soldiers it was safe but they're saying
[17:34.680 --> 17:38.920]  around the plant the radiation levels are climbing off the charts and they're
[17:38.920 --> 17:48.600]  now picking up strontium higher levels of cesium and radioactive iodine this is
[17:48.600 --> 17:54.920]  very serious continuing here is another headline out of Swiss info Japan braces
[17:54.920 --> 17:59.600]  for potential radiation catastrophe Japan faced a potential catastrophe on
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.840]  Tuesday after quake crippled nuclear power plant exploded and sent low levels
[18:03.840 --> 18:09.320]  of radiation floating towards Tokyo prompting some people to flee the
[18:09.320 --> 18:13.400]  capital as others to stock up on essential supplies they've also told
[18:13.400 --> 18:16.760]  people to stay indoors and to try to seal their windows that's actually good
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.680]  advice Prime Minister urged people within 30 kilometers of the facility a
[18:21.680 --> 18:25.640]  population of 140,000 remain indoors amid the world's most serious nuclear
[18:25.640 --> 18:32.200]  accidents in Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986 and it continues with the
[18:32.200 --> 18:39.320]  economic impact Tokyo shares in day down 11 sending the US stock market and
[18:39.320 --> 18:44.640]  other major stock markets down as well continuing Japan nuke plant may spray
[18:44.640 --> 18:49.000]  reactor by helicopter they're now going to the Chernobyl model trying to cover
[18:49.000 --> 18:58.360]  up the containment ponds that are used to recycle the radiation the strontium
[18:58.360 --> 19:04.440]  the cesium the radioactive iodine and other nasty derivatives of the process
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.560]  but they're saying the steam that's getting out is delivering the radioactive
[19:08.560 --> 19:13.200]  particles into the atmosphere and again blowing south towards Tokyo so they're
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.280]  going to try to go in now and dump different things on top of the
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.280]  different reactors very brave people that are going in via helicopter Tokyo
[19:20.280 --> 19:23.720]  electric power says it may use helicopters because of the risk of
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.960]  radiation contamination from approaching the pool directly air drops may also be
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.240]  more effective a Japanese official says the pool might be boiling raising the
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.080]  risk of water used to keep the fuel cool might evaporate officials are

[24:17.280 --> 24:21.480]  complex including the mark one number three reactor that blew sky high
[24:21.480 --> 24:27.920]  yesterday more explosions at reactor two overnight poll Joseph Watson has a new
[24:27.920 --> 24:33.840]  article just out at prisonplanet.com panic buying stocks of potassium iodine
[24:33.840 --> 24:41.000]  exhausted in the United States and we're getting also reports that FEMA has
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.080]  been in stores buying it up those are coming in from all over the country and
[24:45.080 --> 24:49.040]  when you get those confirmed reports of shop owners and others witnessing it you
[24:49.040 --> 24:53.280]  can bet it's happening you have any shop owners want to go on record though and
[24:53.280 --> 24:56.840]  send us emails to put in a story about where you work what you witnessed what
[24:56.840 --> 25:00.440]  happened and we certainly like to further document that but this article
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.680]  deals with the fact that all over the country including here in Austin we've
[25:04.680 --> 25:13.640]  confirmed it potassium iodate tablets iodine tablets the health food type from
[25:13.640 --> 25:20.960]  kelp, dulce and alfalfa all sold out health websites sold out readers struggle
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.920]  to find radiation fighting pills anywhere we're getting numerous reports
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.160]  from readers that stocks of potassium iodine which is used to prevent and
[25:30.160 --> 25:33.480]  protect the body against the effects of nuclear fallout are completely sold out
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.080]  across the United States in fact we'll put this prisonplanet.com article on
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.440]  screen for viewers checks of health supplement websites in the US also
[25:42.440 --> 25:46.720]  confirm that stocks are completely exhausted with the threat of radioactive
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.440]  particles from the stricken Fukushima nuclear complex drifting towards the
[25:50.440 --> 25:53.720]  United States and prevailing easterly winds many Americans are attempting to
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.040]  protect themselves by occurring potassium iodate which protects the
[25:58.040 --> 26:03.080]  thyroid gland from radiation and cancer caused by radioactive iodine you could
[26:03.080 --> 26:11.160]  see a photo screenshot of one of the packages IOSAT indications thyroid
[26:11.160 --> 26:18.240]  blocking in a radiation emergency only potassium iodine tablets USP 130
[26:18.240 --> 26:27.200]  milligrams so we're going to be going over that more in the broadcast today US
[26:27.200 --> 26:32.840]  manufacturers of potassium iodine have been swamped with demand reports CNN one
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.440]  Williamsburg Virginia based company has received hundreds if not thousands of
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.520]  calls for potential buyers in Asia as well as repeat US customers suddenly
[26:40.520 --> 26:45.560]  seeking to replenish their stockpiles of the drug the US government has said it
[26:45.560 --> 26:49.880]  will not stockpile any further supplies of potassium iodine which has only
[26:49.880 --> 26:53.440]  increased demand for Americans who are struggling to find it anywhere the
[26:53.440 --> 26:56.600]  federal government has never purchased enough to meet the standard there is
[26:56.600 --> 26:59.880]  currently only enough the medication available for populations living within
[26:59.880 --> 27:03.160]  10 miles of nuclear reactors in the United States according to US officials
[27:03.160 --> 27:09.720]  and an amount Alan Morris president of Ambex Inc. slams is being completely
[27:09.720 --> 27:15.960]  insufficient Morris points out the fact that fall out from the April 1986 Chernobyl
[27:15.960 --> 27:21.920]  disaster which was spread all around the northern hemisphere led to over a
[27:21.920 --> 27:25.960]  million deaths because of radiation poisoning according to some estimates
[27:25.960 --> 27:30.840]  causing thyroid cancer in children living in surrounding countries it's just
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.640]  been devastating that's a conservative estimate in the last last few decades
[27:34.640 --> 27:38.680]  that have died from that US drug companies are reporting a sudden
[27:38.680 --> 27:41.920]  increase in sales over-the-counter anti-radiation pills despite
[27:41.920 --> 27:46.240]  assurances from health officials that Americans are not at risk from Japanese
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.840]  nuclear reactors by the way I want to get Ben Fuchs the pharmacist to pop in
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.080]  briefly if you can at the start of the next hour jaren if you can get a hold of
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.680]  him just for about five minutes because I've gotten calls saying well look the
[28:01.680 --> 28:08.080]  radioactive iodine if it is coming this way some pharmacist or some people at
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.560]  health food stores we're just getting calls about this we haven't confirmed it
[28:10.560 --> 28:15.520]  are saying look the regular potassium iodine drops for thyroid health are in
[28:15.520 --> 28:21.520]  such low doses that it's not gonna help you but that's not what Ben Fuchs was
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.520]  saying when he was on the show so guys let's just try to get him on even if it
[28:26.520 --> 28:30.040]  has to be later in this hour but preferably next hour to specifically
[28:30.040 --> 28:37.480]  talk about the different doses that are in the over-the-counter kelp pills and
[28:37.480 --> 28:44.080]  also the iodine drops that are labeled for human consumption so we'll continue
[28:44.080 --> 28:50.920]  to look at that as it unfolds the article continues with a few emails that
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.200]  Paul Watson received quote I went to Whole Foods Market in Arlington Texas last
[28:55.200 --> 29:01.000]  night to get a bottle of kelp they were out totally out of potassium iodine they
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.520]  would they would not get a shipment of any by this Friday our people in this
[29:08.520 --> 29:12.480]  area more aware of what's going on in Japan and people in Austin I hope so
[29:12.480 --> 29:17.520]  respectfully Doug Doug I've been to the store and they're sold out just going to
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.920]  check my wife already bought a bunch more Tim Fruget yesterday went and bought

[29:30.880 --> 29:35.280]  certainly here in Austin and Fox News and CNN are reporting that they're sold
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.920]  out nationwide as well but we'll look at alternative ways to protect your
[29:38.920 --> 29:45.200]  thyroid from the radioactive iodine one of the biggest threats and that is the

[33:38.920 --> 33:42.240]  that's been released was worse than what they said that the crisis at the

[34:57.840 --> 35:04.720]  the country of Bahrain that borders them because of major rioting protesting
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.720]  insurrection happening there against that tyranny Saudi Arabian troops sent to
[35:09.720 --> 35:13.360]  Bahrain as protest escalate are we going to hear Hillary Clinton call for air
[35:13.360 --> 35:19.360]  strikes on Saudi Arabia because after all I mean if you if you take over in
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.400]  Egypt you're a patriot if you take over or try to take over in Libya you're a
[35:24.400 --> 35:29.000]  patriot well then why isn't it okay to overthrow Bahrain or Saudi Arabia hmm I
[35:29.000 --> 35:35.200]  mean Saudi Arabia is certainly a tyranny ah but it's a globalist tyranny
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.880]  more than 1000 Saudi Arabian troops have been deployed to Bahrain following
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.160]  fresh protest over the weekend that pitted protesters from the tiny Gulf
[35:44.160 --> 35:52.800]  monarchy Shia majority against riot police and it continues on that front
[35:52.800 --> 35:59.480]  Israeli Navy interceptors Egypt bound ship with arms and so they've
[35:59.480 --> 36:04.040]  intercepted Israeli Navy has intercepted Egypt bound ship with arms
[36:04.040 --> 36:10.160]  we're going to be going over some more of those reports but here is the
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.240]  associated press remember yesterday we were talking about the fact that those
[36:14.240 --> 36:20.960]  explosions were so huge that I couldn't see any way that the containment wouldn't
[36:20.960 --> 36:25.920]  be breached and they're now reporting that may have happened but also you have
[36:25.920 --> 36:32.160]  the cooling tanks that surround them that recycle the radioactive water and
[36:32.160 --> 36:36.120]  that are supposed to stay contained within the facility now those are blown
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.760]  wide open and now basically boiling out as steam into the atmosphere with the
[36:41.760 --> 36:47.120]  wind shifting from going across Japan from China towards the United States
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.520]  they've now shifted southerly towards Tokyo and the tens of millions of
[36:54.520 --> 37:00.040]  inhabitants to the south so very serious situation on that front here is the
[37:00.040 --> 37:05.280]  headline out of the associated press if you doubt us the denial is now
[37:05.280 --> 37:14.200]  evaporating pun intended radiation levels soars after Japan nuke plant fire
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.680]  dangerous levels of radiation leaked from a crippled nuclear plant fires almost
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.560]  worse than an explosion because it'll just heat up those containment facilities
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.640]  and roast them dangerous levels of radiation leaking from a crippled
[37:26.640 --> 37:32.160]  nuclear plant forced Japan to order 140,000 people to seal themselves in
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.400]  doors today after an explosion and a fire dramatically escalated the crisis
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.600]  spawned by the deadly tsunami in a nationally televised statement the
[37:41.600 --> 37:47.320]  prime minister can said radiation had spread from the four stricken reactors
[37:47.320 --> 37:54.000]  of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant along Japan's northeastern coast the
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.800]  region was shattered on Friday's 9.0 some say 8.9 9.0 9.1 magnitude earthquake and
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.320]  the ensuing tsunami that is to believe to have killed more than 10,000 people
[38:05.320 --> 38:10.160]  plunged millions into misery and pummeled the world's third largest
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.480]  economy other stock market dropped 11 points a day at closing Japanese
[38:14.480 --> 38:19.320]  officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the reactor fire was
[38:19.320 --> 38:23.880]  in a fuel storage pond filled with radioactive isotopes I would add
[38:23.880 --> 38:30.000]  strontium cesium and of course radioactive iodide and undoubtedly with
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.680]  these explosions I would guess uranium and plutonium but that hasn't been
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.680]  confirmed yet an area where used nuclear fuel is kept let me say that again
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.000]  Japanese officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.240]  the reactor fire was in a fuel storage pond an area where used nuclear fuel is
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.960]  kept cooled and that radioactivity is being released directly into the
[38:53.960 --> 38:59.640]  atmosphere that's the Japanese prime minister okay telling the atomic energy
[38:59.640 --> 39:03.240]  agency that long after the fire was extinguished a Japanese official said
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.360]  the pool might still be cooling though the report levels of radiation had
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.560]  dropped dramatically by the end of the day so a big off-gassing with the
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.640]  claim it's dropping and we hope that's the truth but with their history of
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.640]  lying who knows what the truth is and more explosions obviously today and
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.720]  they're talking about more explosions to come including at reactors that have
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.920]  been shut down because of fires if the water boils it could evaporate
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.280]  exposing the rods the fuel rods are encased in safety containers meant to
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.920]  prevent them from resuming nuclear reactions nuclear officials said but
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.000]  they acknowledge that there could be and could have been damaged to the
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.800]  containers they also confirmed the walls of the storage pool building were
[39:41.800 --> 39:48.160]  damaged what do you think's gonna happen in those giant explosions experts
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.440]  note that much of the leaking radiation was apparently in steam from boiling
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.160]  water that's what happened to Chernobyl it has not been emitted directly by the
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.040]  fuel rods which could be far more virulent they said yeah uranium and
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.640]  plutonium it's not good but I don't think it's a disaster instead Steve
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.240]  Crossy an Australian based radiation physicist really when when you have a
[40:09.240 --> 40:12.960]  flood and a few hundred people die they call it a disaster but they're saying
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.560]  it's not a disaster not a disaster okay well I'd hate to see a disaster this
[40:18.560 --> 40:27.480]  isn't a disaster millions of people displaced radiation descending down
[40:27.480 --> 40:34.280]  over Tokyo not a disaster Japanese Prime Minister attempts to calm nation as
[40:34.280 --> 40:40.040]  massive radiation spreads Kurt Nemo info wars calm here's a Paul Joseph
[40:40.040 --> 40:49.160]  Watson article radioactive winds head towards Tokyo is some flea capital his
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.640]  business insider iodine pills fly off shells in Hawaii as radiation fear spread
[40:53.640 --> 40:59.480]  across globe I did a YouTube video last night a key report saying we don't know
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.680]  the truth about Japan's nuclear disaster and go over the history of
[41:02.680 --> 41:07.280]  government's lying about previous nuclear disasters very important video for
[41:07.280 --> 41:10.760]  folks out there that have been emailing me the minority but saying why are you
[41:10.760 --> 41:14.720]  upset why are you concerned I heard that Friday I heard that Saturday I heard
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.520]  it Sunday I heard it Monday I'm hearing it today look you told me that the rods
[41:20.520 --> 41:23.360]  were never exposed they now admitted that they had been exposed at least two of
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.880]  the six you said don't worry about the explosions or that it wasn't gonna
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.000]  explode you said that there had been no meltdown when I put an article out
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.320]  Saturday morning breaking it down and now it's all confirmed we've been right
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.880]  because we know the history of reactor crises we know the history of
[41:39.880 --> 41:46.400]  government's lying okay and that's my issue if uranium and plutonium gets
[41:46.400 --> 41:54.160]  released you cannot trust the Japanese government or the atomic energy agency or
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.320]  the IAEA to tell you what's really going on we began to talk about prevailing
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.960]  winds Friday when it was confirmed that cesium and other radioactive derivatives
[42:05.960 --> 42:11.480]  are being released that will hurt you can kill you that are very radioactive
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.360]  blowing towards the West people like oh there there's no winds from Japan coming
[42:15.360 --> 42:21.080]  here now that's all confirmed go look at a major weather satellite website with
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.400]  live feeds from satellites at the jet stream okay and we posted graphs of it
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.480]  people are commenting under it going I don't understand this I don't understand
[42:29.480 --> 42:34.200]  these maps these these screenshots of satellites I don't understand okay you
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.040]  got a jet stream going across Japan across the Northern Pacific to North
[42:38.040 --> 42:42.720]  America and if you look at the maps they have little meteorologist arrows
[42:42.720 --> 42:49.520]  showing you the flow of the wind I mean what's not to get okay I mean sometimes
[42:49.520 --> 42:53.880]  I I really wonder about some people I mean do they have any idea how anything
[42:53.880 --> 43:00.440]  works I'm not even that smart and I can look at a chart I can look at a
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.680]  satellite photo with overlays on it I mean when you watch the weatherman and
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.880]  they say we got a cold front coming into Texas or wherever your state is and it
[43:08.880 --> 43:11.800]  shows the arrows pointing the way the weather front's coming in I mean you
[43:11.800 --> 43:17.960]  don't understand that or are there people posting comments with disinformation on
[43:17.960 --> 43:22.000]  purpose I mean are they paid to do this we know the government has hired hundreds
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.440]  of thousands of people in the last decade to run around and engage in
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.640]  disinformation on the internet but come on I mentioned this three weeks ago when
[43:30.640 --> 43:35.720]  it first broke and I get emails constantly and comments saying it isn't
[43:35.720 --> 43:42.000]  true so I'm gonna ask Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Curtin MO you can all do
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.400]  it everybody should write on this Aaron Dykes my writers and I'm asking
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.720]  everybody else who has news websites to go to the history of this and to look at
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.320]  a whole other issue while we're busy worried about the financial meltdown in
[43:53.320 --> 43:56.320]  the war in the Middle East and the destabilization and the tsunami the
[43:56.320 --> 43:59.920]  earthquakes the nuclear meltdowns and the cover-up of that the whitewash of
[43:59.920 --> 44:06.960]  that that's now imploding while we're busy watching that Obama has announced
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.800]  extremely draconian gun control legislation and it's exactly what we
[44:11.800 --> 44:17.000]  predicted wasn't hard to do in the last year intensifying the last five months
[44:17.000 --> 44:24.160]  we have seen the Attorney General come out and say guns from the US are
[44:24.160 --> 44:28.960]  causing the problems in Mexico well a Mexico has total victim disarmament you
[44:28.960 --> 44:32.080]  there is one gun shop in Mexico reading by guns it's only for the military and
[44:32.080 --> 44:37.520]  police and the public's disarmed they have the highest crime rate officially
[44:37.520 --> 44:41.240]  the last three years in the world over 30,000 killed the last two and a half
[44:41.240 --> 44:46.440]  years violence spilling over beheadings all the rest of it police police chiefs
[44:46.440 --> 44:51.120]  mayors being killed on a police on a daily basis mayors on a weekly basis it
[44:51.120 --> 44:57.600]  is total pandemonium US diplomats being murdered and and they blame this on our
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.680]  guns and I saw this start about a year ago and then suddenly about five months
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.640]  ago the Attorney General started ordering gun shops in the Southwest from
[45:05.640 --> 45:13.240]  Texas to California to order to order on record without law that when somebody
[45:13.240 --> 45:17.440]  buys a semi-automatic rifle or handgun that's most guns that you've got to go
[45:17.440 --> 45:21.120]  ahead and call the ATF on them on top of the fact that you go through an instant
[45:21.120 --> 45:24.280]  FBI background check and they're now denying people who have no criminal
[45:24.280 --> 45:29.680]  record it's the no fly no gun by list executed by fiat that Obama has said he
[45:29.680 --> 45:33.720]  wants to be law just like they're shutting down our coal powered plants
[45:33.720 --> 45:39.040]  even though Congress didn't pass the new law they're just doing it and this is a
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.680]  big deal and people are in denial stop being in denial it's like about five
[45:44.680 --> 45:51.200]  years ago I was in McBride's gun shop buying some ammo and a guy came over and
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.840]  kind of one of the behind-the-counter said Alex I know it's a big gun shop
[45:54.840 --> 45:58.640]  biggest in town he came over behind the counter while I was talking to one guy
[45:58.640 --> 46:05.400]  and he said I don't appreciate you lying about George W. Bush and saying that he
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.280]  supported the assault weapons ban and I said well he's on the and I said nicely
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.120]  I said he's been on the news pushing it I said sir you're gravely mistaken and
[46:14.120 --> 46:18.760]  then one of the owners comes over goes Alex is right he did and the guy goes
[46:18.760 --> 46:24.760]  really oh I'm sorry I mean what do you think I just lie up here think you know
[46:24.760 --> 46:31.040]  these self-righteous ninnies will get in your face and tell you you're a liar
[46:31.040 --> 46:35.840]  because they're ignorant I'm appreciate you lying about George W. Bush saying he
[46:35.840 --> 46:39.720]  is supported the assault weapons ban that's not true you know kind of good
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.720]  old boy and me and I just said really well you're gravely mistaken and they
[46:44.720 --> 46:47.520]  even had YouTube at the time then I said why don't you go to YouTube and type in
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.880]  bush endorses assault weapons ban and but but side issue this is the big issue
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.000]  when I'm about to get to they're moving with a major offensive against the
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.720]  Second Amendment that let's get Larry Pratt on the next few days for a brief
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.200]  15-minute talk on this undoubtedly they're gearing up some more lunatics
[47:03.200 --> 47:05.920]  they've got in mental institutions to you know give them guns and turn them
[47:05.920 --> 47:13.480]  loose as they've been caught doing but I wanted to remind you that this came
[47:13.480 --> 47:23.400]  out this came out on March 3rd CBS News agent I was ordered to let US guns in
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.040]  New Mexico and we'll play that newscast coming up in the third hour I'm gonna
[47:28.040 --> 47:32.120]  get I'm gonna do a report on this 10-minute reporter so and he says this
[47:32.120 --> 47:38.720]  is standard procedure we're told to let the guns in to Mexico and to know what's
[47:38.720 --> 47:44.640]  happening and to release the guns and to allow it to happen and that's a false
[47:44.640 --> 47:49.560]  flag attack because that's that told you a year ago this would be their attack
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.400]  plan and then again five months ago that that that that the whole thing centers
[47:54.400 --> 47:59.400]  around it's America's fault for what's happening in Mexico the only thing
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.360]  America is at fault in Mexico is keeping the phony drug war going which
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.120]  creates 500 billion in black market money and so in incentivizes crime and
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.240]  Americans are using those drugs so in a way we are guilty because we haven't
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.680]  decriminalized that would end this overnight you think the mafia wanted
[48:15.680 --> 48:25.520]  prohibition to end in 1930 no do you think the drug dealers want drug
[48:25.520 --> 48:28.640]  prohibition to end you think government and the banks that launder it want it
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.320]  to know they don't want that so that CBS News here's another one ATF source
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.760]  confirms walking guns to Mexico to pad statistics that's the quote from a
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.120]  senior officer to create the illusion that the problem is caused in the US
[48:44.120 --> 48:48.400]  that's the examiner here's another one daily news mayor police chief an
[48:48.400 --> 48:52.600]  official in us border town busted for running guns to Mexico and drug cartels
[48:52.600 --> 48:58.160]  again government government government government and Obama has run a false
[48:58.160 --> 49:02.960]  flag in the two years he's been in ordering the guns to be allowed into
[49:02.960 --> 49:08.000]  Mexico knowingly even involved in the transactions walking the guns helping get
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.280]  them in to then come out and say give us your guns because of Mexico and that's
[49:12.280 --> 49:17.640]  what Obama announced yesterday okay now I'm gonna go to break and I'm gonna come
[49:17.640 --> 49:23.360]  back and take calls for the rest of the next 40 minutes or so the dr. Bob
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.200]  Bowman joins us on the situation unfolding but we do have a false flag
[49:28.200 --> 49:34.280]  going on it's very simple they I say a year ago two years ago when he got in
[49:34.280 --> 49:37.320]  he said the violence and they had the Justice Department had press conferences
[49:37.320 --> 49:41.600]  in Texas and Arizona and blame the Second Amendment for it and then a year
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.120]  ago it intensified and then before the State of the Union a few months ago he
[49:46.120 --> 49:49.280]  was supposedly gonna announce it and Gibbs said he was the outgoing Gibbs
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.560]  press secretary and then he didn't announce it but the word was it was
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.680]  gonna be because of Mexico and the Gifford shooting we've got to have
[49:57.680 --> 50:03.040]  mental health laws outside of the current laws to just say the government
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.400]  says you've got a mental problem you can't own a gun or you get a divorce you
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.840]  immediately did you know you have a restraining order and can't have guns or
[50:11.840 --> 50:18.880]  an old federal outside of felonies or even misdemeanors for that matter so
[50:18.880 --> 50:21.440]  it's too pronged they're gonna blame everything on Mexico they've already
[50:21.440 --> 50:24.600]  done it everything happening in Mexico on the Second Amendment and the Gifford
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.320]  situation they're coming after our guns and I'll get into the legislation he's
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.360]  proposing that they're busy writing right now but the assault on the Second
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.760]  Amendment is here Obama made all those jokes the White House said how dare
[50:36.760 --> 50:41.320]  people claim he wants your guns he's not introducing legislation Chris Matthews
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.680]  said you people are crazy well they're coming so people were right in the last
[50:46.680 --> 50:51.400]  two and a half years to have two and a half years of record gun sales and you
[50:51.400 --> 50:57.200]  know what they said in Texas in Gonzales when the war started in 1836 when the
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.080]  Mexican Army came to take the guns they said come and take them barrel you want
[51:01.080 --> 51:04.520]  to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead have you ever thought
[51:04.520 --> 51:09.200]  about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant introducing

[54:44.200 --> 54:48.720]  Tokyo the radiation levels going up but it's not uranium and plutonium at least
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.760]  they're saying it isn't it's the other isotopes and other derivatives that are
[54:52.760 --> 54:59.600]  still very bad cesium radioactive iodine strontium very bad can kill you but
[54:59.600 --> 55:02.880]  they're saying that well as you have brief exposures you should you should be
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.920]  okay well I mean they live there it's drifting towards them we cannot trust
[55:08.920 --> 55:12.240]  these governments to tell us the truth and that's what we're going to be
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.600]  tracking and trying to figure out is how severe is this really Michael Derek
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.200]  Joe John Kirby I'm going to go to all of you right now the toll-free number to
[55:21.200 --> 55:28.160]  join us is 800 259 92 31 let's talk to Michael in California you're on the
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.840]  air hi Alex hey first-time caller I've listened to you for last couple years
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.440]  now I just like to say you are the people's champion and I'd like to give
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.920]  kudos to Info Wars and Prison Planet for your world-class news coverage it's
[55:43.920 --> 55:48.400]  you're doing a great service for America and the world well let me say this you
[55:48.400 --> 55:53.200]  don't need to thank me and you can just say diddos or kudos I appreciate it but
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.400]  it's my whole team that that is providing this information so they deserve
[55:57.400 --> 56:01.320]  the lion's share of the credit I couldn't do without my great team we're
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.240]  getting record traffic on Info Wars and Prison Planet I've had IT people
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.880]  struggling around the clock to keep the sites up I want to apologize to the
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.520]  drugs report because it is not good web etiquette to when he links to Info Wars
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.040]  to change the link to Prison Planet to a copy of the article but Info Wars was
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.240]  unable to stay up because of all the other traffic so that's why we did that
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.160]  and Drudge obviously understood that but we've been having to juggle a lot of
[56:30.160 --> 56:36.960]  things because basically we've shattered our previous bandwidth records by
[56:36.960 --> 56:42.480]  double okay it is off the charts the amount of people visiting the sites and
[56:42.480 --> 56:47.080]  it's a great responsibility what's on your mind Michael well Alex I have one
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.640]  shocking news tip and one question the news tip is this is I looked all over
[56:52.640 --> 56:58.560]  Ventura California for potassium iodide yesterday it was gone so I I found a
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.400]  pharmacist who is willing to fill a prescription for me for potassium iodide
[57:03.400 --> 57:09.000]  and and I went to urgent care to get a prescription filled and the doctor
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.120]  denied it because they said they talked to CDC and this DHSC and they
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.720]  recommended that they not give out the prescription for potassium iodide so now
[57:19.720 --> 57:23.840]  the federal government is blocking something that by the way is over the
[57:23.840 --> 57:30.120]  counter you can buy potassium iodide the the the medical grade pills over the
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.280]  counter so now well those reports and here's the problem the emails are pouring
[57:34.280 --> 57:39.120]  in the people usually give the town and the name I have limited staff but we do
[57:39.120 --> 57:41.600]  need to call through the emails Aaron showed me a bunch last night but he
[57:41.600 --> 57:49.400]  worked till three in the morning so I was only up here till till nine on the
[57:49.400 --> 57:57.200]  the research and yes what you just said is is confirmed by just the volume of
[57:57.200 --> 58:01.920]  comments but sir can you write an email and send it well I'll put you on hold
[58:01.920 --> 58:06.160]  and give you kind of a less traffic email to make sure it gets through but
[58:06.160 --> 58:10.280]  but CC at the show tips and infowars.com can you give me the name of the
[58:10.280 --> 58:14.440]  urgent care where it happened what happens so we can do an article that
[58:14.440 --> 58:18.600]  confirms this that the government is blocking over the counter stuff that
[58:18.600 --> 58:24.080]  telling you you can't get it you betcha I'll do I'll do exactly that could I get
[58:24.080 --> 58:28.040]  a one quick question for you and better pukes absolutely we don't we haven't
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.480]  been able to get a hold of pharmacist been fixed what we're trying but yeah
[58:30.480 --> 58:33.880]  throw your question out on the other side Michael then Derek and others will
[58:33.880 --> 58:40.760]  go directly to you but I'm gonna have John Harmon give you a email right now
[58:40.760 --> 58:51.480]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.240]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.520 --> 59:07.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.360 --> 59:16.320]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.320 --> 59:20.720]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:20.720 --> 59:24.440]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.440 --> 59:28.600]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.400 --> 59:35.920]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[59:35.920 --> 59:41.840]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:41.840 --> 59:46.640]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[59:46.640 --> 59:51.720]  1-877-327-0365
[59:52.960 --> 01:00:00.360]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:27.520]  Alex Jones we just talked to Dr. Doug Rocky physicist radiation expert but
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:33.480]  he's at the VA getting treatments receiving get him on nuclear physicist
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.960]  dr. Bob Bowman will be joining us in 30 minutes

[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:45.280]  because they've sold out everywhere of the potassium iodine government approved
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.120]  pills that are over the counter that block the thyroid from up so absorbing
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:57.120]  the radioactive iodine and we were just talking to Michael in California and he
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.840]  was talking about how it's sold out at stores who went to a clinic and tried to
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.480]  get a prescription and they said well the government's told us don't don't give
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.600]  these as prescriptions write that report up Michael get it to us because we want
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.280]  to start confirming you know these things and put an article out on it to
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.240]  dovetail with Paul Watson's article panic buying stocks of potassium iodine
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.440]  exhausted in the US but I want to go to Kirby Derek Joe Joe everybody that's
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.320]  holding here in a moment quickly what was your other question Michael and I
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.960]  got a jump you had to drop off okay I thought he wanted to hold over Derek in
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:36.920]  Missouri Derek you're on the air hello Alex I wanted to ask you a couple
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:43.160]  questions some of them personal to me because I have loved ones or I have
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.200]  people that I know in Japan right now well first of all I want to talk about
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:57.960]  the Japanese economic economy and the Japanese stock markets went from 14
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.440]  percent to 9.5 percent and also it was it was basically 620 billion off the
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.760]  market I wanted to know from your perspective how exactly that was gonna
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.960]  affect how that would affect American markets here and in a short period of
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.640]  time well last time I checked let's pull up the stock market right now live on
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:23.080]  air the US stock market was down quite a few points the Tokyo exchange is closed
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:30.440]  a few hours ago down 11% are one of the biggest losses in recent memory Asian
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:36.520]  shares overall tumbled today if Tokyo stock benchmark plunge 11% on panic
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.320]  selling amid worries that a possible nuclear catastrophe in Japan would
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.800]  further complicate and endanger the nation's recovery from its worst
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:49.160]  earthquake on record the Nikai stock average finished 11 percent lower to
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.960]  8605.15 after sliding more than 14 points earlier in the day pressure by
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.040]  news of explosions at Tokyo electric companies Fukushima nuclear power plant
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.360]  number two and four reactors on top of previous blast at number one and number
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.400]  three so four of them have blown up at the six including one that was turned off
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:16.800]  showing you that it means nothing coming on top of the 6.2 fall Monday the
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:22.640]  performance in the Nikai's worse since October 16 2008 a drop of 11.4 in the
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.520]  aftermath of the global financial crisis so does that answer your question the
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:37.000]  US Dow is down 197 points 0.42 Nasdaq down 45.33 S&P 500 down 20.60 so
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.800]  there's your answer sir there are big numbers to be dropped off from the
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.040]  American markets is that correct well they can always pump them back up with
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.880]  fiat currency but it only devalues the dollar as the global currency more but
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.960]  obviously when it rains it pours this is what happens in history and the
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.760]  globalists have wanted to liquefy the political system so that they can then
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.880]  change it and then re-freeze it that's a term they use and it's a pretty
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:09.920]  amazing time to be alive right now Derek I have a ex-wife who lives you used to
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.680]  live in Toyocho in the Tokyo city I was married over in Tokyo served over there

[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.000]  been able to get a hold of her and as much resentment as we have back and
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.600]  forth towards one another we still share a bond and I feel love for her and
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.680]  her prayers for God well what's her first name

[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.800]  and ask God for divine intervention George Washington prayed for it and

[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.600]  prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.200]  seeing the impact right here in the United States ethanol that was supposed
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.640]  to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:30.840]  the GCN radio network we are going to continue with your phone calls and
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:39.560]  continue to track the unfolding disaster in Japan but the Associated Press and
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:47.560]  others are reporting that radioactive winds are going into Tokyo headline
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:54.480]  radiation levels soar after Japan nuke plant fire Associated Press four of the
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.920]  six reactors including one that had been successfully turned off have blown up
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.080]  and Reuters AP are also reporting that they believe that some of the
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:12.840]  containment systems basically the steel steel box that the reactors are in may
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.680]  have been breached let's hope that that's not the case because you think
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.560]  what's outside the containment vessels bad the water they pumped through that's
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.320]  got all those different radioactive isotopes and radioactive iodine
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:32.560]  strontium cesium that so far is what's made the US fleet race away from the
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.560]  island it was blowing out to see now the winds have changed to the south and
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.600]  is sending it into Tokyo but there are no confirmed reports of uranium and
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.840]  plutonium and if that gets out or has gotten out it is a off-the-chart crisis
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.680]  obviously you don't need to be told that to understand that one particle of
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.360]  that refined plutonium and uranium you are dead meat if it gets into your
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.120]  lungs or if you get it on your hand and then wipe your mouth and it goes into
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.920]  your stomach it is going to devastate those people let's hope and pray that's
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.520]  not the case now I'm gonna go to John Joe John Mark Rusty here in a moment at a
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.600]  Dr. Bob Bowman joining us in about 25 minutes or so but I wanted to just
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.920]  briefly bring up the greed pharmacist Ben Fuchs who's a Genesis talk show
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:26.000]  host briefly because Ben I know it varies but some of the potassium iodine
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.160]  drops that I've bought for thyroid health say take one drop a day some say
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.520]  two some say three I guess it depends on how strong the tincture is you're a
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:42.720]  pharmacist you can explain it versus the IOSAT potassium iodate tablets 130
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.880]  milligram indication thyroid blocking and a radiation emergency only that is
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.280]  sold out all over Europe all over Japan all over China confirmed all over the
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.280]  world it's selling out and now we are getting reports flooding in that FEMA
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.880]  Homeland Security CDC is telling clinics to not give it to people if they
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.000]  request it as a prescription even though it's over the counter so a lot of
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.480]  things happening there but my my only question for you is this some people have
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.560]  gone in to health food stores or grocery stores they've been told by the
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.840]  people in the vitamin aisle and people at clinics that oh only the pills will
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.560]  help you they're 130 to 150 milligrams depending on the brand and we've
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.800]  confirmed that and that and they're claiming that these iodine drops are
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.560]  much weaker and that that that that that the recommended dose wouldn't help you
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.480]  I'm not a doctor I'm not a pharmacist and obviously you can't give general
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.840]  medical advice but but but me individually I'm not taking the
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.320]  potassium iodine pills that I have they're expired by the way but I'm
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.800]  told that they last a lot longer than what the expiration says at this time
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.400]  I'm taking the drops for myself my wife and my children at the recommended dose
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.000]  is that what I should be doing and is it true that these drops aren't gonna
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.240]  help because they're too weak or the Dulse kelp alfalfa based pills we also
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.480]  have those is it true what we're hearing no by far and away the best way to get
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.680]  your iodine is drop SSKI or potassium iodide drops it's the way to go and 130
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.040]  milligrams is a great place to be depending on and you're absolutely
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.720]  correct depending on the brand you're gonna get different dosages per drop but
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.400]  you want to look read the label you want okay so how much in an average bottle in
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.680]  fact we got a bunch of bottles we have Tim bring his in so I can read off the
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.840]  bottle I mean on average it depends on the they're all gonna be different it
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.120]  depends on the brand what you look but it should say on there how much iodine
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.760]  is in how much you're getting per drop and you're absolutely correct you're
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.560]  looking for 130 milligrams but he's telling you that the drops are in any
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.520]  way weaker or less bioavailable or not as good as the pills doesn't know what
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.440]  they're talking about the drops are the way to go absolutely that pills are
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.880]  also okay but if you have an option you want to go with the drops but I really
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.880]  want people to understand is that it's not just iodine that you want to be
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.800]  using you want to be making sure that your body's radiation and heavy metal
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.440]  detoxification systems are all kicking in your body as an enzyme system called
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.680]  the glutathione system which is specifically designed to protect itself
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.160]  to protect the body from substances like radiation and heavy metals and you
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.680]  want to make sure that your glutathione system is kicking in big time and
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.920]  there's nutritional supplements that will do that way your body sheds it
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.880]  instead of self okay so self and so you're looking at the selenium which is
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.680]  very important something called anacetyl 15 is very important there's an
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.240]  amino acid called glutamine which is very important and whey protein is a good
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.120]  source of a lot of these nutrients see vegetables are very important a bladder
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.320]  rack and help everybody knows about kelp but there's all the vegetables are
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.200]  very important in fact I'd be using see vegetables as long as you make sure that
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.120]  they're you can want to make sure that they're from a good source but I'd be
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.920]  eating see vegetables on a daily basis it's one of the best ways to protect
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.400]  yourself from radiation there's also a great seed extract green tea drink a
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.000]  lot of green tea spent all day drinking green tea if I were if I was good to
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.560]  protect myself from any of these substances I'd be doing a lot of and by
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.600]  the way pharmacists don't forget about vitamin C very important absolutely
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.320]  because that helps your body in a defendant's self and I want you to
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.880]  explain that and then I'm gonna let you go we'll have you back soon to continue
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.200]  to break this down for those saying oh trust the government the winds are
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.160]  coming from Japan right across the West Coast ladies and gentlemen and on the
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.800]  number one at the levels that you're supposed to take it I'm correct in
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.320]  saying pharmacist that it's good to have this anyways so as a precaution
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.200]  hope for the best prepare for the worst some people are criticizing us even
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.240]  though we're not even selling this stuff for even telling people they might
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.760]  want to take a precaution as if it's somehow bad but overall it's good to be
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.520]  eating seaweed it's it's good to be eating vitamin C it's good to have
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.280]  proper iodine explained to people what your thyroid problems are off the
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.600]  charts these days why that's happening and what your thyroid absorbs if it
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.720]  doesn't have the iodine it needs well your point is very well taken Alex if
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.920]  you don't wait for a disaster you want to make sure your body is loaded up it's
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.480]  saturated with these substances so when something like this does happen you're
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.680]  protected as far as the thyroid goes okay the one of the biggest problems
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.480]  associated with the thyroid than nobody talks about is the digestive system
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:24.400]  because thyroid hormone is activated in the digestive system so one of the most
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.200]  important things you could do if you want to protect yourself from from these
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.360]  radioactive substances heavy metals if you want to make sure your thyroid is
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.440]  working correctly is correct all digestive symptoms any digestive
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.080]  symptomology needs to be correct because no matter what you're taking if you got
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.440]  digestive problems you got a hole in your boat and you're going to be losing
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.600]  water as fast as your as you're bailing it out all right we've got a jump and I
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.440]  appreciate you joining us on short notice but I have a brand here one last
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:56.000]  question I have a brand here this is from new flower it's iodine with kelp
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.800]  dietary supplement two fluid ounces 60 mil suggested use take one drop once a
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.800]  day in a little water or as directed by your healthcare professional and it
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:16.600]  doesn't even really say anything else in the back it says iodine 150 mcg 100
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:24.960]  percent per drop to mg from kelp so looking at this brand you're saying one
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.320]  drop a day of this would would fill the thyroid and and be what I need that's
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.240]  right one drop a day it's a hundred it's a little over that's 150 mcg you're
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.680]  looking for at least 130 mcg well if I weigh 230 pounds I mean does a man who's
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.440]  bigger take more than a woman who weighs a hundred slight difference but not
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.440]  really significant we're talking about a gland you're talking exactly you're
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.480]  talking about a gland okay pharmacist Ben Fuchs thank you so much for clearing
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.920]  that up for us appreciate it yeah you want to go to a pharmacist even above a
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.440]  doctor because they're the ones that really deal with this every day thank
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:02.600]  you so much okay John in New York John you're on the air welcome you know I've
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.480]  been going around Rochester New York trying to get some potassium iodine or
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:14.400]  isostat and every place I've been to so far except for one is completely out
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:21.000]  their suppliers are completely out they said they were out from day one well
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.680]  that's the issue you know four or five percent of the population is educated
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.600]  they're going to buy it all up it's the same thing with gold and silver once the
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.400]  general public figures out the dollar has been trashed imagine when all the
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.440]  yuppies try to go out and buy gold and silver what's going to happen it's the
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:41.080]  same thing with this anything else you want to add John yes I also have a tip
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.920]  I happen to live near Ganae power plant on Lake Ontario and because they live so
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:52.080]  close they have loaded up the over the years loaded up the pharmacies in my
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.720]  area with the iostat so a tip would be to have people that live in areas around
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.640]  nuclear power plants to go to their pharmacies and they will be able to get
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:08.320]  a iostat kit they have a much greater chance there all right thank you so much
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.800]  that's right and that's one reason the federal government is saying that they
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.160]  don't need any more iodine only people around power plants need it but what if
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.800]  you're downwind from one well what if we're downwind from Japan I mean it
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.680]  makes no sense the government wants to limit it so they can sit there and
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.160]  hand it out and play God Joe in Texas you're on the air welcome hey did those
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:34.240]  Alex hey buddy Alex now that the winds are going south like they are from
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.920]  Japan I'm just wondering what that's gonna do with all the problems that all
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.120]  straighters had with the floods and the fire yeah this stuff's going all over
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.400]  the world I mean there's no doubt that whatever's coming out of those plants
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.880]  they've been covering it up and they're now having to admit I mean again here's
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:57.920]  the AP headline you know dealing with radiation levels rising and it it looks
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:06.360]  like they're they're starting to ratchet down from their cover-up yeah and the
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.760]  other thing I wanted to mention Alex was the the iodine solution you put on
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.840]  your skin I don't know you might know more about to me that it does help to
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.480]  some degree but when I went down or other my girlfriend went down to buy some
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.760]  of this stuff like a month ago that 60 60 ounce ball that stuff was $3 it's
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.880]  now it's now $12 and there you know they they don't have many on the shelf now
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:40.560]  and you can get the first eight times it has the same iodine solution in it but
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.520]  it seems like they're once they're they're out there making money off this
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:50.560]  stuff they certainly are sir all right I appreciate you joining us we're gonna

[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.600]  want to thank your staff for bumping me up a little I have a very important call
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  it's a take action call your listeners taking action it's about the fallout
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:55.480]  from Japan there's something we can do I did some homework last night and
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:02.320]  there are civilian monitoring stations and they're online they're real time but
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:09.520]  there's a problem when I posted this on prison planet I got their website shut
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.800]  down because they got so much traffic and so I talked with the the web well I
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  talked to the people at radiation network dot-com and they said that we need
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.280]  to get all these people who have Geiger counters they said there's lots and lots
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.480]  of people with Geiger counters we need to get them to get them out of their
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.520]  attic we need to get them out of their garages get that dust well here's the
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.800]  problem though they need more I'm not an expert on it but I've done some studying
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.360]  there's a lot of specific very expensive Geiger counters that can flip and check
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.320]  different different types of radiation most of them are geared to uranium or
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:51.160]  plutonium and they're not going to be geared towards less radioactive things
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.440]  that are still very poisonous so I do need to I'm gonna get Dr. Bob Bowman on
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.000]  very soon in fact I'm gonna ask him that question but go ahead yeah but you well
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.840]  we don't know what they have you know they could you're right they could have
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.560]  that they could have others too but if we can get as many people to get those
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.840]  out and I think Hawaii really needs to get on the ball first of all a lot of
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.480]  us out here in radio land we don't trust the government we don't trust the
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:25.760]  media and at least this would be a way to to check their figures and and get I
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.560]  think a second third opinion on on the radiation levels that we're getting all
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.760]  they have to do is is go to the website like like I was saying radiation network
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.600]  they can download the software and they can get up and running they're the
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.840]  experts I'm not even an expert well there's also university and in city
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.440]  facilities but we know in the past the feds have told them not to report on it
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.480]  like when the DU was orbiting the globe in 2003 from the thousands of tons they
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.960]  used in Iraq but the British did not get get shut down they did report the high
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.200]  level so did the Germans the Dutch and others and that was after it had circled
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:07.200]  the globe and gone over the North America and back into Europe and in the
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.600]  Middle East you know completing its circum circum navigation through the
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.520]  atmosphere but that is a really good point I appreciate your call John Mark
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:25.120]  in New York you're on the air go ahead hello yes sir okay I'm sorry it thank
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.560]  you for taking my phone call you don't have to thank me I'm not one of these
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.720]  arrogant crazy house but go ahead okay I live in Bayridge Brooklyn near near the
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.480]  Fort Hamilton Army base and you know it's the only Army base here in in New
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.760]  York City and so you know we're kind of used to them having a little occasional
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:49.120]  like FEMA type exercises that scare the shit out of people okay let him go let
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.000]  him go we can't have that on my show sir let's go ahead and talk to Rusty in
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.320]  Arkansas yeah Alex I was just one to run a couple things by you what about the
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.640]  government shutdown that was posted on the milk or the Army times this morning
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.600]  about the possible troop pay not going out due to a government shutdown I did
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.440]  see that guys I don't think I sent it to you to print Army times troops may not
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.880]  get paid due to government shutdown no it's all bedlam is broken loose we're
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.560]  going bankrupt by design to the globalist who set up this this derivative
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.360]  system a black hole impossible to escape unless you ride it off and arrest the
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:29.200]  bankers it's us or them too big to fail is our destruction you've got the bedlam
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:35.320]  in the Middle East the craziness in Japan I mean it's wild what do you
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.800]  think yeah I really don't know anything about it I've been hit up by some folks
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.840]  locally about this issue about to shut down more than anything else because I
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.680]  hadn't seen a whole lot of on your site particularly I've just you know kind of
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.320]  been up in the air I have seen a few things that on Steve Quill site here
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:01.120]  lately not that I've mentioned that I'd like to add that that inner food just

[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.400]  this time as well I've had good results from it for the last three months and I
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.480]  haven't had any allergy symptoms that we normally suffer from here and it's an

[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.040]  for the next 30 minutes Reuters is reporting that the Japanese government
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:36.840]  is saying that two of the containment vessels in plant number two and four
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:43.440]  may have been partially breached that is not good news also there have been two
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.120]  more explosions overnight bringing the total number of explosions now to form
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.040]  it is also being reported by the Associated Press here's the headline
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.760]  radiation level soar after Japan nuke plant fire now plant number four had
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:06.040]  been brought offline before this even happened it was in some type of state of
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.480]  repair and Dr. Bowman talked yesterday about that sounds like good news because
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:15.280]  it won't melt down well the fire got into it the huge explosions and they're
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:24.000]  saying that that may have been exposed they're reporting strontium cesium
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.440]  different radioactive iodine's going into Tokyo to explain all this to us as
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.400]  Dr. Bob Bowman has three degrees in physics he's a former director of
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.000]  advanced space programs Star Wars program for the US Air Force in the
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.280]  Ford Carter administration's when it was secret and a former United States
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.200]  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel the 101 combat missions over Vietnam he holds a
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.080]  PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering the California Institute of
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.880]  technology and I've got a lot of questions for him dealing with radiation
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.760]  detectors here in the US what does the average detector pick up is it just
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.320]  uranium plutonium could that get across the ocean the winds have now shifted
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.760]  from the jet stream you know it is continually going across the prevailing
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.000]  winds are going across the Pacific towards the US from Japan but the low
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.120]  level winds are have turned to the south towards Tokyo I know Dr. Bowman's been
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:23.720]  covering and following all of this and he's a great asset obviously for the
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.840]  broadcast he joins us via video Skype from his home Dr. Bowman watching what's
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.920]  happening what's what's your what's most important for us to know right now and
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.320]  what's your view of the situation the Japanese Prime Minister now says is a
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:42.040]  terror rating he's a scoriated Tokyo power and electric saying that they
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:47.800]  basically kept things from him it looks like they're starting to really get
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:55.120]  concerned yes indeed and they should be concerned it's it's a good thing that
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.800]  that reactor is northeast of Tokyo and outside of the prevailing winds that
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.280]  doesn't mean that radiation can't get down to Tokyo and indeed some of it has
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:21.960]  but they won't get the brunt of it now the radiation when it happens and I have
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:28.320]  a feeling that before it's over now there'll probably be more radiation
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:38.960]  released than in Chernobyl and that radiation for the most part is going to
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:50.600]  go west probably some northwest and much of it hopefully dissipate over the
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:57.960]  Pacific Ocean the radiation levels by the by the time they get to the Pacific
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:13.440]  coast of the United States will be pretty small and Hawaii is more in line to get
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:24.840]  a larger dose and possibly depending on where the jet stream is Alaska but there
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:32.000]  shouldn't be an enormous impact on the west coast of the continental United
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:42.640]  States which which is good but over a period of the next 50 years it's liable
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:51.800]  to cause quite a few cancers in the continental United States just from this
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:57.920]  low level of fallout that we'll get from us by the way your question about
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.440]  detectors yes sir detectors don't care whether the stuff is coming from uranium
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.920]  or plutonium and it can't even tell you that detectors detect basically gamma
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:17.200]  rays or alpha rays and those can come from either uranium or plutonium well
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.800]  to be specific I phrased the question wrong when I meant to say was will they
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.560]  pick up the strontium the radioactive iodine I mean I know they're giving off
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.920]  radiation but aren't the effects of those not just the radiation but also just
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:44.760]  that they're poisonous yes they are but again you need very high-tech expensive
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:53.480]  equipment to detect those specific chemicals yeah that was my point so so
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:39:00.440]  we won't know about that detector will not detect strontium 90 or cobalt or
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:06.000]  anything it'll just tell you how many gamma rays they're getting in or
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.920]  something like that yeah well that was my concern from what I've read as a
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.800]  layman that a lot of these derivatives of the cooling process that that that we
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.840]  know are coming out in the steam that it's hard to pick those up so then when
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.360]  we see these silver detectors being held up in front of thousands of people in
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:28.240]  lines do we know you know when they say they're picking up strontium and all
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:34.400]  these things I guess they have specific detectors for that there are specific
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:44.080]  detectors but my guess is if they're giving great numbers of fairly simple
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:51.080]  detectors out to people that what it's really detecting is the effects of the
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.000]  strontium 90 and they can't really tell you whether it's coming from strontium
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.360]  90 so it sounds like we don't know what's really going on if a lot of these
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  what are they isotopes what would you call these derivatives isotopes yeah they
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:25.760]  are for the most part their products of the the nuclear process and in some
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:36.800]  cases they're also in the raw uranium and so forth but some of these are by
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:45.920]  products of the process itself and are created while the power is being
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.400]  generated so so those aren't inside the containment facility themselves they're
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:41:01.960]  in the they're in the cooling pools or the the filters both what I think we
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:09.020]  should be mostly concerned about as far as
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:17.320]  radiation itself are the fuel rods in the containment buildings but the
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:26.400]  strontium 90 and cesium some of these chemicals are in the spent fuel rods
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:34.600]  that are in the cooling pools and of course if they lose their cooling and
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:42.040]  or hit by a fire like might have happened there with building four then
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:50.760]  those chemicals can be released into the atmosphere by the fires doctor you've
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:56.720]  now had a chance to see I would imagine building three blowing up yesterday a
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.120]  have you have you seen that many many many times okay I mean obviously that's
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:07.160]  a devastatingly powerful explosion just by how fast the plume goes up obviously
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:11.800]  a lot of explosive force just my layman view is that boy that that that looks
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.120]  like that would damage a containment facility they're now saying it may have
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.480]  but they're being somewhat nebulous knowing how government works and
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.840]  corporations work the statements coming out of Japan getting a little bit more
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.640]  frantic by the prime minister obviously they have a history of being deceptive so
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.760]  we don't know if this is true or not but what does it signify to you that
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:38.000]  they're now saying okay we know rods have been exposed at four we know that's
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.360]  there's been melting partial meltdown this fire damaged reactor four that was
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:50.240]  decommissioned or not online what does it mean if if the containment
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.400]  facilities have been breached well they're already admitting that the
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.200]  containment facility was breached in building to reactor two yes so what does
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:12.240]  that signify well it means that any radiation that is coming out of there
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:19.680]  from melted fuel rods is going to escape into the atmosphere it's not going to be
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:27.640]  contained in the building no and so then you that's why the situation is
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:37.720]  approaching a category 7 or Chernobyl condition and we've got new reports out
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:44.640]  that they're bracing for more explosions right now that's always a
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:58.400]  possibility because those those reactors you know you get they're trying to cool
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:07.320]  them with the seawater then you get the seawater the water goes level goes down
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:15.240]  the things get hot pour water in you get enormous release of steam if they don't
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:24.360]  control the pressure properly by venting it then you get explosions again and
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.000]  this time we've got partially exposed containment at two they're saying
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.680]  probably for Swiss news is reporting that Japanese government is bracing for
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.480]  quote radioactive catastrophe it looks like that they're basically getting
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:45.400]  people ready slowly so they don't panic for the announcement that uranium may
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:52.080]  be getting out of there how bad is it to have the mox mark one plutonium based
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:57.680]  uranium reactor how much more deadly is it to have a plutonium based reactor
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:04.640]  than just a uranium well the mox which which is mixed oxide it's a mixture
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:16.480]  of uranium oxide and plutonium oxide and of course plutonium is more deadly
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:24.240]  when it is breathed into the body and tiny plutonium particles get stuck in
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:35.120]  the lungs and then the radiation from those tiny plutonium particles continues
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:46.720]  then for years and can do enormous damage to the body and that's something
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:55.520]  that it is particularly of interest now uranium can do the same thing we have
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:05.520]  seen similar kinds of damage from depleted uranium in the war zones to
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.800]  our own troops well that was my next point we have this cavalier attitude
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.920]  towards do you detectors picking it up all over the world when thousands of
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:19.680]  tons were used in 2003 2004 right through to today and I don't trust our
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.320]  government or our media if any of this did make it over to the west coast to
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:30.040]  tell us and now in fact we've got a caller from Japan Dr. Bowman I want to
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.120]  go to this caller from Japan stay with us and see what Jack in Japan I
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.000]  apologize I hadn't seen that on the board to Jack Jack you're in Japan what
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.480]  are you seeing where are you well right now Alex I gotta tell you first of all
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.960]  it's just good to hear the sound of your voice it's pretty much total battle
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:53.160]  here basically pretty much everybody in understands that the the government is
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:57.760]  not really telling us the full and complete truth over the national what
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.520]  we've got is our version of CNN which is called the NHK over here and all our
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.840]  friends that I've talked to they all know that we're facing a more serious
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.400]  situation in what the government is very telling us if you look to the state
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.440]  government the revolting bit there was a bit of a revolt by the governor of
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:23.880]  Fukushima prefecture you know challenging the prime minister to tell
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:30.760]  everybody the full truth and so if anybody is looking for you know real
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:35.120]  honest information about what's going on they might look to some of the home
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.080]  web pages of the state government I've got some here but I've also got I did see
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:47.560]  in the news the Fukushima you know regional governor saying that or
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.240]  prefect saying that saying that things are a lot worse than people are being
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:58.160]  being told you describe things as bedlam break that down for us and then
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:02.440]  any questions dr. Bob Bowman has for you well first of all I just want to say
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.640]  to mr. Bowman I saw your interview on prisonplanet.tv and I thought it was
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.240]  very well-spoken and a great interview and thank you so much for you know
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:16.840]  having courage to stand up and speak out I really appreciate that and you know
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:20.640]  again I don't want to sound like you know Lindsay Williams here but everybody
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:26.120]  out there listen to listen to Alex I got my food ready I got my water ready I
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.560]  got my meds ready got my you know my my other supplies ready and sure enough
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.040]  right about now I I need them I mean I'm I'm about 15 20 minutes with bugging
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.240]  out of here well it's not that we live in fear we live in we live in power we
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.640]  we have firearms we have food we have gold we have friends we have the truth
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.440]  we are not weak we are not dependent ants store food grasshoppers don't ants
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  survive the winter the grasshopper doesn't but but but you know we've got
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.560]  you here from Japan that's why I broke in on over dr. Bob Bowman doctor do you
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:07.080]  have any questions for the where are you in Japan Jack I'm I'm about 200 clicks
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.160]  from the from the actual the Fukushima event and for those that don't know what
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  a click is in military nomenclature tell them sorry it's about 200 kilometers
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:21.840]  from the actual event so you're about 150 miles dr. Bob Bowman do you have any
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:27.760]  questions for him well just to comment that Jack said that the government
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:33.840]  doesn't tell all the truth I think part of the answer to is that the government
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:38.600]  don't even know all the truth because the dang corporations lied of the
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.960]  government and of course which is exactly what happens in this country too
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.200]  well I would say that one of the most frightening aspects I've seen Jack and
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.840]  I want your take on this is the prime minister blew up at Tokyo Electric in
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.200]  power and said they didn't tell them for hours and they had the first explosion
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.600]  or the second big one yesterday and they went on to say that everybody
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.680]  evacuated a day and a half ago from Fukushima that there were supposed to
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.920]  be 500 people there was down to 50 and that now 50 weren't even there and the
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:12.600]  prime minister quote ordered the Tokyo Electric power people back in that
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.920]  doesn't sound too good does it dr. Bowman no it doesn't because that's
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.520]  essentially a death warrant for those folks and the prime minister is
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.760]  essentially saying well you know I don't care you know you broke it you you fix
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:36.640]  it it's a shame you know that's a 40-year-old reactor and the new reactor
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:45.160]  designs can be they evacuated and just left and they'll take care of themselves
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.800]  and this won't happen stay there dr. Bowman jack you stay there too I want to
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.280]  come back and finish up any other statements by the way the presses were

[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:07.920]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.280]  that in a real meltdown non hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.040]  silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.920]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:22.360]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:27.880]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:33.880]  by the way you know the test you might have sold out all over the country dr.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.720]  Bob Bowman saying post that radiation won't make it over here he said some
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:42.040]  will long-term effects will just be increased cancers which we already see
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:45.720]  because of all the nuclear testing and the rest of it now I told listeners
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.960]  because my wife bought it from young Jevvie like a total balance thing and
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:55.120]  she also bought kelp pills from them she separately he loves it all and is on
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:58.440]  and all and I said that stuff's up on the site and I don't think it's on our
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.120]  side I think it's on the main young Jevvie site so just a side issue and
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:04.280]  I'm not selling it there so go to the main young Jevvie side if you want that
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.840]  I just called Ted Nassim to add it to the thing but it doesn't folks you can go
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.760]  to stores and they're gonna have the iodine from kelp still they're just not
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:18.000]  gonna have the pills okay and so there I don't even want to get into all of this
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.360]  all I know is my wife's got a couple bottles she bought weeks ago separately
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.400]  and it's it's the kelp but and so technically it's not the iodine but it
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.840]  is iodine kelp getting into this semantically okay it's just not there
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.320]  here we'll just say that it isn't there even though it is okay okay I'm done
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:41.200]  talking about that we're dealing with the situation that is going on in Tokyo
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.720]  with the situation deteriorating quickly I want to keep Bob Bowman 15 minutes or
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:52.440]  so in the next hour if he can do that Jack in Japan getting back to you any
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.600]  other points you want to make are you north are you south what direction are
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.520]  you from the Fukushima area in the northeast from the Fukushima event I'm
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:12.720]  maybe I guess west by Southwest so just follow the map if you wouldn't go
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.320]  directly Daniel Southwest kind of a little bit north of that well that's
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.840]  good because the winds are going a little bit south but they're mainly
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:23.160]  blowing out the sea but but we're getting reports that people are getting
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:29.400]  to a mass exodus out of Tokyo which has a giant population that would cause a
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.960]  disaster in its own right wouldn't it because they're not gonna have the
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.240]  infrastructure in the rural areas four millions of people if they start trying
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:44.040]  to leave dr. Bowman yeah that's for sure man the one question I wanted to
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.680]  sorry to Alex the one question was raised to dr. Bowman was um and yeah
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.200]  Alex you're right I mean if everybody started trying to get out of town in a
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.040]  hurried fashion be the expressways are all shut down and that would force
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.680]  everybody on the small local highways and it'd be pretty much gridlocked in
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.880]  about an hour but the question I got for dr. Bowman is with the situation I have
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:14.680]  now being about well more or less 200 kilometers away from this event um is it
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.040]  a better idea for me to just hunker down and try to but not my house and close
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:22.120]  it all down and you know close all the windows what not or or should I should
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:28.640]  I go ahead and hit the road what what's your opinion at this point well I don't
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:36.760]  know you may be as safe there as you would be in the US because of the
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:41.960]  direction you are opposite to the way the wind's blowing and also because of
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:47.320]  the topography there's probably some pretty good mountains between you and
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:56.680]  Fukushima okay and one other thing just to just to give this out to Alex we we
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.920]  I've got the the local the state government website up here in front of
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:07.880]  that face right now and on a normal day we've got point zero zero zero zero one
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:14.000]  nine amount of illicit births or I'm not sure exactly how to put it but
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:20.160]  radiation and at this point we've got point zero zero zero five oh one so
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.360]  we're looking at basically 25 times the the amount of normal radiation that
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:29.360]  comes in on any given day so either say with constant aftershocks and
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:33.520]  everything else my wife and I are kind of living on pins and needles so that's
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.640]  even where you're at far away it's showing that oh yeah well let's get
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:47.400]  dr. Bowman's to take on that thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:53.920]  today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.280]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.480]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:06.520]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:10.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.720]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:18.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:23.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:26.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:31.040]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:06.440]  Kyoto Reuters all reporting I mean this is turning into a disaster on top of a
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  disaster with the third most powerful earthquake recorded since the Richter
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:16.360]  scale a nine point one now upgraded as of Sunday dr. Bob Bowman is our gas will
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:19.880]  continue to take calls so you can ask him or myself questions and we're only
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.440]  talking about the Japanese situation but dr. Bowman I've been asking the
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.800]  questions what are other points as a degree nuclear physicist former head of
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:32.960]  the Star Wars program that you think people should know about this situation
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.960]  a and b my question what do we expect if some of the plutonium and uranium does
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.520]  start to get out because of further fires and explosions and does go into
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.600]  Tokyo the reports estimated that over a million people have died in the
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:54.760]  aggregate in the last 25 years just from what happened at Chernobyl yeah and
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:02.680]  you'll have a similar situation perhaps not quite as bad because Chernobyl's
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:10.280]  fallout cloud went mainly over populated areas by the way I was in the
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:17.720]  Soviet Union at that time and didn't you know I was scheduled to go to Kiev and
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:26.240]  we didn't we went to Leningrad instead and but you know we were all in our
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.720]  group that were there making jokes you know what's chicken Kiev and the answer
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:36.800]  is I don't know but it glows in the dark you know oh man but yeah that was sort
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:44.760]  of a scary situation I think the point we need to take from this in addition to
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:52.920]  really having empathy for the people of Japan is to have some lessons learned
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:01.720]  for us here in the United States we have these 40 year old reactor designs all
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:10.680]  over this country we've got them on earthquake fault lines like Santa
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:15.560]  Nofre and Diablo Canyon it almost seems like a prerequisite today they only
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:22.280]  build them on fault lines well it often seems that way of course fault lines
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.240]  tend to be along the coast and when you're on the coast you have sort of an
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:36.960]  unlimited supply of cooling water from the ocean and now that water is supposed
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:44.440]  to go through a heat exchanger and cool the steam after it has driven the
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.120]  turbines turn it back into water which is then pumped back into the
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:55.920]  containment facility becomes steam again and goes to drive the turbines so the
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.840]  seawater is never supposed to get into the containment facility but it is
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:08.480]  essential to the whole process to have a good supply of essentially free water
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:15.480]  available the whole cycle really can't work without it and that's why you find
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:24.040]  these things being built along the the coast now the seawater in the case of
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:30.440]  Japan is being pumped directly into the containment facility to try to cool
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:35.720]  those that's been called a desperation move by the US government is that a
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:41.320]  desperation move well of course because what it does is kill the reactor the
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:48.520]  reactor can never again be used to generate power the fuel rods are ruined
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:53.520]  everything in the reaction stay there dr. Bowman let's finish up with that take

[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:43.720]  today we will undoubtedly going to overdrive to take more of your calls
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:48.720]  into the fourth hour dr. bob bowman three degrees in nuclear physics and
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:53.760]  aeronautics former head of the star wars program is our guest for another
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:58.440]  15 minutes or so we're about to go back to your calls but dr. bowman here's the
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.400]  64 million dollar question we know there's been a cover-up that's now
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:09.800]  admitted giant explosions four of them at least now fires containment two
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.280]  is breach but they won't say how breached containment four may be
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:18.920]  breached what happens once it's breached I mean if that stuff's melting inside
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:24.520]  then it would start what off-gassing or do we know what's any ideas of what's
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:28.400]  happening inside those breach containment facilities because that is the
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:31.640]  Chernobyl event correct if that is indeed what's happening they're saying
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.600]  it's happened at least one of the six reactors and if they've pulled out all
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:40.800]  the people even the prime minister's ordering them back in then it is what
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:46.760]  would generally be that the chain reaction now well what happens is that
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:10:03.320]  the the molten fuel rods eventually burn or have explosions out gas one way or
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:11.600]  another it becomes gaseous and goes out through the containment building and
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:20.880]  into the atmosphere and that's when you get the enormous spread of radiation and
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:32.520]  again we in this country have all of these old nuclear reactors many on
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.360]  fault lines and on the ocean as we've talked about and I have called for some
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:46.040]  time for first no new nuclear reactors because even with a relatively safe
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.240]  nuclear reactor we still don't know how to get rid of the high-level radioactive
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:11:04.240]  waste safely but I also call for a gradual upgrade of the existing plants we
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:09.080]  can't shut all the nuclear power plants down now because we depend on that
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:16.800]  electricity you've got the the grid that goes out from them we're dependent on
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:22.200]  them but you can shut down a reactor and replace it with a modern new reactor
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:27.600]  which is fail-safe and then after you've got it going you shut down another
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.920]  react as a nuclear physicist what what new design do you think's the safest the
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:42.320]  light pebble well I think we ought to take a look at France and their
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.760]  experience because they have implemented new designs they have experience with
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:58.040]  them and we can make a study and see with our conditions just what the best
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:08.840]  design would be but the important part of any of the fail-safe designs is that
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:20.120]  without electricity and losing all control the thing shuts itself down
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:26.760]  cools itself down and becomes dormant and if you can't do that without
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.240]  electricity and pumping water in and and so forth then it's not a fail-safe
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:39.440]  design and that's what we have to look for particularly in these places like
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:43.520]  Diablo Canyon and Santa no free that are especially vulnerable when you're in
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.200]  studio next month when you visit Austin we will break that that down more but
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.640]  before we go to these calls because I want to get to them Dr. Bowman in a
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.560]  limited time we have statistically studying history these this mark one
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.360]  design some of the other old designs 39 40 year old designs that are in place at
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:08.000]  the Fukushima disaster site generally now that we know that one guaranteed to
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.760]  maybe have been breached in the containment what generally is going to
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:16.320]  happen and how much of that plutonium or uranium is going to make its way down
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:26.400]  to Tokyo oh I'd say a tiny fraction of 1% would make its way to Tokyo most of it
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:34.960]  will go west but you know 1% of a big number is still a lot and it can still
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:46.240]  do a lot of damage I am going starting the end of April day after Easter as a
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:52.200]  matter of fact on a trip from Florida to California and back and then later in
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:57.280]  the summer covering the eastern half of the country and people can go to my
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:03.880]  website they can see my phone number they can email me from wherever you are
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:10.920]  and ask are you coming here and can we organize a speaking event I'm hoping
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:16.040]  somebody picks up the ball in Austin and San Antonio and organize the speaking
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.240]  events for me there now sir absolutely so folks can contact you there since
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:24.680]  you're traveling the country and that's important but but what I want to nail
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.600]  down here is explain to me directions because the jet stream goes from west
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.480]  to east around the world so it goes over Japan and then to the western United
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:40.760]  States and back around the globe and so some news reports say that yeah when
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:43.840]  it's going to the east it's going to the US we know that's the direction of some
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:48.920]  of it but then you just called it to the west and I understand technically it's
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:52.880]  the western side of the US but it is east from Japan because it's on the other
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:56.600]  side of the world I mean what technically do we call that jet stream
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.720]  going over Japan towards the US West Coast well there's only one jet stream
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:08.120]  and it's like a serpent it goes all the way around the world but you know
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:16.360]  sometimes it it goes from Japan up the Aleutians and Alaskan down to Canada and
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:21.920]  then dips down sometimes all the way to Mexico and then up the east coast but the
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:27.640]  point is the reactor yes but the but the reactor most of us going out to see
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:31.720]  what would be called the east of Japan but some of the media as you said calls
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:35.920]  it to the west of Japan but technically it's east of Japan going towards the
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:41.080]  United States absolutely I'm sorry if I said west you know I'm thinking you know
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:48.040]  Tokyo is west and and no no no no no the media keeps keeps saying to the west as
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:53.360]  well because I guess technically we think of Japan to the east but and I've
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:57.040]  seen it in Accuweather AP Reuters saying the same thing so I was thinking I was
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:04.360]  making a mistake no the shortest way to Japan from here is west yes and so yeah
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:10.200]  the the the radiation is coming toward us it'll cut it'll hit us first and then
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:17.120]  it'll go on and it'll hit Europe and the rest of Asia after all the radiation
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:22.680]  from Chernobyl went all the way around and and got to the United States the
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:28.280]  levels were very low by the time it got here but it did get here Dr. Bowman my
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:35.560]  last question for you take a few calls is is is generally they're reporting that
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:38.840]  these things melt down over a while and just kind of off-gast that the
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.520]  explosions you know generally with the rods themselves aren't that aren't that
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:47.800]  common but but how do you statistically see this playing out now I mean how long
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.640]  will this event be going on weeks months
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:17:03.440]  well it could be over in a week or two it could play out for a very long time
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:11.880]  and you know there are radiation occasionally still coming out of
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:18.760]  Chernobyl so who knows but when I was talking about I never gave out the
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:24.080]  website and I do want people to be able to go there and get my email address and
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:30.240]  whatnot but the patriots dot us if you would give that out once or twice when
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.680]  you get a chance I'd appreciate it we haven't done that for the whole absolutely
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:44.280]  give it out right now the patriots dot us and when you get to that website you
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:51.360]  can get my email address you know just bob at the patriots dot us absolutely
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:55.040]  you're launching a new speaking tour and your powerful speaker you spoke at our
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:00.000]  big 9-11 event that C-SPAN carried and certainly folks can line that up there
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.680]  and watch a lot of great videos and presentations on a host of important
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:08.040]  issues that you cover dr. Bowman let's jam in a few calls because I'm gonna skip
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:11.880]  this break this network breaks we get a few of these in Josh and Pennsylvania
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:14.600]  thanks for holding you're on the air with dr. Bob Bowman and Alex Jones
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.000]  worldwide hey Alex how you doing today good so I want to bring up I want to make
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.240]  two points one is what another another supplement that can be used to is also
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.200]  liquid chlorophyll that's also you know extremely important for helping cleanse
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:32.560]  the blood as well as with everything else that I forget the Benjamin Fuchs
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.680]  said as well so that's one the other thing I want to ask you is and this can
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:42.160]  be for for both of you what do you think we'll we talk a lot about how you know
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.080]  problem-reaction solution and and don't let a good crisis go to waste what can
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:50.040]  what can the US at this point utilize this crisis for to help kind of exploit
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.600]  for their own benefit well they're gonna use it to shut down coal plants and
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.000]  nuclear power plants and further strangle our our energy system they're
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.040]  using as a distraction from the bedlam in the Middle East dr. Bowman what's
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.320]  your view on the Middle East situation I mean they admit mi6 British
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:13.520]  intelligence is all over this what's the end game there from your view well I'm
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:18.760]  afraid the New World Order is attempting to use this to subvert these
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:26.240]  revolutions and get control and and put yet another puppet strong man in each
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:33.840]  of those places so that they can continue to exploit the resources I hope
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:40.600]  that doesn't happen my speaking tour is talking basically about the end of
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:49.840]  empire what we need is a totally new foreign and military policy which abandons
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:56.280]  this thing of puppet dictators all around the world and has a foreign
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:02.000]  policy of non-intervention of no corporate wars of aggression like we're
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:13.040]  fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan if we do a no-fly zone in Libya I dearly hope
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:20.840]  that that's all we do and that we don't subvert the whole thing and oh there's
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:25.720]  already special forces CIA controlled revolution yeah they're already on the
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:32.160]  ground they've been sas has been caught it it's so I mean I I'm calling for us
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:41.680]  to end the wars bring all our troops home give away all our foreign bases
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:46.320]  700 bases around the world that would fix the deficit we don't have much time
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:50.320]  let's move to more callers dr. Bowman stay there Tim in Germany questions for
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:55.360]  dr. Bob Bowman or myself or comments question for you or suggestion I would
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:21:00.440]  suggest the info warriors you are helping and instructing and informing
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:07.280]  should get onto forums or chats in Japan and for example link the article he had
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.920]  yesterday on the CIA helping in the cover-up because I think there is a big
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:19.400]  evidence of a cover-up in with the media my example for that is whenever the
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:25.080]  reactor 3 exploded and the one that you are so worried about the size of the
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:32.360]  explosion on NHK world Japanese TV station they constantly while this was
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:40.680]  happening presumably or shortly before they showed the this force tsunami
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:44.160]  warning that was going on and this lady was just repeating they were shown an
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:49.320]  empty beach for 20 minutes or so and there's a tsunami warning reported we've
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:53.200]  seen a wave from the sea which sounds really odd because not like three meters
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:56.400]  and normally tsunami way yeah there's no doubt that they've been trying to play
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:00.000]  this thing down the whole time to not create panic the problem is then they
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.920]  lose all credibility later when they're proven to be liars and they don't really
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:07.880]  know what's going on because they've all basically evacuated from the Fukushima
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:12.540]  facility I mean how how scary is that and at the same time though it's better
[02:22:12.540 --> 02:22:15.920]  just to tell the truth so folks have confidence in what they're being told
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:21.280]  so you don't lose total confidence in an emergency and so people have time to
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:24.520]  actually get prepared and move into safe areas now that it's getting late and
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:29.200]  that radioactive cloud they're reporting will be hitting very soon in Tokyo that's
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:32.880]  associated press now they don't have time to get ready so it will cause more
[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.960]  panic a very interesting points Tim comments on what Tim was saying from
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:43.960]  Deutschland dr. Bob Bowman no I just agree but you know asking governments
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:50.120]  any governments to tell the truth boy that's a toughie I haven't had a
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:55.040]  government like that a long time yeah Kennedy told the truth quite a bit and
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:59.240]  they blew his head off that's right that's right only got a few minutes left
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:04.000]  with dr. Bob Bowman Tim anything else from Germany yeah the what I'm what I
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.280]  wonder about what they don't get managed what really frustrating is me they
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:12.840]  now thinking about dumping water from helicopters which was the step that was
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:16.880]  needed three four days ago whether they still could have let's say blown holes
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:22.160]  into the roof and dumped it and I wonder why and and I think it's a huge
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.840]  negligence they're showing there they could have moved fire fighting ships
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:30.000]  like they use in in Harbor fire so so in on the industrial complex well so I
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.400]  think previously they still had people there so they were pumping it in with
[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:39.160]  generator pumps with water see so but I appreciate your call interesting points
[02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:43.160]  what could they have done better from you know hindsight's 2020 dr. Bowman but
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:47.080]  from your watching this is an expert in in these issues what could they have
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:54.920]  done better well I agree that using helicopter dumps earlier might have
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:24:07.080]  helped as soon as the the roof was blown off the building why not but I don't
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:12.480]  know it's asking a lot of the helicopter crews sir aren't there different metals
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:19.360]  and other things that can be dumped in that that neutralize uranium to a
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:27.520]  certain extent not just water well the water is just to cool them down so they
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:34.720]  don't melt the neutralization there are some things that they can dump in there
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:39.760]  that will help but the water is the most important thing right now I only got a
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:43.600]  couple minutes left with you let's talk to Kelly and Louisiana Kelly and
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.640]  Louisiana you're on the air worldwide hi Alex I'm Kelly I'm calling from New
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:52.920]  Orleans I'm a first-time caller and I'm sorry to go off topic but there's
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:57.640]  another disaster that's going on here in the Gulf spring break is approaching and
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:01.240]  all the college kids are coming down to the beaches and the waters are
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.840]  contaminated they're still consuming from the oil and the correct that has been
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.960]  sprayed on us residents have internal bleeding seizures and unexplained
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:14.920]  bacterial infections yeah Kelly Kelly that's just like what we saw with the
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:19.360]  air is safe to breathe on ground zero this is what governments corporations do
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.600]  because they don't want to spend the money to try to mitigate things they
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:26.120]  just tell you out of sight out of mind and then your kid gets cancer I
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:29.720]  appreciate your call but we're not really in that issue right now we're
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:34.160]  covering what but but it does tie together Dr. Bowman I'm reading that
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.080]  children I guess because they have fast-growing cells are the most affected
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:43.760]  and and embryos and and gestating babies yeah why is that because they're
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:53.560]  fast-growing cells sure yeah they're much more sensitive to anything which could
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:26:02.740]  disrupt the process of cell reproduction and especially cancer now the
[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:06.200]  numbers I've seen in Chernobyl are around a million have died from
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:09.760]  complications in 25 years and you're saying this is this is approaching
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:18.200]  Chernobyl just from the outside yes I think so it may never cause as many
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:23.600]  deaths as Chernobyl because of the fact that a lot of the radiation will
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.640]  dissipate over the the Pacific Ocean but on the other hand it is possible that
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.280]  the end result is a release of considerably more radiation than came
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:43.200]  out of Chernobyl so it's not gonna be nice and we can expect government cover
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:49.000]  up like we saw the Russians do in the 1980s absolutely so we've got to have
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.040]  watchdogs universities private groups testing the water everything and the
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:57.480]  jet stream set the next three days many things and start getting here it was
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.200]  first stuff will start arriving from Friday and Saturday's debacle and then
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:04.960]  now the bigger blow-ups that'll be arriving in six days but this moment
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.480]  said that a lot of these particles are so heavy that hopefully they didn't get
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:11.080]  up into the jet stream and not much of it will get here but he said there will
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:15.920]  be an overall aggregate cancer increase effect even on a low-level exposure but
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.200]  if this continues to melt down they could get a lot worse dr. Bowman we will
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:23.920]  stay in continual contact probably have you pop back in in the next few days
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:32.600]  again give us your website one more time the patriots dot us patriots is
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:36.920]  plural and don't forget the THE because if you leave that off you get the
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:41.160]  football team absolutely we will be talking to you very very soon and hope
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.520]  to have you in studio when you come in April so folks you to get hooked up with
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:48.480]  that in Austin to get you to town we'll talk to you soon sir thank you all right
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:53.840]  there goes dr. Bob Bowman we have another radiation issue that was in USA today
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:59.400]  last Friday and that was ten times the radiation that the TSA had previously
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:03.080]  claimed is being released from the detectors for a year they refused to
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:09.560]  give Congress there's their test now they've released them TSA to reset
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.080]  airport body scanners for radiation and they report their ten times they
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:16.880]  previously claimed and that's probably a whitewash as well just another example
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.200]  of how they say du's good they don't have any radiology tested the scanners
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.320]  they've got high-powered highway scanners going out on the streets and
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:30.560]  they have the TSA workers standing under those I mean it's they're murdering
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:34.320]  these people and I'm not going in your cooker and don't look at me like I'm a
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:37.600]  crazy man when I go through the airport you go go in the body scanner and I say
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.240]  no you don't follow OSHA plus it violates my fourth amendment if you're
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:47.280]  stupid enough to be and this just happened by the way when I was traveling I
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:50.680]  went over to them and talked to them about I said don't you understand what's
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:53.720]  happening and well they would not even talk to me they were and they look
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:57.560]  completely freaked out look you can't just wave a magic wand and say radiation
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:03.080]  ain't gonna do anything you know oh get cuffed military use du gut up you know
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:09.920]  breathe it in you're men so we're gonna be breaking that down continuing with
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:12.640]  your phone calls I said I'd get to this this hour but I'll have to cover it
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:18.760]  tomorrow Obama has announced a raft of new anti-gun garbage and he's launching
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:21.920]  it against the American people and they're gonna blame them violence in
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.560]  Mexico on our guns and it turns out red-handed for two years they've been
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.440]  shipping guns into Mexico the ATF has to then track them back and claim we're
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:35.560]  causing it that CBS News that's the examiner and it is an Obama government
[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:38.920]  false flag against the Second Amendment and a lot of folks are calling for the
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:42.560]  impeachment of Obama the Attorney General and Janet Apolitano these are
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:47.520]  hardcore criminals they set this up to blame our Second Amendment they are
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:57.000]  terrorist we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:06.280]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:10.080]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:14.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:18.800]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:23.280]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:28.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:39.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:42.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:46.600]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:05.280]  1-877-327-0365 Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:09.360]  and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:13.000]  impact right here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.720]  are expected to reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:26.800]  priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35%
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:30.880]  jump in the next 60 days move quickly while you could still afford it and

[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:40.520]  we are back live I'll be doing overdrive for your phone calls Gord Gerald Paul
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:44.800]  will Donna we've got a guest in studio who was already scheduled before this
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:50.040]  whole crisis began but it ties into radiation TSA to resist airport body
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:56.000]  scanners for radiation and in the report for a year they wouldn't give
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.440]  homeland security wouldn't give Congress under orders that's the
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.560]  government the elected government wouldn't give them the information on
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:06.920]  their internal tests they're supposed to monthly radiology tests turns out they
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:12.240]  weren't doing it then when they did they found 10 times the safe levels because
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:16.320]  I mean why do the companies care if you look at the photos from these things you
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:20.040]  can see the bones in the fingers that's radiation that's shooting through and
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:24.120]  they've had top scientists in the New York Times saying it's 20 to 50 times
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:29.880]  depending on the system the radiation that's being born out here and oh and
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:36.320]  JJ stone made national news when we put a little video together from his radio
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:42.000]  show or the he was guesting on Leo Laporte's a technology show it's very
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.480]  popular heard by millions and dealing with the hands down the pants now this
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.360]  had happened to my employees this had happened to people all over the news
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.680]  back last fall and winter and the media was still denying it until it happened
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:59.760]  to more and more reporters and more and more people and it was oh and JJ stone
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:05.800]  known as the oh doctor it was his report that finally broke it out into the
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:10.160]  mainstream media and he's here for South by Southwest Ian Austin and of
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:15.040]  course oh and JJ stone also known as oh doctor host his own a show oh doctor
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:19.720]  comment frequently makes appearances on this week in tech with cranky geeks
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:27.280]  scam school in SFW and beer diplomacy he's also the founder of inquiring minds
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:36.320]  media and he's Twitter is at Oh doctor D O C T a H and we'll follow him at
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:40.760]  twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones we'll get that done right now in
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:45.440]  fact next hour I will take your questions or your statements one line
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:50.640]  statements on the situation and do you now they admit at least reactor two has
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:56.360]  been the containment a facility blew away and the and the internal seals have
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:02.280]  been broken the mark one also blew up yesterday and they're saying it could be
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:07.160]  exposed that's a plutonium uranium reactor very dangerous 40 years old 40
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:14.000]  year design 39 year old facility six plants there four of them have had
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.720]  fires or explosions this is getting worse by the minute people are starting
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:21.680]  to flee Tokyo with the radiation cloud making its way down there now here's a
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.600]  P radiation level sores after Japan nuke plant fire but then it's just
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.160]  radiation radiation radiation the TSA now is rolling out at checkpoints at
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:34.880]  train stations bus stations they have high-powered radiation systems on the
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.520]  news with the National Garden or TSA 2,000 arrest foxtons reported in one
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:44.560]  year in upstate New York searching citizens with newscast of them driving
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:49.000]  under high-powered x-ray scanners that shoot through the metal of the car I
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.720]  mean that makes a chest x-ray look like a joke so it's not just a fourth
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:58.320]  amendment violator it it just shows how government's gone crazy and oh doctor
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:03.520]  what re-describe well first off what's your take on the whole disaster in
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:07.440]  Japan and the cover-up that's now been exposed and where this is going and then
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:11.120]  we'll go back into your story at the hands of the TSA and what's unfolded
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:16.400]  since then so two things first of all thank family on the show secondly the
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.160]  biggest thing is Japan is the third richest nation in the world and all this
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:24.040]  money we're about to throw at them and banks are gonna you'll steal the money
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:27.840]  hide the money not send the money can I get some of that off the deficit that we
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:31.640]  owe them the $565 billion we own I mean we're about to throw a lot of money at
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.400]  this problem and a lot of that money's gonna disappear I would like someone to
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:39.120]  be keeping an eye on it so that we're not just throwing money away or throwing
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:42.560]  money at the problem secondly hopefully this makes the government do something
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:46.320]  about nuclear plants that are clean and healthy and safe you there's nothing
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:49.480]  safe with an earthquake so all the things I've heard from my whole lifetime
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:54.040]  of solar power we're gonna do all these things that we're gonna do now it's time
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:57.200]  to start harnessing the Sun maybe mr. Obama I mean you keep telling me these
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:02.000]  are jobs of the future if a if a solar farm gets rocked by an earthquake I
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.560]  don't have to worry about this radiation I don't have to worry about the
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:07.040]  millions and millions of people that are gonna die in the middle of the country
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:11.400]  or wherever these nuclear plants are so there's a lot to be going on with this
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:15.240]  situation that people need to take a look at we could sustain with green
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:20.240]  energy but we talk about it we don't do it so sad but true something like this
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.080]  has to happen to make people realize that it's a dangerous world we live in
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:27.440]  and we can't just keep eating what people are feeding us because you'll end up
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:30.740]  sick well I'm all for real green energy the problem is everything the
[02:38:30.740 --> 02:38:34.880]  government rolls out our sweetheart deals with big corporations for mega farms
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:38.960]  that then don't transmit it long distance as well the answer is tax incentives
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:43.360]  to have everybody go solar themselves that's what I'm doing without the
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.680]  government we need those incentives to be totally or no tax on that and I'll
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:51.160]  guarantee you there'll be solar panels in every house and and and go
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:55.480]  decentralized but the big boys don't like that case in point my friend just
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:59.760]  got sore pounds put on his home pay for it himself they won't come out to
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:03.240]  inspect it to connect it he's not allowed to plug it in and start using it
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:06.600]  six months he's been waiting for an inspector to come out after he's paid
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:10.160]  and bought had him installed why because they don't want him but you get it
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:14.360]  immediately if you put them in and tied into the grid exactly exactly they don't
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:17.200]  want you owning your own power they don't want you saving your own money after
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:21.000]  you spent your hard-earned money on solar power so it's all a scam and a system
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.320]  that what you just said the big boys want to keep the money to themselves so
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:29.360]  again a problem like this a crisis like this it puts a huge spotlight on the
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:33.920]  games that are played with green energy and everyone having green energy let's
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:36.160]  go back to that split shot that looks good guys
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.120]  wow a great crew in there well it's so good to have you here because I am a fan
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:45.520]  of the shows you do I am a fan of this weekend tech and you know everything
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.800]  you're doing but but this whole TSA thing does get down to radiation again
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:53.800]  and before 1991 they wouldn't let the troops use DU because in all their
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.760]  studies they knew it would not kill only kill the enemy but kill them it has a
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:00.720]  four and a half billion year half-life and it's very radioactive and poisonous
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:04.760]  now they just use it now they've got the the scanners going on the streets much
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:09.320]  more powerful Australia's gonna put full-body chest X-rays in now I mean
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:13.280]  since when did government and corporations wave a magic wand and
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:17.960]  suspend the laws of physics and radiology and it'll break down what
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:22.680]  happened to you with the TSA well we didn't have the body scanner situation
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:25.240]  where I was at because they didn't have those there they just the hands down the
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:27.760]  pants they want to do the hands on the pants and they wanted to take me in a
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:31.640]  private room to do it they highly encourage the private room I refuse the
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:34.480]  private room probably they wanted to rob your bags as they've been caught or
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.720]  whatever they wanted to do I just know that criminals do things in the dark you
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:41.880]  know they don't do things in the middle of the day I don't want to be behind
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:44.440]  closed doors with these guns exactly because anything can happen and you
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.680]  hear stories and everything's always a lot of people get killed like that woman
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:50.880]  in Phoenix they beat her to death and said she choked herself on her own
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:54.400]  handcuffs or behind her back yeah well I don't want anything like that happening
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:58.000]  to me regardless of what people say oh skeptical you can't believe it all I know
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  is is that there's no reason for them to take me to private room if there's
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.520]  nothing wrong with they're gonna do if your check is so thorough so legal so
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.720]  righteous then stand out here and do it in front of everyone else there's no
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:11.640]  reason to take me to private room I don't have guns I don't have drugs I don't
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:15.080]  have any kind of weaponry on me I don't even travel with liquids so there's no
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.000]  reason to I need to go through my bag and private no tell us where this
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:24.560]  airport was and what they did this is the Oakland Airport and basically I
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:28.360]  wore the same clothes a week before flying through San Francisco no check I
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:31.520]  just walked through didn't beep have a nice day mr. Stone the next week they
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:35.880]  implemented their new rules with the same exact outfit and they had to put
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:39.600]  their hands in my pants and they do touch your junk as it were as funny as it
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:43.320]  sounds for people to say but they do pass they do that to Ventura yeah I mean
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:47.080]  that's why soon yeah I mean people so they don't do that I'm like they do do
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:51.920]  that you know it's uncomfortable no their manual says actually put pressure
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:56.160]  they check it they see what it is all let me let me they they they I didn't get
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:00.160]  grabbed but they were pushing on my stuff in the front and the back I can't
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:04.640]  handle it yeah so that's what Ventura said that he really couldn't stand on
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:08.640]  his word and children listening but it is a medical turn he said they went and
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:13.320]  pressed pressed into his quote anus I mean that mean literally they stick their
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:16.280]  hand between I mean that's incredible yeah that's worth I mean I would go
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:20.120]  crazy I mean yeah it really makes you freak out and the guy was very
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:24.000]  apologetic and I'm like if this is your job and you're okay with this job how
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.120]  could you just keep saying I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry why are you doing this
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:32.720]  one because maybe you couldn't pay me a million dollars to stick my hand in
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:36.240]  people's crack and grab their genitals I mean give me a break and and they're
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.480]  getting paid nothing to do it which is the odd part I mean especially with
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.320]  the people that are checking children my child has not flown she's three she
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.720]  won't fly until she's four or five you know this all started when Michelle here
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:49.800]  in the office with her eight-year-old and her year and a half old they were
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:54.160]  having men grabbing him who wants to touch children who wants to touch a man
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:58.520]  touching little girls who wants to touch a child it's it's it's it's embarrassing
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:02.880]  it's disgusting and and that that alone is the thing that freaks me out the
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.600]  most if my child if they wanted to search my child I walked by got the
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:09.840]  airport if my child goes through that now they're saying if you try to leave
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:13.960]  they then arrest you it's like it's like I'm gonna molest you know and we're
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:17.920]  gonna do this you're gonna put up with it I'm either gonna be arrested or killed
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:20.800]  because nobody's touching my child so they say we're gonna do this to you yeah
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:26.720]  and it's the thing about kid doesn't have that moral compass and well it's now
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.160]  causing problems because kids are saying I thought it's wrong mommy I thought it's
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:34.120]  wrong daddy for exactly you tell your kids don't let strangers touch you or
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:37.760]  take you anywhere strange don't go with strangers and as they said I want to
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:40.800]  take your child to a room and now we see the images of like four-year-old kids
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.920]  having their shirts taken off that was that was disgusting again it wouldn't
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:48.280]  happen to me I don't know I don't know what kind of parents they are but I saw
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:52.080]  the video tape where they made the little boy pull a shirt up okay this is
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:55.200]  prisoner training this is to break our will what do you think of the public
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:58.160]  announcements that TSA is gonna be all over the streets so you pull up to a
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.800]  checkpoint and they're out there and they're gonna make you drive under
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:06.280]  radiators I'm just waiting for Egypt in America I'm waiting for people to start
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:09.920]  riding burning things down people think it's a joke but that's gonna happen at
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:13.880]  some point you can only push people so far I mean the gas price is going back
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:17.000]  up again for absolutely no reason and I mean people sit there and they take it
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.880]  and they take it but people can't afford it right now I mean maybe four years
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.920]  ago the economic situation wasn't as bad so five dollars all you cry about it you
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:27.160]  stay home right now people being unemployed and gas prices going up through
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:30.280]  the roof and you can't get anywhere to feed your kids to take care of your kids
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:34.200]  somebody's gonna set something on fire that's what Gerald Salente says when
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:37.920]  people lose everything they lose it and when they lose their jobs the blood
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:42.960]  starts flowing yep I mean at some point I don't understand how you think that you
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:46.680]  could put so much pressure on someone who has nothing and not have it blow back
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.040]  at you and you see we saw that in Egypt I mean the man running Egypt is one of
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:53.720]  the richest men in the world literally the guy could finance his own country but
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:57.000]  yet the United States sends two billion dollars there a year and how they're
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.920]  saying Mubarak had estimated eight billion twelve billion I mean and we're
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:04.440]  and we're sending that country eight every year for what I mean this man could
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.920]  fund his own country but as yet he robs and steals from it and it leaves
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:13.440]  everyone in the average citizen is paid two dollars or less a day 52% and this
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:16.680]  guy's got billions and billions of dollars and then he wonders why somebody's
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:20.600]  out front his gate with a pitchfork I mean it's insane so you know the
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:27.160]  Milwaukee situation with the with the jobs and everything like that's just a
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:30.080]  small rumbling of what's gonna happen when you start pushing people too much
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:33.240]  and folks can demonize unions all day I'm not saying they're perfect but the
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.640]  larger issue is the big banks have stolen 28 trillion dollars in the last
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:41.280]  two years of we give them our tax money we got to pay it back in taxes and
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:45.440]  interest and then they make the scapegoats some unions and say oh this is all
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:49.120]  happening because of them you could get rid of all that and it wouldn't pay any
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:54.240]  of this fake debt down not to get on that rope but unions are evil apparently
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.200]  but the fact that banks can go ask for money for free tax payers money not give
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.240]  us any interest back on it you know we're getting a 1.2% you get at the bank
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:05.560]  but then they go get their bonuses and their checks and the raises but then a
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.720]  teacher the educators of our youth can't get a raise of five thousand dollars a
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:13.640]  year because oh that's just outrageous we can't pay that much well the banks
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:16.840]  stole their money their pension funds and gambled them away and then our
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:20.640]  government our tax your own tax dollars has to bail back out your educators and
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:24.760]  people don't care about it I mean it's insane it's in the president of the
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:28.880]  United States to say I want to put a cap on it softly just do it you're the man
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:32.680]  right just just cut these banks off stop letting them spend them well they put
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:36.880]  him in power they control the Republicans to it's totally financed and if
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.360]  people think you're gonna get any change from these folks you're gonna get more
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:43.640]  of the same yeah you're not and then like well here's the deal the dollars
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:49.000]  already been devalued look at inflation in oil gold silver food food prices
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:53.160]  are up over 30% in the last 12 months and and people people whether they're
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:57.120]  free market teachers whatever it is they need that money people are running out
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:00.120]  of money and what do they think's gonna happen and then meanwhile the bankers
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.480]  are all making record profits and telling us about how welfare is bad and
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:06.840]  I'm against it because it makes people dependent but the point is they're the
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:10.600]  biggest recipients of corporate welfare this the smallest things create the
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:15.640]  biggest motions so you the Wall Street raises gas barrel prices then they say
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:19.040]  oh we'll cost more money to ship your food to your locations your food goes up
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:22.000]  then your boss says oh well you know I've got to come back because I'm spending
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.720]  my money on all these things affect each other and no one says anything and
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:28.800]  that's why I'm waiting for something to erupt to make a change well you notice
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.080]  though government the last decade has gotten ready for martial law trained to
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:35.320]  police the tasers admittedly getting ready for this they knew they were
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:39.000]  engineering this yeah and and they want to have a big blow-up in the country as
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:42.280]  a pretext to bring in even more control I just want to take our government back
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.680]  and and then we wouldn't have to you know go that route well I don't know how
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.280]  it's gonna happen out people being upset first I mean even the welfare
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:52.280]  situation as you talked about if the government just did something simple
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:55.600]  like oh your own welfare we do a drug test every other month to make sure you're
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:58.800]  not on any dependency you know many people you'd knock off a welfare and
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:01.800]  be forced them to go get a job because they're sitting at home getting high and
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:05.440]  and it's not that people in welfare can have every kind of person gets high but
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:08.400]  I mean if you're just giving money away why don't you cut down on some of the
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.840]  things you're wasting money on but we don't we release all the nonviolent
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:14.840]  offenders out of prisons you know how many hundreds of billions that cost
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:18.600]  because we've got to keep people locked up it's just a business it's a business
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:23.040]  they're not making jokes and go they build two beds for every per every person
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:26.240]  it's in jail for a amount of kids they have they're preparing for their children
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:29.920]  to go to jail instead of spending that money to educate children and get them
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:33.200]  into schools which would keep them out of jail they make more beds for them
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:37.000]  waiting for them to come to jail oh I just got locked up I've got two kids one
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.360]  of those kids is coming to jail we'll have a bed waiting for them again folks
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.520]  are amazing guests it's great to have him in studio we can do Skype interviews
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:48.800]  in the future stood up to the TSA spoke out against them you know I see the TSA
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:53.600]  as the globalist perfect takeover tool federalization tool but also the perfect
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:56.400]  way to bring the left and right together and and people all between
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  libertarians you know people off the political reservation because it's
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:03.560]  something everybody doesn't like it's something that all Americans understands
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:08.480]  of violation and that's why the system is so scared of this oh doctor is because
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.520]  they realize it's a political issue that brings us together yeah and and again
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.160]  like maybe what you're saying I don't want it to blow up but some things got
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:19.440]  to happen where people are just putting this container and they're so tight
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:23.760]  together that they just have to get out and now would unify everyone to move
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:26.560]  towards something at least to educate themselves because most people sit at
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.960]  home and they watch things they don't care now that radiation is big right now
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:33.200]  and it's on every channel you can't get away from it you're gonna think about
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:35.760]  that the next time you go to the airport and somebody wants to stick you in a
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:39.400]  booth radiation isn't bad then have an officer stand in that booth all day
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:43.080]  every day well and get scanned while one person gets scanned and walks on their
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:48.240]  way I guarantee you they won't do it well I've looked at the spec studies it's
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:52.200]  splattering and leaking anyways on those guys all day and and the only person
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:55.200]  that might be saved as the person hiding behind in the back scanning the
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:58.680]  pictures supposedly deleting them as soon as you walk out but they've been
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:03.640]  caught not deleting exactly one federal courthouse at 34,000 images people are
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:06.960]  faulty and they're human how can you trust anybody real well who would want
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.000]  that job that's why they've caught so many of them that are perverts plant and

[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:11.560]  through and I see people go with flip flaps on and just walk barefoot across
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:15.240]  that floor I've seen people with green feet yes it's disgusting I don't I just
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.360]  don't understand like especially barefoot like are you crazy thousands and
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:23.480]  I never have had athletes foot since I played football in high school as soon
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:27.160]  as they started this the last six seven years flying almost every time I've
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:30.600]  learned to carry extra socks and as soon as I walked through my socks I peel
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:33.560]  them off put them in my bags you know sitting there in the bathroom trying to
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:36.960]  put my feet on the floor and put new socks on or I get athletes foot yeah you
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:40.920]  get I mean thousands of people at LAX I got to walk through it yeah it's
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:44.440]  disgusting and people again people don't even think about the small things that
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.160]  add up to something much bigger but at some point hopefully that changes
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:53.040]  starting with this this tragedy in Japan today you know this these nuclear
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:57.200]  actors going off I mean really I mean people in Delaware right now are really
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:01.240]  nervous and really upset about where they live more than ever and they're
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:04.040]  going to speak out about the new plants that they want to build everywhere again
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.840]  we talked about the green energy and how there's a system in a scam but Lord
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.800]  knows that something's got to change with the way everything gets done in his
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.920]  country we're going into overdrive in the fourth hour to take your phone calls
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:19.240]  and recap the latest off-the-chart news radiation level soars after Japan
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:23.680]  new plant fire a lot of folks are fleeing Tokyo as a radiation filled cloud
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:30.400]  with strontium the cesium and I'm pronouncing that right in the radioactive
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.440]  iodine pray for those folks and they now admit at least one reactor core is open
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:38.760]  and has been breached let me tell you folks this is serious news look at how
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:42.240]  government just got caught lying and lying again there's mushroom clouds at
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:47.160]  reactors and they say no problem how is it possible that anyone in the right
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:50.640]  mind sits in an office somewhere and listens to some minions say we can get
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:54.600]  away with this cell phones cameras internet everywhere why would you bother
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:57.880]  they bother because most people are ignorant and stupid that's the bottom
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:02.200]  line and you can make your stupid you keep the teachers underpaid it's just a
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:05.880]  system like I said top to bottom of little things that keep people in their
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:09.520]  little mindset and keep them out of the public but that's why things like that I
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:12.560]  love when they lie I love when they lie because it's going to get caught you
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:15.920]  can't hide anything anymore and so to keep doing it just makes them look
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:19.600]  stupider and stupider and they get weaker and weaker and at some point we'll
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.640]  happen and then the government's filled the dumb down people now a product of
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:26.560]  this where everything's just starting to unravel yeah a lot of political scientists
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:30.040]  I talked to say this is a real problem remember what George Carlin said about
[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:33.560]  there's a big club and you ain't in it and he said and they want you dumb and
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:37.120]  you know that whole rap he did yeah I don't even know if I'd want to be rich
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:40.720]  and be in that club I'd probably be sick from all the sinister things that they
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:44.360]  have going on behind closed doors I mean literally just to say things when they
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.800]  know it takes one person with a camera and an internet connection to blow it
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:51.760]  out of the water because now with the Twitters and the Facebook everything goes
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:54.560]  viral and they can't control it and that's why they're losing credibility but
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:58.840]  they're using a 30 year old Cold War model of lying and the people don't get
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:01.760]  it's not working and that's why the bigger corporations want to take over the
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:06.080]  internet so they can bottleneck that and keep their power yeah even Al Franken
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.160]  senators out saying quote headline Franken they're after the internet they've
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:14.120]  openly announced they want to shut down the web as we know it you know what I'm
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:17.320]  gonna do at least 30 minutes overdrive but I want to do five minutes with you
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.640]  one minute break and finishing up oh doctor on your view of how they're
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:25.480]  trying to kill the old free internet as we knew it that I promise we're going to
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:31.320]  get a gourd Gerald Paul will Donna at eight after I'm going directly to your

[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:32.600]  happening in Japan it's getting worse and worse by the minute we've been
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:36.560]  proven unfortunately right again I said Friday that there was meltdowns going on
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:39.800]  I said Saturday with the explosion that there was going to be containment
[03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:44.680]  system breaches now that's admitted today and no one's at the plant now
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:47.240]  they're talking about have a helicopter's flower and drop stuff that
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:50.720]  that's coming up in the next segment with your phone calls I promise you were
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:53.320]  talking about the attack on the Internet there's a whole cocktail of
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:59.520]  Internet IDs taxes tracking throttling back alternative media the new Google
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:03.320]  algorithm they admit targets alternative growing media because the old line media
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:06.680]  is dying the government's discredited they're all teaming up openly hitting
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:10.400]  the panic button saying shut it down shut it down but isn't Pandora's box
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:13.800]  already open break down the constellation of attacks you see as a
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:17.680]  technology researcher in the Internet that that they're going after so
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:22.560]  basically with Twitter and the Facebook sharing you can't stop something that
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:26.240]  someone says if someone puts something on a Facebook page oh the government lied
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.080]  about the radiation levels it takes one other person in their network to share
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:33.760]  with up to 5,000 people and then other person up to 5,000 people or even if they
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:37.880]  have a fan page with 20,000 30,000 people it just reaches out and you see the
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:40.880]  government try to slow it down with Twitter is no well could you not talk
[03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:44.840]  about you know Israel or you know could you stop and Twitter's like well sure
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:47.280]  because I don't want to make the government upset but then everybody
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:50.000]  already knows it and then they go Twitter why would you do that we need to
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.240]  hear what these people are saying on the ground so we understand real time
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.760]  because real time you can't lie it's circumventing the old controlled media
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:02.240]  mainstream media can't get a hold of it they can't stop it they can't rewrite
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:05.080]  what they want to rewrite because people on the ground saying hey people are
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:08.360]  dying out here people are starving out here we're set stuff on fire here you
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:12.560]  know Egypt you think starting down the internet was a real big reason why they
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:15.320]  wanted to keep it out they wanted to stop it from getting out so what they do
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:19.160]  they turn off everyone's cell phones and Internet and that's what control the
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:21.760]  Internet here's gonna and the whole country came to a grinding hole and
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:23.960]  that's what they want to do with these little things they say oh well you're
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:27.680]  using too much bandwidth well bandwidth means if you're in a viral sector and
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:29.640]  you're looking at things you're trying to get information you're trying to
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:33.000]  download they can cap you off and look all they've done this for years on YouTube
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.800]  we'll have a video that gets a million views in a day and suddenly they just
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:40.440]  delist it remove it it's still there but it just stops I'm sure someone in
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:43.080]  government that has a job to just watch these things and make calls and say
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:45.720]  could you take stuff down well no they admit Joe Lieberman does it all the time
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.000]  isn't it staff and the biggest thing again when I said bottleneck you can't
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:53.200]  keep that information people because once it gets out a spark happens and they
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:56.000]  could stop it just like how they cut off the internet and Egypt but at that
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.920]  point you already have videos flying around people sharing them you already
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:01.920]  had tweets flying around people sharing them and that's why they want to cap and
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:05.040]  control the internet because these free market spaces these things that are
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:08.120]  making money and creating jobs in America are the same thing that are
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:13.280]  disposing the governments they're exposing them you can't lie about a kid in
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:16.360]  Japan with a cell phone looking up at a mushroom cloud you can't tell me there's
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:19.480]  not a mushroom cloud it only takes one person with a cell phone and an internet
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:22.240]  connection I mean the Apple store stand open give a free yeah they tried to
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:25.800]  cover up the mushroom cloud the Apple stores are out there so somebody said
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:28.560]  they're giving free Wi-Fi and power they're one of the only places people
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.080]  have internet so somebody's running around taking video running back uploading
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:36.400]  this video and then boom your whole lie of telling me someone who is nowhere
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:39.600]  near Japan that nothing's wrong I'm looking at a video looking at a mushroom
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.360]  cloud from some kid in Japan so who am I to believe the government or an
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:47.880]  independent person saying hey we're dying out here we need help well cast
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:51.520]  Sunstein the White House regulations are said they're gonna pose as thousands
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:55.840]  of alternative media to pump this info out to try to discredit us but then we
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:59.440]  get that info and show how they did that yeah because we've got the billions
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:03.720]  of people they've got their centralized lies it just doesn't work and they're
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:07.360]  burning themselves down and the biggest thing too is just anything that
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:10.680]  threatens their business model Comcast wants to kill Netflix because they can't
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:14.440]  buy Netflix so what do they do they're gonna cut off their throttle cut off
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:18.120]  their internet off their service and in essence killing a company the United
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:20.880]  States government is gonna let one company kill another company and not
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:24.760]  capitalism not buying them out not dismantling them literally taking one
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:28.000]  service away that's technically because they can't compete that's technically
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:31.920]  free and then just kill another company because the government says I'm by the
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:35.720]  way we built the internet with the bills we pay they charge us for all this
[03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:39.200]  bandwidth on both ends they're they're they're making money they start
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:42.120]  complaining about all your using bandwidth they've got all the algorithms
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:45.840]  they're making huge profits and you're paying for it folks you're paying for the
[03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:50.400]  stinking bandwidth and my favorite thing is is the price will go up for less
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:54.360]  usage and the people who can't afford it again people who are on the bottom getting
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:57.120]  this information that they desperately cuts off the poor people it's the same
[03:04:57.120 --> 03:04:59.520]  thing with the power plants they shut them down that they made more money with
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:03.200]  a few that are left oh Dr. Great Avenue before you throw away your used batteries

[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:23.840]  developments the people are starting a mass exodus from Tokyo there is a big
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:33.360]  radiation cloud of strontium and we said 90 radioactive iodine cesium coming
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:36.760]  that way and the government is admitting that it well a little bit of it
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:40.800]  won't hurt you too bad that a lot will kill you a long exposure so pray for
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:46.360]  those folks radiation levels soar after third nuke explosion Tokyo wind radiation
[03:08:46.360 --> 03:08:50.400]  plume could reach capital by nightfall Europe's energy commissioner calls it an
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:54.360]  apocalypse and guys print me all those new ones please thank you spent nuke
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:09:00.120]  fuel pool may be boiling panic may dump water on pool by helicopter that's
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:03.720]  boiling with all those radioactive isotopes out into the atmosphere panic
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:07.400]  residents start to flee they're also reporting there's been at least four
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:13.440]  perhaps five explosions two last night and that at least number twos containment
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:18.240]  facility is breached is breached and that stuff's on fire in there ladies and
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:22.240]  gentlemen this just went to Chernobyl levels but you heard dr. Bob Bowman a
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:27.320]  lot of it's blowing out to sea not good though if you're eating the fish out of
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:33.480]  there this is just unspeakable right now obviously and what does that say about
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:38.040]  the propaganda of the nuclear power industry I'm a pro technology guy but
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:42.520]  you know give me coal any day I've studied energy they've got totally clean
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:46.760]  burning coal that's why they want to tax carbon dioxide now because that's all
[03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:50.200]  that's coming out in water vapor and you can get people they've done studies
[03:09:50.200 --> 03:09:54.360]  where most people will shine on to ban dihydrogen monoxide if because they it's
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:58.800]  a scary name that's water carbon dioxide sound scary most people in studies
[03:09:58.800 --> 03:10:01.280]  they've done and you've seen it on TV where they go to an environmental
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:04.400]  meeting and say let's ban dihydrogen monoxide they say yes let's ban it and
[03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:08.360]  they sign the petition let's ban sodium chloride yes ban it that's table salt
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:14.680]  this is what they're doing and well let's go to your phone calls I want to
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:18.000]  get to a lot of them I may do an entire hour of overdrive this is just too
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:22.560]  important what's happening Gord in Canada then Gerald Paul will Donna Gord
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:27.600]  thanks for holding her on the air thank you Alex longtime listener first time
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:32.400]  caller hi Dr. Stone I'm a registered herbalist I've been practicing
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:36.240]  herbalism just north of Toronto for a while and I wanted to cover a few
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:40.960]  separate things but quickly go over the dosing of the iodine there's there might
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:46.360]  be a bit of misunderstanding about the difference between kelp and elemental
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:52.160]  iodine so when you're taking like you mentioned some product that you had in
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:59.280]  front of you that gives you 150 micrograms per drop right so to get what
[03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:05.480]  would equal six milligrams of Lugel's iodine per drop you'd have to take 40
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:12.640]  drops of a regular kelp based product that yields a smaller amount of iodine
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:16.440]  are you a pharmacist I'm a herbalist well I mean I had a
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:24.440]  agreed pharmacist on the radio broadcast just earlier and he he he specifically
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:29.440]  with the iodine from kelp disagreed with the statement you just made right I
[03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:34.520]  know but I just that's why I wanted to clear it up because kelp fight like a
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:41.800]  teaspoon of kelp 5,000 milligrams will only give you one to five milligrams of
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:45.840]  iodine yeah you're not you're not listening to me sir we're not even
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:50.920]  talking about raw kelp here we're talking about iodine from kelp iodine
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:57.000]  extracted from kelp like vitamin C extracted from tangerine peels right I
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:00.880]  understand that but you need to take enough kelp to give you the elemental
[03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:06.240]  iodine of six milligrams and so it's not you're not taking kelp per se you're
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:09.960]  taking the iodine levels yes sir appreciate your call yes we understand
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:15.720]  that thank you let's talk to Gerald in West Virginia Gerald you're on the year
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:24.880]  yeah good what's on your mind okay I got a couple of questions first off on the
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:31.840]  iodine what about people like me that are extremely allergic to iodine I mean
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:36.480]  if I eat if I eat a couple pieces of seafood I get extremely well that's the
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:41.600]  same thing if I say a good storable food is peanut butter but you're you are
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:45.560]  allergic to peanut butter then you don't want to eat peanut butter you because
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:49.220]  you know that if you're allergic to penicillin you don't want to take it but
[03:12:49.220 --> 03:12:53.320]  yes that's a good question for a pharmacist or a medical doctor what does
[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:57.240]  someone do who's allergic to iodine now are you allergic to certain types of
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:01.760]  extracted iodine because iodine is in is in all sorts of foods I mean I mean
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:07.440]  can you not eat eat bread or waffles that have alfalfa in it because that has
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:15.880]  just just seafood like if I eat crab legs or crabs then or I get really
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:19.280]  extremely sick well you might be allergic to something else in there I
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:23.200]  mean I really I can't tell you sir because I'm not a doctor or a pharmacist
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:27.000]  but that's a good question what's your overall view of the devastating news
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:31.360]  we're being pretty calm about here and we did predict this three days ago that
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:38.800]  that at least the reactor number two at Fukushima has been exposed the
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:44.920]  containment vessel has been exposed okay I'm from West Virginia you know
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:48.840]  everybody likes to make fun of all those hillbillies but let me tell you
[03:13:48.840 --> 03:13:55.280]  something I think this that this is an extreme cover-up I do believe that this
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:14:02.360]  is way worse than anybody is letting out well I agree with you and I appreciate
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:08.280]  your call Paul in Alabama you're on the air hey thanks for taking my call I know
[03:14:08.280 --> 03:14:12.720]  you and Dr. Bowman said that not as much radiation I was gonna hit the US because
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:16.160]  of the crossing the ocean there I mean I didn't say that because I don't but
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:19.240]  Bowman said you know that hopefully most of it will go in the ocean and I would
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:23.440]  think I would imagine that's the case and he said there's a slight change in the
[03:14:23.440 --> 03:14:29.440]  jet stream too well I just wanted to not to try to beat this to death but the
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:33.400]  thing was something real quick with the iodine okay there's three types of iodine
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:38.200]  supplements you can use to protect from the radioactive iodine there's iodine
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:43.200]  supplements like the kale that you have on there's potassium iodide and there's
[03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:50.800]  potassium iodate okay the the IO stat pills contain 130 milligrams of potassium
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:56.560]  iodide okay the equivalents to that are a hundred milligrams of the supplemental
[03:14:56.560 --> 03:15:02.760]  iodine like you have 130 milligrams of the iodide and 170 milligrams of the
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:07.720]  iodate okay now you're I want you to look at the back of your bottle it says
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:17.640]  it's in micrograms MCG my correct yes okay micrograms one microgram is the
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:23.440]  equivalent to point zero zero one milligrams and I heard when you were on
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:28.080]  with with Ben Fuchs earlier and he's and he said the pills the IO stat pills
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:35.320]  contain 130 milligrams of iodine okay and those your your drops are in
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:41.560]  micrograms okay for 130 micrograms I think there's your bottle set 120 or
[03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:50.280]  130 micrograms 150 150 micrograms that would be point one five milligrams okay
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:56.080]  so for you to get the the same equivalent as one of the IO stat pills you
[03:15:56.080 --> 03:16:06.600]  would have to take 130,000 drops of that kale substance Fuchs I'll have to stick
[03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:10.560]  with him and research that but I appreciate that again I don't want to
[03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:14.760]  sit here and obsess over this all day long and just get completely obsessed
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:20.040]  with it you know the point is if your thyroid is filled with the good iodine
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:24.400]  it needs it will not absorb anymore if it gets what it needs I've read that it
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:28.200]  is overkill with these pills these IO stat that makes some people get sick I'm
[03:16:28.200 --> 03:16:31.800]  not a medical doctor I'm not giving you advice I've told you what I've done okay
[03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:37.120]  folks we're talking about meltdown going on at four reactors we're talking about
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:41.280]  giant explosions fires we're talking about a radioactive cloud going towards
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:46.280]  Tokyo and as many experts have stated if we're dealing with uranium and
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:50.640]  plutonium it's not even gonna matter with iodine okay so the issue is thank
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:54.840]  God there's an ocean between us called the Pacific Ocean and I'm not getting
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:01.000]  an argument with you Paul it just it goes on and on and on and and and then it
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:04.600]  becomes I must provide everything for everyone and I must have the answers and
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:09.480]  I must you know you know do all of this let's go ahead and talk to will in
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:14.200]  Kentucky you're on the air will yeah hi Alex how are you today good what do you
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:17.480]  think about what's happening in Japan I think it's right man I think the
[03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:21.040]  government has their hand in it they had their hand in everything that this goes
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:25.280]  on around us today in the news that it before it makes the news we know about
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:30.120]  it and like you said the internet is going away they're trying to get to try
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:33.760]  to get rid of that part so that we can't tell them what we think of them oh what's
[03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:38.680]  what's going on what they're doing behind our backs at any rate I was looking
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:43.320]  at that I was listening to dr. Baldwin that you had on earlier and he he
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:47.160]  mentioned something about they know the iodide and all that it just people put
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:51.600]  you here potassium iodide they're running crazy to get to the stores it's
[03:17:51.600 --> 03:17:55.640]  you go on the internet look up potassium iodide all it says it's sold out
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:18:01.320]  everywhere you can't get it absolutely there we go another call on that subject
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:08.520]  I mean I my whole issue here is at this point we can't here's the biggest issue
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:14.960]  we can't trust the Japanese government the UN the US government to tell us the
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:18.600]  truth you heard moment that those detectors they've got testing the
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:23.040]  Japanese people are only gonna pick up the radiation from uranium or
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:28.880]  plutonium they're not gonna pick up generally the cesium the radioactive
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:36.760]  iodine the strontium so it it it this is a can of worms and we're all trying to
[03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:40.840]  figure this out together here right now that's why we're taking your phone
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:44.560]  calls but we don't know what's gonna hit us I just know that jet stream comes
[03:18:44.560 --> 03:18:48.520]  across the Pacific and historically we know Chernobyl went all the way around
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:53.720]  the world further than Japan you know over the Middle East over Russia over
[03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:57.760]  Asia over Japan over the Pacific and back over the US that was on record in
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:02.520]  1986 it orbited the planet for several years so you heard Bowman he said a lot
[03:19:02.520 --> 03:19:06.440]  of it is gonna come here a small amount of the overall but that itself will
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:10.040]  increase cancer rates there's a reason cancer is already up in the last 60
[03:19:10.040 --> 03:19:18.280]  years of the nuclear age guys search the term the factoid number of above
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:23.680]  ground nuclear test total number of above ground nuclear test with the US
[03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:31.960]  Russia the British the French and many others the Chinese I believe it's in the
[03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:38.160]  hundreds I make let's just do it super dead reckoning from ancient memory I
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:42.760]  believe there's been over 300 above ground nuclear test and the US has done
[03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:46.520]  the most of anybody we'll see if I'm right after this break the point is what
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:50.560]  do you think all those did above ground some of them dead on the ground then you
[03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:54.280]  get a lot more fallout we're gonna come back with more your phone calls straight

[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:23.360]  pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:26.880]  being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected

[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:20.600]  we are continuing overdrive throughout this hour it is now being reported by
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:24.920]  mainstream news that more deadly types of radiation are being injected directly
[03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:28.760]  into the air I'm going to be covering that after the break we're gonna have
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:36.160]  pharmacists been fused back on because this has become a big point of debate
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:41.000]  again I'm not giving medical advice here I've been saying that since Friday I
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:45.040]  have the pills I've chosen to go with the liquid because it's better absorbed
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:49.120]  and if you're and if your thyroid has enough it shuts off there is a lot more
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:53.680]  and it is overkill with the iostat but I'm that's my personal opinion okay I'm
[03:24:53.680 --> 03:24:56.520]  not here giving you advice we're gonna get Ben Fuchs back on but I went and
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:25:00.840]  looked at iodine deficiency sites that do the research and they talk about how
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:06.040]  you need 130 micrograms a day and then it fills your thyroid if you've been
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:10.360]  doing it over time obviously but we're gonna talk to a
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:13.920]  degreed pharmacist on the other side to try to explain this from his perspective
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:18.200]  but you do whatever you want okay don't take it or go eat a big piece of fish
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:21.280]  that's got it I don't care what you do do whatever you want I'm not gonna
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:25.240]  medically tell you to eat fish you do it every one okay and we eat so many GMO
[03:25:25.240 --> 03:25:28.760]  foods people are allergic to everything now in fact don't eat any food just stop
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:35.400]  eating joking now again this this whole iodine thing has completely exploded and
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:44.040]  gone crazy and so we'll continue to discuss that as well right now let's go
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:47.240]  ahead and go back to your phone calls Donna in New Hampshire you're on the
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:52.400]  air hi Alex I'm a researcher and moderator over in prison planet form
[03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:57.560]  and I've done some extensive research on trying to help people detox their
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:26:02.600]  bodies you know from radiation one of the things that I did find out throughout
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:09.720]  my research that people can go out and buy a plant called spider wart and what
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:15.080]  spider wart does is the minute any kind of radiation is present in the area
[03:26:15.080 --> 03:26:22.240]  they're in the flower will turn pink I wonder how folks are gonna find enough
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:25.720]  spider warts suddenly there'll be a shortage of spider warts I'll have to
[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:32.240]  look into that well you know that's that you know and also there if you go to the
[03:26:32.240 --> 03:26:37.400]  prison planet forum that's almost like a canary in the coal mine correct but but
[03:26:37.400 --> 03:26:41.960]  this way if you have just a little bit of detection of radiation you can start
[03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:49.840]  doing your K1 K you know 103 or you can do any kind of protection you can eat
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:55.240]  well there's a lot of things the biggest issue is sealing your house putting
[03:26:55.240 --> 03:26:58.920]  up plastic over the windows and turning off the air conditioner that's what we
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:02.640]  said Friday that's what the Japanese government saying right now you know
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:06.040]  that's the biggest issue because then the radiation will go into the dirt and
[03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:09.400]  things it's still there but you have a less of a chance of inhaling it
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:13.240]  directly out of the atmosphere and a lot of it dissipates that way and a lot of
[03:27:13.240 --> 03:27:18.480]  it will float over Japan out to sea and go into the ocean and so if people can
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:21.960]  just stay in their houses obviously if they could get out of the way of the
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:25.680]  cloud that's now approaching Tokyo reportedly already hitting it that that
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:31.840]  would be you know number one what you should do it's also important to make
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:36.240]  sure you avoid sugars and sweets during this time way too much of that in your
[03:27:36.240 --> 03:27:41.840]  system is gonna you know is gonna do danger to it also it's very important
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:48.880]  to double up on your your your D3 just be you know the fact that Americans in
[03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:55.200]  general are D3 deficient we got to keep our immune systems up very well said I
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:59.840]  appreciate the call Donna Trina in Montana you're on the air hi how are you
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:05.080]  good oh good thanks for taking my call I wanted to read you a note I have a
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:08.720]  friend who's in Japan and was caught in the earthquake and I thought you'd find
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:11.800]  this rather interesting she goes on about you know the earthquake and how
[03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:16.120]  she was frightened then she said she works in a security firm she said
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:20.320]  there's no announcement by the firm but I heard from the traders that Goldman
[03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:27.160]  Sachs on the on the 42nd floor had already evacuated and where is where is
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:33.720]  this she lives in Tokyo well I know that they've evacuated the many of the
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:39.240]  foreign embassies that was reported last night out of Tokyo and so that is
[03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:46.320]  confirmed that many foreign embassies including the British and US Embassy
[03:28:46.320 --> 03:28:51.880]  have moved into southern Japan out of central northern Japan where Tokyo is
[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:59.240]  located and so we can confirm that that that flights into Tokyo by British
[03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:04.960]  Airways Lufthansa out of Germany and others have suspended flights into Tokyo
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:10.280]  as of last night so what does that tell you well this is this is this is a thing
[03:29:10.280 --> 03:29:14.600]  she wrote this note right after the earthquake she said they had email
[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:18.040]  capabilities so she was writing her husband here in the United States right
[03:29:18.040 --> 03:29:21.840]  now so she was writing everybody to not let him know that she's okay the kids
[03:29:21.840 --> 03:29:28.280]  are okay but that that Goldman Sachs had already at the time of the earthquake
[03:29:28.280 --> 03:29:35.440]  evacuated the building well you know that's that's I'd like to see some proof

[03:33:30.500 --> 03:33:34.160]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs leaves us he's popping back in live he was on earlier
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:40.400]  today and yes if you go up to info wars team.com they do have the thyroid
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:45.600]  health kelp iodine based tablets they're right there at the top of the
[03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:49.120]  site for people that can't see them there's also some drops that that company
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:51.960]  has we're gonna get those up on there people keep asking it's out everywhere
[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:56.400]  I haven't promoted it the last four or five days it is at info wars team.com if
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:33:59.520]  you want it while supplies last I don't know how long they will but it'll be
[03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:07.960]  removed once it has been sold out that's info wars team.com I'm gonna get
[03:34:07.960 --> 03:34:11.640]  into this report after Ben Fuchs leaves us and then I'm gonna get into the
[03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:16.440]  latest developments that are earth shaking upon and unfortunately intended
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:20.640]  also this latest article is only at prisonplana.com it's going up on info
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:24.200]  wars.com the next five minutes US government blocking Americans from
[03:34:24.200 --> 03:34:28.640]  retaining potassium iodine and we're getting massive emails and confirm
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:38.600]  reports with names of where this is happening now the man gave us his full
[03:34:38.600 --> 03:34:42.600]  name and everything we need to have Watson ad name removed for privacy you
[03:34:42.600 --> 03:34:45.120]  know the guy didn't ask for that's people know this was confirmed not just a
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:48.280]  caller this is he gave the name of the place we're getting countless calls and
[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:51.280]  emails confirming that they're being told that the US government has told them
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:59.160]  not to issue this out to people and to basically keep it Germany has announced
[03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:03.880]  they're gonna shut down pre-1980 nuclear plants that's Reuters blast
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:09.760]  escalates Japan's nuclear crisis and the government is saying that radiation is
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:15.280]  now being injected directly out of the four devastated and exploded plants one
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:19.640]  and definitely reactor number two has had its core revealed the containment
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:24.560]  vessel is broken plant four may have had the same thing you saw the mark three
[03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:29.680]  plutonium based plant blows sky high yesterday the prime minister's been
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:33.880]  ordering last night and today the 500 workers back in they're not going back
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:39.200]  in so we don't know I mean this the fact that they're trying to cover their
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:45.000]  hind end saying okay reactor containment of two has been breached who knows it's
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  probably much worse if it follows the trend of what we've been seeing I'm gonna
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:53.320]  be getting into all of that coming up and of course your phone calls Terry
[03:35:53.320 --> 03:35:58.280]  Nolan Pat California and others that are patiently holding the toll free number
[03:35:58.280 --> 03:36:02.720]  800 25 at 992 31 but when I go to you please be quick as I want to get to
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:08.240]  everybody pharmacist been fuses will probably just up the controversy even
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:11.240]  more I was just taking an eye down during the break and I gave some to Phil
[03:36:11.240 --> 03:36:16.920]  will you bring that bottle back in for me thank you sir trying to explain to
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:22.200]  people the difference between this type of iodine we have the headline panic
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:26.360]  buying stocks of potassium iodine exhausted in us we have a screenshot of
[03:36:26.360 --> 03:36:31.480]  iosat indications thyroid blocking and radiation emergency only this is the
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:36.960]  stuff sold out all over the place and it says it's 130 milligrams of potassium
[03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:46.800]  iodate tablet usp and 14 tablets per package now separately they're available
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:50.600]  still in some stores though it's sold out almost everywhere iodine from kelp or
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:57.280]  dulce or alfalfa and reading mainline medical journals about this for people
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:37:00.160]  to have good thyroid function you've heard about the African tribes have the
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:03.440]  giant jowls because they live up the mountains and don't get in the iodine and
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:06.960]  they have all those illnesses other tribes that don't know have it the
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:10.800]  point is is that when your thyroid is filled with natural iodine according to
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:13.760]  all the medical doctors people we've interviewed then it won't absorb the
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:19.840]  radioactive iodine now the question is why is the pharmaceutical stuff 130
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:27.200]  milligrams and then this is 150 mcg I guess that's micrograms so what is the
[03:37:27.200 --> 03:37:30.800]  difference people are calling in saying Alex you need to take thousands of these
[03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:37.280]  drops to get the same amount of what is in the iosan well look all I'm doing
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:41.040]  here is covering alternatives I'm not giving medical advice I don't know
[03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:45.360]  okay I just know what people like pharmacist Ben Fuchs have been telling
[03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:49.800]  me been try to explain this to people in layman's terms who are confused okay
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:53.640]  here's the deal there is the recommended daily allowance of iodine
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:58.200]  suggested amount of iodine there's iodine that you need for daily functioning
[03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:03.720]  that is based in micrograms then there's the iodine that you take for
[03:38:03.720 --> 03:38:08.040]  protection for radioactive disasters for example such as SSKI or the potassium
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:13.640]  iodide pills those are measured in milligrams so when you take iodine for
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:17.440]  protection from radiation you need a lot more than when you take a baseline
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:22.080]  level for daily nutritional purposes however it's important to keep in mind
[03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:26.640]  that you can take too much iodine so you don't want to stay on a high dose of
[03:38:26.640 --> 03:38:31.040]  iodine for too long a period of time for emergencies it's understandable you do
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:34.200]  need to have a high dose of iodine to just drench your body with it so you
[03:38:34.200 --> 03:38:37.720]  don't take in that that radioactive stuff but the stuff that you're talking
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:40.840]  about the kelp derived and the stuff that you get from golf and the stuff in
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:45.200]  those that you buy the health food stores those are typically providing a
[03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:49.760]  hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty micrograms of iodine which is based
[03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:55.240]  on the recommended daily allowance of iodine so the difference is a thousand
[03:38:55.240 --> 03:39:02.560]  difference between protection and regular daily nutritional use as a
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:09.440]  pharmacist does it do any good then to take the regular nutritional supplement
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:15.360]  iodine if you can't action yes no there won't be enough for protection unless
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:18.720]  you've been doing it for a long period of time and even then it depends on how
[03:39:18.720 --> 03:39:23.120]  much you're exposed to I would certainly if I could find a potassium iodide I was
[03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:26.080]  worried about protection and I could find a potassium iodide that's the way to go
[03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:31.400]  or fsk I which is a solution of potassium iodide okay but if you've been
[03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:36.600]  taking the regular type for a long time though then that that does it helps it
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:40.040]  helps but again it depends on the kind of dose of rate radiation dose that you're
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:43.880]  getting I mean if you're right by the reactor and announced by the way iodide
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:47.400]  protecting yourself using iodide does not give you overall protection from
[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:54.840]  radiation it gives you protection from radioactive iodide it's not not from
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:40:00.120]  the not from you know I'm not from uranium not from plutonium it gives you
[03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:04.080]  protection for the thyroid yeah I think that's why people are freaking out so
[03:40:04.080 --> 03:40:07.160]  much about this is because they think it's gonna give them a hundred percent
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:10.920]  protection no it's not it's not gonna give you on that's why you want to
[03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:14.480]  upregulate all of your enzyme systems you want to upregulate all of your
[03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:17.240]  detoxification well I know there's a whole laundry list of things that help
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:20.640]  with radiation what are some of those things there's a lot of things
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:25.680]  selenium is very important and acetyl 15 is very important sulfur is very
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:30.120]  important vitamin C is very important the amino acid glutamine is very
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:33.800]  important building your body's glutathione levels is very important
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:38.040]  superoxide dismutase is very important there's a whole bunch of things and it's
[03:40:38.040 --> 03:40:40.840]  really important you want to protect yourself from overall protection for
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:49.400]  radiation that you upregulate all of these systems continue MSM is very
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:52.840]  important eating a lot of sulfur containing foods is very important
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:56.560]  eating a lot of food like cabbage is very important onions garlic which also
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:00.480]  contains selenium those are very important I think I said vitamin C is
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:05.640]  important seaweed in general has an addition to seaweed containing iodine
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:10.080]  seaweed also has an ability to chelate or magnetically attract heavy metals so
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:14.040]  eating keel it eating substance that can help you magnetically attract these
[03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:16.880]  heavy metals and then pass them to your body is another strategy that you want
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:21.520]  to use vitamin E is very important vitamin E works with selenium and vitamin E
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:26.000]  also acts to protect cell membrane essential fatty acids are very well I'm
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:30.920]  glad we flesh this out so the callers calling up explaining this are correct
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:34.800]  that's good that's why I told folks I don't understand all of this I'm trying
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:39.840]  to learn it as we all learn together there's a difference between healthy
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:45.640]  thyroid getting what you need versus totally trying to fill it to block it
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:50.440]  but that's only for the radioactive iodine one of the big isotopes according
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:54.600]  to Bob Bowman release from these melting down reactors but keep in mind you
[03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:58.320]  can take too much iodine so if you're going to be protecting yourself using
[03:41:58.320 --> 03:42:02.400]  SSKI or using potassium iodide tablets you want to stop when you don't need to
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:05.960]  protection anymore because taking too much iodine can also mess up the thyroid
[03:42:05.960 --> 03:42:10.160]  well I'm gonna say this is I've been saying since Friday call your doctor go
[03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:14.000]  to the local clinic talk to them now shifting gears briefly been that I'm
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:17.800]  gonna go back to calls and I appreciate you coming on we have this new report out
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:23.040]  by Paul Joseph Watson the calls were pouring in yesterday the emails we've
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:26.760]  gotten people to send us the name of where it happened the places it's in
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:32.920]  this article where the US government the CDC and others are basically ordering
[03:42:32.920 --> 03:42:40.040]  clinics that do have the iostat type you know strong medical grade potassium
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:49.400]  iodine with 130 milligrams they are now telling them not to give it to people
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:54.000]  even though it's over the counter I'm not sure why they're saying that they
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:43:00.120]  want to hoard it baby I don't know we've got this article up on prison planet
[03:43:00.120 --> 03:43:04.920]  dot com it's now going up on info wars dot com but it I mean these reports are
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:10.560]  pouring in and we've now had listeners confirm and even tell us dates places and
[03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:15.560]  times doctor refuses prescribed drug as they call it after conversation with
[03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:21.600]  CDC Amazon dot com and poses one month waiting period as supplies sell out on
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:27.040]  back of panic buying but I want to believe what but Dr. Bowman saying that
[03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:32.000]  most of this is going to go out to see folks the problem is we can't trust
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:36.440]  government to tell us the truth because they have a history of lying especially
[03:43:36.440 --> 03:43:41.680]  dealing with nuclear disasters that's what are you going to do about the
[03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:45.760]  government I wouldn't trust the government so basically iodine is only
[03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:51.040]  one thing one thing only it's important and it protects the thyroid because like
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:54.160]  your previous guest said one of those one of the major contaminants in the
[03:43:54.160 --> 03:43:58.440]  nuclear disasters radioactive iodine but there's other things to and so giving
[03:43:58.440 --> 03:44:01.520]  yourself overall protection building up your immune system you know all the
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:04.960]  substances all these compounds that we talked about is very very important well
[03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:08.520]  the Japanese are some of the longest-lived people and they eat a lot of
[03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:12.920]  seaweed that's right that's right seaweed is amazingly mixed amazing stuff
[03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:17.800]  it's got vitamins it's got amino acids it's got antioxidants it's got phytonutrients
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:20.880]  that protect you from the sun and protect you from just general background
[03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:26.160]  radiation amazing stuff seaweed eating it all all the time and green tea by the
[03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:29.520]  way I think I said that the last hour drinking green tea that should be your
[03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:33.120]  beverage of choice if you're concerned about radiation poisoning or toxic
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:36.400]  should be your beverage of choice anyway well Dr. Bowman said it best three
[03:44:36.400 --> 03:44:40.160]  degrees in nuclear physics he said definitely some of this is gonna hit the
[03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:44.320]  West Coast but he said it'll be the type that you know takes a long time to
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:48.000]  cause people to get cancer you won't see it overnight but if these things
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:51.400]  completely melt down then it's gonna be more intense and it looks like it
[03:44:51.400 --> 03:44:55.440]  unfortunately is leaning towards that direction. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs thank you
[03:44:55.440 --> 03:44:58.800]  for clarifying that. One last thing I could say in Chernobyl one of the big
[03:44:58.800 --> 03:45:04.000]  problems was milk from the cows that were near the near the nuclear disaster. It was
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.560]  bio accumulating and being excreted in their milk. That's right so you want to
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:10.640]  be very careful about dairy products you want to be very careful about animal
[03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:15.680]  products and in radiation contaminated areas. Alright thank you Pharmacist Ben
[03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:19.200]  Fuchs we'll talk to you again very soon so there thank you callers for
[03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:24.400]  correcting me again I told you I mean on this type stuff I just know that it
[03:45:24.400 --> 03:45:27.440]  helps to have a healthy thyroid so you don't absorb as much but it's true you
[03:45:27.440 --> 03:45:31.280]  need the medical grade to fully fill it. As I said talk to your doctors from
[03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:36.480]  Friday as I told you there people are just calling saying the potassium iodine
[03:45:36.480 --> 03:45:41.520]  medical grade was sold out all over the country as of yesterday so I'm like well
[03:45:41.520 --> 03:45:46.080]  what are alternatives? And you heard him it's a whole spectrum of vitamins minerals
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:50.680]  nutrients seaweed you go to any sushi place and load up or any grocery store
[03:45:50.680 --> 03:45:53.920]  in a big city they're gonna have it but again I'm not saying that's gonna
[03:45:53.920 --> 03:45:58.280]  protect you totally it's not my job I'm not God I can't you know get it all done
[03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:02.240]  for you. We've got a great seaweed supplement from kelp again at infowarsteam.com
[03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:05.760]  because it's sold out a lot of places I'm told they have a lot of it there but
[03:46:05.760 --> 03:46:09.840]  infowarsteam.com and that also goes to support the broadcast because in the
[03:46:09.840 --> 03:46:13.600]  middle of this crisis I haven't even been plugging sponsors or the online
[03:46:13.600 --> 03:46:17.440]  video bookstore or anything because of this or prisonplanet.tv but we
[03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:21.640]  couldn't do any of this without you. Okay let me I mean I'm even going to
[03:46:21.640 --> 03:46:25.160]  fifth hour of retransmission or live broadcast there's so much to cover here
[03:46:25.160 --> 03:46:30.600]  but let's so let's go to Nolan in Ohio Nolan you're on the air. Hey Alex I'm
[03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:34.040]  not sure what's going on but the government's definitely planning for
[03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:37.640]  something I have some potentially imperative information from one of my
[03:46:37.640 --> 03:46:43.960]  relatives stationed out at Fort Hamilton in New York he found it alarmed he gave
[03:46:43.960 --> 03:46:47.760]  me a call and asked if some major was going on here in the US and I said no
[03:46:47.760 --> 03:46:53.400]  nothing that I've seen on news it's just Japan and he said that they were
[03:46:53.400 --> 03:46:58.920]  provided full biohazard radiation suits with gas masks and they were told they
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:03.400]  were in preparation for a natural disaster here in the US. Well I know
[03:47:03.400 --> 03:47:06.880]  Steve Watson wrote an article of the guys can find it we'll put it up it was on
[03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:13.000]  prisonplanet.com yesterday about solar watchers precisely predicted the
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:18.640]  Tokyo the Japanese quake and there are the predictions by astrophysicist and
[03:47:18.640 --> 03:47:23.120]  people like Pierce Corbin who said that big solar flare hit the earth hours
[03:47:23.120 --> 03:47:27.920]  before the earthquake coinciding with a quote giant moon the closest it's been
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:34.600]  to the earth since 1992 or 19 years ago and that those two things manipulate the
[03:47:34.600 --> 03:47:39.640]  magma not just the tides and that it contributed to that and a lot of these
[03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:43.800]  solar physicists and people are saying look for more earthquakes including the
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:46.840]  west coast of the United States I'm not trying to scare people but that is being
[03:47:46.840 --> 03:47:51.400]  discussed in mainstream news and we're seeing a lot of tectonic activity but
[03:47:51.400 --> 03:47:54.840]  the government also uses things like this for drills you know readiness drills
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:59.960]  but I'd like to get some verification of that did he say anything else Nolan yeah
[03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:03.400]  that's basically what they told him it was for preparation for a natural
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:09.600]  disaster in the US within 14 days so that was yesterday so I'm not sure I
[03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:13.840]  mean he sounded alarmed you know and he's in the military so I'm gonna try
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:17.600]  and get more information out of this I'm gonna hang up on you nobody else call
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:23.560]  in on that line from now on we're going to mega overdrive if we have to only
[03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:32.520]  military personnel the fast teams with the Marines you name it call in at 800
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:40.320]  259 92 31 have you been told get ready for an imminent natural disaster 800 259
[03:48:40.320 --> 03:48:47.640]  92 31 there is the headline from prisonplanet.com on screen both Japan
[03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:51.800]  and New Zealand earthquakes volcanic eruptions were precisely predicted last
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:57.000]  month by solar watchers is California next Steve Watson prisonplanet.com
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:03.960]  also on info wars.com let's continue with your calls Pat in Ohio you're on
[03:49:03.960 --> 03:49:11.280]  the air hello yes Pat yeah um Alex I got two questions but you something you
[03:49:11.280 --> 03:49:15.000]  were talking about using for tech because I'm gonna follow your lead you were
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:20.480]  talking about using potassium iodate versus yes that's one version but that's
[03:49:20.480 --> 03:49:23.960]  something the military gave out decades ago and then I looked into it you can't
[03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:27.160]  even get it anymore but I don't want to get I'm here live on air trying to track
[03:49:27.160 --> 03:49:32.160]  all this check it out for yourself I don't have all the answers on this okay
[03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:37.240]  according to everybody we've talked to you want iostat 130 milligram but you
[03:49:37.240 --> 03:49:40.480]  could only take it for a little while because it's toxic after that if you if
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:43.720]  radiation exposure comes you don't want to really even take it as a
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:47.840]  preventative once you you know once it's clear that if things get worse if you
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:51.360]  could get it but it's all sold out so you can't get it and he and the
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:55.400]  pharmacist was saying there's a cocktail of things that help you but nothing's
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:49:59.680]  gonna help you if you get a big dose of uranium or plutonium right but my
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:04.040]  question was like if Dr. Feud say that you have to know when to stop taking it
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:10.920]  and and what do you do? Well it's all on the drug insert so I can't give you
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:13.520]  medical advice because I don't even have the drug insert here in front of me
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:18.960]  there's 14 tablets in this and they recommend you take that regimen just go
[03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:24.720]  looking up for yourself I mean look up Google the drug insert iostat potassium
[03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:28.560]  iodide tablets insert you know it'll be online we can put it up even on screen
[03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:32.720]  read it for yourself it's like the flu shot where I said read the insert it says
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:37.560]  it can cause brain damage Guillain berets spontaneous abortions just read it for
[03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:41.840]  yourself get your make your own medical decision I cannot give you medical
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:50.240]  advice we've got the potassium iodine nuke core type stuff it's it's expired
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:54.440]  but we're gonna I guess start taking that because again this doesn't give you
[03:50:54.440 --> 03:50:58.920]  total protection but it's only from one isotope anyways you can't dodge this
[03:50:58.920 --> 03:51:05.000]  bullet if it comes here sore throat spray that with dermatol

[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:49.880]  these reactor cores continue to be exposed as they admit one of them is
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:53.200]  now there's been a major breach and I'm gonna break all that down in the next
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:58.160]  hour then you better believe ladies and gentlemen that I will just you will see
[03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:02.280]  an announcement at infowars.com at prisonplanet.com then I'm going live at

[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:19.360]  you can post on your own site for people that want to be able to get this
[03:55:19.360 --> 03:55:24.040]  information. I've got a lot of news that I'm collating getting together in a
[03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:29.920]  special report next hour now I'm only gonna open our phones up my phones in my
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:34.200]  office in the in the Austin Texas studios for military or emergency
[03:55:34.200 --> 03:55:41.280]  personnel who can confirm or deny our families of military people that have
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:44.840]  been told this have you been told prepare for natural disasters that are
[03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:48.360]  imminent they're always doing drills but are they saying something's coming
[03:55:48.360 --> 03:55:50.960]  what do they know about the solar flares what do they know about the moon
[03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:54.600]  being so close to the earth it controls the seas it also controls the magma
[03:55:54.600 --> 03:55:59.480]  under the crust or are they using harp which they admit that reprint me the
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:03.880]  quote in 1997 secretary defense William Cohen army times we said that
[03:56:03.880 --> 03:56:07.400]  governments and terrorists do have tectonic earthquake weapons that's not
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:11.880]  me that's secretary defense so it could be that too this could be a staged event
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:18.120]  I don't it exists the globalists are totally ruthless who knows I've got
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:21.960]  times of Australia articles from in the 50s where they wanted to set off nukes
[03:56:21.960 --> 03:56:25.560]  on the ocean floor to create tsunamis to flood the Chinese I mean there's there's
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:29.400]  no end to this so we're gonna be breaking all that down but again if you're
[03:56:29.400 --> 03:56:32.120]  listening to the Genesis Streams or on the Genesis Network we're going to super
[03:56:32.120 --> 03:56:35.480]  overdrive you'll have to go to info wars.com listen the free streams there
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:41.040]  or the video of your prison planet dot TV member we will continue on into the
[03:56:41.040 --> 03:56:44.840]  fifth hour today and if stations want to carry that you're welcome to get the
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:49.680]  internet feed and carry it if stations want it at info wars.com but let me
[03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:54.760]  give the number out to military personnel or or emergency personnel nuclear
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:56:58.000]  physicists corporate people that are being told to get ready for something in
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:02.160]  the west a lot of earthquake predictors and scientists are saying look for big
[03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:06.520]  stuff here there's all sorts of volcanoes becoming active again all over the
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:16.720]  world not just in Japan here's the toll-free number 877-789-ALEX 877-789-ALEX

[03:58:52.200 --> 03:58:57.040]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[03:58:57.040 --> 03:59:01.600]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:06.320]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home turn members
[03:59:06.320 --> 03:59:11.320]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[03:59:11.320 --> 03:59:16.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[03:59:16.720 --> 03:59:21.640]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[03:59:21.640 --> 03:59:26.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[03:59:26.040 --> 03:59:29.760]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[03:59:29.760 --> 03:59:33.720]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[03:59:33.720 --> 03:59:39.360]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[03:59:39.360 --> 03:59:45.400]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[03:59:45.400 --> 03:59:52.080]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[03:59:52.080 --> 04:00:00.360]  thank you for listening to GCN great talk radio starts here
[04:00:04.560 --> 04:00:10.240]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[04:00:10.240 --> 04:00:17.040]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show okay we have opened up our
[04:00:17.040 --> 04:00:22.720]  phone lines live into the fifth hour for military personnel only what have you
[04:00:22.720 --> 04:00:26.880]  been hearing about Japan what's really going on about deployments the fleet
[04:00:26.880 --> 04:00:30.400]  pulling out caller earlier and I'm getting emails saying that they're
[04:00:30.400 --> 04:00:33.360]  preparing for earthquakes in the US saying it's going to happen
[04:00:33.360 --> 04:00:38.400]  Secretariat Defense Cohen back in 97 said that there are governments and
[04:00:38.400 --> 04:00:42.720]  terrorists who are developed tectonic weapons yeah like the globalists that
[04:00:42.720 --> 04:00:47.280]  run our country could this be a tectonic rollout as they bring in global
[04:00:47.280 --> 04:00:51.000]  crisis or is it the sun and the moon manipulating tectonic plates with the
[04:00:51.000 --> 04:00:55.440]  solar flare and the moon being closer to the earth and it's been since 1992 19
[04:00:55.440 --> 04:01:02.800]  years ago all of this plays in but we are going to be opening the phones up
[04:01:02.800 --> 04:01:10.320]  here for military people are emergency personnel who can confirm this 877
[04:01:10.320 --> 04:01:16.640]  889 Alex is the number for you to call and join us as we go into hour number
[04:01:16.640 --> 04:01:20.560]  five here's some of the news and I'll continue with news as we track this and
[04:01:20.560 --> 04:01:24.240]  start going to your calls US government blocking Americans from obtaining
[04:01:24.240 --> 04:01:29.880]  potassium iodide panic buying stocks of potassium iodide exhausted in US as well
[04:01:29.880 --> 04:01:36.360]  as many areas of Europe and Asia mass evacuations begin from northeast of
[04:01:36.360 --> 04:01:40.560]  Japan and Tokyo as the scale the nuclear disaster unfolding at the stricken
[04:01:40.560 --> 04:01:44.400]  Fukushima nuclear power plant begins to finally be realized we've been correct
[04:01:44.400 --> 04:01:47.600]  on that front despite the Japanese government's continued under playing of
[04:01:47.600 --> 04:01:52.160]  the situation mass evacuations are now underway with people fleeing Tokyo and
[04:01:52.160 --> 04:01:56.880]  northeastern areas of the country in order to avoid a toxic cloud of radiation
[04:01:56.880 --> 04:02:03.160]  heading their way continuing radioactive winds head towards Tokyo as some
[04:02:03.160 --> 04:02:07.640]  flee capital that's the earlier article all on prison planet calm and info wars
[04:02:07.640 --> 04:02:12.040]  dot-com I've been at 24 hours a day as this unfortunately worsens and
[04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:16.040]  deteriorates Japanese Prime Minister attempts to calm nation as mass
[04:02:16.040 --> 04:02:21.320]  radiation spreads US Navy low-level radiation detected at some Tokyo area
[04:02:21.320 --> 04:02:28.480]  bases continuing online monitors at different Tokyo facilities and other
[04:02:28.480 --> 04:02:33.000]  smaller towns around the country are reporting escalations of between 20
[04:02:33.000 --> 04:02:37.320]  and 100 times normal levels of radiation and those detectors can only pick up
[04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:41.440]  certain types of radiation there's been a different isotopes blasting out of the
[04:02:41.440 --> 04:02:46.000]  Fukushima facility that has had now four perhaps five massive explosions
[04:02:46.000 --> 04:02:53.120]  including the mushroom cloud is the mark one plutonium uranium based reactor
[04:02:53.120 --> 04:02:58.440]  exploded in a huge mushroom cloud they now admit reactor to at least has a
[04:02:58.440 --> 04:03:04.080]  breached central containment facility that is super bad news that's Chernobyl
[04:03:04.080 --> 04:03:08.640]  news we don't know how bad it is the Japanese Prime Minister yesterday and
[04:03:08.640 --> 04:03:14.800]  today has been ordering Tokyo electric power employees 500 of them back in it
[04:03:14.800 --> 04:03:18.960]  appears they were fusing to go back in and so you basically got six reactors
[04:03:18.960 --> 04:03:26.280]  going completely haywire fires explosions it isn't good okay and I told
[04:03:26.280 --> 04:03:32.280]  listeners who were in Japan Friday and you heard me I said get out of Tokyo go
[04:03:32.280 --> 04:03:35.440]  south because the winds at that time were going northeast but I said it may
[04:03:35.440 --> 04:03:39.360]  turn south later but the North predominantly gets most of the winds
[04:03:39.360 --> 04:03:42.920]  get out of there there's no perfect advice I'm telling you what I would do
[04:03:42.920 --> 04:03:47.280]  that's where people are going the government saying go south four days
[04:03:47.280 --> 04:03:51.480]  later Friday Saturday Sunday Monday four days later so again not tooting our
[04:03:51.480 --> 04:03:54.360]  horn we're giving overall good information we're not perfect we're
[04:03:54.360 --> 04:04:01.400]  trying our best we're putting our heads together talking to you I am and waiting
[04:04:01.400 --> 04:04:04.720]  for phone calls to come in from the military other emergency personnel have
[04:04:04.720 --> 04:04:08.040]  you been told prepare for earthquakes here in the United States have we gotten
[04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:15.240]  any calls you didn't have your mic open okay the phone lines are open I
[04:04:15.240 --> 04:04:19.600]  appreciate listeners not calling if they don't have specific information and
[04:04:19.600 --> 04:04:23.760]  we're having no military personnel calling in to confirm what the earlier
[04:04:23.760 --> 04:04:28.440]  caller said now the guy sounded you know nice but you can't believe just what
[04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:32.680]  some caller says but you look at Steve Watson's article where a lot of
[04:04:32.680 --> 04:04:37.320]  different people that organizations that study earthquakes connecting to the
[04:04:37.320 --> 04:04:40.560]  moon being closer to the earth and the Sun are saying there's higher
[04:04:40.560 --> 04:04:45.400]  probability of earthquakes and obviously California is part of the Pacific
[04:04:45.400 --> 04:04:49.800]  Ring of Fire headline both Japan and New Zealand earthquakes volcanic
[04:04:49.800 --> 04:04:55.400]  eruptions were precisely predicted last month by solar watchers very important
[04:04:55.400 --> 04:05:02.200]  article continuing Brisbane times blast escalate Japan's nuclear crisis
[04:05:02.200 --> 04:05:07.680]  explosions at fire at Japan's quake hit nuclear plant have unleashed dangerous
[04:05:07.680 --> 04:05:12.400]  levels of radiation sparking a collapse of the stock market and panic buying in
[04:05:12.400 --> 04:05:17.800]  supermarkets continuing the UN weather agency said the winds were currently
[04:05:17.800 --> 04:05:21.840]  blowing radioactive materials towards the ocean and that there were no
[04:05:21.840 --> 04:05:27.400]  implications for Japan or countries nearby I don't know what that means
[04:05:27.400 --> 04:05:32.640]  France's nuclear security authorities of the disaster now equated to a six on
[04:05:32.640 --> 04:05:36.520]  the seven-point international scale for nuclear accidents ranking the crisis
[04:05:36.520 --> 04:05:40.760]  second only in gravity to Chernobyl Europe's Energy Commissioner Gunther
[04:05:40.760 --> 04:05:46.720]  Otringer dubbed the nuclear disaster an apocalypse saying Tokyo had almost lost
[04:05:46.720 --> 04:05:51.880]  control of events at the Fukushima power plant there is talk of an apocalypse
[04:05:51.880 --> 04:05:57.600]  and I think the world is particularly well-chosen again there is talk of
[04:05:57.600 --> 04:06:00.760]  apocalypse I think the word is particularly well-chosen he said in
[04:06:00.760 --> 04:06:04.840]  remarks to the European Parliament Japan however maintained its assessment of
[04:06:04.840 --> 04:06:09.800]  the disaster at four placing it behind a three-mile island accident in the
[04:06:09.800 --> 04:06:14.240]  United States in 79 oh give me a break three-mile island was nothing compared
[04:06:14.240 --> 04:06:21.040]  to this this is this is just amazing Japan radiation linking directly into
[04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:27.320]  the air Reuters Vienna Japan has told the UN nuclear watchdog radio activity
[04:06:27.320 --> 04:06:30.320]  was being released directly into the atmosphere from the side of the
[04:06:30.320 --> 04:06:34.640]  earthquake stricken reactor and again reactor to its core containment facility
[04:06:34.640 --> 04:06:38.800]  is breached we don't know how bad and I guess they're seeing that from aircraft
[04:06:38.800 --> 04:06:42.120]  because there's really no personnel there reportedly and that it had put out
[04:06:42.120 --> 04:06:45.880]  the fire at a spent fuel storage pond there that's some good news you can
[04:06:45.880 --> 04:06:49.640]  believe it the International Atomic Energy Agency citing information to
[04:06:49.640 --> 04:06:57.040]  receive from Japanese authorities at 350 GMT said on Tuesday dose rates of up
[04:06:57.040 --> 04:06:59.600]  to 400
[04:06:59.840 --> 04:07:05.280]  millisvert per hour have been reported at the Fukushima power plant site it did
[04:07:05.280 --> 04:07:08.800]  not give details or comparisons the radiation level but exposure to over
[04:07:08.800 --> 04:07:14.960]  100 milliverts a year is a level which can lead to cancer so you're getting
[04:07:14.960 --> 04:07:21.320]  400 milliverts when you're there for an hour or less and and 100 in a year more
[04:07:21.320 --> 04:07:26.240]  than 100 is bad news we all live in a radiation baked environment we're close
[04:07:26.240 --> 04:07:30.280]  to a sun just blasting different types of radioactive wavelengths at us so we're
[04:07:30.280 --> 04:07:34.240]  designed to live in this but not at these levels the Japanese that's one
[04:07:34.240 --> 04:07:39.880]  reason we die folks it breaks down our DNA we're living in just radiation the
[04:07:39.880 --> 04:07:43.440]  Japanese authorities are saying there is a possibility that the fire was caused
[04:07:43.440 --> 04:07:48.640]  by a hydrogen explosion the IAEA said in a statement it later said that the
[04:07:48.640 --> 04:07:53.560]  fire had been extinguished at unit four of the plant in Japan authorities warned
[04:07:53.560 --> 04:07:57.400]  radiation levels had begun significantly higher on the nuclear power plant on
[04:07:57.400 --> 04:08:01.600]  Tuesday after explosions at two reactors and the French embassy said low-level
[04:08:01.600 --> 04:08:05.520]  radioactivity wind could reach Tokyo within hours hours is now elapsed the
[04:08:05.520 --> 04:08:09.760]  reporting the radiation levels going up an IAEA said it has been informed that
[04:08:09.760 --> 04:08:14.920]  the spent fuel pond at reactor four of Fukushima nuclear power plant is on fire
[04:08:14.920 --> 04:08:18.640]  and radioactivity is being released they put it out at one but not at the other
[04:08:18.640 --> 04:08:24.520]  directly into the atmosphere spent nuke fuel pond may be boiling for the
[04:08:24.520 --> 04:08:31.320]  radiation leak feared radiation levels soar as Japan nuke plant fire AP we've
[04:08:31.320 --> 04:08:39.040]  got I don't we have urethane in Texas urethane do you have any intel
[04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:44.240]  specifically on the military are you in the military saying that they're
[04:08:44.240 --> 04:08:50.000]  preparing for imminent natural disasters in the U.S. is it a drill or are they
[04:08:50.000 --> 04:08:55.080]  or is your intel that they're saying it's imminent yes I have a cousin in
[04:08:55.080 --> 04:09:02.400]  fusion that's full cocked and preparing for a radiological attack oh god that's
[04:09:02.400 --> 04:09:07.440]  a that's a joke caller man buddy this isn't funny I know in America we've
[04:09:07.440 --> 04:09:11.120]  been brainwashed by TV males are put into an arrested development at about a
[04:09:11.120 --> 04:09:18.320]  seven-year-old level but you know just for him so I can take a two-minute
[04:09:18.320 --> 04:09:22.840]  break before while we get some more callers lined up can we play that clip
[04:09:22.840 --> 04:09:28.640]  of attention American pigs you know that particular clip yeah it's up there in
[04:09:28.640 --> 04:09:34.440]  the board that I did a month or so ago to describe the globalist view of us and
[04:09:34.440 --> 04:09:40.680]  you know the caller thinks it's real funny that all of this is happening and
[04:09:40.680 --> 04:09:46.560]  I will assure you it will not be funny if this continues to melt down and if you
[04:09:46.560 --> 04:09:50.000]  plutonium and uranium gets out and we're watching a bunch of dead Japanese
[04:09:50.000 --> 04:09:54.560]  people and then that radiation comes over here and the government tells you
[04:09:54.560 --> 04:10:02.160]  that everything is okay and basically tells you that everything I've seen it
[04:10:02.160 --> 04:10:04.640]  up on the computer board just so you know I've I've seen it in one of those
[04:10:04.640 --> 04:10:09.800]  blocks or you can play the ultimate red pill if you want and I'll go out there
[04:10:09.800 --> 04:10:15.800]  and look I forget the name of it though it's also all over YouTube somebody did
[04:10:15.800 --> 04:10:18.480]  a video version of it where it says Alex Jones taken over by the new world
[04:10:18.480 --> 04:10:21.240]  order I probably shouldn't even it's not even a joke though I mean I did the
[04:10:21.240 --> 04:10:27.520]  piece basically from the globalist you know perspective on us and what they
[04:10:27.520 --> 04:10:31.680]  think of us so the prankers are out there they think it's very funny since I
[04:10:31.680 --> 04:10:36.560]  promised to take phone calls we'll just open the phones up to the general public

[04:11:10.480 --> 04:11:17.320]  EPA I called there I've been tracking this website the rad net which is to
[04:11:17.320 --> 04:11:23.000]  tracking environmental radiation nationwide network and I went in there
[04:11:23.000 --> 04:11:28.080]  to try to find out you know what we were doing here locally in Idaho and I
[04:11:28.080 --> 04:11:34.080]  called the local EPA number here and they referred me to Seattle and I have a
[04:11:34.080 --> 04:11:38.680]  phone call into them and they're supposed to return my call the thing I was
[04:11:38.680 --> 04:11:43.520]  concerned about is that the website is inaccessible they have taken the website
[04:11:43.520 --> 04:11:48.160]  down that you cannot get any live streaming of baseline radiation
[04:11:48.160 --> 04:11:56.280]  measurements here in the US and I called yeah I called the main laboratory in
[04:11:56.280 --> 04:12:00.800]  Montgomery Alabama which is where they send the specimens to be measured once
[04:12:00.800 --> 04:12:06.240]  they're taken at these various sites across the country and they on their
[04:12:06.240 --> 04:12:10.960]  website it states whether state they are either always in emergency or routine
[04:12:10.960 --> 04:12:16.200]  mode and I asked them and they said that they were in emergency mode and that
[04:12:16.200 --> 04:12:22.200]  they are deploying personnel to the West Coast again man can you give us a
[04:12:22.200 --> 04:12:25.800]  specific facilities that you were talking to so we can make phone calls and

[04:12:52.680 --> 04:12:56.000]  office they really didn't want to handle any phone call she was kind of
[04:12:56.000 --> 04:12:59.840]  hesitant to talk to me or tell me anything and I tried calling the
[04:12:59.840 --> 04:13:03.120]  Washington DC phone number and I'm getting a recording well that's big
[04:13:03.120 --> 04:13:06.160]  breaking news that the federal government is deploying people to the West
[04:13:06.160 --> 04:13:10.280]  Coast I had a fallout showing that they know it's a real danger this is
[04:13:10.280 --> 04:13:15.560]  unbelievably huge we have a limited personnel today of all days they're
[04:13:15.560 --> 04:13:21.560]  doing a great job scrambling in there ma'am I'm gonna put you on hold and give

[04:13:51.680 --> 04:13:55.880]  radiation they tell you that people were being deployed they are all in
[04:13:55.880 --> 04:14:01.200]  meeting right now but yeah she said equipment has been deployed but it is
[04:14:01.200 --> 04:14:05.920]  not it seems to being stockpiled right now at this stage they have not actually
[04:14:05.920 --> 04:14:08.920]  that would that would tell us why they're telling clinics not to give people
[04:14:08.920 --> 04:14:17.200]  prescriptions for the medical grade iodine today very very I don't know
[04:14:17.200 --> 04:14:22.000]  about that but but I do have the phone number in Washington DC for the media
[04:14:22.000 --> 04:14:26.720]  line as well but I don't know that you'd get anybody to answer your questions
[04:14:26.720 --> 04:14:31.800]  there like I said they've taken down the national website so that you can't
[04:14:31.800 --> 04:14:35.720]  because I told her I wanted to see what the baseline data was because there's
[04:14:35.720 --> 04:14:39.880]  nothing recorded for this specific just for everybody on air what was the net
[04:14:39.880 --> 04:14:44.400]  mocked umri alabama I couldn't write that fast it's the national air and
[04:14:44.400 --> 04:14:52.280]  radiation environmental laboratory in Montgomery Alabama that's where the
[04:14:52.280 --> 04:14:56.760]  actual sampling goes they have the ventilation counters there where they
[04:14:56.760 --> 04:15:02.200]  can actually break it down into the different isotopes okay great job
[04:15:02.200 --> 04:15:05.880]  Deborah we're going to put you on hold and get that number so we don't give it
[04:15:05.880 --> 04:15:09.960]  out on air and then we're gonna call it live on air thank you so much for that
[04:15:09.960 --> 04:15:17.840]  call let's get her the number of the facility and Google it first I believe
[04:15:17.840 --> 04:15:21.600]  or you could tell she was 100% real but let's double check the number before we
[04:15:21.600 --> 04:15:26.640]  know who we're calling good job team let's go ahead and go to Linda in

[04:15:40.640 --> 04:15:45.680]  States government was not telling them what to do I told him what my plans were
[04:15:45.680 --> 04:15:51.880]  it seemed he was on course with me to take some potassium iodate so I'm just
[04:15:51.880 --> 04:15:57.720]  a regular layman who just got pissed off part part of my language and so they
[04:15:57.720 --> 04:16:01.160]  just said they're not being told anything by the feds they told us we're
[04:16:01.160 --> 04:16:05.560]  not where you know they haven't got any information he said no information they
[04:16:05.560 --> 04:16:10.400]  been inquiring and I told him what we were doing and he said spread it to
[04:16:10.400 --> 04:16:16.200]  everyone you know all right so they were concerned so he was concerned about
[04:16:16.200 --> 04:16:21.720]  radiation it's very concerned very concerned all right thank you so much
[04:16:21.720 --> 04:16:27.120]  for that Intel Linda let's talk to Rick in New York these are great calls are

[04:16:40.560 --> 04:16:45.840]  harp graph on harp Alaska.edu that's the website for harp and you can look at
[04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:50.240]  the graph from the 11th and it was great thing going on the 11th you can look at

[04:17:00.520 --> 04:17:04.320]  well I showed the graph goes straight across and on the 11th they go straight
[04:17:04.320 --> 04:17:08.760]  down all three graphs downward and east and west and I don't know what the graph
[04:17:08.760 --> 04:17:13.360]  mean winter aiming but it was powered up and aiming down at minus 500 whatever
[04:17:13.360 --> 04:17:19.400]  that means but you can look at Alaska harp Alaska.edu and it shows you the
[04:17:19.400 --> 04:17:26.160]  graph of fluctuations is harp Alaska.edu you know I was worried about sir I

[04:25:18.760 --> 04:25:24.840]  as the evacuations accelerate from Tokyo about 150 kilometers south of the Fukushima
[04:25:24.840 --> 04:25:32.440]  six reactor crisis with four reactors melting down one core containment
[04:25:32.440 --> 04:25:37.440]  facility breached Reuters AP reporting as of this morning more fires more
[04:25:37.440 --> 04:25:44.640]  insanity and the calls are pouring in from people that have called different
[04:25:44.640 --> 04:25:47.840]  government agencies to say yes they're preparing on the West Coast we're gonna
[04:25:47.840 --> 04:25:52.680]  call a federal agency here in a moment live on air but Salem in Illinois says
[04:25:52.680 --> 04:25:58.120]  that he worked in the Japanese reactor or another mark one I worked at the Fukushima
[04:25:58.120 --> 04:26:05.280]  plant really yes I worked there in May of 2009 I'm an American I live here in
[04:26:05.280 --> 04:26:09.240]  America spent about three weeks there but for those that don't know their
[04:26:09.240 --> 04:26:13.840]  general electric belt so it's a lot of Americans there well actually and I'll
[04:26:13.840 --> 04:26:16.720]  say I've worked at a lot of nuclear plants and what a lot of these plants do
[04:26:16.720 --> 04:26:22.200]  is they they buy units from several different manufacturers Siemens Siemens
[04:26:22.200 --> 04:26:28.200]  Westinghouse GE Toshiba Mitsubishi or the old Alice Chalmers which they're out
[04:26:28.200 --> 04:26:33.040]  of business now anyway I worked on unit six which is a Toshiba unit it's actually
[04:26:33.040 --> 04:26:39.280]  shut down for inspection at the time of the earthquake this is one of the
[04:26:39.280 --> 04:26:43.080]  largest it was definitely the largest plant I've ever been to I was completely
[04:26:43.080 --> 04:26:48.320]  in awe working there was so huge it was like a small city and nuclear plants are
[04:26:48.320 --> 04:26:51.840]  like little kingdoms in themselves and they they have their own little systems
[04:26:51.840 --> 04:26:55.880]  and units and rules as well as the federal and international rules that
[04:26:55.880 --> 04:27:00.000]  overlay them but they all have their own little training facilities and seminars
[04:27:00.000 --> 04:27:03.280]  which you know I had to go through I did not work in containment I worked on the
[04:27:03.280 --> 04:27:07.880]  turban deck as an on-site machinist and that's that's my specialty I basically
[04:27:07.880 --> 04:27:13.440]  machine things that are too big to move this is I think the third largest plant
[04:27:13.440 --> 04:27:20.120]  in Japan and something interesting there's way more people employed there
[04:27:20.120 --> 04:27:26.240]  than needs to be the Japanese people are very sensitive to nuclear power ever
[04:27:26.240 --> 04:27:31.520]  since the the bomb obviously from World War two so they do it as a payoff yes
[04:27:31.520 --> 04:27:35.120]  right they they try to gain favor with the communities and just add a little
[04:27:35.120 --> 04:27:37.920]  bias and they just give them a great wage and they basically do nothing in
[04:27:37.920 --> 04:27:41.920]  fact I even pointed out to my coworker when I was there we appointed at these
[04:27:41.920 --> 04:27:45.680]  three guys who were actually pushing an empty cart there was three guys and all
[04:27:45.680 --> 04:27:48.320]  three of them had one hand on this empty cart as they're going across the
[04:27:48.320 --> 04:27:52.400]  turban deck and if you just see that there's there's people there did they
[04:27:52.400 --> 04:27:57.640]  don't need to be there and right now I know that I'll think over a hundred
[04:27:57.640 --> 04:28:02.200]  people have high doses of dosages of radiation that was two days ago it's
[04:28:02.200 --> 04:28:06.360]  off the charts yeah who really know it's like they say 10,000 have died total
[04:28:06.360 --> 04:28:10.120]  but they admit 10,000 are missing from one fishing village oh I just mean at
[04:28:10.120 --> 04:28:14.200]  this one plant no no I understand yeah they're talking about but but now it's
[04:28:14.200 --> 04:28:18.600]  correct the mark one with the plutonium in it that blew up yesterday so
[04:28:18.600 --> 04:28:23.320]  spectacularly that is a general electric I believe that's a GE unit now the
[04:28:23.320 --> 04:28:26.520]  re-after doesn't necessarily have to match let me ask you a question you've
[04:28:26.520 --> 04:28:30.080]  been there yeah the Prime Minister's been for a day and a half ordering them
[04:28:30.080 --> 04:28:33.560]  back reportedly the workers won't go back they said there were 500 now they're
[04:28:33.560 --> 04:28:38.360]  gone I don't blame them well I do know let me ask you this watching all these
[04:28:38.360 --> 04:28:41.840]  giant explosions and what you see happening there what do you think it
[04:28:41.840 --> 04:28:47.160]  looks like on the ground oh my gosh you know those those walls those outer shell
[04:28:47.160 --> 04:28:51.800]  walls and they are absolutely enormous that that stuff is thick and they are
[04:28:51.800 --> 04:28:56.120]  designed and I've actually worked I worked at a plant turkey point nuclear in
[04:28:56.120 --> 04:28:58.880]  Florida where they actually had to cut a hole in it to bring the reactor out with
[04:28:58.880 --> 04:29:03.720]  a giant crane and you can see how thick that wall is it's designed to be hit
[04:29:03.720 --> 04:29:09.640]  with an airplane 747 yeah and now I don't know if Japan is that way I would
[04:29:09.640 --> 04:29:14.240]  assume so especially in coastal like that actually if just a few weeks before I
[04:29:14.240 --> 04:29:19.680]  was there North Korea had lobbed a missile over Japan and it splashed off the
[04:29:19.680 --> 04:29:24.200]  coast in minutes the Japanese carrier was out there immediately and we you know
[04:29:24.200 --> 04:29:30.320]  it was visible from the shore but see what was I gonna what other intel can
[04:29:30.320 --> 04:29:37.360]  you give us about the Fukushima plant well it's huge I do know that a lot of
[04:29:37.360 --> 04:29:40.520]  the people who need to be there can't be there so one of my friends I'm
[04:29:40.520 --> 04:29:45.080]  conversing with over the internet he's actually in Yokohama he's an engineer
[04:29:45.080 --> 04:29:51.760]  there I worked with him and he can't even get on site because all of the
[04:29:51.760 --> 04:29:55.840]  railroads are down they're all they're all just shut down the infrastructure is
[04:29:55.840 --> 04:29:59.560]  messed up he can obviously get online he's in Yokohama he can't get into the
[04:29:59.560 --> 04:30:03.200]  office and at this point there's a massive earthquake still ongoing after
[04:30:03.200 --> 04:30:08.600]  shocks 9.1 a lot of the rail lines down and and how many people are in Tokyo 9
[04:30:08.600 --> 04:30:13.920]  million oh I was in Tokyo I don't remember the that statistic in fact you
[04:30:13.920 --> 04:30:17.440]  guys found the statistics it's over 500 above ground tests that have gone on
[04:30:17.440 --> 04:30:21.600]  well but let's pull up the population of Tokyo can you imagine if even a
[04:30:21.600 --> 04:30:26.240]  fraction of them try to flee south as is now being reported by AP and others can
[04:30:26.240 --> 04:30:30.000]  you imagine what that is gonna look like with the infrastructure already in
[04:30:30.000 --> 04:30:34.160]  shambles right I can imagine Chicago trying to do such a thing and having
[04:30:34.160 --> 04:30:38.320]  difficulty here in the States and that that country is so tightly compacted the
[04:30:38.320 --> 04:30:44.400]  roads are not as wide as ours you know the cars are smaller I know that Japan
[04:30:44.400 --> 04:30:50.400]  under treaty is not allowed to have nuclear weaponry and it it would
[04:30:50.400 --> 04:30:54.000]  surprise me and as I talked to their engineers and that in fact what my escort
[04:30:54.000 --> 04:30:57.560]  there he actually had met the Queen of England you know so he was a pretty
[04:30:57.560 --> 04:31:02.800]  important person and you know in talking to him they were so proud of these
[04:31:02.800 --> 04:31:05.720]  plants and I thought you know this is amazing that you would put so there's
[04:31:05.720 --> 04:31:09.800]  six units out there they're actually building two more currently and you
[04:31:09.800 --> 04:31:12.720]  know they don't see an end to this it's almost like since they're restricted
[04:31:12.720 --> 04:31:16.320]  from making weaponry they're kind of showing off with their you know nuclear
[04:31:16.320 --> 04:31:20.920]  capabilities I just wouldn't build that obviously there's they shouldn't be doing
[04:31:20.920 --> 04:31:24.920]  this one reactor after another is like a you know just a chain reaction domino
[04:31:24.920 --> 04:31:29.160]  effect blowing up you know it was made my point about those walls being so thick
[04:31:29.160 --> 04:31:32.360]  if those bricks are being blown everywhere like that you know like what we
[04:31:32.360 --> 04:31:36.440]  saw in that video I mean I can just imagine the damage that's doing to
[04:31:36.440 --> 04:31:39.400]  everything all around there I mean I think about it shooting thousands of
[04:31:39.400 --> 04:31:43.600]  feet in the air in a matter of seconds the explosive power was incredible of
[04:31:43.600 --> 04:31:49.000]  course it was gonna expose the the the containment core which they now admit
[04:31:49.000 --> 04:31:53.320]  has happened at two perhaps at four we have the numbers to give people an idea
[04:31:53.320 --> 04:32:02.240]  there are 37 plus million people in Tokyo Metro 8.5 in the city limits can you
[04:32:02.240 --> 04:32:09.640]  imagine if even 10% of 37 million try to get out of the city and reportedly it
[04:32:09.640 --> 04:32:18.080]  is just bedlam yeah oh it'll it'll be wild in fact I haven't talked to my
[04:32:18.080 --> 04:32:21.000]  engineer friend in two days he hasn't responded so I think he's he might
[04:32:21.000 --> 04:32:24.100]  actually be on the move I know a lot of different airlines are refusing to
[04:32:24.100 --> 04:32:28.480]  fly into Tokyo right now there's another interesting thing I know that the
[04:32:28.480 --> 04:32:33.480]  Japanese people are very tightly knit very brave I had a great time being out
[04:32:33.480 --> 04:32:37.920]  there they took me out to dinner every night lots of drinks had a good time the
[04:32:37.920 --> 04:32:41.000]  culture is just really cool had an awesome time and I stayed up in that
[04:32:41.000 --> 04:32:45.840]  northeastern area and the people were so so good and everybody's got their own
[04:32:45.840 --> 04:32:49.520]  home guard and they're just very independent style people don't own
[04:32:49.520 --> 04:32:53.760]  weapons they can't you know actually I bought a 450 year old spear I brought
[04:32:53.760 --> 04:32:58.200]  home from their authentic that was pretty cool but the Japanese military now
[04:32:58.200 --> 04:33:02.920]  they all have it ingrained in their minds that their life ends at 24 they are
[04:33:02.920 --> 04:33:10.000]  ready to die for their country and at any cost and I just think that that is
[04:33:10.000 --> 04:33:13.200]  somewhat permeated into the culture there could be a brevity or you know
[04:33:13.200 --> 04:33:17.520]  braveness and the people to want to get in there and do their work at the
[04:33:17.520 --> 04:33:21.600]  Fukushima plant and get this under control I know that the plant but how
[04:33:21.600 --> 04:33:24.640]  do you do that when there's giant explosions going off everywhere
[04:33:24.640 --> 04:33:30.200]  well yeah I mean I you know what I put myself in that position and I think
[04:33:30.200 --> 04:33:34.200]  about America and if I was working at the plant it was like look this thing
[04:33:34.200 --> 04:33:38.320]  could blow and we could lose you know the whole half the continent you know I
[04:33:38.320 --> 04:33:41.400]  would put on that suit and go in there and do what I could do and knowing that
[04:33:41.400 --> 04:33:44.680]  I would die what do you think the Prime Minister is trying to quote order them
[04:33:44.680 --> 04:33:52.760]  back in well I guess I don't know about that maybe they want from what we get
[04:33:52.760 --> 04:33:57.120]  and no one in us Japanese are you know extremely brave folks that's part of the
[04:33:57.120 --> 04:34:00.600]  culture yeah you know they've sent awards to the Alamo there's a big Japanese
[04:34:00.600 --> 04:34:04.040]  award out at the Alamo for you know them standing and dying you know they love
[04:34:04.040 --> 04:34:08.800]  that stuff very romantic but the point is that it from what I get is it's the
[04:34:08.800 --> 04:34:12.200]  Tokyo power and electric isn't coordinating things what the Prime
[04:34:12.200 --> 04:34:15.920]  Minister says and so things are just exploding I mean that explosion of
[04:34:15.920 --> 04:34:20.560]  reactor three yesterday I mean the whole facility had stuff flying all over it
[04:34:20.560 --> 04:34:24.600]  yeah we felt 25 miles away in the ground yeah so I mean what do you expect it
[04:34:24.600 --> 04:34:26.640]  just it sounds like there's really nothing they even can do that's what
[04:34:26.640 --> 04:34:30.600]  they're trying to use helicopters to go in over it right now well sir really
[04:34:30.600 --> 04:34:38.760]  informative phone call anything else you can add for us Salem no I just we
[04:34:38.760 --> 04:34:42.160]  just do need to pray I mean we can see the human systems fail all human
[04:34:42.160 --> 04:34:46.160]  systems failed I mean I do believe you know God is sovereign he's in control
[04:34:46.160 --> 04:34:50.200]  and we just pray that all these people's lives individually get get touched and
[04:34:50.200 --> 04:34:53.520]  they can you know connect to the true meaning of life through it all and not
[04:34:53.520 --> 04:34:58.880]  be so dependent no matter you know Japan one of most complex countries in the
[04:34:58.880 --> 04:35:02.360]  world you know we can see it just failing so we can't put our faith in man
[04:35:02.360 --> 04:35:06.420]  systems and I think it's absolutely foolish to build plants of this many
[04:35:06.420 --> 04:35:10.720]  units and I hope this is kind of thing doesn't doesn't go on maybe they
[04:35:10.720 --> 04:35:16.520]  should start shutting down many of these multiple reactor units but hey Alex I
[04:35:16.520 --> 04:35:19.840]  know you're up you're an artist I'm actually a professional sculptor full
[04:35:19.840 --> 04:35:23.160]  time and I know you do oil paintings you've got any sculptural ideas I could
[04:35:23.160 --> 04:35:26.960]  incorporate I never really have time to paint I paint with my kids all the time
[04:35:26.960 --> 04:35:31.800]  you know just little things but I don't know man I'm sure you're a great artist
[04:35:31.800 --> 04:35:35.000]  you've got your own your own ideas but I appreciate your call Salem very
[04:35:35.000 --> 04:35:40.080]  interesting a lady called in who sounded very earnest very focused very informed
[04:35:40.080 --> 04:35:45.760]  we confirmed it is the phone number to the Montgomery Alabama federal sub agency
[04:35:45.760 --> 04:35:50.560]  that test the air for and water for radiation we're gonna call them live on
[04:35:50.560 --> 04:35:55.240]  air right now because she said that they told her that yes they are deploying
[04:35:55.240 --> 04:35:59.440]  emergency nuclear fallout personnel to the west coast right now as a
[04:35:59.440 --> 04:36:03.560]  precaution that's important news because you're not seeing that in the media the
[04:36:03.560 --> 04:36:06.640]  federal government's not even really debating it or discussing it you know
[04:36:06.640 --> 04:36:10.040]  isn't a problem guys can we go ahead and start dialing that number live on air
[04:36:10.040 --> 04:36:17.040]  right now please you can let him hear the dialing it's fine here we go we are

[04:37:51.880 --> 04:37:56.760]  syndicated radio broadcast and I've had callers calling in telling me that they
[04:37:56.760 --> 04:38:02.640]  what particular lady who called you just about an hour ago your office it was
[04:38:02.640 --> 04:38:05.280]  one of my listeners so we were just confirming what she said that she had
[04:38:05.280 --> 04:38:11.200]  talked to some folks in your office specifically about response to any fall
[04:38:11.200 --> 04:38:14.560]  out coming from Japan on the west coast that you were one of the main offices
[04:38:14.560 --> 04:38:20.080]  that test that can I be put in contact with the specific sub-office the air and
[04:38:20.080 --> 04:38:27.480]  water radiation measurement office there Alex you're a syndicated radio show
[04:38:27.480 --> 04:38:35.520]  yes ma'am what what is your what is your your radio was it what station is it
[04:38:35.520 --> 04:38:40.840]  it's all over the country it's on stations like 590 here in Austin the
[04:38:40.840 --> 04:38:45.680]  websites info wars calm and again man we're broadcasting live right now we're
[04:38:45.680 --> 04:38:48.640]  getting scores of calls from people who call different federal agencies state
[04:38:48.640 --> 04:38:53.840]  agencies that there is a response on the west coast to measure and prepare for
[04:38:53.840 --> 04:38:57.760]  fallout and I need to talk to somebody because ferriting through numbers I'm
[04:38:57.760 --> 04:39:02.240]  told that this Montgomery Alabama office has the sample sent to it for a
[04:39:02.240 --> 04:39:07.880]  nationwide is that correct I do not have the answers for you because I am just
[04:39:07.880 --> 04:39:12.720]  a protest person can I talk to the I mean can I talk to the press person or
[04:39:12.720 --> 04:39:17.640]  can I talk to the laboratory that does the testing the press person I will be

[04:39:49.880 --> 04:39:54.080]  calling all right thank you let's go ahead and dial that next number and I'll
[04:39:54.080 --> 04:39:58.120]  obviously do this once we go off air to and ferret this out because this is
[04:39:58.120 --> 04:40:01.880]  important breaking news and we need this is what the media should be doing this
[04:40:01.880 --> 04:40:07.560]  is what ABC CBS NBC see all of them should be doing a citizen shouldn't be

[04:40:20.680 --> 04:40:28.440]  hours I start babbling got a refocus here we will call the DC number for Andy
[04:40:28.440 --> 04:40:34.040]  Adora the press secretary individual for this outfit but it sounds like the lady
[04:40:34.040 --> 04:40:37.320]  we talked to earlier was able to get around some of people actually working
[04:40:37.320 --> 04:40:39.560]  there with the samples that said yes they are moving to the west coast to
[04:40:39.560 --> 04:40:41.720]  respond
[04:40:55.560 --> 04:41:00.400]  hi this is Adora Andy deputy associate administrator for EPA's office of

[04:41:20.960 --> 04:41:28.480]  okay are we blocking that number out or am I gonna leave a message yeah I want
[04:41:28.480 --> 04:41:33.160]  to leave a message I never heard it beat because the audio just cut out are we
[04:41:33.160 --> 04:41:39.280]  leaving a message now it's okay to give these numbers out these are public
[04:41:39.280 --> 04:41:42.760]  numbers I know earlier I didn't want to give that particular number out because
[04:41:42.760 --> 04:41:46.960]  I hadn't called it yet but the stuff's all on the web
[04:41:51.160 --> 04:41:57.040]  what I know is that we cannot trust the US government the International
[04:41:57.040 --> 04:42:01.160]  Atomic Energy Agency of the UN the Japanese government the Chinese
[04:42:01.160 --> 04:42:04.560]  government the Transylvanian government the South African government the
[04:42:04.560 --> 04:42:08.600]  Israeli government the German government the Canadian government the Mexican
[04:42:08.600 --> 04:42:12.880]  government the Chilean government the Brazilian government the Timbuktu
[04:42:12.880 --> 04:42:17.000]  government the Egyptian government to tell you the truth on anything they're a
[04:42:17.000 --> 04:42:23.160]  pack of liars and bureaucracies and we need to know if the government thinks
[04:42:23.160 --> 04:42:26.760]  it's a serious enough threat that they're moving emergency personnel to the
[04:42:26.760 --> 04:42:31.120]  east coast to the west coast from the east we've gotten caller after caller
[04:42:31.120 --> 04:42:36.920]  confirming they've got family who's in the military who has told them that they
[04:42:36.920 --> 04:42:41.560]  are preparing for disasters they are preparing for radiation fallout on the
[04:42:41.560 --> 04:42:46.840]  west coast that is important information we know this thing's been covered up
[04:42:46.840 --> 04:42:50.040]  from the start and only gets worse and worse by the minute the things I was
[04:42:50.040 --> 04:42:54.360]  putting out in article Saturday and being laughed at for and Friday is now
[04:42:54.360 --> 04:43:00.360]  confirmed now I'm telling you this could go from bad to worse and the problem is
[04:43:00.360 --> 04:43:04.720]  as I put out in that video last night that's on YouTube and info wars and
[04:43:04.720 --> 04:43:08.960]  prison planet that we don't know the truth about what's happening in Japan
[04:43:08.960 --> 04:43:15.480]  now more and more we're learning that our worst suspicions have come true and
[04:43:15.480 --> 04:43:21.280]  if one or more of those reactors continue to ignite and continue to vent
[04:43:21.280 --> 04:43:29.960]  uranium plutonium strontium cesium radioactive iodide in the air it is
[04:43:29.960 --> 04:43:34.440]  just totally devastating what's going to happen in Japan you're going to see
[04:43:34.440 --> 04:43:38.440]  people die of radiation poisoning the globalists like soft kill they like
[04:43:38.440 --> 04:43:42.240]  things to kill you in 10 years 20 years then they get to suck all the money out
[04:43:42.240 --> 04:43:44.800]  of you with their cancer treatment the rest of it they do not like people
[04:43:44.800 --> 04:43:48.440]  falling over dead in a week and let me tell you radiation poisoning is not
[04:43:48.440 --> 04:43:53.840]  pretty teeth falling out gums bleeding blood pouring out of your intestines you
[04:43:53.840 --> 04:44:01.120]  know through your hind in I mean it is not fun and this is horrible what's
[04:44:01.120 --> 04:44:09.640]  happening and the radiation levels are rising in Japan and it's no one really
[04:44:09.640 --> 04:44:14.440]  knows what's going on at that plant facility but we're going to be here on
[04:44:14.440 --> 04:44:20.000]  the news websites and live on air covering all of this continually we are
[04:44:20.000 --> 04:44:24.160]  going to be here covering this and if things continue to deteriorate I may be
[04:44:24.160 --> 04:44:30.120]  on nine o'clock tonight I might be on it 6 a.m. in the morning whatever we have
[04:44:30.120 --> 04:44:34.920]  to do to really look at every angle of this that's why talk radio so good for
[04:44:34.920 --> 04:44:39.040]  this is that we can spend a lot of time looking at every facet debating
[04:44:39.040 --> 04:44:43.480]  discussing putting our heads together I correct callers callers correct me we
[04:44:43.480 --> 04:44:47.720]  we help each other we bring each other the information by the way I know I put
[04:44:47.720 --> 04:44:51.280]  it out in the last hour you can you guys print me some of the Twitter
[04:44:51.280 --> 04:44:55.640]  questions specifically or I bet you've already brought those into me stuff
[04:44:55.640 --> 04:45:00.520]  stacks up so quick I gave out the the twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones
[04:45:00.520 --> 04:45:04.280]  earlier and I promise to answer some of your questions so we'll go through some
[04:45:04.280 --> 04:45:10.320]  of those in a moment who's up first here in this list of callers Paul in New
[04:45:10.320 --> 04:45:13.800]  York before we go to Paul I want to say this everybody's especially media
[04:45:13.800 --> 04:45:17.800]  outlets who I know we're listening contact the government and force them to
[04:45:17.800 --> 04:45:20.720]  give a statement about what they're doing about preparations for fallout
[04:45:20.720 --> 04:45:24.240]  because we're getting the intel that's happening we need to confirm this right
[04:45:24.240 --> 04:45:29.200]  now okay you know we sit here for hour after hour covering this and in a way
[04:45:29.200 --> 04:45:36.120]  you kind of get punch-drunk to all of it but my children are in the fallout
[04:45:36.120 --> 04:45:41.920]  path of the jet stream yours are your mother your daughter your sons your
[04:45:41.920 --> 04:45:46.920]  grandmother your children I am upset about this and I know you are yesterday
[04:45:46.920 --> 04:45:50.120]  I blew up a lot on air because it was still cover-ups going on you notice I'm
[04:45:50.120 --> 04:45:55.120]  pretty calm now because the cover-up is unraveled at least we have some
[04:45:55.120 --> 04:46:00.480]  preparation and can see it coming even though it's invisible if government and
[04:46:00.480 --> 04:46:05.800]  industry and private groups do what they have to to test I mean there should be
[04:46:05.800 --> 04:46:08.800]  aircraft in fact I got to write articles about this I should do a YouTube video
[04:46:08.800 --> 04:46:14.800]  there should be u.s. Naval aircraft u.s. Air Force aircraft u.s. Army aircraft
[04:46:14.800 --> 04:46:19.720]  all over that area of the Pacific with radiation meters reporting back to the
[04:46:19.720 --> 04:46:23.160]  public now I'll guarantee you they're up there right now and they know exactly
[04:46:23.160 --> 04:46:26.640]  what's coming this way they know what isotopes they've got the devices that
[04:46:26.640 --> 04:46:31.320]  pick it all up with precision now you notice we're four days into this you're
[04:46:31.320 --> 04:46:35.640]  not heard anything about that you just know that yesterday morning when Fukushima
[04:46:35.640 --> 04:46:41.040]  three blew up that plutonium-powered plant they the main fleet high-tailed it
[04:46:41.040 --> 04:46:45.720]  out of there for running south as fast as they could that's not a good indicator
[04:46:45.720 --> 04:46:48.560]  is it
[04:46:52.360 --> 04:46:59.280]  Paul in New York you're on the air hey can you hear me yes I can hey Alex thanks
[04:46:59.280 --> 04:47:07.160]  I just wanted to bring up a quick point that I think getting lost in this story
[04:47:07.160 --> 04:47:13.400]  is that the Saudi Saudi Arabian Army is now all in Bahrain and they're killing
[04:47:13.400 --> 04:47:18.440]  pro sir are you on speakerphone no I'm not I'm on a phone can you can you hear
[04:47:18.440 --> 04:47:22.440]  me okay let me hear you better okay yeah getting lost in this is that the Saudi
[04:47:22.440 --> 04:47:27.440]  Arabians have rolled into Bahrain a bunch of troops and tanks and everything's
[04:47:27.440 --> 04:47:31.320]  getting wild yes there they're there they're shooting protesters and if you
[04:47:31.320 --> 04:47:36.480]  go on Al Jazeera and you look at the video on there titled Bahrain imposes
[04:47:36.480 --> 04:47:41.960]  state of emergency I think it's pretty compelling that's the thing they
[04:47:41.960 --> 04:47:45.520]  ever call martial law martial law people are ever waiting for that term to be
[04:47:45.520 --> 04:47:50.960]  used they call it civil emergency so I just wanted to point that out if people
[04:47:50.960 --> 04:47:56.560]  want to go on Al Jazeera and look at Bahrain imposes state of emergency and
[04:47:56.560 --> 04:47:59.680]  see for themselves what's going on there thank you sir we'll get that up on
[04:47:59.680 --> 04:48:03.640]  screen for folks right now Al Jazeera Bahrain imposes state of emergency I've
[04:48:03.640 --> 04:48:07.000]  actually got reports here saying that obviously the video I'm shooting people
[04:48:07.000 --> 04:48:09.680]  but that's part of the course in these third-world countries and now here in
[04:48:09.680 --> 04:48:19.560]  America Pete in Michigan you're on the year welcome okay just wanted to ask you
[04:48:19.560 --> 04:48:23.200]  kind of a bit of a question a couple months ago or a month ago you were
[04:48:23.200 --> 04:48:26.480]  talking about how the elites were moving down to South America around Chile and
[04:48:26.480 --> 04:48:31.240]  Argentina and all that and it's been kind of the the talk that they were
[04:48:31.240 --> 04:48:36.400]  possibly going to try a nuclear attack in America to kill a bunch of people and
[04:48:36.400 --> 04:48:40.840]  impose martial law what do you think about the possibility that maybe they
[04:48:40.840 --> 04:48:47.920]  caused the earthquake which which made this nuclear disaster in Japan with the
[04:48:47.920 --> 04:48:52.880]  Tesla weapons they have and maybe that's why they you know they they knew they
[04:48:52.880 --> 04:48:56.080]  were going to do that ahead of time that's why they're yeah I mean I'm not
[04:48:56.080 --> 04:49:01.240]  saying you're bad for asking that question but at the same time we can't
[04:49:01.240 --> 04:49:04.640]  prove that the general public doesn't know they have weather modification much
[04:49:04.640 --> 04:49:09.600]  less tectonic weapons the Secretary of Defense Cohen back in 97 in the Army
[04:49:09.600 --> 04:49:15.160]  Times April 28th issue and others have talked about it and yes harp is involved
[04:49:15.160 --> 04:49:19.320]  with that and yes that's a real situation but we also had a huge solar flare hit
[04:49:19.320 --> 04:49:23.520]  the earth the top astrophysicist say manipulates the magnetic field the
[04:49:23.520 --> 04:49:26.600]  tectonic plates along with the moon being the closest to the earth had been
[04:49:26.600 --> 04:49:30.880]  in 18 years and a lot of top scientists predicted massive earthquakes
[04:49:30.880 --> 04:49:35.600]  especially around Japan because of this so I think my gut leans more towards it
[04:49:35.600 --> 04:49:38.360]  not being harp folks love to blame everything on the government I
[04:49:38.360 --> 04:49:44.120]  certainly certainly I'm happy to when they're involved in it and they may
[04:49:44.120 --> 04:49:48.320]  be but the globalists are mainly moving out of the US and the West because
[04:49:48.320 --> 04:49:52.120]  they've so robbed it blind they're worried about getting arrested I
[04:49:52.120 --> 04:49:57.480]  appreciate your call good points who's up next year Richard and Vermont you're
[04:49:57.480 --> 04:50:02.920]  on the air worldwide hi Alex yes spoke to you yesterday on the guy to build the
[04:50:02.920 --> 04:50:07.280]  submarines there for 13 years and I was telling you about the mock one mark
[04:50:07.280 --> 04:50:12.840]  again mark one mark two mark three okay that was you were wondering and I
[04:50:12.840 --> 04:50:17.640]  were I was wondering what we saw fall out of that cloud of smoke from number
[04:50:17.640 --> 04:50:23.640]  three on the article that you guys have posted and I've seen it all over the
[04:50:23.640 --> 04:50:28.000]  internet today by Kirk James Murphy regarding the turn out Chernobyl on
[04:50:28.000 --> 04:50:33.680]  steroids there is one paragraph in there which gives a pretty good indication of
[04:50:33.680 --> 04:50:39.840]  what's going on here and I checked the schematic diagrams of the the mark one
[04:50:39.840 --> 04:50:44.840]  reactors and these particular reactors not the two and three but these
[04:50:44.840 --> 04:50:51.480]  particular ones have got their spent fuel rods sitting on top of the
[04:50:51.480 --> 04:50:55.400]  contain no I saw that in the news they admitted that the spent fuel rods are
[04:50:55.400 --> 04:51:00.320]  sitting inside of the containment deal and that's what it looked like to me
[04:51:00.320 --> 04:51:05.880]  shooting up in the sky on top of the containment vessel in other words when
[04:51:05.880 --> 04:51:11.000]  that explosion went there was enough there was enough pressure underneath the
[04:51:11.000 --> 04:51:15.840]  bottom of that to shoot that containment vessel with those spent rods in it it
[04:51:15.840 --> 04:51:20.760]  says right here I've got to the give me the headline on that because because I
[04:51:20.760 --> 04:51:24.480]  did see that in a whole bunch of articles it just side note mentioned that in
[04:51:24.480 --> 04:51:29.480]  several of the reactors sitting inside on top the containment vessel are the
[04:51:29.480 --> 04:51:36.000]  spent fuel rods and that was the fire at number two that actually caught some of
[04:51:36.000 --> 04:51:40.440]  those number four that caught some of those on fire wow again hidden in plain
[04:51:40.440 --> 04:51:46.080]  view putting our heads together Richard specifically what's the article because
[04:51:46.080 --> 04:51:50.080]  it's I got a sea of them here that had that about the spent fuel rods if we
[04:51:50.080 --> 04:51:55.160]  just search spent fuel rods fire caught it'll show you all the articles that
[04:51:55.160 --> 04:52:00.720]  have it man fire fuel rod fire and Fukushima reactor would be left for
[04:52:00.720 --> 04:52:09.680]  noble on steroids let me let me write it fuel rod fire at Fukushima Fukushima
[04:52:09.680 --> 04:52:16.840]  reactor would be like Chernobyl on steroids and it was written by Kirk
[04:52:16.840 --> 04:52:24.080]  James Murphy who is an MD he's a he's a doctor and what do we repost that from
[04:52:24.080 --> 04:52:32.520]  what's the original source it's on your front page of info wars calm and it is
[04:52:32.520 --> 04:52:38.320]  one of the highlighted articles down there that if you click on it was the
[04:52:38.320 --> 04:52:44.520]  original source was FDL whatever that is I see it I'm gonna get Watson on this
[04:52:44.520 --> 04:52:48.440]  this is hidden in plain view or more than 24 hours out of Fukushima three
[04:52:48.440 --> 04:52:54.320]  blowing did foot so that mark one was because I saw that absolutely
[04:52:54.320 --> 04:52:59.760]  fuel rods sitting on which are highly radioactive sitting on top of the
[04:52:59.760 --> 04:53:03.280]  containment vessel and that's what it looked like was rod casing shooting up
[04:53:03.280 --> 04:53:08.920]  into the sky those are plutonium that's it mixed in there and inside of that
[04:53:08.920 --> 04:53:13.480]  inside those spent rods are plutonium rods those things fall into the water
[04:53:13.480 --> 04:53:18.480]  or anywhere on the ground around there absolute shit is gonna hit the fan
[04:53:18.480 --> 04:53:21.760]  because those things are gonna get into the water and like we were talking
[04:53:21.760 --> 04:53:25.640]  yesterday a particle of dust like if you were dusting your furniture you see all
[04:53:25.640 --> 04:53:29.800]  these little you have a little ray of sunlight here you're doing sir incredible
[04:53:29.800 --> 04:53:34.600]  info guys get me Watson on air right now please please I'll call him I want him
[04:53:34.600 --> 04:53:38.120]  standing to call him on his cell phones the only thing ever answers I want him
[04:53:38.120 --> 04:53:43.720]  on air right now this is an emergency situation yeah because he won't answer
[04:53:43.720 --> 04:53:48.240]  his homes I'm telling you the the the Richard this is huge you know why this
[04:53:48.240 --> 04:53:53.080]  is huge because I read that in AP an article after article this morning oh
[04:53:53.080 --> 04:53:58.240]  there was a fire at two and a thing at four and yeah they and I read plan after
[04:53:58.240 --> 04:54:10.200]  plant multiple ones they're storing the spent fuel rods inside of the the main
[04:54:10.200 --> 04:54:17.800]  containment shield but but on top of the the containment vessel of the active
[04:54:17.800 --> 04:54:25.200]  rods and you're right the mark one is 7% plutonium 93% uranium those would be
[04:54:25.200 --> 04:54:30.600]  uranium plutonium rods oh my gosh because they're all saying don't worry
[04:54:30.600 --> 04:54:36.960]  it's safe it's inside they know full well with the design that it blew him
[04:54:36.960 --> 04:54:41.920]  sky high oh my gosh that's why we've been on air for almost five hours we're
[04:54:41.920 --> 04:54:48.040]  putting our heads together hidden in plain view whoa whoa man that means fall
[04:54:48.040 --> 04:54:53.800]  out oh man oh my gosh can you imagine those things when they get hot are
[04:54:53.800 --> 04:54:58.000]  basically like graphite they fall apart easily especially spent rods that have
[04:54:58.000 --> 04:55:02.400]  already been in heat how much of that would be aerosolized how much of that
[04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:08.240]  would be aerosolized Richard Richard's gone we got Paul Paul Watson are you
[04:55:08.240 --> 04:55:15.040]  there yeah okay I'm actually staggered right now Paul this is an emergency
[04:55:15.040 --> 04:55:20.000]  situation I know you've already written three articles today busting your butt
[04:55:20.000 --> 04:55:24.200]  you're six hours ahead of us you are my number one guy to get this right I want
[04:55:24.200 --> 04:55:30.800]  you to take notes right now this is an emergency situation now I have literally
[04:55:30.800 --> 04:55:37.280]  this morning probably read 50 or more articles in entirety I'm just putting
[04:55:37.280 --> 04:55:42.560]  some background here so people know where I'm coming from I am exhausted so
[04:55:42.560 --> 04:55:49.400]  you're gonna have to dig this out but it's everywhere but I know I've read it
[04:55:49.400 --> 04:55:53.240]  no fewer than 10 or 12 articles and put the one on screen that has the links to
[04:55:53.240 --> 04:55:56.480]  the mainstream news I'm gonna give this to watch as a source right now listen to
[04:55:56.480 --> 04:56:00.720]  me carefully fuel rod at Fukushima reactor would be like Chernobyl on
[04:56:00.720 --> 04:56:06.680]  steroids by FDL Kirk James Murphy and MD now listen this is what's key my my
[04:56:06.680 --> 04:56:12.440]  friend this is what's key I have read an article after article and we just had
[04:56:12.440 --> 04:56:15.880]  the guy that worked on nuclear submarines he looked up the schematics of a mark
[04:56:15.880 --> 04:56:25.280]  one general electric box reactor that's 7% plutonium 93% uranium driven and I
[04:56:25.280 --> 04:56:29.600]  read this in article after article after article and it's in that article but
[04:56:29.600 --> 04:56:36.960]  you got to search the term spent fuel rods fire spent fuel rods fire that will
[04:56:36.960 --> 04:56:40.920]  bring you up the up team Jillian because if I saw 10 or 12 I read without
[04:56:40.920 --> 04:56:43.760]  looking I just saw it in the footnotes didn't know what I was saying I was like
[04:56:43.760 --> 04:56:48.560]  hmm spent fuel rods caught on fire but they were able to put them out and
[04:56:48.560 --> 04:56:51.520]  knowing that that would release some stuff well guess where they store it and
[04:56:51.520 --> 04:56:55.320]  this is in the news hidden in plain view no one has picked up on this people are
[04:56:55.320 --> 04:56:58.520]  saying oh boy if there is a fire with ease which has now happened it'll be
[04:56:58.520 --> 04:57:03.240]  Chernobyl forget that there was an explosion they store on top of the
[04:57:03.240 --> 04:57:10.720]  containment vessel inside on top of it inside the dome inside the blast shield
[04:57:10.720 --> 04:57:17.000]  you know the main you know overall containment dome they store because
[04:57:17.000 --> 04:57:23.880]  they're highly toxic and radioactive the mark 1 uranium plutonium spent rods on
[04:57:23.880 --> 04:57:27.640]  top of it I know what when he said it bingo as I read that in article after
[04:57:27.640 --> 04:57:32.200]  article after article because of the other plant that blew up today I think
[04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:35.880]  was for they were storing them in there too but it's a different design at the
[04:57:35.880 --> 04:57:40.120]  mark one and he looked up the schematics they are on top of it so they're not
[04:57:40.120 --> 04:57:43.720]  with so the media saying don't worry okay we have a breach it to probably at
[04:57:43.720 --> 04:57:48.280]  four but it's only a little the seals may be broken some may get out the truth
[04:57:48.280 --> 04:57:54.520]  is they were storing inside the main containment dish over the the the internal
[04:57:54.520 --> 04:58:00.440]  containment of the active reactor the spent fuel rods of the last bunch that
[04:58:00.440 --> 04:58:04.240]  the mark wanted to use it's been there for 40 years and looking at it studying
[04:58:04.240 --> 04:58:09.080]  nuclear reactors I know what rod casings look like and I blew up the video and
[04:58:09.080 --> 04:58:14.360]  saw black rod casings and set it on air yesterday when it blew up at Fukushima
[04:58:14.360 --> 04:58:19.520]  3 that that looks like you know the guts of a reactor well of course they've got
[04:58:19.520 --> 04:58:24.240]  all the old pulled spent batteries sitting there still deadly radioactive and
[04:58:24.240 --> 04:58:32.640]  so it was the big it makes it it makes it makes Chernobyl look like a joke and
[04:58:32.640 --> 04:58:36.240]  and Bob Bowman has now agreed this is as big as Chernobyl it's going to this is
[04:58:36.240 --> 04:58:43.480]  past that you understand massive cover-up Paul they were storing spent
[04:58:43.480 --> 04:58:51.240]  plutonium uranium fuel inside the overall containment facility over the
[04:58:51.240 --> 04:58:57.520]  sealed container over the active system and it's all over the news but it's
[04:58:57.520 --> 04:59:01.160]  hidden there no one paying attention no one understanding it took a guy that
[04:59:01.160 --> 04:59:07.360]  worked on nuclear submarines to call in and connect the dots and this is
[04:59:07.360 --> 04:59:12.560]  horrible news Watson but we've got to warn people so the issue is you can show
[04:59:12.560 --> 04:59:17.400]  that it's not just a fire at other areas getting into these that if indeed they
[04:59:17.400 --> 04:59:21.400]  were storing the fuel rods which you can find the news from memory again I've
[04:59:21.400 --> 04:59:25.880]  read this all but I'm telling you now we're moving fast look it up find it
[04:59:25.880 --> 04:59:33.760]  they were storing rods the evidence shows inside not the sealed container not
[04:59:33.760 --> 04:59:36.680]  not in the sealed area which they're now saying several of them are breached at
[04:59:36.680 --> 04:59:44.480]  least one but not just it seal broken ejecting in that huge mushroom cloud the
[04:59:44.480 --> 04:59:49.800]  the the the the last group or more of the news is saying some of them have
[04:59:49.800 --> 04:59:56.240]  repeated groupings into the air and one particle of that it kills somebody Watson
[04:59:56.240 --> 04:59:59.840]  well what do you say about this information
[05:00:00.360 --> 05:00:06.800]  there's an MPR story which basically says the same thing called spent fuel rods
[05:00:06.800 --> 05:00:12.560]  now are concerned at nuclear plant and it has a graphic which shows them stored
[05:00:12.560 --> 05:00:19.680]  next to the actual reactor core yeah but to be specific in the mark one it's not
[05:00:19.680 --> 05:00:28.120]  within the sealed final containment that they were they are sitting inside of the
[05:00:28.120 --> 05:00:32.120]  overall containment facility that blue sky hide that's what we've got to look
[05:00:32.120 --> 05:00:36.400]  into guess we know that in some of the other plants they caught on fire the
[05:00:36.400 --> 05:00:42.480]  spent fuel rods hold on one second my wife keeps calling me hold on one second
[05:00:42.480 --> 05:00:47.680]  hey honey I'm still on air I'll call you back okay this thing's the situation is
[05:00:47.680 --> 05:00:54.360]  terrorating okay well okay there it is they have a map of it is that from MPR
[05:00:54.360 --> 05:01:01.600]  and there it is spent fuel rods blow that up so I can read it please thank you
[05:01:01.600 --> 05:01:10.400]  okay I won't get any bigger than that are they saying that's the mark one we're
[05:01:10.400 --> 05:01:14.840]  not talking about number four that got on fire today they're talking about that's
[05:01:14.840 --> 05:01:20.560]  number two reactor that also blew up and they're saying that spent fuel rods
[05:01:20.560 --> 05:01:27.520]  there you go they were able to blow it up okay I usually can take breaks folks
[05:01:27.520 --> 05:01:31.920]  and get my wind back for here on air but Watson I'm gonna take a five minute
[05:01:31.920 --> 05:01:35.600]  break you've got the floor give people the latest you know at present planet
[05:01:35.600 --> 05:01:38.880]  info wars and you talk for five ten minutes I'm gonna go do some research
[05:01:38.880 --> 05:01:42.400]  on this and nail it down but you've got a ferret to sound the mark one was
[05:01:42.400 --> 05:01:46.440]  storing them inside not the main containment vessel but in but but but
[05:01:46.440 --> 05:01:52.640]  above that what do they call the larger dome the the main containment concrete
[05:01:52.640 --> 05:01:57.840]  system it stored up it stored inside that not in the main containment vessel
[05:01:57.840 --> 05:02:03.360]  within it so we've got a ferret to sound what Richard Vermont was saying is
[05:02:03.360 --> 05:02:11.600]  Richard still on hold or is he gone we had to drop him and I'm trying to think
[05:02:11.600 --> 05:02:17.200]  through all this right now all you got the floor give me a break okay go ahead
[05:02:17.200 --> 05:02:24.360]  well the latest is that the ISIS which is the Institute for Science and
[05:02:24.360 --> 05:02:31.600]  International Security has basically said that the crisis is now closer to a
[05:02:31.600 --> 05:02:37.560]  level 6 event which is obviously more serious than Three Mile Island and that
[05:02:37.560 --> 05:02:46.920]  quote it may unfortunately reach a level 7 so now the top US based science and
[05:02:46.920 --> 05:02:52.800]  international security agencies basically admitting that the two articles I
[05:02:52.800 --> 05:03:00.040]  wrote earlier today were about the shortage in potassium iodide basically
[05:03:00.040 --> 05:03:08.840]  you've got private sellers on eBay selling a blister of potassium iodide
[05:03:08.840 --> 05:03:14.520]  tablets 14 tablets in a pack and that's it everywhere else is filled out
[05:03:14.520 --> 05:03:21.600]  amazon.com if you try to purchase potassium iodide off amazon.com
[05:03:21.600 --> 05:03:27.600]  they're sending out an email saying that the manufacturers have completely run
[05:03:27.600 --> 05:03:33.040]  out of supply indeed on Saturday before this evening really got serious they had
[05:03:33.040 --> 05:03:38.280]  already run out of supply and they're not going to have any supply back in stock
[05:03:38.280 --> 05:03:46.600]  before April at the earliest or even May I am applying to visit China in a couple
[05:03:46.600 --> 05:03:52.160]  of weeks which of course is not far from Japan so I tried to buy some
[05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:58.440]  potassium iodide just in case obviously you only take it in an emergency you
[05:03:58.440 --> 05:04:02.720]  know it's not some kind of supplement it's not the liquid form which is a lot
[05:04:02.720 --> 05:04:09.480]  weaker you only take this in times of emergency so I tried to buy some just
[05:04:09.480 --> 05:04:15.880]  for you know preparedness purchased it off eBay and then lo and behold I got an
[05:04:15.880 --> 05:04:22.280]  email about three hours later saying that they will not have any back in stock
[05:04:22.280 --> 05:04:29.960]  until the end of April or even May so basically there's no supply for the whole
[05:04:29.960 --> 05:04:35.040]  of next month is what they're saying then of course you had the caller earlier
[05:04:35.040 --> 05:04:39.520]  in the show saying that he tried to get it through prescription because we're
[05:04:39.520 --> 05:04:45.960]  also getting a lot of reports where chemists or health stores actually have
[05:04:45.960 --> 05:04:51.360]  small amounts of it in stock but they're just refusing to sell it one email said
[05:04:51.360 --> 05:04:56.480]  that a guy tried to buy it and he was told that it's used in the production of
[05:04:56.480 --> 05:05:01.560]  meth and ketamine so they just point blank refused to sell it to him and then
[05:05:01.560 --> 05:05:05.760]  he had the case of course we should cover it earlier where this guy went to his
[05:05:05.760 --> 05:05:13.440]  doctor and she refused to prescribe it to him because after a conversation with
[05:05:13.440 --> 05:05:21.520]  the CDC she was basically sold not to recommended not to and so she followed
[05:05:21.520 --> 05:05:30.400]  their orders and refused to prescribe it so panic buying as resulted in a massive
[05:05:30.400 --> 05:05:37.480]  shortage and what's amazing about it is that it's been going on since Saturday
[05:05:37.480 --> 05:05:43.600]  before they even admitted to the fact that any kind of radiation had been
[05:05:43.600 --> 05:05:47.440]  injected into the atmosphere at that point they were still claiming it was
[05:05:47.440 --> 05:05:52.280]  all hydrogen blast and that there was there was no real threat part from the
[05:05:52.280 --> 05:05:57.840]  you know the immediate vicinity but after of course the reports that we covered
[05:05:57.840 --> 05:06:04.240]  of the jet stream potentially carrying this across the Pacific people are
[05:06:04.240 --> 05:06:11.440]  trying to acquire this potassium iodide and it's all basically run out so good
[05:06:11.440 --> 05:06:18.760]  luck of course you can you can still get the weaker liquid form of it which is
[05:06:18.760 --> 05:06:28.880]  iodine but it's far less concentrated than the pill format the pill format is a 130
[05:06:28.880 --> 05:06:34.240]  milligrams and that's the amount that you need to take once a day to protect you
[05:06:34.240 --> 05:06:41.320]  from radiation fallout but the liquid format is down around 80 milligrams
[05:06:41.320 --> 05:06:48.120]  iodide that's the strongest that you can get from my research and I've been
[05:06:48.120 --> 05:06:53.360]  looking obviously looking to buy it for hours today and managed to get some of
[05:06:53.360 --> 05:07:00.360]  liquid but the tablets are completely sold out apart from that the latest
[05:07:00.360 --> 05:07:05.480]  developments are of course the radiation they said was an immediate threat we have
[05:07:05.480 --> 05:07:14.040]  people fleeing Tokyo early today later the government said that radiation had
[05:07:14.040 --> 05:07:22.160]  now fallen but of course since they've been caught underplaying the situation
[05:07:22.160 --> 05:07:26.560]  all along nobody really trusts them that's why a lot of people now start
[05:07:26.560 --> 05:07:32.720]  to leave Tokyo after the early reports of small levels of radiation reaching
[05:07:32.720 --> 05:07:40.280]  Tokyo and basically you've got evacuations taking place you've got the
[05:07:40.280 --> 05:07:47.640]  French radio radio France which is the state radio station for France they
[05:07:47.640 --> 05:07:53.680]  pulled basically all their staff from Japan over radiation fears the Chinese
[05:07:53.680 --> 05:08:01.320]  government has started to sell flights to evacuate its people out of the affected
[05:08:01.320 --> 05:08:09.160]  areas and so you've got a lot of people trying to leave as the crisis gets
[05:08:09.160 --> 05:08:14.320]  worse which it only seems to have been doing every single morning in Japan
[05:08:14.320 --> 05:08:19.080]  people wake up to this 6 30 announcement from the government and it seems that
[05:08:19.080 --> 05:08:24.880]  each time they've made this announced announcement the situation has got worse
[05:08:24.880 --> 05:08:31.720]  and worse their methods for dealing with the nuclear crisis has taken on a more
[05:08:31.720 --> 05:08:37.600]  and more desperate tone it went from injecting seawater in to try and cool
[05:08:37.600 --> 05:08:43.920]  the nuclear rods now they're failing to do that and these rods are being exposed
[05:08:43.920 --> 05:08:49.520]  because of the water level going down they're talking about flying over
[05:08:49.520 --> 05:08:54.840]  helicopters to dump water on there to try and cool them down
[05:08:54.840 --> 05:09:00.160]  Paul going back to Friday going back to Friday and Saturday our little debates
[05:09:00.160 --> 05:09:05.760]  you know I did a lot of research on this and and I have to say the reportage in
[05:09:05.760 --> 05:09:10.600]  our analysis has been absolutely dead-on from the beginning of this just
[05:09:10.600 --> 05:09:14.360]  because we know the history of other nuclear disasters and the cover-ups we
[05:09:14.360 --> 05:09:19.360]  understand the technology and I've got to commend you Kurt Nemo, Steve Watts and
[05:09:19.360 --> 05:09:25.480]  your brother Aaron Dykes the entire crew here Matt Ryan, Jaren Nyhart, Marley
[05:09:25.480 --> 05:09:36.480]  Jones, Matt, Bill, Max, the entire crew everybody in this office and I tell you
[05:09:36.480 --> 05:09:40.440]  if this continues to melt down the way it has we're gonna have big problems not
[05:09:40.440 --> 05:09:45.920]  just in Japan but in Hawaii in northeastern Russia Alaska those winds
[05:09:45.920 --> 05:09:50.600]  just gyrate and go all over the place but mainly towards the US and I was
[05:09:50.600 --> 05:09:55.320]  hoping and praying that they could get this under control but Paul you understand
[05:09:55.320 --> 05:10:01.400]  the complete mission today and tomorrow now is the fact that that mark one blew
[05:10:01.400 --> 05:10:06.320]  up and that they're reporting that it had rods not in the super powerful
[05:10:06.320 --> 05:10:11.040]  internal chamber but the larger blast shield containment over that it was
[05:10:11.040 --> 05:10:16.240]  inside of there some of the reactors tore it inside the inner chamber others
[05:10:16.240 --> 05:10:21.320]  outside the caller who worked on nuclear submarines was totally proven right
[05:10:21.320 --> 05:10:24.400]  yesterday today he called in very credible and said he looked at the
[05:10:24.400 --> 05:10:29.920]  specs on a mark one and he reported to me that it's in the press and I remember
[05:10:29.920 --> 05:10:33.680]  reading it again I'm live on air so it's hard but to go in there find out if
[05:10:33.680 --> 05:10:36.280]  they were storing it because I saw it all over the news that some of these
[05:10:36.280 --> 05:10:40.840]  reactors they were stored outside the inner containment facility and so if
[05:10:40.840 --> 05:10:46.040]  that thing totally blew away and then there was rods inside of there that
[05:10:46.040 --> 05:10:49.040]  weren't in the main containment facility but we're in the outer one those were
[05:10:49.040 --> 05:10:52.480]  ejected up into the air we're dealing with something that makes Chernobyl look
[05:10:52.480 --> 05:10:57.800]  like a joke I mean this is off the charts this is the number one imperative I
[05:10:57.800 --> 05:11:03.760]  need to let you go what is your ETA on research on this how long till we can get
[05:11:03.760 --> 05:11:07.320]  this key report out so we get it on info wars.com and prison planet.com because
[05:11:07.320 --> 05:11:12.960]  obviously Paul if they're because we know and other reactors at Fukushima they
[05:11:12.960 --> 05:11:17.840]  were outside the facility as well caught on fire and the explosion blew up we
[05:11:17.840 --> 05:11:23.400]  know that happened but they were not ejected 3,000 feet in the air you watch
[05:11:23.400 --> 05:11:27.680]  that plume in seconds go up and you see the guts of what looks like a reactor in
[05:11:27.680 --> 05:11:36.200]  rods just falling back down I mean this is folks that one little grain of that
[05:11:36.200 --> 05:11:40.000]  plutonium or uranium in you you're dead you're not gonna have to wait ten years
[05:11:40.000 --> 05:11:44.480]  for it to kill you with cancer and we're already facing Dr. Bob Bowman three
[05:11:44.480 --> 05:11:48.280]  nuclear physicist degrees the former head of Star Wars program showing
[05:11:48.280 --> 05:11:51.440]  undoubtedly summer radiation is going to hit the west you're going to see
[05:11:51.440 --> 05:12:00.400]  increased cancers but that was from the strontium the cesium the cesium the
[05:12:00.400 --> 05:12:04.800]  radioactive iodine so that's that's bad but nothing compared to uranium and
[05:12:04.800 --> 05:12:08.480]  plutonium so what what's your timeline on research and this I'll help you
[05:12:08.480 --> 05:12:12.320]  ferret it out as soon as I get off air but I'm telling you I've read it over
[05:12:12.320 --> 05:12:16.640]  and over again that they were storing rods outside the inner containment
[05:12:16.640 --> 05:12:22.560]  facility that's hidden in plain view we separate from the other plants with them
[05:12:22.560 --> 05:12:26.640]  stored outside that just caught on fire if that huge explosion happened and they
[05:12:26.640 --> 05:12:31.640]  were storing things inside the general containment area over the inner that's
[05:12:31.640 --> 05:12:36.880]  the issue if that happened we know that this is worse than Chernobyl and it's
[05:12:36.880 --> 05:12:40.440]  being covered up and everything else has been covered up Paul like when I called
[05:12:40.440 --> 05:12:44.320]  you Saturday morning and I said Fukushima one just blew up I would doubt
[05:12:44.320 --> 05:12:47.160]  that the containment facility would be intact and now they're admitting that oh
[05:12:47.160 --> 05:12:51.960]  one two three maybe a bunch of them the seals are broke you know of the of the
[05:12:51.960 --> 05:12:55.720]  impregnable I saw Glenn Beck yesterday saying it was just impregnable the
[05:12:55.720 --> 05:13:00.400]  inner one and great hope that all you want I mean the the explosion we saw at
[05:13:00.400 --> 05:13:04.160]  Fukushima three and we don't know the explosions have you seen the explosions
[05:13:04.160 --> 05:13:06.960]  that went on during the night because I can't find video of that because it was
[05:13:06.960 --> 05:13:13.560]  dark I mean do we know how big those were right but there's no one there that's
[05:13:13.560 --> 05:13:17.200]  why they said they heard an explosion because there's hardly anyone there to
[05:13:17.200 --> 05:13:24.000]  see it there's only 50 people left in the actual vicinity but I mean I thought
[05:13:24.000 --> 05:13:27.360]  that Glenn Beck last night he was basically downplaying it said that it
[05:13:27.360 --> 05:13:32.160]  wasn't even as urgent as Three Mile Island and you can have a bit of egg on
[05:13:32.160 --> 05:13:37.240]  his face tonight by the looks of it no he's busy I just saw him during the
[05:13:37.240 --> 05:13:41.120]  break when I took a break he's back there saying that look at how great the
[05:13:41.120 --> 05:13:46.080]  Japanese people are how they handle things praying and being good versus
[05:13:46.080 --> 05:13:51.520]  Americans rioting and I absolutely agree with that but this is people with an
[05:13:51.520 --> 05:13:55.840]  outside threat an outside crisis coming together this isn't people who are
[05:13:55.840 --> 05:14:00.480]  angry about having their paychecks cut so you know being docile can go too far
[05:14:00.480 --> 05:14:04.160]  but I wouldn't call it docile the Japanese are very brave stoic noble
[05:14:04.160 --> 05:14:08.760]  people and we pray for him but I don't want to get off in a glint back the
[05:14:08.760 --> 05:14:13.360]  point is is I'm watching last night he clearly was up there lying to people and
[05:14:13.360 --> 05:14:18.800]  I'm just sick of it but but you understand how critical this is you
[05:14:18.800 --> 05:14:22.280]  understand how critical this is that if they were storing rods outside the
[05:14:22.280 --> 05:14:25.560]  central containment facility those blue sky high and that this is the biggest
[05:14:25.560 --> 05:14:29.560]  nuclear disaster in history you understand the UN already listed as the
[05:14:29.560 --> 05:14:33.360]  second worst ever Chernobyl this is way past that you confirm it you break it
[05:14:33.360 --> 05:14:37.480]  right now Paul okay and if it isn't confirmed thank God but it looks like
[05:14:37.480 --> 05:14:43.680]  that's what happened are you on the job Watson yeah okay then attack them with
[05:14:43.680 --> 05:14:47.280]  the info get in there ferret it out did you hear the article with the listener
[05:14:47.280 --> 05:14:51.760]  mentioned that has a link where they talk about fuel rods in the mark one
[05:14:51.760 --> 05:14:57.320]  stored in the second level of containment yeah I'm looking at a graphic of
[05:14:57.320 --> 05:15:02.720]  it now I can see that they are okay get it out this is an emergency situation I
[05:15:02.720 --> 05:15:07.600]  mean I mean the headline to get people understand the warning is emergency
[05:15:07.600 --> 05:15:18.080]  warning Mark Fukushima number three fuel rods ejected in explosion and the
[05:15:18.080 --> 05:15:22.200]  fact that no one's seeing it right right there this isn't it the other plant to
[05:15:22.200 --> 05:15:26.760]  with some getting on fire them catching on fire that's some of its fizzes and
[05:15:26.760 --> 05:15:32.040]  gets out but not a lot when they're blowing up into the sky and they fall
[05:15:32.040 --> 05:15:36.480]  and into particleized dust when they're spent this is just and folks don't think
[05:15:36.480 --> 05:15:40.120]  spent doesn't mean these things are radioactive you know one one little
[05:15:40.120 --> 05:15:45.080]  micron of this you're dead no wonder the embassies are pulling out in Tokyo no
[05:15:45.080 --> 05:15:50.920]  wonder I mean I can't believe this Paul this is horrible news
[05:15:50.920 --> 05:15:57.240]  well they're saying that the blast that affected the number two reactor
[05:15:57.240 --> 05:16:03.440]  affected the suppression pool which is down below from where the spent fuel
[05:16:03.440 --> 05:16:07.000]  rods are stored yeah but we're not talking about number two we're talking
[05:16:07.000 --> 05:16:12.520]  about number three Fukushima it's the mark one plutonium uranium reactor
[05:16:12.520 --> 05:16:16.720]  that's the issue in the big explosion yesterday morning that's the point these
[05:16:16.720 --> 05:16:21.200]  aren't rods on fire at another plant next door this is them ejected into the
[05:16:21.200 --> 05:16:26.840]  sky do you understand that that's the big issue yeah folks are seeing some
[05:16:26.840 --> 05:16:30.000]  behind-the-scenes things here where Paul call me with news I'll call him with
[05:16:30.000 --> 05:16:33.120]  news we'll work through it together I've just been handed more information Japan
[05:16:33.120 --> 05:16:36.400]  races to contain meltdowns at the tubeless third reactor losing cooling
[05:16:36.400 --> 05:16:42.200]  capacity and they've got it underlined here at the 40-year-old Fukushima
[05:16:42.200 --> 05:16:46.680]  Daiachi unit one where an explosion Saturday destroyed a building housed in
[05:16:46.680 --> 05:16:49.920]  the reactor the spent fuel pool and according to the general electrics
[05:16:49.920 --> 05:16:54.400]  design is placed above the reactor okay so one and three are the general
[05:16:54.400 --> 05:16:59.440]  electrics and it does say they're placed above the reactor Tokyo electrics said
[05:16:59.440 --> 05:17:03.160]  it was trying to figure out how to maintain water levels in the pools the
[05:17:03.160 --> 05:17:12.180]  question is use that outside of the of the internal containment and according
[05:17:12.180 --> 05:17:16.480]  to these reports it is that's the point that's the point is that everybody's
[05:17:16.480 --> 05:17:20.200]  talking about the active reactor not the other reactor cores the batteries
[05:17:20.200 --> 05:17:24.240]  basically they've pulled that's the issue the mother of all dirty bombs it
[05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:27.960]  said that would be like Chernobyl on steroids said Arnie Gunderson a nuclear
[05:17:27.960 --> 05:17:31.720]  engineer at Fairwinds Associates to remember the public oversight panel for
[05:17:31.720 --> 05:17:37.200]  Vermont Yankee power plant which is identical to the Fukushima Daiachi
[05:17:37.200 --> 05:17:40.840]  unit one we're not talking about that we're talking about three we're also
[05:17:40.840 --> 05:17:44.200]  talking about one because if that was stored on the outside that's two of them
[05:17:44.200 --> 05:17:48.120]  Watson you know what to do let's get on it and ferret out the truth because this
[05:17:48.120 --> 05:17:51.360]  is the mother of all cover-ups if they've known this since Saturday if it
[05:17:51.360 --> 05:17:54.800]  happened at one as well you get what I'm saying we got one and three here
[05:17:54.800 --> 05:18:03.280]  anything else Watson just the fact that a lot of people are still in denial for
[05:18:03.280 --> 05:18:09.520]  example there's a lot of British people who live in Japan and on the BBC I'm
[05:18:09.520 --> 05:18:13.840]  talking about the people who live about 30 to 50 miles away from the actual
[05:18:13.840 --> 05:18:17.920]  reactor they're just saying that they're taking their kids to the park and
[05:18:17.920 --> 05:18:21.000]  they're still drinking the tap water because they just believe that
[05:18:21.000 --> 05:18:27.920]  everything's gonna be fine you're talking about Japan yeah I'm talking about
[05:18:27.920 --> 05:18:33.640]  British people reporting from Japan and it just goes to the Japanese an orderly
[05:18:33.640 --> 05:18:38.800]  fashion or fleeing but the breads are just just bumbling about like Americans
[05:18:38.800 --> 05:18:44.680]  yeah because I mean they're downfall is that they believe the authorities and
[05:18:44.680 --> 05:18:47.800]  their lies that everything's gonna be fine and so you know they're gonna pay the
[05:18:47.800 --> 05:18:52.600]  price in the end you still planning to go to Asia in a few weeks
[05:18:52.600 --> 05:18:59.520]  Paul no I think they did in radiation no but I have to wait and see well the
[05:18:59.520 --> 05:19:02.720]  thing is they're gonna lie about it and so I would cancel that trip and do it in
[05:19:02.720 --> 05:19:06.280]  a few months but we'll see what happens buddy a good job get the report out
[05:19:06.280 --> 05:19:11.880]  thank you so much for the great job Watson all right there goes Paul Watson
[05:19:11.880 --> 05:19:17.160]  we've already gone this far I'm gonna take 11 phone calls and we're done
[05:19:17.160 --> 05:19:20.880]  until tomorrow unless this continues to deteriorate and I'll be back I want to
[05:19:20.880 --> 05:19:25.560]  say great job with the crew let's go away and I've tried to do the best job I
[05:19:25.560 --> 05:19:32.840]  can doing five hours of radio here five plus hours now let's go ahead and talk
[05:19:32.840 --> 05:19:39.840]  to David in Germany David you're on the air this is David from Germany how are
[05:19:39.840 --> 05:19:45.040]  you as Alex very upset trying to maintain calm very angry at General
[05:19:45.040 --> 05:19:48.920]  Electric very angry at the globalist covering this up but what's your view
[05:19:48.920 --> 05:19:58.320]  David cool I have one one information one one question and one suggestion to
[05:19:58.320 --> 05:20:05.400]  make it very short so I'm info warrior then saw two decades and Paul what you
[05:20:05.400 --> 05:20:13.560]  are doing is just I'm just well I'm I'm off the words now so the the question is
[05:20:13.560 --> 05:20:20.480]  why the heck do they have plutonium in there which is normally only used for
[05:20:20.480 --> 05:20:29.280]  weapons because they've created the mark ones to get rid of hydrogen bomb
[05:20:29.280 --> 05:20:36.120]  thistle material and so what they burn there reportedly is American
[05:20:36.120 --> 05:20:44.440]  decommissioned plutonium from warheads oh wow so beyond the information in the
[05:20:44.440 --> 05:20:48.880]  mainstream media here in Germany that BMW is pulling out people and Simon's
[05:20:48.880 --> 05:20:54.000]  is pulling out people and which all confirms what is going on there beyond
[05:20:54.000 --> 05:21:00.240]  that I did a energy protection management training years ago and I was in
[05:21:00.240 --> 05:21:05.280]  Ohu too so I have seen a power plant I know how it works and I made a lot of
[05:21:05.280 --> 05:21:11.280]  very bad questions there they didn't like me at all beyond all that you pointed
[05:21:11.280 --> 05:21:17.120]  out the question why they hack they always build that power plant at fault
[05:21:17.120 --> 05:21:22.520]  lines and the information I've got years ago from a guy which is called or
[05:21:22.520 --> 05:21:29.440]  named run volume as he's a deck is the only reason is to have it really work
[05:21:29.440 --> 05:21:35.560]  good you need a negative spot which is the dragon lines or however you call it
[05:21:35.560 --> 05:21:42.160]  the magnetic lines a negative spot to work good for a nuclear facility for
[05:21:42.160 --> 05:21:46.800]  you know that sounds crazy but but I've talked to engineers and they say that
[05:21:46.800 --> 05:21:51.400]  they're depending on it whether it's superstition or whatever that they do
[05:21:51.400 --> 05:21:56.360]  believe and the globalists believe in all this stuff and it's it's very
[05:21:56.360 --> 05:21:59.880]  bizarre David good to hear from you I really appreciate your great points
[05:21:59.880 --> 05:22:05.680]  from Deutschland let's talk to Dana in Colorado you're on the air Dana wow
[05:22:05.680 --> 05:22:15.440]  okay I was just watching eBay and two blister packs of IOSAT started at $29
[05:22:15.440 --> 05:22:21.880]  there were 38 bidders and it just sold for $610 wow and I just threw away about
[05:22:21.880 --> 05:22:29.960]  a year ago two boxes of it that I bought because it said it was expired sorry go
[05:22:29.960 --> 05:22:37.280]  ahead actually so so what do you think of this overall situation well I
[05:22:37.280 --> 05:22:40.960]  actually called to tell you about another fact that I had seen on the
[05:22:40.960 --> 05:22:47.000]  internet when you were talking about units being deployed on the FEMA website
[05:22:47.000 --> 05:22:51.520]  I already emailed it to your division their fact sheet reads that there's a
[05:22:51.520 --> 05:23:00.080]  national level exercise 2011 called NLE 2011 on the Madrid for May correct the
[05:23:00.080 --> 05:23:07.520]  200 year anniversary and it's got eight states participating in this drill and
[05:23:07.520 --> 05:23:12.160]  how ironic that is I tell you there's a lot of
[05:23:12.160 --> 05:23:15.720]  creepiness going on we can't rule out harp here they admit they've got that
[05:23:15.720 --> 05:23:19.520]  weapon system do we ever find the Secretary of Defense quote Secretary of
[05:23:19.520 --> 05:23:24.280]  Defense William Cohen 1997 Secretary of Defense William Cohen talks about
[05:23:24.280 --> 05:23:27.640]  tectonic weapons that'll pull the quota for you I want to read the exact quote
[05:23:27.640 --> 05:23:32.160]  thank you Dana thank you let's talk to Mark in mass mark you're on the air
[05:23:32.160 --> 05:23:37.400]  moving along here hi Alex hi I just first of all major thank you this is
[05:23:37.400 --> 05:23:41.600]  beyond incredible you're not the only one who whose head is spinning right now
[05:23:41.600 --> 05:23:45.760]  let's put it that way I'm a geologist among other things I've been following
[05:23:45.760 --> 05:23:49.760]  this you know right along and just talk about spiraling out of control you've
[05:23:49.760 --> 05:23:54.600]  heard terms obviously like culture shock the news is coming in left and right so
[05:23:54.600 --> 05:23:59.360]  fast so rapidly you know hearing you and your energy is incredible it reminds me
[05:23:59.360 --> 05:24:02.440]  things I heard about Nicola Tesla where he realized he only needed I think 20
[05:24:02.440 --> 05:24:07.420]  minutes of sleep he get it like at 4 a.m. well I'm not Nicola Tesla that guy
[05:24:07.420 --> 05:24:12.160]  probably had a 250 IQ I'm lucky if I'm pushing 120 pal you're pretty good man
[05:24:12.160 --> 05:24:15.160]  you're pretty good I got a couple things to share with you really quick I'll try
[05:24:15.160 --> 05:24:18.840]  to be concise here just when you do what you just said about you know when
[05:24:18.840 --> 05:24:21.880]  you're they were telling everyone not to worry it really reminds me of like the
[05:24:21.880 --> 05:24:25.560]  Martians and Mars attacks you know they're going around saying everything
[05:24:25.560 --> 05:24:28.760]  is fine do not worry while they're nuking people at the same time you know
[05:24:28.760 --> 05:24:34.640]  destroying the planet but everything is fine your information's grown zero let's
[05:24:34.640 --> 05:24:38.280]  put it that way number one for everybody out there listening this might
[05:24:38.280 --> 05:24:41.480]  it's not the most important point but it is a good point there's a song on
[05:24:41.480 --> 05:24:45.640]  YouTube and if you can get access to it I already told your staff about it called
[05:24:45.640 --> 05:24:50.120]  the apple tree came out 1985 by Difford and Tilbrook the main guys from
[05:24:50.120 --> 05:24:53.600]  squeeze and it's the ultimate song for what's going on right now not that
[05:24:53.600 --> 05:24:57.320]  songs are important but you know you have bumper music it's eerie every line in
[05:24:57.320 --> 05:25:01.120]  the song it's about the nuclear meltdown that kind of causes doom day and it
[05:25:01.120 --> 05:25:05.200]  doomsday it's amazing beyond amazing so I told them anyone out there listening
[05:25:05.200 --> 05:25:09.520]  check out the apple tree we'll do it mark thank you that's six more callers
[05:25:09.520 --> 05:25:12.400]  I'm gonna take it and that's it folks we'll be back tomorrow Dan in
[05:25:12.400 --> 05:25:17.240]  Pennsylvania you're on the air welcome yeah kudos to you Alex this is our kind
[05:25:17.240 --> 05:25:22.320]  of off topic but it's about all of the nuclear power plants that are around it
[05:25:22.320 --> 05:25:27.240]  about the country and everything it's about what is it retrofitting them with
[05:25:27.240 --> 05:25:37.440]  cold fusion from a gentleman out in Italy mr. Rossi and he and they want to
[05:25:37.440 --> 05:25:44.560]  put one in Greece but they have to um what is it wait for authorization for it
[05:25:44.560 --> 05:25:49.120]  and this I believe this is a technology that you know way well you know they've
[05:25:49.120 --> 05:25:52.440]  done some hoaxes claiming that it isn't real but now it's been duplicated
[05:25:52.440 --> 05:25:56.200]  thousands of times and the establishment doesn't want people having close to free
[05:25:56.200 --> 05:25:59.800]  energy so there is a lot of suppression of it like my guest earlier in the show
[05:25:59.800 --> 05:26:04.000]  today talked about when you try to get your own solar panels hooked up at your
[05:26:04.000 --> 05:26:06.760]  house they'll never never come in permanent so just ignore them just do it
[05:26:06.760 --> 05:26:11.600]  but then if you agree to put solar panels in and put it in the grid then they
[05:26:11.600 --> 05:26:15.600]  come right out and do it they want to control your life thank you Dan Fred and
[05:26:15.600 --> 05:26:21.160]  Florida you're on the air worldwide hey Alex I just had a little bit more to add
[05:26:21.160 --> 05:26:26.600]  to this that I emailed you an image I found it's a fairly high resolution
[05:26:26.600 --> 05:26:33.080]  satellite image of on top of unit three and when you see the explosion at plume
[05:26:33.080 --> 05:26:38.040]  that went up I mean went pretty near a mile up and you could see chunks of
[05:26:38.040 --> 05:26:43.240]  stuff falling out well on the satellite image you could see what looks like the
[05:26:43.240 --> 05:26:48.240]  whole guts of the reactor just laying across now we know why it looked like
[05:26:48.240 --> 05:26:53.640]  that because the evidence shows they had the original guts of the
[05:26:53.640 --> 05:26:59.960]  previous load of plutonium uranium rods in there and so that was sitting on top
[05:26:59.960 --> 05:27:03.960]  of the of the intercontainment when the outside blew up it ejected it into the
[05:27:03.960 --> 05:27:09.040]  air right so what I'm wondering is it looks like when you when you read what
[05:27:09.040 --> 05:27:14.800]  I learned about what a meltdown is is that the main for melts and then melts
[05:27:14.800 --> 05:27:19.320]  down through the earth until it hits groundwater and then it has a steam
[05:27:19.320 --> 05:27:24.320]  explosion and blows up just like what I imagined that video looks like up to a
[05:27:24.320 --> 05:27:28.920]  blue mile up how many kilotons of energy was that going up um so my
[05:27:28.920 --> 05:27:33.400]  what I'm wondering has the main containment shell disintegrated in that
[05:27:33.400 --> 05:27:39.840]  plume or is it just the spent fuel rods oh the the outer containment shell
[05:27:39.840 --> 05:27:45.080]  evaporated and exploded good points I'm sorry go ahead there's three shells there's
[05:27:45.080 --> 05:27:50.880]  the square outer one and then there's an inner dome safety shell yeah and then
[05:27:50.880 --> 05:27:54.400]  there's the main the main containment shell yeah and what I'm saying is they
[05:27:54.400 --> 05:27:59.800]  store exactly in the above the first shell the inner shell they store them
[05:27:59.800 --> 05:28:02.160]  above that and they have another shell above it another shell above it and
[05:28:02.160 --> 05:28:05.600]  clearly look at the photos it's all blown to Kingdom come I appreciate your
[05:28:05.600 --> 05:28:09.120]  call that's the big issues the spent fuel rods spraying all out in the air
[05:28:09.120 --> 05:28:14.080]  breaking up in the wind I mean this is just that stuff is so deadly ladies and
[05:28:14.080 --> 05:28:18.240]  gentlemen let's go ahead but see they'll spin it just like to do with the
[05:28:18.240 --> 05:28:23.480]  radiation at the airports or the TSA or the DU for the troops I'll be surprised
[05:28:23.480 --> 05:28:26.600]  they don't come out and say give children do you you know give children
[05:28:26.600 --> 05:28:32.960]  uranium you know give them plutonium let's go ahead and talk to John and you
[05:28:32.960 --> 05:28:40.440]  were telling me something yeah John and Pennsylvania go ahead Alex my hat's off
[05:28:40.440 --> 05:28:44.240]  my tip of my hat to you sir I wanted to mention to you the guy that mentioned
[05:28:44.240 --> 05:28:48.400]  from boy he worked at Oyster Creek nuclear power plant I worked at Three Mile
[05:28:48.400 --> 05:28:53.480]  Island Stevensville Michigan DC Cook I'm 63 years old I worked at quite a few of
[05:28:53.480 --> 05:29:00.200]  these plants and it's amazing what goes on in them and everybody kind of touched
[05:29:00.200 --> 05:29:06.680]  on the points that I wanted to touch on it's but I worked at Indian Point which
[05:29:06.680 --> 05:29:11.440]  is a nuclear power plant right above New York City and many years ago when I was
[05:29:11.440 --> 05:29:16.000]  just a young man they had some problems in there and in order for the people to
[05:29:16.000 --> 05:29:21.680]  go inside the plant to repair them they could only stay in there at 15 minutes at
[05:29:21.680 --> 05:29:25.760]  one time and that was it for a year's work so they were going through welders
[05:29:25.760 --> 05:29:30.560]  that were it was so quick and so fast it was unbelievable and I was lucky I was
[05:29:30.560 --> 05:29:34.480]  fat and I couldn't fit in the containment vessel so I had to stay I was
[05:29:34.480 --> 05:29:38.880]  outside testing the welders constantly the ones that were going into weld it
[05:29:38.880 --> 05:29:42.040]  was kind of an interesting thing and one last thing I want to ask you really
[05:29:42.040 --> 05:29:46.200]  quick the reverend from that was up this from a my partner trans Alaska pipeline
[05:29:46.200 --> 05:29:52.400]  I was up there in 1976 7778 when he was and I just would like you to ask him
[05:29:52.400 --> 05:29:58.200]  some time if he enjoyed the BP Hilton all right what was the BP Hilton well
[05:29:58.200 --> 05:30:02.720]  that was what birdies petroleum had they had this huge magnificent building
[05:30:02.720 --> 05:30:08.240]  where the uppity up lived and they had the swimming pool in it and and I mean
[05:30:08.240 --> 05:30:12.280]  it was Gory was up high up on Stilton now we're talking about 30 and 40 50
[05:30:12.280 --> 05:30:17.240]  degrees below zero and occasionally I got invited in because I was an inspector
[05:30:17.240 --> 05:30:21.040]  and I got to swim in it and I said what would happen if that window broke while
[05:30:21.040 --> 05:30:24.240]  we were swimming he said don't worry you never know well God bless you sir
[05:30:24.240 --> 05:30:28.400]  appreciate your call interesting points well we have Robert Bob and David left
[05:30:28.400 --> 05:30:33.000]  there okay we're gonna go to three final calls and in this transmission going to
[05:30:33.000 --> 05:30:37.120]  rebroadcast with the information with dr. Bob Bowman and others this is from
[05:30:37.120 --> 05:30:43.000]  defense.gov was also the Army Times Army press conference let me ask you
[05:30:43.000 --> 05:30:46.560]  specifically last week the scare here in Washington and what we might have
[05:30:46.560 --> 05:30:52.280]  learned from how prepared we are to deal with inaudible and it goes on at
[05:30:52.280 --> 05:30:59.680]  Benebryth and he went on into superdobola viruses constructing them how
[05:30:59.680 --> 05:31:04.040]  governments have them he says others are engaging even in eco-type terrorism
[05:31:04.040 --> 05:31:08.480]  whereby they can alter climate shut off earthquakes volcanoes remotely through
[05:31:08.480 --> 05:31:14.560]  the use of electromagnetic waves well what do you think harp is so he
[05:31:14.560 --> 05:31:18.680]  continues the mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off a
[05:31:18.680 --> 05:31:22.240]  chain reaction this is Secretary of Defense Cohen at the time and a hunt
[05:31:22.240 --> 05:31:25.920]  for particular mole which can paralyze an agency for weeks and months or years
[05:31:25.920 --> 05:31:30.840]  even in search the same thing is true about just the false scare of a threat
[05:31:30.840 --> 05:31:36.600]  of using some kind of chemical weapon or biological one there are some reports
[05:31:36.600 --> 05:31:39.920]  for example that some countries have been trying to construct something like
[05:31:39.920 --> 05:31:44.640]  an Ebola virus that's airborne and would be a very dangerous phenomenon meanwhile
[05:31:44.640 --> 05:31:49.320]  the UT professor Pionka talks about how wonderful it'll be to kill everybody to
[05:31:49.320 --> 05:31:53.320]  say the least Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientist in
[05:31:53.320 --> 05:31:56.280]  their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens which would
[05:31:56.280 --> 05:32:00.120]  be ethnic specific you mean Dick Cheney September 20th 2000 promoting race
[05:32:00.120 --> 05:32:05.360]  specific bio weapons awesome American statesman reported on it again in their
[05:32:05.360 --> 05:32:09.080]  laboratory trying to devise you mean South Africa and Israel to devise
[05:32:09.080 --> 05:32:12.720]  certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific wiping out certain
[05:32:12.720 --> 05:32:15.800]  races so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups or races and
[05:32:15.800 --> 05:32:21.120]  others are designing some sort of engineering some sort of insects that
[05:32:21.120 --> 05:32:25.080]  can destroy specific crops like the US government did to Guatemala others are
[05:32:25.080 --> 05:32:28.880]  engaging even an eco type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate set
[05:32:28.880 --> 05:32:32.280]  off earthquakes volcanoes remotely the use of electromagnetic waves and it goes
[05:32:32.280 --> 05:32:39.480]  on okay that's that's defense.gov boys and girls okay this stuff's real it's
[05:32:39.480 --> 05:32:43.880]  going on ignored at your own risk can I say this was a government operation
[05:32:43.880 --> 05:32:49.480]  hey God's harps a lot bigger than the Elsie bubs what the new what the devil
[05:32:49.480 --> 05:32:53.040]  can do through man is bad but let me tell you what God can do is and in God's
[05:32:53.040 --> 05:32:58.160]  plan we can't even grasp and let's get that through our heads right now let's
[05:32:58.160 --> 05:33:03.640]  think about that the sun the moon the manipulation of our weather systems the
[05:33:03.640 --> 05:33:09.400]  magnetic fields the magma the moon doesn't just pull the oceans and and and
[05:33:09.400 --> 05:33:13.320]  and cause literally from satellites they can show the ocean bulging towards the
[05:33:13.320 --> 05:33:18.120]  moon that's what creates the waves it manipulates the magma so we don't know
[05:33:18.120 --> 05:33:21.520]  we just know the government's been lying about this the whole time and there's
[05:33:21.520 --> 05:33:25.560]  clear evidence that they had spent fuel rods outside all these facilities blown
[05:33:25.560 --> 05:33:31.440]  sky high confirmed at mark one and we confirmed it Fukushima one and we're
[05:33:31.440 --> 05:33:34.680]  looking at the mark one Fukushima three where it went straight up in the sky
[05:33:34.680 --> 05:33:38.680]  thousands of feet three thousand feet I don't think that's a mile but let's go
[05:33:38.680 --> 05:33:42.240]  ahead and talk to Robert in Texas Robert you're on the air part of this five hour
[05:33:42.240 --> 05:33:47.080]  33 minutes so far transmission go ahead two quick things first on those spent
[05:33:47.080 --> 05:33:54.360]  fuel rods the I found the Union of Concerned Scientists have a page dedicated
[05:33:54.360 --> 05:33:58.280]  to that it looks like there's a two different kinds of spent fuel rods one
[05:33:58.280 --> 05:34:02.760]  is in the wet storage and then after five years the rods are put into a dry
[05:34:02.760 --> 05:34:07.880]  interim storage cask and there's they're reporting that both were in these
[05:34:07.880 --> 05:34:12.160]  facilities yeah well the casks look like in one of the pictures here it looks
[05:34:12.160 --> 05:34:15.840]  like they might have those casks stored on the roof is that first caller who
[05:34:15.840 --> 05:34:20.400]  reported this it's a do me a favor will you email that right now I'm gonna put
[05:34:20.400 --> 05:34:27.320]  you on hold to my producer and so he can relay that to Paul Watson because that
[05:34:27.320 --> 05:34:30.240]  that's good research for his article he's doing right now I'm gonna put you
[05:34:30.240 --> 05:34:33.320]  on hold in a minute then give him a jaren's email please we're gonna bounce
[05:34:33.320 --> 05:34:37.240]  that over to Watson but go ahead and finish your point Robert okay thanks
[05:34:37.240 --> 05:34:45.000]  I'm I'm quite surprised that we haven't seen the robots in action I mean the
[05:34:45.000 --> 05:34:49.480]  United States is famous for surveillance drones in Japan famous for robots and
[05:34:49.480 --> 05:34:53.800]  why aren't the robots flying and crawling all over this thing giving us
[05:34:53.800 --> 05:34:58.120]  because they don't want us to see what's going on they've got some gun owner at a
[05:34:58.120 --> 05:35:03.240]  farm corner they got robots and the cops on record roast hot dogs and play the
[05:35:03.240 --> 05:35:08.040]  sound of squealing dying animals this is on record and high-five and call another
[05:35:08.040 --> 05:35:14.600]  jurisdiction and burn it down and robots and robots and a box falls off a car
[05:35:14.600 --> 05:35:18.880]  here in Austin they got multi-million dollar robots rolling out hysteria but
[05:35:18.880 --> 05:35:23.160]  there's a real crisis government hightails it sorry go ahead yeah well
[05:35:23.160 --> 05:35:26.860]  that was my point where are they I mean both countries are famous for having
[05:35:26.860 --> 05:35:30.560]  drones and robots and you would think that they would be all over the place
[05:35:30.560 --> 05:35:35.200]  but yeah I'll go ahead and give the concern scientists fuel spent fuel
[05:35:35.200 --> 05:35:38.400]  report to your guy all right thank you let's give him
[05:35:38.400 --> 05:35:43.440]  jaren's little secret mouse email and let's get that bounced over to Watson
[05:35:43.440 --> 05:35:47.880]  right now call Watson make sure he knows it's coming okay thank you and how you
[05:35:47.880 --> 05:35:51.120]  guys can use the comment sections on info wars in prison planet to add links
[05:35:51.120 --> 05:35:55.680]  intel help us I mean we're we're doing a decent job but sometimes I'm floundering
[05:35:55.680 --> 05:36:00.200]  around because there's just too much data Bob in California you were the next
[05:36:00.200 --> 05:36:04.560]  to the last in line go ahead Bob yeah by the way you just went on our cocoa our
[05:36:04.560 --> 05:36:09.200]  local talk station here about two weeks ago and I called the program director and
[05:36:09.200 --> 05:36:13.360]  thanked him because I just amazed that they put you on what station is that it's
[05:36:13.360 --> 05:36:18.960]  kxw talk 960 and I we're up in the high desert up in the Victorville
[05:36:18.960 --> 05:36:24.440]  Apple Valley area we're 3,000 you know feet above 3,000 feet up here but I go
[05:36:24.440 --> 05:36:29.080]  into LA all the time and I can hear this station all the way clear down into
[05:36:29.080 --> 05:36:34.440]  Orange County in the daytime and I found that something's happened most people
[05:36:34.440 --> 05:36:38.560]  aren't new or controlled they just are controlled by the propaganda and more
[05:36:38.560 --> 05:36:41.480]  and more station owners and program directors have seen everything we talk
[05:36:41.480 --> 05:36:45.680]  about come true they care about America and their families we're gaining about
[05:36:45.680 --> 05:36:49.880]  three stations a week right now which for it's just explosive we're gonna cover
[05:36:49.880 --> 05:36:54.120]  of talkers next month and I am the keynote speaker at their yearly event
[05:36:54.120 --> 05:36:58.200]  usually it's rush limbaugh so we believe me sir we have broken through thanks to
[05:36:58.200 --> 05:37:02.440]  you go ahead Bob that's good well I one piece of news of what course you're
[05:37:02.440 --> 05:37:07.520]  talking about those those spent fuel rods being stored yeah they are stored but
[05:37:07.520 --> 05:37:09.880]  they got to be stored in something because they're still radioactive they
[05:37:09.880 --> 05:37:13.040]  got to be stored in something fairly secure but when an explosion like that
[05:37:13.040 --> 05:37:17.400]  happens they throw all the security just goes right out the door that's at the
[05:37:17.400 --> 05:37:21.600]  side of what I called about what I'm worried about is if there is a lot of
[05:37:21.600 --> 05:37:25.000]  radiation gonna be floating over here and I would hope that they've got
[05:37:25.000 --> 05:37:29.880]  air force planes up there collecting air samples between here in Japan and you
[05:37:29.880 --> 05:37:33.880]  know they are but they're not telling us have you know they won't be telling us
[05:37:33.880 --> 05:37:39.480]  but what I'm afraid of Alex is is your worst worst concern is this is the
[05:37:39.480 --> 05:37:44.200]  perfect chance for them to throw in a martial law well notice Obama came out
[05:37:44.200 --> 05:37:48.200]  against the guns yesterday while we're busy watching this yes I know man Martin
[05:37:48.200 --> 05:37:51.560]  here is so here's their perfect chance to roll up the National Guard in martial
[05:37:51.560 --> 05:37:56.200]  law tell everybody to stay indoors nobody go anywhere shut the whole system
[05:37:56.200 --> 05:37:59.880]  down lock the banks up and everything let's not let a good crisis go to waste
[05:37:59.880 --> 05:38:05.440]  anyhow that's so that's what the main thing that I did learn from nuclear
[05:38:05.440 --> 05:38:10.680]  physicists up in the Bay Area who's a dr. Bill Wattenberg he says what happened
[05:38:10.680 --> 05:38:14.600]  over there is the reactor shut down when the earthquake hit but there's
[05:38:14.600 --> 05:38:20.680]  residual heat in those fuel rods and he says when the when the tsunami came in
[05:38:20.680 --> 05:38:24.600]  it killed the diesel generators and that's what they relied on and the
[05:38:24.600 --> 05:38:28.920]  batteries and the batteries great point they killed everything so that's why
[05:38:28.920 --> 05:38:32.320]  this whole thing happened but I'm beginning to I used to think nuclear
[05:38:32.320 --> 05:38:36.080]  power was safe I'm beginning to think like you now you know there's just no
[05:38:36.080 --> 05:38:40.360]  way you can think out think every possibility of what could happen well
[05:38:40.360 --> 05:38:44.560]  more than that Japan I understand why they did it they don't have any coal or
[05:38:44.560 --> 05:38:50.640]  oil they need energy but at the same time I mean Japan if you look at it is on
[05:38:50.640 --> 05:38:55.560]  the great rim of fire great ring of fire in probably they estimate the most
[05:38:55.560 --> 05:39:00.680]  unstable volcanic tectonic area in the world and they've got more reactors per
[05:39:00.680 --> 05:39:05.120]  capita than anybody and they got a bunch of aging ones 40 years old I mean what
[05:39:05.120 --> 05:39:08.040]  did they think was going to happen I appreciate your call Bob final caller
[05:39:08.040 --> 05:39:11.400]  David in Wisconsin thank you for holding her on the air you'll take us out of
[05:39:11.400 --> 05:39:15.120]  stale gunner thank you Alex and I really appreciate your coverage and tell you
[05:39:15.120 --> 05:39:18.560]  when you go off the air all you the only thing you can rely on is drudge he's
[05:39:18.560 --> 05:39:22.960]  good Al Jazeera and BBC because nobody else is covering this in the US media
[05:39:22.960 --> 05:39:26.200]  this is real journalism what you're doing here we really appreciate that I
[05:39:26.200 --> 05:39:29.520]  want to tell you where's our president times like this he's hanging around with
[05:39:29.520 --> 05:39:34.400]  the NCAA today talking about basketball games and let me say this breaking news
[05:39:34.400 --> 05:39:38.640]  just came out on drudge it says US surgeon general encourages west coast
[05:39:38.640 --> 05:39:42.160]  residents to buy iodide tablets it just popped up there Alex while you were
[05:39:42.160 --> 05:39:46.160]  talking about last caller but meanwhile we got to get it to drudge we have the
[05:39:46.160 --> 05:39:50.880]  article up on prison planet info wars where the government is telling clinics
[05:39:50.880 --> 05:39:54.680]  not to give it to people when they ask and how do you like that here it is it's
[05:39:54.680 --> 05:39:58.520]  in the red letters top left column drudge report take a look at it I'll let
[05:39:58.520 --> 05:40:01.720]  you get going and I appreciate your coverage we wish you could stay on
[05:40:01.720 --> 05:40:04.680]  longer and you know give us some more information because you're the source
[05:40:04.680 --> 05:40:08.080]  well my crew wishes we'd stay on longer you guys want to do a couple more hours
[05:40:08.080 --> 05:40:12.400]  I'm joking I mean you really need that what a present what it would a cabinet
[05:40:12.400 --> 05:40:15.760]  that we got in a president that's just hanging around running some kind of an
[05:40:15.760 --> 05:40:20.640]  NCAA meeting it's ridiculous well they do that on purpose to teach you the
[05:40:20.640 --> 05:40:25.840]  reactors blowing up the revolutions the plunging dollar is important basketball
[05:40:25.840 --> 05:40:30.440]  is and the public sees that and then thinks oh well that's good and I'll
[05:40:30.440 --> 05:40:34.280]  say another thing he plays golf I heard what is it now two or three months total
[05:40:34.280 --> 05:40:38.920]  out of his whole presidential tour of office now it's like 60 days well he's
[05:40:38.920 --> 05:40:43.360]  a teleprompter reading frontman so what do you expect David we're out of time
[05:40:43.360 --> 05:40:48.560]  that there's the headline what is that MSNBC or ABC news
[05:40:49.440 --> 05:40:55.440]  yeah it's NBC I recognize the font NBC reporting surgeon general buying iodine
[05:40:55.440 --> 05:41:00.600]  a precaution conflicting messages appear in effort to buy iodine tablets well
[05:41:00.600 --> 05:41:04.520]  we've got it confirmed that the that the government's telling people not to
[05:41:04.520 --> 05:41:08.520]  prescribe it to folks it's not even prescription but but sold out of stores
[05:41:08.520 --> 05:41:14.120]  to go to the clinic say I want it they go no homeland security says no no so they
[05:41:14.120 --> 05:41:17.240]  can't even get their act straight on that that's an important article we've got
[05:41:17.240 --> 05:41:22.240]  up at prison planet calm Watson's big article is going to be coming out in the
[05:41:22.240 --> 05:41:29.560]  next hour dealing with reactor rods spent rods plutonium uranium on top go
[05:41:29.560 --> 05:41:35.880]  ahead and take a cell boys and girls the those spent rods packed and stacked up
[05:41:35.880 --> 05:41:40.080]  on top the intercontainment unit blowing sky high we know they've caught on fire
[05:41:40.080 --> 05:41:43.560]  we know they're stored at some of the others were they in mark one mark three
[05:41:43.560 --> 05:41:48.280]  we know they were in mark one I mean that's the huge news that this happened
[05:41:48.280 --> 05:41:53.680]  this is going on this is unfolding and they're still trying to play it down
[05:41:53.680 --> 05:41:57.440]  when if those reactor rods were on the outside we know they were at some of the
[05:41:57.440 --> 05:42:02.880]  plants were ejected in explosions this is a super huge horrible disaster and
[05:42:02.880 --> 05:42:06.680]  people should be getting the warnings and we should be getting ready here in
[05:42:06.680 --> 05:42:11.720]  the path of the jet stream Lord willing I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. central
[05:42:11.720 --> 05:42:15.680]  standard time live covering this if you want your friends and family to hear an
[05:42:15.680 --> 05:42:19.520]  in-depth full analysis the callers perspectives nuclear physicists and
[05:42:19.520 --> 05:42:23.720]  more tell folks that you know to tomorrow 11 a.m. central and watch us at
[05:42:23.720 --> 05:42:26.840]  info wars dot com and prison planet calm let us developments get that article
[05:42:26.840 --> 05:42:30.560]  Watson's got coming out the next hour at prison planet info wars out to
[05:42:30.560 --> 05:42:34.920]  everybody will be red linked on info wars get it out to everybody will be on
[05:42:34.920 --> 05:42:39.320]  prison planet first great job to the crew in the five hour 42 minute
