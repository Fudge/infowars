[00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.271]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:08.051]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:09.832]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:11.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:17.134]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:21.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:29.480]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:39.793]  It is very dire times right now for Japan and the rest of the world as the government of Japan and the media has now stopped denying the magnitude of the
[00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:43.426]  We're good to go.
[00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.612]  And it certainly is a ill-omened time that we are in right now.
[00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:13.935]  It is Tuesday, March 15th, 2011.
[00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.296]  We are live.
[00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:25.540]  And we have Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, three degrees in nuclear physics, former head of the Star Wars program, joining us coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.963]  Then we have blogger and syndicated talk show host Owen J.J.
[00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:46.048]  Stone, who's here for South by Southwest, joining us the last 30 minutes to talk about the TSA sticking their hands down his pants and all the new information that's come out with the federal takeover known as the TSA.
[00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:52.131]  Also, the other huge news, the White House had signaled several months ago they were going to roll out an anti-gun agenda.
[00:01:53.499 --> 00:02:05.765]  They have indeed done that, dealing with gun registration and the expanded tracking of firearms and the restriction of how many firearms you can purchase by Executive Fiat, the Justice Department.
[00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:21.160]  In the last five months, has been ordering outside of law in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California, ordering gun dealers to call them when someone buys a semi-automatic firearm.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.282]  Obama is now trying to push to make that law.
[00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:27.884]  Headline, Obama starts pushing gun control.
[00:02:27.884 --> 00:02:36.050]  Another headline, Obama pins op-ed calling for better gun sale background checks, blaming it all on Mexico.
[00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:41.248]  And we need to turn our eyes now to what came out about three weeks ago that the ATF
[00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:52.150]  has been caught on record shipping firearms into Mexico to then trace them back to the United States.
[00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.351]  That's even CBS News.
[00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.834]  In fact, I never played that news clip from two weeks ago.
[00:02:55.834 --> 00:03:03.621]  Please dig that CBS up and please print me all the old articles dealing with the ATF caught shipping guns into Mexico.
[00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:06.324]  This is a false flag attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:06.324 --> 00:03:07.024]  Now that said,
[00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:26.716]  That's coming up later in the third hour, but we can't let the nuclear meltdown disaster be an overall distraction from what's happening to the economy, what's happening in North Africa, the Middle East, what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with the domestic police state, what's happening in our economy.
[00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:28.717]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:31.699]  When we come back from break, I'm going to try to compose myself.
[00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.000]  I got a little wild yesterday.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.885]  Because there was a lot of media denial and government denial about what was unfolding.
[00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:46.734]  When I saw Fukushima 1 blow up on Saturday, there was little doubt in my mind that it was going to expose the containment vessel.
[00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.497]  I've studied the designs of these reactors.
[00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.599]  They're online, they're public.
[00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.562]  They're designed to take a 7.0 direct hit, not a 9.1 direct hit as they took.
[00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.185]  Then, yesterday morning, when Fukushima No.
[00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:12.059]  3, a Mark 1 plutonium-driven reactor, blew thousands of feet in the air in seconds, I said, there's no way that that didn't damage the containment vessel.
[00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.600]  And, of course, they're now announcing it did.
[00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:21.307]  Another reactor at Fukushima, and I disagree with Dr. Bowman yesterday when he said, well, three of the reactors were successfully shut down.
[00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:31.035]  I said, explosions of this magnitude, just looking at it, it's so explosive, how fast that explosion went up, upwards of 3,000 feet in seconds.
[00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:33.517]  That shows incredible power.
[00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:42.784]  You don't need to be a demolitions expert to know that, though I've interviewed so many and studied it so much, I have a layman's understanding of it, that that would damage the surrounding reactors.
[00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:43.344]  Number four.
[00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:47.908]  Which is a shutdown reactor has now been exposed.
[00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:57.234]  Multiple meltdowns of three of the reactors have occurred and they're now having to admit that more deadly types of radiation are leaking and blowing directly towards Tokyo.
[00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:59.015]  We'll break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:59.015 --> 00:04:59.475]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.634]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:08.878]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:13.683]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:20.070]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.313]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:23.153]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:23.653]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.653 --> 00:05:24.334]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:25.614]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:27.855]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:49.029]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:58.139]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:04.745]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:05.645]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:09.068]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:09.928]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:14.831]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:15.572]  It's true.
[00:06:15.572 --> 00:06:20.455]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:21.275]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:24.858]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.858 --> 00:06:28.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.561]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:32.323]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:36.007]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:36.788]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:40.931]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:45.696]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:57.147]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:57.147 --> 00:07:00.350]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:08.138 --> 00:07:10.699]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:16.082]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:19.123]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:21.445]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:27.688]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:31.069]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:36.572]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:36.852 --> 00:07:38.473]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:38.473 --> 00:07:39.774]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:42.456]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:46.679]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:51.302]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:07:51.302 --> 00:07:53.903]  That's endofamerica3.com.

[00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:05.796]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.796 --> 00:08:08.077]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.077 --> 00:08:16.801]  It is the Ides of March.
[00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:21.583]  It is the 15th day of March, 2011 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:26.265]  Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, will be joining us.
[00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:28.106]  Three degrees in nuclear physics.
[00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:34.734]  We'll be joining us to give us expert analysis coming up the middle of the next hour today.
[00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:44.988]  We're working on getting some other nuclear physicists on the broadcast to give us different perspectives as well today and tomorrow right through into the weekend.
[00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:56.033]  And as things continue to unfold, we may even do special nighttime transmissions that are streamed at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:08:56.033 --> 00:09:03.777]  We'll be posting those announcements at InfoWars.com and sending them over the Genesis satellites if stations want to carry the special reports.
[00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:05.077]  I just want to put that out there.
[00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:10.540]  We're not sure if we're going to do them yet, but the winds gyrate over Japan from the
[00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:12.249]  I don't know.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.721]  Colorado turning into Oklahoma.
[00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:46.504]  There is strontium, there is cesium, there is radioactive iodine being released in massive levels.
[00:09:46.504 --> 00:09:47.344]  That's now confirmed.
[00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:49.965]  We're gonna go over all the mainstream media reports.
[00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:56.408]  The plutonium-uranium-based Mark I, as you know, blew up spectacularly yesterday.
[00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:59.609]  No doubt that damaged, in my mind, the containment vessel.
[00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:01.730]  I mean, the explosion was so horrific.
[00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:09.297]  And moved so quickly that gives you an idea of the measurement of the blast rate pounds per square inch.
[00:10:09.297 --> 00:10:15.883]  And we're also going to get some demolition experts on separately who've been looking at that blast.
[00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:22.309]  But studying Oklahoma City, studying 9-11 with the experts over the years, we've gained some knowledge of this.
[00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:26.632]  And now it is confirmed that the blast at Fukushima 3 was so big
[00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:33.530]  That it damaged the shutdown reactor, but it's got the rods in there at Fukushima 4.
[00:10:35.342 --> 00:10:37.983]  A uranium reactor.
[00:10:37.983 --> 00:10:39.963]  And it has now begun to melt down.
[00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:47.245]  And there's two other reactors separate from the Fukushima 6 nuke reactors that are also in the process of melting down.
[00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:52.526]  And the Japanese government has had a big backlash from the population saying, stop lying.
[00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:56.347]  And so now they're talking about this being an absolute disaster.
[00:10:56.347 --> 00:11:00.068]  We pray that the uranium and plutonium does not get out.
[00:11:00.068 --> 00:11:04.529]  But now they're kind of easing the news out to the people that, uh-oh, we think
[00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:11.676]  One or more of the reactor containment systems at four and three may be exposed.
[00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:18.843]  Ladies and gentlemen, if plutonium gets out of there, it makes uranium look like mother's milk.
[00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:25.630]  It is so deadly, one microscopic micron of it in your lungs, you are deader than a hammer.
[00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:29.997]  We have got to pray for the people of Japan.
[00:11:29.997 --> 00:11:38.166]  And the winds have now turned to the south and are driving it into Tokyo and the radiation detectors are going off.
[00:11:39.056 --> 00:11:43.657]  Let me just read to you some of the headlines here, my friends.
[00:11:43.657 --> 00:12:01.781]  And it's unfortunate to be right again, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and to be ridiculed, but I've studied other nuclear disasters in depth because there is a reactor facility in Austin, an experimental reactor, a large reactor and a smaller experimental reactor at the J.J.
[00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.681]  Pickle Research Facility in North Austin.
[00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:07.122]  And if I'm gonna live around one of these things, I wanna know about it.
[00:12:07.882 --> 00:12:14.643]  And the first thing they pick up is cesium and strontium and radioactive iodide.
[00:12:14.643 --> 00:12:17.844]  And those are all spewing out of Fukushima.
[00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:26.045]  And they don't even know specifically which one because they have evacuated the 500 workers from the plant.
[00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.305]  There's only 50 there.
[00:12:27.305 --> 00:12:29.386]  It's a death sentence.
[00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:35.267]  And now the Japanese Prime Minister has ordered
[00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:42.325]  The workers back in to try to stave off the emergency as Gerald Salente has been proven right yet again.
[00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:45.725]  He said, come on, you're seeing giant explosions all over the place.
[00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:48.226]  Two more explosions last night.
[00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.607]  First they said one, now they're saying two.
[00:12:50.607 --> 00:12:53.887]  But it happened in the night, so there's not good video of it.
[00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:57.348]  So we don't really know the magnitude of the situation.
[00:12:57.348 --> 00:13:00.169]  And Gerald pointed out, he said, there's no way people are going to stay in there.
[00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:09.638]  Even though the Japanese are known for being very valiant and stoic and having a lot of courage, and you have to commend them for absolutely no known looting going on.
[00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:13.621]  Very genteel, cultured, civilized people.
[00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:17.544]  Can you imagine watching the footage of Black Friday?
[00:13:17.544 --> 00:13:27.811]  Everybody goes out to shop when they have the tax-free day, with the riots and people being trampled to death, and the rioting when people don't get their welfare checks on time.
[00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:32.773]  43 million Americans on food stamps in the wonders of globalism.
[00:13:32.773 --> 00:13:36.855]  Can you imagine a disaster like this in the U.S., how people would be behaving?
[00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:39.716]  I will guarantee you it would not be like the Japanese.
[00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:45.338]  I'm not trying to bash America, but we have turned into a bunch of decadent slobs on average.
[00:13:45.338 --> 00:13:48.479]  And we should really learn from the Japanese in the way they're handling this.
[00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:50.720]  We have to commend them.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.122]  Japan atom plant main vessel
[00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.847]  May be damaged.
[00:13:57.847 --> 00:14:08.095]  IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, an explosion on Monday at Japan's disaster-hit nuclear plant may have damaged the primary containment vessel of one reactor unit.
[00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:09.617]  Now the reporting could be two.
[00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:18.103]  The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the explosion at Fukushima Daiichi Unit 2
[00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:22.425]  May have affected the integrity of its primary containment vessel.
[00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:29.226]  They're also reporting four, which was shut down, is now experiencing meltdown because of the explosions around it.
[00:14:29.226 --> 00:14:30.647]  I mean, what do you think's gonna happen?
[00:14:30.647 --> 00:14:37.448]  The IAEA said primary containment vessels unit one and three appeared intact despite explosions there.
[00:14:37.448 --> 00:14:40.489]  It said units at the Fukushima and
[00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:51.265]  Okay, so we have that report there.
[00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:53.847]  Here's another one, another Reuters report.
[00:14:53.847 --> 00:15:02.752]  And I've got other reports here saying they believe that it has been partially unsealed.
[00:15:02.752 --> 00:15:04.033]  But again, that is not confirmed.
[00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.034]  Let's hope and pray that's not the case.
[00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:07.655]  But you've seen the explosions.
[00:15:07.655 --> 00:15:08.496]  And there's been more now.
[00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:20.767]  Japan's Nuclear Safety Agency said it was unsure if a fresh explosion at its quake-stricken nuclear power plant on Tuesday has damaged one of the reactor containment vessels.
[00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:23.349]  The vessel of the Fukushima Complex No.
[00:15:23.349 --> 00:15:33.439]  2 reactor contains fuel rods in danger of melting down, a development that experts say could cause a major radiation leak if the containment vessel's thick vessel walls were breached.
[00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.731]  And again, I've been watching and listening to the news.
[00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:52.996]  There's a lot more dire statements being made, again, about one, three, two, and four, including a containment vessel at four, but they're not sure as of right now.
[00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:55.557]  Here are some of the other news reports.
[00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:57.037]  In order, we're gonna go through these.
[00:15:57.037 --> 00:15:59.138]  London Telegraph, Japan crisis.
[00:15:59.138 --> 00:16:02.299]  Third explosion raises specter of nuclear nightmare.
[00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:05.809]  Similar to headlines we wrote last night ahead of this.
[00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:07.576]  The new explosion at Fukushima plant.
[00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:14.077]  As engineers fought to prevent a meltdown in the second-worst nuclear accident in history.
[00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:19.321]  They're now saying it is the second-worst after Chernobyl, and if it continues to unfold, it'll be far worse than Chernobyl.
[00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:26.466]  A huge explosion hit another reactor at the earthquake-damaged, really the tsunami-damaged, Japanese nuclear power plant early Tuesday.
[00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:28.348]  So, it's just ongoing.
[00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:31.330]  The third blast since Saturday, the plant operator said.
[00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.192]  There was a huge explosion between 6 a.m., 2100 Greenwich Mean Time,
[00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:41.161]  And again, I have another report here saying that the explosions from other reactors may have damaged number four.
[00:16:51.411 --> 00:17:01.355]  The government also reported apparent damage to part of the container shielding the same reactor at Fukushima, 250 kilometers or 155 miles northeast of Tokyo.
[00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:08.277]  And previously the wind was going basically out to sea towards the United States, to the east.
[00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:12.639]  Now it is changed to the south.
[00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:24.050]  Blowing it down over Tokyo, and there are reports that the radiation is climbing there, though they're saying that it's safe if you only have brief exposure.
[00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.411]  Whatever that means.
[00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:30.737]  Kind of like they said the air was safe to breathe on 9-11, when they knew it was deadly filled with asbestos.
[00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:33.019]  Or kind of like they told the atomic soldiers it was safe.
[00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:44.899]  But they're saying around the plant, the radiation levels are climbing off the charts, and they're now picking up strontium, higher levels of cesium, and radioactive iodine.
[00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:49.609]  This is very serious.
[00:17:49.609 --> 00:17:54.074]  Continuing, here is another headline out of Swiss Info.
[00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.718]  Japan braces for potential radiation catastrophe.
[00:17:57.718 --> 00:18:07.067]  Japan faced a potential catastrophe on Tuesday after quake-crippled nuclear power plant exploded and sent low levels of radiation floating towards Tokyo.
[00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:12.857]  Prompting some people to flee the capital as others to stock up on essential supplies.
[00:18:12.857 --> 00:18:16.181]  They've also told people to stay indoors and to try to seal their windows.
[00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.883]  That's actually good advice.
[00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:27.834]  Prime Minister urged people within 30 kilometers of the facility, a population of 140,000, to remain indoors amid the world's most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986.
[00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:33.242]  And it continues with the economic impact.
[00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:38.644]  Tokyo shares in day down 11, sending the U.S.
[00:18:38.644 --> 00:18:41.665]  stock market and other major stock markets down as well.
[00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:46.306]  Continuing, Japan nuke plant may spray reactor by helicopter.
[00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:51.988]  They're now going to the Chernobyl model, trying to cover up the containment
[00:18:52.788 --> 00:19:04.475]  Ponds that are used to recycle the radiation, the strontium, the cesium, the radioactive iodine and other nasty derivatives of the process.
[00:19:04.475 --> 00:19:13.020]  But they're saying the steam that's getting out is delivering the radioactive particles into the atmosphere and again, blowing south towards Tokyo.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.422]  So they're gonna try to go in now and dump different things on top of the different reactors.
[00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.924]  Very brave people that are going in via helicopter.
[00:19:19.924 --> 00:19:21.405]  Tokyo Electric Power says,
[00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:26.788]  It may use helicopters because of the risk of radiation contamination from approaching the pool directly.
[00:19:26.788 --> 00:19:28.990]  Air drops may also be more effective.
[00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.793]  A Japanese official says the pool might be boiling, raising the risk of water...
[00:19:33.783 --> 00:19:34.243]  I don't know.
[00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:02.928]  This is an urgent message.
[00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:05.470]  Urgent if you care about feeding your family.
[00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.155]  S-510 has passed through Congress and will make the sale of heirloom seeds difficult.
[00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:15.981]  Prices of non-GMO seeds are skyrocketing and may be hard to afford in the future, if you can even find them.
[00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:22.528]  As the economy continues to decline, this will make the heirloom seeds worth their weight in gold and one of the best barter tools available.
[00:20:22.768 --> 00:20:27.773]  When food supplies eventually run out, your solution is to grow your own food and barter tool.
[00:20:27.773 --> 00:20:35.280]  Now for a short time, GetSeeds.net offers 100 packets of heirloom non-GMO vegetable seeds for only $59.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.744]  Pay with 2 ounces of pure silver or just $59.
[00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:41.586]  The best price on the net for high quality seeds.
[00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:47.192]  Our GetSeeds.net seeds are open pollinated vegetable seeds sealed in a mylar bag for long term storage.
[00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:48.713]  Bulk pricing available.
[00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:56.356]  So get seeds while you still can at GetSeeds.net or call toll free 877-341-4769.
[00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:57.517]  That's 877-341-4769.
[00:20:57.517 --> 00:21:02.760]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.081]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:08.282]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.282 --> 00:21:13.045]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:17.907]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.907 --> 00:21:20.348]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:23.129]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:26.051]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:33.654]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:39.283]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.283 --> 00:21:42.225]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:45.907]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:46.988]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.988 --> 00:21:48.309]  You're everyone else.

[00:21:59.306 --> 00:22:00.087]  Gold.
[00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:01.608]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:01.608 --> 00:22:07.913]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:07.913 --> 00:22:12.076]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:12.076 --> 00:22:14.017]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:14.017 --> 00:22:16.459]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:23.985]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:24.785]  We're good to go.
[00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:54.321]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:29.464]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:34.027]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:34.027 --> 00:23:39.851]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:43.473]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:43.473 --> 00:23:46.195]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:51.258]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:51.258 --> 00:23:51.559]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:58.063 --> 00:23:58.159]  Yeah.
[00:24:06.547 --> 00:24:07.388]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:07.388 --> 00:24:19.056]  Continual coverage of the tsunami earthquake ravaged Japan and all the problems they're having at the Fukushima 6th Nuke Reactor Complex, including the Mark 1 No.
[00:24:19.056 --> 00:24:22.518]  3 reactor that blew sky-high yesterday.
[00:24:22.518 --> 00:24:26.561]  More explosions at Reactor 2 overnight.
[00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:30.984]  Paul Joseph Watson has a new article just out at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:30.984 --> 00:24:31.805]  Panic buying
[00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:38.167]  Stocks of potassium iodine exhausted in the United States.
[00:24:38.167 --> 00:24:42.749]  And we're getting also reports that FEMA has been in stores buying it up.
[00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:45.130]  Those are coming in from all over the country.
[00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:50.953]  And when you get those confirmed reports of shop owners and others witnessing it, you can bet it's happening.
[00:24:50.953 --> 00:24:59.856]  If any shop owners want to go on record, though, and send us emails to put in a story about where you work, what you witnessed, what happened, we certainly like to further document that.
[00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.577]  But this article
[00:25:01.357 --> 00:25:05.620]  Deals with the fact that all over the country, including here in Austin, we've confirmed it.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:18.148]  Potassium iodate tablets, iodine tablets, the health food type from kelp, dulse, and alfalfa, all sold out.
[00:25:19.128 --> 00:25:23.771]  Health websites sold out, readers struggle to find radiation-fighting pills anywhere.
[00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:35.900]  We're getting numerous reports from readers that Stoxa Potassium Iodine, which is used to prevent and protect the body against the effects of nuclear fallout, are completely sold out across the United States.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.962]  In fact, we'll put this PrisonPlanet.com article on screen for viewers.
[00:25:39.682 --> 00:25:42.203]  Checks of health supplement websites in the U.S.
[00:25:42.203 --> 00:25:52.607]  also confirm that stocks are completely exhausted with the threat of radioactive particles from the stricken Fukushima nuclear complex drifting towards the United States and prevailing easterly winds.
[00:25:52.607 --> 00:26:02.891]  Many Americans are attempting to protect themselves by acquiring potassium iodate, which protects the thyroid gland from radiation and cancer caused by radioactive iodine.
[00:26:02.891 --> 00:26:05.972]  You can see a photo screenshot of
[00:26:07.252 --> 00:26:26.125]  One of the packages iosat indications thyroid blocking in a radiation emergency only potassium iodine tablets USP 130 milligrams so we're going to be going over that more in the broadcast today.
[00:26:27.006 --> 00:26:27.206]  Yes.
[00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:53.375]  Not stockpile any further supplies of potassium iodide, which has only increased demand for Americans who are struggling to find it anywhere.
[00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:56.418]  The federal government has never purchased enough to meet the standard.
[00:26:56.418 --> 00:27:02.803]  There is currently only enough of the medication available for populations living within 10 miles of nuclear reactors in the United States, according to U.S.
[00:27:02.803 --> 00:27:10.368]  officials, and an amount Alan Morris, president of Ambex, Inc., slams as being completely insufficient.
[00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:30.307]  Morris points out the fact that fallout from the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which was spread all around the northern hemisphere, led to over a million deaths because of radiation poisoning, according to some estimates, causing thyroid cancer in children living in surrounding countries.
[00:27:30.307 --> 00:27:31.548]  It's just been devastating.
[00:27:31.548 --> 00:27:32.829]  That's a conservative estimate in the last...
[00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.471]  Last few decades have died from that.
[00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:38.133]  By the way, I want to get Ben Fuchs, the pharmacist, to pop in briefly.
[00:27:53.394 --> 00:28:19.147]  If you can, at the start of the next hour, Jaren, if you can get a hold of him, just for about five minutes, because I've gotten calls saying, well, look, the radioactive iodine, if it is coming this way, some pharmacists or some people at health food stores, we're just getting calls about this, we haven't confirmed it, are saying, look, the regular potassium iodine drops for thyroid health are in such low doses that it's not gonna help you.
[00:28:20.087 --> 00:28:23.128]  But that's not what Ben Fuchs was saying when he was on the show.
[00:28:23.128 --> 00:28:43.254]  So guys, let's just try to get him on, even if it has to be later in this hour, but preferably next hour, to specifically talk about the different doses that are in the over-the-counter kelp pills and also the iodine drops that are labeled for human consumption.
[00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:47.075]  So we'll continue to look at that as it unfolds.
[00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:52.199]  The article continues with a few emails that Paul Watson received.
[00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:57.163]  Quote, I went to Whole Foods Market in Arlington, Texas last night to get a bottle of kelp.
[00:28:57.163 --> 00:29:02.928]  They were out, totally out of potassium iodide.
[00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:06.452]  They would not get a shipment of any by this Friday.
[00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:12.007]  Are people in this area more aware of what's going on in Japan than people in Austin?
[00:29:12.007 --> 00:29:12.588]  I hope so.
[00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:13.950]  Respectfully, Doug.
[00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.054]  Doug, I've been to the store and they're sold out.
[00:29:17.054 --> 00:29:17.835]  Just going to check.
[00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:20.078]  My wife already bought a bunch more.
[00:29:20.078 --> 00:29:23.884]  Tim Frugier yesterday went and bought the last bottle.
[00:29:24.364 --> 00:29:32.569]  At New Flower, which is a health food store, it was sold out at Central Market, so yes sir, this is happening all over the country, and certainly here in Austin.
[00:29:32.569 --> 00:29:37.031]  And Fox News and CNN are reporting that they're sold out nationwide as well.
[00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:47.137]  But we'll look at alternative ways to protect your thyroid from the radioactive iodine, one of the biggest threats, and that is the type of radiation that is being released.
[00:29:47.137 --> 00:29:49.479]  More on what's happening in Japan in your phone call straight ahead.
[00:29:50.782 --> 00:29:54.733]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:57.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:08.689]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:30:08.689 --> 00:30:11.352]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:20.398]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:30:20.398 --> 00:30:26.923]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:30:29.025 --> 00:30:29.346]  I think so.
[00:30:44.915 --> 00:30:45.636]  I think so.
[00:31:04.268 --> 00:31:05.528]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.528 --> 00:31:09.191]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:11.693]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.693 --> 00:31:17.557]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:31:17.557 --> 00:31:23.822]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.222 --> 00:31:30.207]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.207 --> 00:31:34.370]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.674]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.674 --> 00:31:44.619]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.619 --> 00:31:48.182]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.182 --> 00:31:50.163]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.163 --> 00:31:50.604]  It's here.

[00:32:29.452 --> 00:32:34.053]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:32:34.053 --> 00:32:37.894]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:32:37.894 --> 00:32:39.114]  Others don't.
[00:32:39.114 --> 00:32:41.255]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.255 --> 00:32:43.035]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:32:55.258 --> 00:32:57.619]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:58.119]  Others don't.
[00:33:11.026 --> 00:33:30.014]  We're gonna open the phones up for your perspective on what's happening in the world, predominantly in Japan.
[00:33:30.014 --> 00:33:35.236]  It's clear now that there has been a cover-up in the last four days in Japan.
[00:33:36.243 --> 00:33:52.917]  That they knew that the severity of the radiation that's been released was worse than what they said, that the crisis at the plants were far worse than what they'd said, that the explosions Saturday, Monday and today were far more devastating than they had first reported.
[00:33:52.917 --> 00:33:54.258]  They're now beginning to
[00:33:56.135 --> 00:34:11.643]  Ease the news out to the public that one or more containment vessels with the really deadly radiation, not just the byproducts of it, the strontium, the cesium, the radioactive iodine, that's bad enough, but the plutonium or uranium
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.621]  Could be getting out.
[00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:22.227]  Let's not forget that that is a MOX reactor, number three, that blew up spectacularly yesterday and does have plutonium in it.
[00:34:22.227 --> 00:34:26.790]  7% plutonium, 93% uranium.
[00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:32.114]  It just doesn't get any more dangerous than that.
[00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:33.695]  I want to open the phones up.
[00:34:33.695 --> 00:34:35.136]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:35.176]  800-259-9231.
[00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:42.290]  I think?
[00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:08.422]  In Bahrain, the country of Bahrain that borders them because of major rioting, protesting, insurrection happening there against that tyranny.
[00:35:08.422 --> 00:35:11.763]  Saudi Arabian troops sent to Bahrain as protests escalate.
[00:35:11.763 --> 00:35:15.384]  Are we going to hear Hillary Clinton call for airstrikes on Saudi Arabia?
[00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:20.745]  Because after all, I mean, if you take over in Egypt, you're a patriot.
[00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:28.431]  If you try to take over in Libya, you're a patriot, well then why isn't it okay to overthrow Bahrain or Saudi Arabia?
[00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:29.772]  Hmm?
[00:35:29.772 --> 00:35:33.415]  I mean, Saudi Arabia is certainly a tyranny.
[00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:36.137]  Ah, but it's a globalist tyranny.
[00:35:36.137 --> 00:35:48.167]  More than 1,000 Saudi Arabian troops have been deployed to Bahrain following fresh protest over the weekend that pitted protesters from the tiny Gulf monarchy Shia majority against riot police.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.923]  And it continues on that front.
[00:35:52.923 --> 00:35:59.031]  Israeli Navy interceptors, Egypt-bound, ship with arms.
[00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:03.396]  And so they've intercepted, Israeli Navy has intercepted Egypt-bound ship with arms.
[00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:07.641]  We're going to be going over some more of those reports, but
[00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:09.211]  Here is
[00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:34.782]  Uh, that surround them that recycle the radioactive water and that are supposed to stay contained within the facility.
[00:36:34.782 --> 00:36:47.487]  Now those are blown wide open and now basically boiling out as steam into the atmosphere with the wind shifting from going across Japan from China towards the United States.
[00:36:47.487 --> 00:36:55.790]  They've now shifted southerly towards Tokyo and the tens of millions of inhabitants to the south.
[00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.491]  So very serious situation on that front.
[00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:02.893]  Here is the headline out of the Associated Press.
[00:37:02.893 --> 00:37:08.755]  If you doubt us, the denial is now evaporating.
[00:37:08.755 --> 00:37:09.755]  Pun intended.
[00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:14.757]  Radiation level soars after Japan nuke plant fire.
[00:37:14.757 --> 00:37:18.059]  Dangerous levels of radiation leaked from a crippled nuclear plant.
[00:37:19.192 --> 00:37:24.438]  Fire's almost worse than an explosion because it'll just heat up those containment facilities and roast them.
[00:37:24.438 --> 00:37:38.574]  Dangerous levels of radiation leaking from a crippled nuclear plant forced Japan to order 140,000 people to seal themselves indoors today after an explosion and a fire dramatically escalated the crisis spawned by the deadly tsunami.
[00:37:39.395 --> 00:37:53.920]  In a nationally televised statement, the Prime Minister, Kan, said radiation had spread from the four stricken reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant along Japan's northeastern coast.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:04.403]  The region was shattered on Friday's 9.0, some say 8.9, 9.0, 9.1 magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami that is believed to have killed more than 10,000 people.
[00:38:06.004 --> 00:38:10.668]  plunged millions into misery and pummeled the world's third largest economy.
[00:38:10.668 --> 00:38:14.131]  Yeah, the stock market dropped 11 points today at closing.
[00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:33.826]  Japanese officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the reactor fire was in a fuel storage pond filled with radioactive isotopes, I would add, strontium, cesium, and of course radioactive iodine, and undoubtedly with these explosions I would guess uranium and plutonium, but that hasn't been confirmed yet.
[00:38:33.826 --> 00:38:34.367]  An area
[00:38:35.933 --> 00:38:36.674]  We're good to go.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.581]  Telling the Atomic Energy Agency that.
[00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:09.283]  Long after the fire was extinguished, a Japanese official said the pool might still be cooling, though the report levels of radiation had dropped dramatically by the end of the day.
[00:39:09.283 --> 00:39:11.904]  So a big off-gassing, but they claim it's dropping.
[00:39:11.904 --> 00:39:15.625]  And we hope that's the truth, but with their history of lying, who knows what the truth is.
[00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:19.246]  And more explosions, obviously, today, and they're talking about more explosions to come.
[00:39:20.326 --> 00:39:24.268]  Uh, including at reactors that have been shut down because of fires.
[00:39:24.268 --> 00:39:26.729]  If the water boils, it could evaporate, exposing the rods.
[00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:33.772]  The fuel rods are encased in safety containers meant to prevent them from resuming nuclear reactions, nuclear officials said.
[00:39:33.772 --> 00:39:38.494]  But they acknowledged that there could be and could have been damage to the containers.
[00:39:38.494 --> 00:39:44.217]  They also confirmed the walls of the storage pool building were damaged.
[00:39:44.217 --> 00:39:46.238]  Well, what do you think's going to happen in those giant explosions?
[00:39:47.757 --> 00:39:52.240]  Experts note that much of the leaking radiation was apparently in steam from boiling water.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.081]  That's what happened to Chernobyl.
[00:39:54.081 --> 00:39:58.784]  It has not been emitted directly by the fuel rods, which could be far more virulent, they said.
[00:39:58.784 --> 00:40:01.346]  Yeah, uranium and plutonium.
[00:40:01.346 --> 00:40:07.890]  It's not good, but I don't think it's a disaster, said Steve Crossy, an Australian-based radiation physicist.
[00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:08.790]  Really?
[00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.473]  When you have a flood and a few hundred people die, they call it a disaster.
[00:40:12.473 --> 00:40:14.594]  But they're saying it's not a disaster.
[00:40:14.594 --> 00:40:15.775]  Not a disaster, okay.
[00:40:17.162 --> 00:40:21.265]  Well, I'd hate to see a disaster if this isn't a disaster.
[00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:26.188]  Millions of people displaced.
[00:40:26.188 --> 00:40:29.211]  Radiation descending down over Tokyo.
[00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:31.452]  Not a disaster.
[00:40:31.452 --> 00:40:35.775]  Japanese Prime Minister attempts to calm nation as massive radiation spreads.
[00:40:35.775 --> 00:40:40.739]  CurtNemoInfoWars.com Here's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:44.922]  Radioactive winds head towards Tokyo as some flee capital.
[00:40:49.053 --> 00:40:50.714]  Here's Business Insider.
[00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:56.636]  Iodine pills fly off shelves in Hawaii as radiation fears spread across globe.
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:41:05.781]  I did a YouTube video last night, a key report saying we don't know the truth about Japan's nuclear disaster and go over the history of governments lying about previous nuclear disasters.
[00:41:05.781 --> 00:41:11.323]  Very important video for folks out there that have been emailing me, the minority, but saying, why are you upset?
[00:41:11.323 --> 00:41:12.424]  Why are you concerned?
[00:41:12.424 --> 00:41:13.784]  I heard that Friday.
[00:41:13.784 --> 00:41:14.585]  I heard that Saturday.
[00:41:14.585 --> 00:41:15.325]  I heard it Sunday.
[00:41:15.325 --> 00:41:16.486]  I heard it Monday.
[00:41:16.486 --> 00:41:17.126]  I'm hearing it today.
[00:41:18.356 --> 00:41:21.357]  Look, you told me that the rods were never exposed.
[00:41:21.357 --> 00:41:24.639]  They now admitted that they had been exposed at least two of the six.
[00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:27.840]  You said don't worry about the explosions or that it wasn't going to explode.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.383]  You said that there had been no meltdown when I put an article out Saturday morning breaking it down.
[00:41:33.383 --> 00:41:34.503]  And now it's all confirmed.
[00:41:34.503 --> 00:41:39.225]  We've been right because we know the history of reactor crises.
[00:41:39.225 --> 00:41:41.186]  We know the history of governments lying.
[00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.147]  Okay?
[00:41:42.147 --> 00:41:44.548]  And that's my issue.
[00:41:44.548 --> 00:41:46.989]  If uranium and plutonium gets released,
[00:41:48.393 --> 00:41:59.020]  You cannot trust the Japanese government or the Atomic Energy Agency or the IAEA to tell you what's really going on.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:07.205]  We began to talk about prevailing winds Friday when it was confirmed that cesium and other radioactive derivatives were being released that will
[00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:08.935]  We're good to go.
[00:42:24.178 --> 00:42:28.843]  And we posted graphs of it and people are commenting under it going, I don't understand this.
[00:42:28.843 --> 00:42:33.048]  I don't understand these maps, these, these screenshots of satellites.
[00:42:33.048 --> 00:42:33.529]  I don't understand.
[00:42:33.529 --> 00:42:34.109]  Well, okay.
[00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:39.275]  You got a jet stream going across Japan, across the Northern Pacific to North America.
[00:42:39.275 --> 00:42:44.862]  And if you look at the maps, they have little meteorologist arrows showing you the flow of the wind.
[00:42:46.323 --> 00:42:48.784]  I mean, what's not to get, okay?
[00:42:48.784 --> 00:42:52.305]  I mean, sometimes I really wonder about some people.
[00:42:52.305 --> 00:42:55.465]  I mean, do they have any idea how anything works?
[00:42:55.465 --> 00:42:57.466]  I'm not even that smart!
[00:42:57.466 --> 00:43:03.247]  And I can look at a chart, I can look at a satellite photo with overlays on it.
[00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:12.530]  I mean, when you watch the weatherman, and they say, we got a cold front coming into Texas, or wherever your state is, and it shows the arrows pointing the way the weather front's coming in, I mean, you don't understand that?
[00:43:13.917 --> 00:43:19.179]  Or are there people posting comments with disinformation on purpose?
[00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:20.379]  I mean, are they paid to do this?
[00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:29.062]  We know the government has hired hundreds of thousands of people in the last decade to run around and engage in disinformation on the internet, but come on.
[00:43:29.062 --> 00:43:38.385]  I mentioned this three weeks ago when it first broke, and I get emails constantly and comments saying it isn't true, so I'm gonna ask Paul Watson
[00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:41.457]  Or Steve Watson, or Kurt Nemo.
[00:43:41.457 --> 00:43:42.138]  You can all do it.
[00:43:42.138 --> 00:43:43.458]  Everybody should write on this.
[00:43:43.458 --> 00:43:44.898]  Aaron Dykes, my writers.
[00:43:44.898 --> 00:44:01.702]  And I'm asking everybody else who has news websites to go to the history of this and to look at a whole other issue while we're busy worrying about the financial meltdown, the war in the Middle East, and the destabilization, and the tsunami, the earthquakes, the nuclear meltdowns, and the cover-up of that, the whitewash of that that's now imploding.
[00:44:04.363 --> 00:44:10.846]  While we're busy watching that, Obama has announced extremely draconian gun control legislation.
[00:44:10.846 --> 00:44:13.707]  And it's exactly what we predicted, wasn't hard to do.
[00:44:13.707 --> 00:44:25.671]  In the last year, intensifying the last five months, we have seen the Attorney General come out and say, guns from the US are causing the problems in Mexico.
[00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:29.033]  Well, A, Mexico has total victim disarmament.
[00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.233]  There is one gun shop in Mexico where you can buy guns.
[00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:32.294]  It's only for the military and police.
[00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.793]  And the public's disarmed.
[00:44:35.793 --> 00:44:39.579]  They have the highest crime rate officially for the last three years in the world.
[00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:41.442]  Over 30,000 killed in the last two and a half years.
[00:44:42.432 --> 00:44:45.313]  Violence spilling over, beheadings, all the rest of it.
[00:44:45.313 --> 00:44:51.115]  Police, police chiefs, mayors being killed, well, police on a daily basis, mayors on a weekly basis.
[00:44:51.115 --> 00:44:53.295]  It is total pandemonium.
[00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:53.695]  U.S.
[00:44:53.695 --> 00:44:58.077]  diplomats being murdered, and they blame this on our guns.
[00:44:58.077 --> 00:45:11.621]  And I saw this start about a year ago, and then suddenly about five months ago, the Attorney General started ordering gun shops in the Southwest, from Texas to California, to order, to order on record, without law,
[00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:19.292]  That when somebody buys a semi-automatic rifle or handgun, that's most guns, that you've got to go ahead and call the ATF on them.
[00:45:19.292 --> 00:45:31.676]  On top of the fact that you go through an instant FBI background check and they're now denying people who have no criminal record, it's the no-fly, no-gun-by list executed by Fiat that Obama has said he wants to be law.
[00:45:31.676 --> 00:45:36.838]  Just like they're shutting down our coal-powered plants even though Congress didn't pass the new law.
[00:45:36.838 --> 00:45:38.559]  They're just doing it.
[00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:39.819]  And this is a big deal.
[00:45:39.819 --> 00:45:40.820]  And people are in denial.
[00:45:41.914 --> 00:45:43.935]  Stop being in denial.
[00:45:43.935 --> 00:45:56.422]  It's like about five years ago I was in McBride's gun shop buying some ammo and a guy came over and kind of one of the behind the counter and said, Alex, I know it's a big gun shop, biggest in town.
[00:45:56.422 --> 00:46:06.788]  He came over behind the counter while I was talking to one guy and he said, I don't appreciate you lying about George W. Bush and saying that he supported the assault weapons ban.
[00:46:08.188 --> 00:46:12.509]  And I said, well, he's on the, and I said nicely, I said, he's been on the news pushing it.
[00:46:12.509 --> 00:46:14.070]  And I said, sir, you're gravely mistaken.
[00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.091]  And then one of the owners comes over and goes, Alex is right, he did.
[00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:19.351]  And the guy goes, really?
[00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.692]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:46:20.692 --> 00:46:23.132]  I mean, what do you think, I just lie up here?
[00:46:23.132 --> 00:46:32.095]  You know, these self-righteous ninnies will get in your face and tell you you're a liar because they're ignorant.
[00:46:33.049 --> 00:46:37.510]  I don't appreciate you lying about George W. Bush saying he is supporting the assault weapons ban.
[00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.151]  That's not true!
[00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:40.931]  You're the kind of good old boy in me.
[00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:41.812]  And I just said, really?
[00:46:41.812 --> 00:46:44.692]  Well, you're gravely mistaken.
[00:46:44.692 --> 00:46:50.274]  They even had YouTube at the time then, and I said, why don't you go to YouTube and type in, Bush endorses assault weapons ban.
[00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:54.195]  But side issue, this is the big issue, what I'm about to get to.
[00:46:54.195 --> 00:46:56.636]  They're moving with a major offensive against the Second Amendment.
[00:46:56.636 --> 00:46:59.757]  In fact, let's get Larry Pratt on in the next few days for a brief 15-minute talk on this.
[00:47:01.187 --> 00:47:10.376]  Undoubtedly they're gearing up some more lunatics they've got in mental institutions to, you know, give them guns and turn them loose as they've been caught doing.
[00:47:10.376 --> 00:47:20.265]  But I wanted to remind you that this came out, this came out on March 3rd, CBS News.
[00:47:20.265 --> 00:47:23.008]  Agent, I was ordered to let U.S.
[00:47:23.008 --> 00:47:23.949]  guns into Mexico.
[00:47:25.748 --> 00:47:27.849]  And we'll play that newscast coming up in the third hour.
[00:47:27.849 --> 00:47:31.532]  I'm gonna do a report on this, a 10 minute report or so.
[00:47:31.532 --> 00:47:33.173]  And he says, this is standard procedure.
[00:47:33.173 --> 00:47:43.999]  We're told to let the guns into Mexico and to know what's happening and to release the guns and to allow it to happen.
[00:47:43.999 --> 00:47:46.801]  And that's a false flag attack.
[00:47:46.801 --> 00:47:50.303]  Because that's, I told you a year ago, this would be their attack plan.
[00:47:50.303 --> 00:47:51.324]  And then again, five months ago.
[00:47:52.305 --> 00:47:59.068]  That the whole thing centers around it's America's fault for what's happening in Mexico.
[00:47:59.068 --> 00:48:07.391]  The only thing America is at fault in Mexico is keeping the phony drug war going, which creates $500 billion in black market money and incentivizes crime.
[00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:09.032]  And Americans are using those drugs.
[00:48:09.032 --> 00:48:12.973]  So in a way, we are guilty because we haven't decriminalized.
[00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:14.614]  That would end this overnight.
[00:48:14.614 --> 00:48:16.695]  You think the mafia wanted prohibition to end in 1930?
[00:48:21.843 --> 00:48:23.464]  No.
[00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:26.266]  Do you think the drug dealers want drug prohibition to end?
[00:48:26.266 --> 00:48:28.927]  Do you think government and the banks that launder it want it to?
[00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:30.788]  No, they don't want that.
[00:48:30.788 --> 00:48:31.829]  So that's CBS News.
[00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:32.709]  Here's another one.
[00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:36.611]  ATF source confirms walking guns to Mexico to pad statistics.
[00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:43.916]  That's the quote from a senior officer to create the illusion that the problem is caused in the U.S.
[00:48:44.895 --> 00:48:45.836]  That's the examiner.
[00:48:45.836 --> 00:48:46.456]  Here's another one.
[00:48:46.456 --> 00:48:47.357]  Daily News.
[00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:49.198]  Mayor, police chief, and official in U.S.
[00:48:49.198 --> 00:48:52.661]  border town busted for running guns to Mexico and drug cartels.
[00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:54.222]  Again, government.
[00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:55.763]  Government, government, government.
[00:48:55.763 --> 00:49:11.975]  And Obama has run a false flag in the two years he's been in, ordering the guns to be allowed into Mexico, knowingly, even involved in the transactions, walking the guns, helping get them in, to then come out and say, give us your guns because of Mexico.
[00:49:11.975 --> 00:49:14.137]  And that's what Obama announced yesterday.
[00:49:15.157 --> 00:49:26.542]  Okay, now I'm gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back and take calls for the rest of the next 40 minutes or so, then Dr. Bob Bowman joins us on the situation unfolding.
[00:49:26.542 --> 00:49:29.723]  But we do have a false flag going on.
[00:49:29.723 --> 00:49:32.264]  It's very simple.
[00:49:32.264 --> 00:49:41.228]  I say a year ago, two years ago when he got in, he said the violence, and they had the Justice Department have press conferences in Texas and Arizona and blamed the Second Amendment for it.
[00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:42.709]  And then a year ago, it intensified.
[00:49:43.772 --> 00:49:51.297]  And then, before the State of the Union a few months ago, he was supposedly going to announce it, and Gibbs said he was, the outgoing Gibbs, press secretary.
[00:49:51.297 --> 00:50:04.867]  And then he didn't announce it, but the word was it was going to be, because of Mexico and the Giffords shooting, we've got to have mental health laws outside of the current laws to just say, the government says you've got a mental problem, you can't own a gun.
[00:50:06.022 --> 00:50:11.467]  Or, you get a divorce, you immediately have a restraining order and can't have guns.
[00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:18.754]  Or, in all federal, outside of felonies, or even misdemeanors for that matter.
[00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:19.655]  So it's two-pronged.
[00:50:19.655 --> 00:50:21.036]  They're going to blame everything on Mexico.
[00:50:21.036 --> 00:50:21.777]  They've already done it.
[00:50:22.037 --> 00:50:25.180]  Everything happening in Mexico on the Second Amendment and the Giffords situation.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:30.444]  They're coming after our guns and I'll get into the legislation he's proposing that they're busy writing right now.
[00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:33.887]  But the assault on the Second Amendment is here.
[00:50:33.887 --> 00:50:35.349]  Obama made all those jokes.
[00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:38.872]  The White House said how dare people claim he wants your guns.
[00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:40.793]  He's not introducing legislation.
[00:50:40.793 --> 00:50:43.075]  Chris Matthews said you people are crazy.
[00:50:43.075 --> 00:50:43.776]  Well, they're coming.
[00:50:44.983 --> 00:50:51.189]  So people were right in the last two and a half years to have two and a half years of record gun sales.
[00:50:51.189 --> 00:51:00.799]  And you know what they said in Texas and Gonzales when the war started in 1836, when the Mexican army came to take the guns, they said come and take them barrel first.
[00:51:00.799 --> 00:51:03.822]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[00:51:03.822 --> 00:51:08.387]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[00:52:01.494 --> 00:52:05.518]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.518 --> 00:52:08.781]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.781 --> 00:52:13.565]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.565 --> 00:52:19.971]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:22.214]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.734 --> 00:52:23.054]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.054 --> 00:52:23.515]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.515 --> 00:52:23.895]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:23.895 --> 00:52:24.676]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:24.676 --> 00:52:26.358]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.636 --> 00:52:43.477]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.477 --> 00:52:48.919]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.919 --> 00:52:58.103]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:29.484]  I just want to recap something.
[00:54:29.484 --> 00:54:33.449]  All Hades has broke loose in Japan.
[00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:35.511]  We need to pray for him.
[00:54:35.511 --> 00:54:40.998]  The government over there has been caught lying every step of the way to only later confirm our worst fears.
[00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:44.722]  Radiation cloud is drifting into Tokyo.
[00:54:44.722 --> 00:54:46.542]  The radiation level's going up.
[00:54:46.542 --> 00:54:48.483]  But it's not uranium and plutonium.
[00:54:48.483 --> 00:54:49.963]  At least they're saying it isn't.
[00:54:49.963 --> 00:54:54.284]  It's the other isotopes and other derivatives that are still very bad.
[00:54:54.284 --> 00:54:58.105]  Cesium, radioactive iodine, strontium.
[00:54:58.105 --> 00:54:59.506]  Very bad, can kill you.
[00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:03.567]  But they're saying that, well, as long as you have brief exposures, you should be okay.
[00:55:03.567 --> 00:55:05.387]  Well, I mean, they live there.
[00:55:05.387 --> 00:55:07.948]  It's drifting towards them.
[00:55:07.948 --> 00:55:10.469]  We cannot trust these governments to tell us the truth.
[00:55:11.471 --> 00:55:15.973]  And that's what we're going to be tracking and trying to figure out is how severe is this really?
[00:55:15.973 --> 00:55:20.475]  Michael, Derek, Joe, John, Kirby, I'm going to go to all of you right now.
[00:55:20.475 --> 00:55:25.818]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:55:25.818 --> 00:55:27.779]  Let's talk to Michael in California.
[00:55:27.779 --> 00:55:29.239]  You're on the air.
[00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:30.220]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.080]  Hey.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.281]  First time caller.
[00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:34.342]  I've listened to you for the last couple of years now.
[00:55:34.342 --> 00:55:37.103]  I'd just like to say you are the People's Champion.
[00:55:38.576 --> 00:55:44.720]  And I'd like to give kudos to InfoWars and Prison Planet for your world-class news coverage.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.402]  You're doing a great service for America and the world.
[00:55:47.402 --> 00:55:48.303]  Well, let me say this.
[00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:49.503]  You don't need to thank me.
[00:55:49.503 --> 00:55:51.965]  You can just say dittos or kudos.
[00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:53.086]  I appreciate it.
[00:55:53.086 --> 00:55:59.550]  But it's my whole team that is providing this information, so they deserve the lion's share of the credit.
[00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.211]  I couldn't do it without my great team.
[00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:05.194]  We're getting record traffic on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:56:05.194 --> 00:56:06.915]  I've had IT people struggling.
[00:56:07.836 --> 00:56:10.743]  Around the clock to keep the sites up.
[00:56:10.743 --> 00:56:15.053]  I want to apologize for the drugs report because it is not good web etiquette.
[00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:25.443]  to when he links to InfoWars to change the link to Prison Planet to a copy of the article but InfoWars was unable to stay up because of all the other traffic.
[00:56:25.443 --> 00:56:28.084]  So that's why we did that and Drudge obviously understood that.
[00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:38.308]  But we've been having to juggle a lot of things because basically we've shattered our previous bandwidth records by double.
[00:56:38.308 --> 00:56:39.889]  Okay?
[00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:43.850]  It is off the charts the amount of people visiting the sites and it's a great responsibility.
[00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:44.831]  What's on your mind, Michael?
[00:56:45.646 --> 00:56:49.768]  Well, Alex, I have one shocking news tip and one question.
[00:56:49.768 --> 00:56:51.909]  The news tip is this.
[00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:55.491]  I looked all over Ventura, California for potassium iodide yesterday.
[00:56:55.491 --> 00:56:57.032]  It was gone.
[00:56:57.032 --> 00:57:04.455]  So I found a pharmacist who was willing to fill a prescription for me for potassium iodide.
[00:57:04.455 --> 00:57:12.779]  And I went to Urgent Care to get a prescription filled and the doctor denied it because they said they talked to CDC and DHSC
[00:57:14.893 --> 00:57:18.715]  And they recommended that they not give out the prescription for potassium iodide.
[00:57:35.602 --> 00:57:37.764]  The people usually give the town and the name.
[00:57:37.764 --> 00:57:40.146]  I have limited staff, but we do need to call through the emails.
[00:57:40.146 --> 00:57:44.089]  Aaron showed me a bunch last night, but he worked till 3 in the morning.
[00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:51.535]  So I was only up here till 9 on the research.
[00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:57.880]  And yes, what you just said is confirmed by just the volume of comments.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.282]  But, sir, can you write an email and send it?
[00:58:00.982 --> 00:58:09.149]  Well, I'll put you on hold and give you kind of a less-trafficked email to make sure it gets through, but cc it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[00:58:09.149 --> 00:58:20.380]  Can you give me the name of the urgent care, where it happened, what happened, so we can do an article that confirms this, that the government is blocking over-the-counter stuff, telling you you can't get it?
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.261]  You betcha.
[00:58:22.261 --> 00:58:23.783]  I'll do exactly that.
[00:58:23.783 --> 00:58:26.005]  Could I get one quick question for you and Bennett Fuchs?
[00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:27.483]  Absolutely.
[00:58:27.483 --> 00:58:30.204]  We haven't been able to get ahold of pharmacists, but we're trying.
[00:58:30.204 --> 00:58:32.305]  But yeah, throw your question out on the other side.
[00:58:32.305 --> 00:58:43.710]  Michael and Derek and others will go directly to you, but I'm going to have John Harmon give you an email right now.
[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.831]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:48.732]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.438 --> 00:58:54.981]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:55.901]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:59.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.324 --> 00:59:00.184]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.184 --> 00:59:05.067]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.067 --> 00:59:05.828]  It's true.
[00:59:05.828 --> 00:59:10.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:11.511]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:15.094]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.094 --> 00:59:18.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.996 --> 00:59:22.558]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:26.239]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.239 --> 00:59:31.181]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.181 --> 00:59:36.223]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.223 --> 00:59:40.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.405 --> 00:59:42.186]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.186 --> 00:59:47.008]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call one
[00:59:47.388 --> 00:59:55.857]  877-327-0365 Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.857 --> 00:59:58.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:10.149]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.730]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.272]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:17.455]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.455 --> 01:00:21.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:29.227]  We just talked to Dr. Doug Rockey, physicist, radiation expert, but he's at the VA getting treatments.
[01:00:29.227 --> 01:00:32.530]  We're going to see if we can get him on.
[01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:36.393]  Nuclear physicist, Dr. Bob Bowman, will be joining us in 30 minutes.
[01:00:36.393 --> 01:00:42.899]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is going to pop in for about five minutes of the next segment, because they've sold out everywhere of the potassium iodine.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.721]  I don't
[01:01:00.518 --> 01:01:04.781]  And try to get a prescription, and they said, well, the government's told us don't give these as prescriptions.
[01:01:04.781 --> 01:01:06.122]  Write that report up, Michael.
[01:01:06.122 --> 01:01:17.069]  Get it to us, because we want to start confirming these things and put an article out on it to dovetail with Paul Watson's article, Panic Buying Stocks of Potassium Iodine Exhausted in the U.S.
[01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:21.852]  But I want to go to Kirby, Derek, Joe, everybody that's holding here in a moment.
[01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.232]  Quickly, what was your other question, Michael?
[01:01:23.232 --> 01:01:23.773]  And I got to jump.
[01:01:26.698 --> 01:01:27.478]  You had to drop off.
[01:01:27.478 --> 01:01:29.379]  Okay, I thought he wanted to hold over.
[01:01:29.379 --> 01:01:30.559]  Derek in Missouri.
[01:01:30.559 --> 01:01:31.499]  Derek, you're on the air.
[01:01:31.499 --> 01:01:33.980]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.581]  I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
[01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:46.664]  Some of them personal to me because I have loved ones or I have people that I know in Japan right now.
[01:01:46.664 --> 01:01:51.225]  Well, first of all, I want to talk about the Japanese economy and the Japanese
[01:01:56.314 --> 01:02:04.301]  Stock markets went from 14% to 9.5% and also it was basically $620 billion off the market.
[01:02:04.301 --> 01:02:12.249]  I wanted to know from your perspective how exactly that was going to affect how that would affect American markets here in a short period of time.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.241]  Well, last time I checked, let's pull up the stock market right now live on air.
[01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:16.622]  The U.S.
[01:02:16.622 --> 01:02:21.203]  stock market was down quite a few points.
[01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:30.187]  The Tokyo exchange is closed a few hours ago, down 11% or one of the biggest losses in recent memory.
[01:02:30.187 --> 01:02:33.488]  Asian shares overall tumbled today as Tokyo stock
[01:02:33.948 --> 01:02:45.635]  Benchmark plunged 11% on panic selling amid worries that a possible nuclear catastrophe in Japan would further complicate and endanger the nation's recovery from its worst earthquake on record.
[01:02:45.635 --> 01:02:50.157]  The Nikkei stock average finished 11% lower to 8,605.15 after sliding more than 14 points earlier in the day.
[01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:50.437]  Pressure
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.587]  By news of explosions at Tokyo Electric Company's Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant No.
[01:03:01.587 --> 01:03:05.111]  2 and 4 reactors on top of previous blasts at No.
[01:03:05.111 --> 01:03:05.671]  1 and No.
[01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:05.731]  3.
[01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:11.898]  So, four of them have blown up of the six, including one that was turned off, showing you that that means nothing.
[01:03:11.898 --> 01:03:13.480]  Coming on top of the 6.2 fall Monday,
[01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:24.939]  The performance in the Nikkei is worse since October 16, 2008, a drop of 11.4 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
[01:03:24.939 --> 01:03:26.421]  So does that answer your question?
[01:03:26.421 --> 01:03:26.982]  The U.S.
[01:03:26.982 --> 01:03:29.124]  Dow is down 197.42, Nasdaq down 45.33, S&P 500 down 20.60.
[01:03:29.124 --> 01:03:30.165]  So there's your answer, sir.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:41.722]  Those are big numbers to be dropped off from the American markets.
[01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:42.222]  Is that correct?
[01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:48.727]  Well, they can always pump them back up with fiat currency, but it only devalues the dollar as the global currency more.
[01:03:48.727 --> 01:03:51.008]  But obviously, when it rains, it pours.
[01:03:51.008 --> 01:03:53.110]  This is what happens in history.
[01:03:53.110 --> 01:04:01.175]  And the globalists have wanted to liquefy the political system so that they can then change it and then refreeze it.
[01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:02.956]  That's a term they use.
[01:04:02.956 --> 01:04:05.698]  And it's a pretty amazing time to be alive right now, Derek.
[01:04:07.071 --> 01:04:12.437]  I have an ex-wife who used to live in Toyocho in the Tokyo City.
[01:04:12.437 --> 01:04:16.802]  I was married over in Tokyo, served over there in the Navy.
[01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:19.445]  I'm actually a third-time, probably fourth-time caller.
[01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:23.470]  Um, but uh, I haven't been able to get a hold of her.
[01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:34.195]  And, um, as much, uh, resentment as we have, uh, back and forth towards one another, we still, uh, uh, uh, share a bond, and I feel love for her, and I have prayers for her.
[01:04:34.195 --> 01:04:35.995]  Well, what's her first name?
[01:04:35.995 --> 01:04:37.276]  Hiroko Asada.
[01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:40.552]  Well, folks, pray for her and everybody else.
[01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:44.514]  Lift them up in prayer and ask God for divine intervention.
[01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:47.035]  George Washington prayed for it and certainly got it.
[01:04:47.035 --> 01:04:48.796]  And there are no atheists in foxholes.
[01:04:48.796 --> 01:04:50.437]  Thank you for the call, Derek.
[01:04:50.437 --> 01:04:53.918]  John, Joe, Mark, others, your call's straight ahead.
[01:04:53.918 --> 01:04:56.840]  I'd like to hear from nuclear engineers, physicists, you name it.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.981]  We'll be right back with Ben Fuchs briefly.
[01:04:58.981 --> 01:04:59.421]  Then your calls.
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:02.352]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:05.715]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:31.196]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:05:31.196 --> 01:05:32.698]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:05:52.755 --> 01:05:53.255]  Thank you!
[01:06:01.539 --> 01:06:05.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.801]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:13.602]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:19.984]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:22.225]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.785 --> 01:06:23.085]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.085 --> 01:06:23.585]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:24.266]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.266 --> 01:06:25.546]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.787]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:48.956]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.956 --> 01:06:58.060]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:01.457 --> 01:07:08.501]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:07:08.501 --> 01:07:11.162]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:07:11.162 --> 01:07:20.207]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:26.790]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:07:28.851 --> 01:07:29.191]  I think so.
[01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.691]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.443 --> 01:08:36.637]  We are going to continue with your phone calls and continue to track the unfolding disaster in Japan.
[01:08:37.932 --> 01:08:47.196]  But the Associated Press and others are reporting that radioactive winds are going into Tokyo.
[01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:52.459]  Headline, radiation levels soar after Japan nuke plant fire.
[01:08:52.459 --> 01:09:00.002]  Associated Press, four of the six reactors, including one that had been successfully turned off, have blown up.
[01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:04.744]  And Reuters, AP, are also reporting that they believe that some of the containment
[01:09:06.986 --> 01:09:13.528]  Systems basically the steel steel box that the reactors are in may have been breached.
[01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:27.774]  Let's hope that that's not the case because you think what's outside the containment vessels bad the water they pump through that's got all those different radioactive isotopes and radioactive iodine, strontium, cesium,
[01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:31.592]  That, so far, is what's made the U.S.
[01:09:31.592 --> 01:09:34.114]  fleet race away from the island because it was blowing out the sea.
[01:09:34.114 --> 01:09:40.519]  Now the winds have changed to the south and it's sending it into Tokyo, but there are no confirmed reports of uranium and plutonium.
[01:09:40.519 --> 01:09:45.082]  And if that gets out or has gotten out, it is an off-the-chart crisis.
[01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:47.904]  Obviously, you don't need to be told that to understand that.
[01:09:47.904 --> 01:09:53.687]  One particle of that refined plutonium and uranium, you are dead meat if it gets into your lungs.
[01:09:55.048 --> 01:10:01.710]  Or if you get it on your hand and then wipe your mouth and it goes into your stomach, it is going to devastate those people.
[01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.911]  Let's hope and pray that's not the case.
[01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:07.432]  Now, I'm going to go to John, Joe, John, Mark, Rusty, here in a moment.
[01:10:07.432 --> 01:10:17.255]  I had a Dr. Bob Bowman joining us in about 25 minutes or so, but I wanted to just briefly bring up degreed pharmacist Ben Fuchs, who's a Genesis Talk Show host.
[01:10:18.855 --> 01:10:31.519]  Briefly, because Ben, I know it varies, but some of the potassium iodine drops that I've bought for thyroid health say take one drop a day, some say two, some say three.
[01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:34.380]  I guess it depends on how strong the tincture is.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.361]  You're a pharmacist, you can explain it.
[01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:39.442]  Versus the IoSat.
[01:10:40.872 --> 01:10:46.615]  Uh, potassium iodate tablets, 130 milligram indication, thyroid blocking, and a radiation emergency only.
[01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:50.877]  That is sold out all over Europe, all over Japan, all over China, confirmed.
[01:10:50.877 --> 01:10:53.399]  All over the world it's selling out.
[01:10:53.399 --> 01:11:03.644]  Uh, and now we are getting reports flooding in that FEMA, Homeland Security, CDC is telling clinics to not give it to people if they request it as a prescription.
[01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:06.205]  Even though it's over the counter.
[01:11:06.205 --> 01:11:08.126]  So a lot of things happening there.
[01:11:08.126 --> 01:11:12.008]  But my only question for you is this.
[01:11:12.008 --> 01:11:14.949]  Some people have gone in to health food stores or grocery stores.
[01:11:14.949 --> 01:11:21.872]  They've been told by the people in the vitamin aisle and people at clinics that, oh, only the pills will help you.
[01:11:21.872 --> 01:11:24.353]  They're 130 to 150 milligrams, depending on the brand.
[01:11:24.353 --> 01:11:25.874]  And we've confirmed that.
[01:11:25.874 --> 01:11:30.536]  And they're claiming that these iodine drops are much weaker and that
[01:11:31.877 --> 01:11:32.117]  That's
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.623]  At this time, I'm taking the drops for myself, my wife, and my children at the recommended dose.
[01:11:56.623 --> 01:11:58.024]  Is that what I should be doing?
[01:11:58.024 --> 01:12:02.387]  And is it true that these drops aren't going to help because they're too weak?
[01:12:02.387 --> 01:12:08.610]  Or the Dulse, Kelp, Alfalfa-based pills, we also have those.
[01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:09.811]  Is it true what we're hearing?
[01:12:10.538 --> 01:12:14.140]  No, by far and away, the best way to get your iodine is drops.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.261]  SSKI or potassium iodide drops, it's the way to go.
[01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:28.365]  And 130 milligrams is a great place to be, depending on, and you're absolutely correct, depending on the brand, you're going to get different dosages per drop, but you want to look, read the label, you want... Okay, so how much in an average bottle?
[01:12:28.365 --> 01:12:29.646]  In fact, we got a bunch of bottles.
[01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:31.987]  We have Tim bring his in so I can read off the bottle.
[01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:33.248]  I mean, on average...
[01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:48.257]  I don't
[01:13:03.437 --> 01:13:05.418]  That way your body sheds it instead of...
[01:13:25.843 --> 01:13:26.724]  Oh, okay, so...
[01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:52.783]  I'd be using sea vegetables as long as you want to make sure that they're from a good source.
[01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:55.605]  But I'd be eating sea vegetables on a daily basis.
[01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:58.308]  It's one of the best ways to protect yourself from radiation.
[01:13:58.308 --> 01:14:00.970]  There's also grape seed extract, green tea.
[01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.552]  Drink a lot of green tea.
[01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:05.374]  Spend all day drinking green tea.
[01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.677]  If I was going to protect myself from any of these substances, I'd be doing a lot of green tea.
[01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.700]  And by the way, pharmacists... Also, don't forget about vitamin C. Very important.
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:14.761]  Absolutely, because that helps your body defend itself.
[01:14:14.761 --> 01:14:19.023]  And I want you to explain that, and then I'm going to let you go, and we'll have you back soon to continue to break this down.
[01:14:19.023 --> 01:14:21.644]  For those saying, oh, trust the government.
[01:14:21.644 --> 01:14:25.685]  The winds are coming from Japan right across the West Coast, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:25.685 --> 01:14:34.248]  And on the, number one, at the levels that you're supposed to take it, I'm correct in saying, pharmacist, that it's good to have this anyways.
[01:14:34.248 --> 01:14:37.410]  So as a precaution, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:37.910]  Some people
[01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:45.912]  Or criticizing us, even though we're not even selling this stuff, for even telling people they might want to take a precaution, as if it's somehow bad.
[01:14:45.912 --> 01:14:49.052]  But overall, it's good to be eating seaweed.
[01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:52.313]  It's good to be eating vitamin C. It's good to have proper iodine.
[01:14:52.313 --> 01:15:02.035]  Explain to people what your thyroid problems are off the charts these days, why that's happening, and what your thyroid absorbs if it doesn't have the iodine it needs.
[01:15:02.495 --> 01:15:04.856]  Well, your point is very well taken, Alex.
[01:15:04.856 --> 01:15:06.276]  You don't want to wait for a disaster.
[01:15:06.276 --> 01:15:08.876]  You want to make sure your body is loaded up.
[01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:11.037]  It's saturated with these substances.
[01:15:11.037 --> 01:15:13.317]  So when something like this does happen, you're protected.
[01:15:13.317 --> 01:15:23.119]  As far as the thyroid goes, I'll tell you one of the biggest problems associated with the thyroid that nobody talks about is the digestive system, because thyroid hormone is activated in the digestive system.
[01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:26.520]  So one of the most important things you could do if you want to protect yourself from
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.180]  I'm good.
[01:15:44.352 --> 01:15:48.153]  All right, we've got a jump, and I appreciate you joining us on short notice, but I have a brand here.
[01:15:48.153 --> 01:15:49.693]  One last question.
[01:15:49.693 --> 01:15:51.494]  I have a brand here.
[01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:54.875]  This is from New Flower.
[01:15:54.875 --> 01:16:00.116]  It's iodine with kelp, dietary supplement, two fluid ounces, 60 mil.
[01:16:00.116 --> 01:16:07.978]  Suggested use, take one drop once a day in a little water or as directed by your healthcare professional.
[01:16:07.978 --> 01:16:09.278]  And it doesn't
[01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:22.201]  Even really say anything else in the back, it says, Iodine 150 MCG, 100% per drop, 2MG from Kelp.
[01:16:22.201 --> 01:16:30.203]  So, looking at this brand, you're saying one drop a day of this would fill the thyroid and be what I need?
[01:16:30.203 --> 01:16:31.424]  That's right, one drop a day.
[01:16:31.424 --> 01:16:34.144]  It's a little over, that's 150 mikes.
[01:16:34.144 --> 01:16:35.225]  You're looking for at least 130 mikes.
[01:16:36.547 --> 01:16:41.631]  Well, if I weigh 230 pounds, I mean, does a man who's bigger take more than a woman who weighs 100?
[01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:44.553]  Slight difference, but not really significant.
[01:16:44.553 --> 01:16:46.594]  Because we're talking about a gland.
[01:16:46.594 --> 01:16:48.175]  You're talking, exactly, you're talking about a gland.
[01:16:48.175 --> 01:16:50.857]  Okay, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, thank you so much for clearing that up for us.
[01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:51.498]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:16:51.498 --> 01:16:52.298]  Appreciate it.
[01:16:52.298 --> 01:16:56.321]  Yeah, you want to go to a pharmacist, even above a doctor, because they're the ones that really deal with this every day.
[01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.162]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:57.162 --> 01:16:59.023]  Okay, John in New York.
[01:16:59.023 --> 01:16:59.864]  John, you're on the air.
[01:16:59.864 --> 01:17:00.164]  Welcome.
[01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:08.920]  Alex, I just want to let you know I've been going around Rochester, New York, trying to get some potassium iodine, or iostat.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.968]  And every place I've been to so far, except for one, is completely out.
[01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:16.830]  Their suppliers are completely out.
[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:18.252]  They said they were out from day one.
[01:17:20.882 --> 01:17:22.002]  Well, that's the issue.
[01:17:22.002 --> 01:17:24.743]  You know, four or five percent of the population is educated.
[01:17:24.743 --> 01:17:26.364]  They're going to buy it all up.
[01:17:26.364 --> 01:17:28.304]  It's the same thing with gold and silver.
[01:17:28.304 --> 01:17:34.626]  Once the general public figures out the dollar has been trashed, imagine when all the yuppies try to go out and buy gold and silver.
[01:17:34.626 --> 01:17:35.267]  What's going to happen?
[01:17:35.267 --> 01:17:37.187]  It's the same thing with this.
[01:17:37.187 --> 01:17:39.868]  Anything else you want to add, John?
[01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:41.569]  Yes, I also have a tip.
[01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:49.291]  I happen to live near Ginney Power Plant on Lake Ontario, and because I live so close, they have loaded up the
[01:17:49.904 --> 01:17:53.766]  Over the years loaded up the pharmacies in my area with the IOstat.
[01:17:53.766 --> 01:18:04.751]  So a tip would be to have people that live in areas around nuclear power plants to go to their pharmacies and they will be able to get a IOstat kit.
[01:18:04.751 --> 01:18:06.492]  They have a much greater chance there.
[01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:09.202]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:18:09.202 --> 01:18:14.623]  That's right, and that's one reason the federal government is saying that they don't need any more iodine.
[01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.444]  Only people around power plants need it.
[01:18:16.444 --> 01:18:18.344]  But what if you're down wind from one?
[01:18:18.344 --> 01:18:19.565]  What if we're down wind from Japan?
[01:18:19.565 --> 01:18:21.025]  I mean, it makes no sense.
[01:18:21.025 --> 01:18:25.146]  The government wants to limit it so they can sit there and hand it out and play God.
[01:18:25.146 --> 01:18:26.607]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:18:26.607 --> 01:18:27.667]  Welcome.
[01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:28.927]  Hey, dittos, Alex.
[01:18:28.927 --> 01:18:29.187]  Hey, buddy.
[01:18:31.952 --> 01:18:40.918]  Now that the winds are going south like they are from Japan, I'm just wondering what that's going to do with all the problems that Australia's had with the floods and the fires.
[01:18:40.918 --> 01:18:42.540]  Oh yeah, this stuff's going all over the world.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:49.244]  I mean, there's no doubt that whatever's coming out of those plants, they've been covering it up and they're now having to admit, I mean, again, here's the AP.
[01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:56.002]  Yeah, and the other thing I wanted to mention, Alex, was the iodine solution you put on your skin.
[01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:57.463]  I don't know.
[01:18:57.463 --> 01:19:01.466]  You might know more about it than me that it does help to some degree.
[01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:28.621]  When I went down, or rather my girlfriend went down to buy some of this stuff like a month ago, that 16 ounce bottle of that stuff was $3.
[01:19:28.621 --> 01:19:34.825]  It's now $12, and they don't have many on the shelf now.
[01:19:34.825 --> 01:19:43.891]  And you can get the first eight kinds that has the same iodine solution in it, but it seems like they're out there making money off this stuff.
[01:19:44.895 --> 01:19:46.576]  They certainly are, sir.
[01:19:46.576 --> 01:19:49.156]  All right, I appreciate you joining us.
[01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:52.898]  We're going to come back and talk to John, Mark, Rusty, and others.
[01:19:52.898 --> 01:19:55.979]  Then Dr. Bob Bowman's joining us at more of your calls.
[01:19:55.979 --> 01:19:59.540]  AP headline, radiation level soars after Japan nuke plant fire.
[01:20:00.765 --> 01:20:07.591]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:20:07.591 --> 01:20:09.192]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:20:09.192 --> 01:20:17.039]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:25.185]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation.
[01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:26.266]  What's going on as a nation?
[01:20:26.266 --> 01:20:28.648]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:20:28.648 --> 01:20:30.129]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:30.850]  They're not just economic.
[01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:31.730]  They're philosophical.
[01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:33.212]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:20:33.212 --> 01:20:35.133]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:20:46.602 --> 01:20:47.043]  I think.
[01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:13.113]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[01:21:13.113 --> 01:21:16.775]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[01:21:16.775 --> 01:21:17.596]  Have you?
[01:21:17.596 --> 01:21:28.885]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:30.066]  Could this really happen?
[01:21:30.066 --> 01:21:34.069]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[01:21:34.069 --> 01:21:39.633]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth
[01:21:39.693 --> 01:21:40.094]  We're good.
[01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:05.251]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:06.672]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:10.676]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:13.418]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:13.418 --> 01:22:15.400]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.702]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:18.723 --> 01:22:22.769]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:22.769 --> 01:22:24.911]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:24.911 --> 01:22:26.594]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:24:34.011 --> 01:24:35.572]  John in Colorado.
[01:24:35.572 --> 01:24:36.793]  You're up next at bat.
[01:24:36.793 --> 01:24:37.774]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:24:37.774 --> 01:24:41.537]  Thank you so much, Alex, and I want to thank your staff for bumping me up a little.
[01:24:41.537 --> 01:24:43.699]  I have a very important call.
[01:24:43.699 --> 01:24:46.161]  It's a take action call.
[01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:48.703]  Your listener's taking action.
[01:24:48.703 --> 01:24:51.666]  It's about the fallout from Japan.
[01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:53.407]  There's something we can do.
[01:24:53.407 --> 01:24:58.011]  I did some homework last night and there are civilian monitoring
[01:24:58.706 --> 01:25:04.730]  stations, and they're online, they're real-time, but there's a problem.
[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:26.444]  When I posted this on Prison Planet, I got their website shut down because they got so much traffic, and so I talked with the web, well I talked to the people at RadiationNetwork.com, and they said that we need to get all these people who have Geiger counters, they said there's lots and lots of people with Geiger counters,
[01:25:26.926 --> 01:25:29.008]  We need to get them to get them out of their attic.
[01:25:29.008 --> 01:25:31.190]  We need to get them out of their garages.
[01:25:31.190 --> 01:25:31.950]  Get that dust blowing out.
[01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:33.191]  Well, here's the problem, though.
[01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:36.114]  They need more... I'm not an expert on it, but I've done some studying.
[01:25:36.114 --> 01:25:43.620]  There's a lot of specific, very expensive Geiger counters that can flip and check different types of radiation.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:53.889]  Most of them are geared to uranium or plutonium, and they're not going to be geared towards less radioactive things that are still very poisonous.
[01:25:53.889 --> 01:25:54.650]  So I do need to
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:57.031]  I'm going to get Dr. Bob Bowman on very soon.
[01:25:57.031 --> 01:26:00.194]  In fact, I'm going to ask him that question, but go ahead.
[01:26:00.194 --> 01:26:02.935]  Yeah, but we don't know what they have.
[01:26:02.935 --> 01:26:03.396]  You're right.
[01:26:03.396 --> 01:26:04.136]  They could have that.
[01:26:04.136 --> 01:26:05.677]  They could have others, too.
[01:26:05.677 --> 01:26:12.082]  But if we can get as many people to get those out, and I think Hawaii really needs to get on the ball.
[01:26:12.082 --> 01:26:14.884]  First of all, a lot of us out here in Radioland, we don't trust the government.
[01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:16.705]  We don't trust the media.
[01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:22.549]  And at least this would be a way to check their figures.
[01:26:25.031 --> 01:26:31.454]  And get, I think, a second, third opinion on the radiation levels that we're getting.
[01:26:31.454 --> 01:26:36.076]  All they have to do is go to the website, like I was saying, Radiation Network.
[01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:38.657]  They can download the software and they can get up and running.
[01:26:39.301 --> 01:26:40.202]  They're the experts.
[01:26:40.202 --> 01:26:41.322]  I'm not even an expert.
[01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:56.432]  Well, there's also university and city facilities, but we know in the past the feds have told them not to report on it, like when the DU was orbiting the globe in 2003 from the thousands of tons they used in Iraq, but the British did not
[01:26:57.132 --> 01:26:58.073]  Get get shut down.
[01:26:58.073 --> 01:27:15.620]  They did report the high-level so did the Germans the Dutch and others and that was after it had circled the globe and gone over the North America and back into Europe and in the Middle East, you know completing its circum circumnavigation through the atmosphere But that is a really good point.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.481]  I appreciate your call John mark in New York.
[01:27:18.481 --> 01:27:19.442]  You're on the air.
[01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:19.822]  Go ahead.
[01:27:19.822 --> 01:27:19.842]  I
[01:27:21.288 --> 01:27:21.848]  Hello?
[01:27:21.848 --> 01:27:22.789]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:22.789 --> 01:27:25.070]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.351]  Thank you for taking my phone call.
[01:27:26.351 --> 01:27:27.152]  You don't have to thank me.
[01:27:27.152 --> 01:27:29.513]  I'm not one of these arrogant, crazy hoes, but go ahead.
[01:27:29.513 --> 01:27:31.454]  Okay.
[01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:35.597]  I live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, near the Fort Hamilton Army Base.
[01:27:35.597 --> 01:27:39.499]  And, you know, it's the only Army base here in New York City.
[01:27:39.499 --> 01:27:42.221]  And so, you know, we're kind of used to them having their little
[01:27:43.514 --> 01:27:48.120]  Yeah Alex, I was just wanting to run a couple things by you.
[01:27:59.830 --> 01:28:08.358]  What about the government shutdown that was posted on the Army Times this morning about the possible troop pay not going out due to a government shutdown?
[01:28:08.358 --> 01:28:09.118]  I did see that.
[01:28:09.118 --> 01:28:10.840]  Guys, I don't think I sent it to you to print.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.503]  Army Times, troops may not get paid due to government shutdown.
[01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:16.765]  No, it's all bedlam has broken loose.
[01:28:16.765 --> 01:28:24.772]  We're going bankrupt by design to the globalists who set up this derivative system, a black hole, impossible to escape unless you write it off and arrest the bankers.
[01:28:24.772 --> 01:28:25.413]  It's us or them.
[01:28:26.013 --> 01:28:28.275]  Yeah, I really don't know anything about it.
[01:28:28.275 --> 01:28:35.240]  I've been hit up by some folks locally about this issue, about the shutdown more than anything else because I hadn't seen a whole lot of
[01:28:48.627 --> 01:28:51.732]  On your site particularly, I've just kind of been up in the air.
[01:28:51.732 --> 01:28:56.638]  I have seen a few things out on Steve Quill's site here lately and I thought I'd mention that.
[01:28:56.638 --> 01:29:05.571]  I'd also like to add that Interfood, just plug one of your sponsors, Interfood is probably a good thing to be taking at this time as well.
[01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:11.575]  I've had good results from it for the last three months and I haven't had any allergy symptoms that we normally suffer from here.
[01:29:24.921 --> 01:29:29.604]  Before this even happened, does have, they call it Total Balancer, I think's the name.
[01:29:29.604 --> 01:29:32.786]  It's an iodine slash other mineral drop.
[01:29:32.786 --> 01:29:35.928]  We actually do sell potassium iodide drops, but I haven't mentioned it.
[01:29:35.928 --> 01:29:37.489]  There, I have mentioned it.
[01:29:37.489 --> 01:29:38.650]  They do have it.
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:47.456]  Infowarsteam.com, but, and I've not even been mentioning Interfood and other things that'll help you, because I don't want to piggyback on this and profit from it, but there you go.
[01:29:47.456 --> 01:29:51.139]  It's available and we haven't raised the prices of it like everybody else.
[01:29:51.139 --> 01:29:52.520]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.021]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.029 --> 01:30:00.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:01.951]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.951 --> 01:30:08.873]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.873 --> 01:30:11.413]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.413 --> 01:30:16.815]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.815 --> 01:30:19.855]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.855 --> 01:30:21.916]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.156 --> 01:30:28.420]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.802]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:37.586]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.586 --> 01:30:39.227]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.227 --> 01:30:40.528]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.528 --> 01:30:43.190]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:47.412]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.412 --> 01:30:49.454]  You can find the video at www.
[01:30:50.214 --> 01:30:52.035]  End of America 3.com.
[01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:54.617]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:04.683]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.683 --> 01:31:10.687]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:11.067 --> 01:31:18.448]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.448 --> 01:31:23.329]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:31.991 --> 01:31:35.712]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:36.246 --> 01:31:43.029]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:43.029 --> 01:31:46.910]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:53.293]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:31:53.293 --> 01:31:54.513]  Thank you.
[01:32:01.087 --> 01:32:16.554]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.554 --> 01:32:20.236]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.263 --> 01:32:34.015]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:41.302]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.983 --> 01:32:52.352]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.352 --> 01:32:56.275]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.275 --> 01:32:59.398]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:09.537 --> 01:33:12.791]  No one's gonna take me alive!
[01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:22.974]  We're going to continue with your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:33:22.974 --> 01:33:30.018]  Dr. Bob Bowman joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:33:30.018 --> 01:33:39.243]  Reuters is reporting that the Japanese government is saying that two of the containment vessels in plant number two and four may have been partially breached.
[01:33:39.243 --> 01:33:41.424]  That is not good news.
[01:33:41.424 --> 01:33:41.845]  Also,
[01:33:42.825 --> 01:33:49.934]  There have been two more explosions overnight, bringing the total number of explosions now to four.
[01:33:49.934 --> 01:33:58.183]  It is also being reported by the Associated Press, here's the headline, radiation levels soar after Japan nuke plant fire.
[01:33:58.183 --> 01:34:01.808]  Now, plant number four had been brought offline before this even happened.
[01:34:02.967 --> 01:34:07.671]  It was in some type of state of repair.
[01:34:07.671 --> 01:34:11.294]  And Dr. Bowman talked yesterday about that sounds like good news because it won't melt down.
[01:34:11.294 --> 01:34:17.880]  Well, the fire got into it, the huge explosions, and they're saying that that may have been exposed.
[01:34:19.764 --> 01:34:20.505]  I don't know.
[01:34:35.326 --> 01:34:40.291]  He's a former Director of Advanced Space Programs, Star Wars Program, for the U.S.
[01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:47.739]  Air Force in the Ford-Carter Administrations when it was secret, and a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions over Vietnam.
[01:34:47.739 --> 01:34:53.244]  He holds a PhD in Aeronautics and Nuclear Engineering from the California Institute of Technology.
[01:34:54.005 --> 01:34:59.107]  And I've got a lot of questions for him dealing with radiation detectors here in the U.S.
[01:34:59.107 --> 01:35:00.467]  What does the average detector pick up?
[01:35:00.467 --> 01:35:01.667]  Is it just uranium?
[01:35:01.667 --> 01:35:02.668]  Plutonium?
[01:35:02.668 --> 01:35:04.308]  Could that get across the ocean?
[01:35:04.308 --> 01:35:09.330]  The winds have now shifted from the jet stream is continually going across.
[01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:11.510]  The prevailing winds are going across the Pacific towards the U.S.
[01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:12.431]  from Japan.
[01:35:12.431 --> 01:35:16.112]  But the low-level winds have turned to the south towards Tokyo.
[01:35:16.992 --> 01:35:24.254]  I know Dr. Bowman's been covering and following all of this, and he's a great asset, obviously, for the broadcast.
[01:35:24.254 --> 01:35:27.234]  He joins us via video Skype from his home.
[01:35:27.234 --> 01:35:38.556]  Dr. Bowman, watching what's happening, what's most important for us to know right now, and what's your view of the situation that the Japanese Prime Minister now says is deteriorating?
[01:35:38.556 --> 01:35:43.437]  He's excoriated Tokyo Power and Electric, saying that they basically kept things from him.
[01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.378]  It looks like they're
[01:35:47.598 --> 01:35:54.000]  Yes, indeed, and they should be concerned.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.641]  It's a good thing that that reactor is northeast of Tokyo and outside of the prevailing winds.
[01:36:02.641 --> 01:36:14.304]  That doesn't mean that radiation can't get down to Tokyo, and indeed some of it has, but they won't get the brunt of it.
[01:36:16.747 --> 01:36:33.476]  Now, the radiation, when it happens, and I have a feeling that before it's over now, there will probably be more radiation released than in Chernobyl.
[01:36:33.476 --> 01:36:36.978]  And that radiation, for the most part, is going to
[01:36:39.844 --> 01:36:52.850]  Go west, probably some northwest, and much of it hopefully dissipate over the Pacific Ocean.
[01:36:52.850 --> 01:37:04.396]  The radiation levels by the time they get to the Pacific coast of the United States will be pretty small.
[01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:22.691]  And Hawaii is more in line to get a larger dose and possibly, depending on where the jet stream is, Alaska.
[01:37:22.691 --> 01:37:32.520]  But there shouldn't be an enormous impact on the west coast of the continental United States.
[01:37:34.424 --> 01:37:36.785]  Which is good.
[01:37:36.785 --> 01:37:54.620]  But over a period of the next 50 years, it's liable to cause quite a few cancers in the continental United States just from this low level of fallout that we'll get from this.
[01:37:56.508 --> 01:37:59.349]  By the way, your question about detectors.
[01:37:59.349 --> 01:38:00.110]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:07.093]  Detectors don't care whether the stuff is coming from uranium or plutonium and it can't even tell you that.
[01:38:07.093 --> 01:38:17.117]  Detectors detect basically gamma rays or alpha rays and those can come from either uranium or plutonium.
[01:38:17.117 --> 01:38:20.498]  Well, to be specific, I phrased the question wrong.
[01:38:20.498 --> 01:38:21.399]  What I meant to say was
[01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:26.741]  Will they pick up the strontium, the radioactive iodine?
[01:38:26.741 --> 01:38:35.484]  I mean, I know they're giving off radiation, but aren't the effects of those not just the radiation, but also just that they're poisonous?
[01:38:35.484 --> 01:38:36.784]  Yes, they are.
[01:38:36.784 --> 01:38:48.568]  But again, you need very high-tech, expensive equipment to detect those specific
[01:38:51.277 --> 01:39:06.760]  chemicals yeah that was my point so so we won't necessarily know about that detector will not detect strontium-90 or cobalt or anything it'll just tell you how many gamma rays are getting in or something like that
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:18.107]  Yeah, well that was my concern from what I'd read as a layman, that a lot of these derivatives of the cooling process that we know are coming out in the steam, that it's hard to pick those up.
[01:39:18.107 --> 01:39:31.896]  So then when we see these silver detectors being held up in front of thousands of people in lines, do we know, when they say they're picking up strontium and all these things, I guess they have specific detectors for that?
[01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:57.450]  There are specific detectors but my guess is if they're getting great numbers of fairly simple detectors out to people that what it's really detecting is the effects of the Strontium-90 and they can't really tell you whether it's coming from Strontium-90.
[01:39:57.450 --> 01:39:58.351]  So it sounds like
[01:39:59.187 --> 01:40:04.371]  We don't know what's really going on if a lot of these, what are they, isotopes?
[01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:06.774]  What would you call these derivatives?
[01:40:06.774 --> 01:40:08.275]  Isotopes.
[01:40:08.275 --> 01:40:12.518]  They are, for the most part, they're
[01:40:15.936 --> 01:40:41.925]  Products of the the nuclear process and in some cases they're also in the raw uranium and so forth but some of these are byproducts of the process itself and are created
[01:40:42.945 --> 01:41:07.106]  While the power is being Generated so So those aren't inside the containment facility themselves, they're in the they're in the cooling pools or the the filters Both what I think we should be mostly concerned about as far as
[01:41:09.739 --> 01:41:29.830]  Radiation itself are the fuel rods in the containment buildings, but the Strontium-90 and Cesium-70 chemicals are in the spent fuel rods that are in the cooling pools.
[01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:33.252]  And of course, if they lose their cooling and
[01:41:35.407 --> 01:41:42.792]  Doctor, you've now had a chance to see, I would imagine, Building 3 blowing up yesterday.
[01:41:42.792 --> 01:41:44.313]  Have you seen that?
[01:41:58.783 --> 01:42:00.063]  Many, many, many times.
[01:42:16.108 --> 01:42:28.517]  But they're being somewhat nebulous knowing how government works and corporations work The statements coming out of Japan getting a little bit more frantic by the Prime Minister Obviously, they have a history of being deceptive.
[01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:33.020]  So we don't know this is true or not But what does it signify to you that they're now saying?
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:45.268]  Okay, we know rods have been exposed it for We know that there's been melting and partial meltdown this fire damaged reactor for that was decommissioned or not online
[01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:52.570]  What does it mean if the containment facilities have been breached?
[01:42:52.570 --> 01:43:00.312]  Well, they're already admitting that the containment facility was breached in Building 2, Reactor 2.
[01:43:00.312 --> 01:43:01.833]  Yes, so what does that signify?
[01:43:04.093 --> 01:43:19.004]  Well, it means that any radiation that is coming out of there from melted fuel rods is going to escape into the atmosphere.
[01:43:19.004 --> 01:43:21.106]  It's not going to be contained in the building.
[01:43:21.106 --> 01:43:22.647]  No.
[01:43:22.647 --> 01:43:28.671]  And so then you, that's why the situation is approaching a
[01:43:31.673 --> 01:43:53.174]  Category 7 or Chernobyl condition And we've got new reports out that they're bracing for more explosions right now That's always a possibility because those Those reactors
[01:43:54.969 --> 01:44:02.373]  You know, you get, they're trying to cool them with seawater.
[01:44:02.373 --> 01:44:10.277]  Then you get the seawater, the water goes, level goes down, the things get hot.
[01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:14.039]  Pour water in, you get enormous release of steam.
[01:44:14.039 --> 01:44:23.064]  If they don't control the pressure properly by venting it, then you get explosions again.
[01:44:24.918 --> 01:44:28.620]  And this time we've got partially exposed containment at two.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:31.422]  They're saying probably four.
[01:44:31.422 --> 01:44:37.485]  Swiss News is reporting the Japanese government is bracing for quote radioactive catastrophe.
[01:44:37.485 --> 01:44:43.689]  It looks like that they're basically getting people ready slowly so they don't panic for the announcement that
[01:44:44.489 --> 01:44:47.231]  Uranium may be getting out of there.
[01:44:47.231 --> 01:44:54.215]  How bad is it to have the MOX Mark 1 plutonium-based uranium reactor?
[01:44:54.215 --> 01:45:00.860]  How much more deadly is it to have a plutonium-based reactor than just a uranium?
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:08.665]  Well, the MOX, which is mixed oxide, it's a mixture of uranium oxide and plutonium oxide.
[01:45:08.665 --> 01:45:11.207]  And, of course, plutonium
[01:45:14.654 --> 01:45:43.275]  is more deadly when it is breathed into the body and tiny plutonium particles get stuck in the lungs and then the radiation from those tiny plutonium particles continues then for years and can do enormous damage to the body and that's
[01:45:46.278 --> 01:45:52.342]  Something that is particularly of interest.
[01:45:52.342 --> 01:45:55.203]  Now, uranium can do the same thing.
[01:45:55.203 --> 01:46:06.390]  We have seen similar kinds of damage from depleted uranium in the war zones to our own troops.
[01:46:07.150 --> 01:46:08.210]  Well, that was my next point.
[01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:18.453]  We have this cavalier attitude towards DU, detectors picking it up all over the world when thousands of tons were used in 2003, 2004, right through to today.
[01:46:18.453 --> 01:46:24.635]  And I don't trust our government or our media, if any of this did make it over to the West Coast, to tell us.
[01:46:24.635 --> 01:46:24.875]  And now,
[01:46:27.486 --> 01:46:29.807]  In fact, we've got a caller from Japan, Dr. Bowman.
[01:46:29.807 --> 01:46:31.227]  I want to go to this caller from Japan.
[01:46:31.227 --> 01:46:36.848]  Stay with us and see what Jack in Japan... I apologize, I hadn't seen that on the board to Jack.
[01:46:36.848 --> 01:46:37.869]  Jack, you're in Japan.
[01:46:37.869 --> 01:46:38.569]  What are you seeing?
[01:46:38.569 --> 01:46:40.269]  Where are you?
[01:46:40.269 --> 01:46:44.750]  Well, right now, Alex, I've got to tell you, first of all, it's just good to hear the sound of your voice.
[01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:46.191]  It's pretty much total bedlam here.
[01:46:48.755 --> 01:46:57.645]  Basically, pretty much everybody understands that the government is not really telling us the full and complete truth over the national.
[01:46:57.645 --> 01:47:03.031]  What we've got is our version of CNN, which is called NHK, over here.
[01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:10.539]  And all of my friends that I've talked to, they all know that we're facing a more serious situation than what the government is really telling us.
[01:47:11.159 --> 01:47:11.340]  I think?
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:33.401]  You know, real honest information about what's going on.
[01:47:33.401 --> 01:47:37.942]  They might look to some of the home webpages of the state governments.
[01:47:37.942 --> 01:47:53.846]  I've got some here, but I've also got... No, I did see in the news the Fukushima regional governor saying that, or prefect, saying that things are a lot worse than people are being told.
[01:47:53.846 --> 01:47:55.326]  You describe things as bedlam.
[01:47:56.967 --> 01:48:13.414]  Well, first of all, I just want to say to Mr. Bowman, I saw your interview on PrisonPlanet.tv and I thought it was very well spoken and a great interview and thank you so much for having the courage to stand up and speak out.
[01:48:13.414 --> 01:48:14.334]  I really appreciate that.
[01:48:17.876 --> 01:48:19.177]  Well, it's not that we live in fear.
[01:48:19.177 --> 01:48:19.657]  We live in power.
[01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:41.187]  We have firearms.
[01:48:41.187 --> 01:48:41.788]  We have food.
[01:48:41.788 --> 01:48:42.889]  We have gold.
[01:48:42.889 --> 01:48:43.810]  We have friends.
[01:48:43.810 --> 01:48:45.171]  We have truth.
[01:48:45.171 --> 01:48:46.092]  We are not weak.
[01:48:46.092 --> 01:48:47.994]  We are not dependent.
[01:48:47.994 --> 01:48:49.115]  Ants store food.
[01:48:49.115 --> 01:48:50.396]  Grasshoppers don't.
[01:48:50.396 --> 01:48:51.777]  Ants survive the winter.
[01:48:51.777 --> 01:48:53.579]  The grasshopper doesn't.
[01:48:53.579 --> 01:48:55.821]  But we've got you here from Japan.
[01:48:55.821 --> 01:48:57.763]  That's why I broke in over Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:48:57.763 --> 01:49:03.989]  Doctor, do you have any questions for the... Where are you in Japan, Jack?
[01:49:05.504 --> 01:49:11.389]  I'm about 200 clicks from the actual Fukushima event.
[01:49:11.389 --> 01:49:15.512]  And for those who don't know what a click is in military nomenclature, tell them.
[01:49:15.512 --> 01:49:19.415]  Sorry, it's about 200 kilometers from the actual event.
[01:49:19.415 --> 01:49:20.836]  So you're about 150 miles.
[01:49:20.836 --> 01:49:22.478]  Dr. Bowman, do you have any questions for him?
[01:49:24.166 --> 01:49:31.131]  Well, just to comment that Jack said that the government doesn't tell all the truth.
[01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:39.837]  I think part of the answer, too, is that the government doesn't even know all the truth because the dang corporations lie to the government.
[01:49:39.837 --> 01:49:43.980]  And, of course, which is exactly what happens in this country, too.
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:48.063]  Well, I would say that one of the most frightening aspects I've seen, Jack, and I want your take on this,
[01:49:49.048 --> 01:49:57.534]  Is the Prime Minister blew up at Tokyo Electric and Power and said they didn't tell him for hours when they had the first explosion or the second big one yesterday.
[01:49:57.534 --> 01:50:07.781]  And they went on to say that everybody evacuated a day and a half ago from Fukushima, that there were supposed to be 500 people there, it was down to 50, and that now 50 weren't even there.
[01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:12.504]  And the Prime Minister, quote, ordered the Tokyo Electric Power people back in.
[01:50:12.504 --> 01:50:14.606]  That doesn't sound too good, does it Dr. Bowman?
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:29.808]  No, it doesn't, because that's essentially a death warrant for those folks, and the Prime Minister is essentially saying, well, you know, I don't care, you know, you broke it, you fix it.
[01:50:29.808 --> 01:50:31.429]  It's a shame.
[01:50:31.429 --> 01:50:42.916]  You know, that's a 40-year-old reactor, and the new reactor designs can be evacuated and just left.
[01:50:43.716 --> 01:50:46.079]  And they'll take care of themselves and this won't happen.
[01:50:46.079 --> 01:50:47.561]  Alright, stay there Dr. Bowman.
[01:50:47.561 --> 01:50:48.603]  Jack, you stay there too.
[01:50:48.603 --> 01:50:50.445]  I want to come back and finish up with any other statements.
[01:50:50.445 --> 01:50:55.091]  By the way, the press is reporting it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:50:55.091 --> 01:50:57.735]  The mass exodus out of Tokyo has begun.
[01:50:57.735 --> 01:50:59.217]  This crisis just got a lot worse.
[01:51:01.573 --> 01:51:05.855]  Becoming a modern smoker is now easier and more cost-effective, thanks to Lecig.
[01:51:05.855 --> 01:51:08.496]  Traditional smokers the world over love Lecig.

[01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:01.914]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.914 --> 01:52:07.495]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.495 --> 01:52:12.517]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.517 --> 01:52:17.558]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.078 --> 01:52:23.322]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.322 --> 01:52:25.623]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.623 --> 01:52:30.426]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.426 --> 01:52:31.547]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.547 --> 01:52:34.629]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:38.252]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.252 --> 01:52:41.434]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.434 --> 01:52:43.655]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:43.655 --> 01:52:44.576]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:48.298 --> 01:52:52.441]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.441 --> 01:52:57.284]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.284 --> 01:53:00.727]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.727 --> 01:53:04.509]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[01:53:04.509 --> 01:53:08.432]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[01:53:08.432 --> 01:53:12.575]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[01:53:12.575 --> 01:53:13.596]  That's why you need...
[01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:16.670]  Sea Energy.

[01:54:30.902 --> 01:54:33.683]  By the way, you know potassium iodate's sold out all over the country.
[01:54:33.683 --> 01:54:37.164]  Dr. Bob Bowman's saying most of that radiation won't make it over here.
[01:54:37.164 --> 01:54:38.625]  He said some will.
[01:54:38.625 --> 01:54:44.547]  Long-term effects will just be increased cancers, which we already see because of all the nuclear testing and the rest of it.
[01:54:44.547 --> 01:54:51.470]  Now, I told listeners, because my wife bought it from Longevity, like a total balance thing, and she also bought kelp.
[01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:53.170]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.057 --> 01:55:16.658]  And so there.
[01:55:16.658 --> 01:55:19.099]  I don't even want to get into all of this.
[01:55:19.099 --> 01:55:26.522]  All I know is my wife's got a couple bottles she bought weeks ago, separately, and it's the kelp.
[01:55:26.522 --> 01:55:29.304]  And so technically it's not the iodine, but it is iodine kelp.
[01:55:29.994 --> 01:55:30.394]  I don't know.
[01:55:51.383 --> 01:55:53.385]  From the Fukushima event, I'm maybe, I guess, west by southwest.
[01:55:53.385 --> 01:55:54.667]  So just following the map.
[01:56:12.272 --> 01:56:16.093]  You wouldn't go directly diagonal southwest, kind of a little bit north of that.
[01:56:16.093 --> 01:56:20.834]  Well that's good because the winds are going a little bit south but they're mainly blowing out the sea.
[01:56:20.834 --> 01:56:28.776]  But we're getting reports that people are beginning to amass exodus out of Tokyo, which has a giant population.
[01:56:28.776 --> 01:56:31.196]  That would cause a disaster in its own right, wouldn't it?
[01:56:31.196 --> 01:56:38.618]  Because they're not going to have the infrastructure in the rural areas for millions of people if they start trying to leave, Dr. Bowman.
[01:56:38.618 --> 01:56:39.478]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:56:42.983 --> 01:56:59.236]  The one question I wanted to raise to Dr. Bowman was, if everybody started trying to get out of town in a hurried fashion, the expressways are all shut down and that would force everybody on the small local highways.
[01:57:00.357 --> 01:57:03.179]  It'd be pretty much gridlock in about an hour.
[01:57:03.179 --> 01:57:20.929]  But the question I've got for Dr. Bowman is, with the situation I have now being about, well, more or less 200 kilometers away from this event, is it a better idea for me to just hunker down and try to button up my house and close it all down and, you know, close all the windows and whatnot?
[01:57:20.929 --> 01:57:23.250]  Or should I go ahead and hit the road?
[01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:24.851]  What's your opinion at this point?
[01:57:27.239 --> 01:57:28.980]  Well, I don't know.
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:34.942]  You may be as safe there as you would be in the U.S.
[01:57:34.942 --> 01:57:43.946]  because of the direction you are, opposite to the way the wind's blowing, and also because of the topography.
[01:57:43.946 --> 01:57:50.849]  There's probably some pretty good mountains between you and Fukushima.
[01:57:50.849 --> 01:57:51.650]  Okay.
[01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:54.351]  And one other thing, just to give this out to Alex.
[01:57:55.515 --> 01:58:02.482]  We, uh, we, I've got the, uh, the local, the state government website up here in front of my face right now.
[01:58:02.482 --> 01:58:14.595]  And, um, on a normal day, we've got .000019, um, amount of, uh, millisieverts, or I'm not sure exactly how to put it, but radiation.
[01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:18.457]  And at this point, we've got .000501.
[01:58:18.457 --> 01:58:26.261]  So we're looking at basically 25 times the amount of normal radiation that comes in on any given day.
[01:58:26.261 --> 01:58:33.245]  So needless to say, with constant aftershocks and everything else, my wife and I are kind of living on pins and needles.
[01:58:33.245 --> 01:58:37.347]  So that's even where you're at, far away, it's showing that?
[01:58:37.347 --> 01:58:37.967]  Oh yeah.
[01:58:37.967 --> 01:58:39.929]  Wow, let's get Dr. Bowman's take on that.
[01:58:39.929 --> 01:58:44.171]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.717 --> 01:58:47.913]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.848 --> 01:58:55.391]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.391 --> 01:58:56.311]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.311 --> 01:58:59.734]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.734 --> 01:59:00.594]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.594 --> 01:59:05.477]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.477 --> 01:59:06.218]  It's true.
[01:59:06.218 --> 01:59:11.101]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.101 --> 01:59:11.921]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:15.504]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.504 --> 01:59:19.206]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.406 --> 01:59:20.206]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.206 --> 01:59:22.967]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.967 --> 01:59:26.649]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.649 --> 01:59:27.449]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.449 --> 01:59:31.591]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.591 --> 01:59:36.633]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:00:13.537 --> 02:00:17.738]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.738 --> 02:00:21.839]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.838 --> 02:00:40.220]  No, that's the headline at Drudge, also at InfoWars.com, RisenPlanet.com.
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:43.722]  Radiation levels soar after third nuke explosion, AP.
[02:00:43.722 --> 02:00:47.623]  Tokyo wind, radiation plume could reach capital by nightfall.
[02:00:47.623 --> 02:00:50.584]  Europe's energy commissioner calls it an apocalypse.
[02:00:50.584 --> 02:00:53.285]  Spike nuke-fueled pool may be boiling.
[02:00:53.285 --> 02:00:56.467]  Panic may dump water on pool by helicopter.
[02:00:56.467 --> 02:00:58.487]  Panic residents start to flee.
[02:00:58.487 --> 02:01:01.869]  AP, BBC, Kyoto, Reuters, all reporting.
[02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:14.699]  I mean, this is turning into a disaster on top of a disaster with the third most powerful earthquake recorded since the Richter scale, a 9.1 now upgraded as of Sunday.
[02:01:14.699 --> 02:01:16.260]  Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:19.483]  We'll continue to take calls so you can ask him or myself questions.
[02:01:19.483 --> 02:01:22.105]  Again, we're only talking about the Japanese situation.
[02:01:22.685 --> 02:01:24.907]  But, Dr. Bowman, I've been asking the questions.
[02:01:24.907 --> 02:01:33.273]  What are other points, as a degreed nuclear physicist, former head of the Star Wars program, that you think people should know about this situation?
[02:01:33.273 --> 02:01:43.881]  A, and B, my question, what do we expect if the plutonium and uranium does start to get out because of further fires and explosions, and does go into Tokyo?
[02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:51.267]  The report's estimated that over a million people have died in the aggregate in the last 25 years, just from what happened at Chernobyl.
[02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:58.882]  Yeah, and you'll have a similar situation.
[02:01:58.882 --> 02:02:07.006]  Perhaps not quite as bad because Chernobyl's fallout cloud went mainly over populated areas.
[02:02:07.006 --> 02:02:18.393]  By the way, I was in the Soviet Union at that time and didn't, you know, I was scheduled to go to Kiev and we didn't.
[02:02:18.393 --> 02:02:20.274]  We went to Leningrad instead and
[02:02:23.477 --> 02:02:30.240]  But you know, we were all in our group that were there making jokes, you know, what's chicken Kiev?
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.241]  And the answer is, I don't know, but it glows in the dark.
[02:02:33.241 --> 02:02:35.322]  Oh man.
[02:02:35.322 --> 02:02:37.903]  But yeah, that was sort of a scary situation.
[02:02:40.635 --> 02:02:56.063]  I think the point we need to take from this, in addition to really having empathy for the people of Japan, is to have some lessons learned for us here in the United States.
[02:02:56.063 --> 02:02:58.584]  We have these 40 year old
[02:03:00.151 --> 02:03:04.455]  reactor designs all over this country.
[02:03:04.455 --> 02:03:13.084]  We've got them on earthquake fault lines like San Onofre and Diablo Canyon.
[02:03:13.084 --> 02:03:16.688]  It almost seems like a prerequisite that they only build them on fault lines.
[02:03:18.342 --> 02:03:21.166]  Well, it often seems that way.
[02:03:21.166 --> 02:03:33.665]  Of course, fault lines tend to be along the coast, and when you're on the coast, you have sort of an unlimited supply of cooling water from the ocean.
[02:03:34.546 --> 02:03:54.232]  And now that water is supposed to go through a heat exchanger and cool the steam after it has driven the turbines, turn it back into water, which is then pumped back into the containment facility, becomes steam again and goes to drive the turbines.
[02:03:54.232 --> 02:04:02.754]  So the seawater is never supposed to get into the containment facility, but it is essential to the whole process
[02:04:03.334 --> 02:04:14.465]  To have a good supply of essentially free water available, the whole cycle really can't work without it.
[02:04:14.465 --> 02:04:19.950]  And that's why you find these things being built along the coast.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:35.110]  The seawater in the case of Japan is being pumped directly into the containment facility to try to cool those... That's been called a desperation move by the U.S.
[02:04:35.110 --> 02:04:35.510]  government.
[02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.091]  Is that a desperation move?
[02:04:37.091 --> 02:04:40.073]  Well, of course, because what it does is kill the reactor.
[02:04:41.054 --> 02:04:44.697]  Uh, the reactor can never again be used to generate power.
[02:04:44.697 --> 02:04:48.520]  Uh, the fuel rods are ruined.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:52.403]  Uh, everything in the reactor... Stay there, Dr. Bowman.
[02:04:52.403 --> 02:04:53.384]  Let's finish up with that.
[02:04:53.384 --> 02:04:54.965]  Take phone calls on the other side.
[02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:57.267]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:05:00.936 --> 02:05:04.758]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:05:04.758 --> 02:05:09.039]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:05:09.039 --> 02:05:13.861]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:19.684]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:05:19.684 --> 02:05:26.727]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:05:29.464 --> 02:05:35.009]  I'm looking for America.
[02:05:35.009 --> 02:05:36.630]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:39.312]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:05:39.312 --> 02:05:43.755]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[02:05:43.755 --> 02:05:48.299]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:05:55.433 --> 02:06:00.003]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:06:01.969 --> 02:06:09.011]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:06:09.011 --> 02:06:11.672]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:06:11.672 --> 02:06:20.715]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:06:20.715 --> 02:06:28.978]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:06:28.978 --> 02:06:30.538]  Move quickly while you can still afford
[02:06:33.288 --> 02:06:33.748]  I think so.
[02:07:04.545 --> 02:07:05.786]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.786 --> 02:07:09.728]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.728 --> 02:07:11.950]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:17.834]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.834 --> 02:07:24.058]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.498 --> 02:07:30.481]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:34.643]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.643 --> 02:07:38.945]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.945 --> 02:07:44.888]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.888 --> 02:07:48.430]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:50.411]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.411 --> 02:07:50.851]  It's here.

[02:08:10.554 --> 02:08:12.135]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.135 --> 02:08:13.676]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.676 --> 02:08:17.879]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.879 --> 02:08:21.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.583 --> 02:08:41.388]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, eight minutes into hour number three today.
[02:08:41.388 --> 02:08:44.752]  We will undoubtedly go into overdrive to take more of your calls into the fourth hour.
[02:08:44.752 --> 02:08:55.141]  Dr. Bob Bowman, three degrees in nuclear physics and aeronautics, former head of the Star Wars program, is our guest for another 15 minutes or so.
[02:08:55.141 --> 02:08:59.305]  We're about to go back to your calls, but Dr. Bowman, here's the $64 million question.
[02:09:00.626 --> 02:09:02.087]  We know there's been a cover-up.
[02:09:02.087 --> 02:09:03.448]  That's now admitted.
[02:09:03.448 --> 02:09:06.949]  Giant explosions, four of them at least now.
[02:09:06.949 --> 02:09:13.212]  Fires, containment two is breached, but they won't say how breached.
[02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:16.034]  Containment four may be breached.
[02:09:16.034 --> 02:09:17.475]  What happens once it's breached?
[02:09:17.475 --> 02:09:19.636]  I mean, if that stuff's melting inside, then it would start
[02:09:20.256 --> 02:09:21.997]  Well what happens is that the uh... uh...
[02:09:51.124 --> 02:10:03.772]  The molten fuel rods eventually burn or have explosions, outgas one way or another.
[02:10:03.772 --> 02:10:17.960]  It becomes gaseous and goes out through the containment building and into the atmosphere and that's when you get the enormous spread of radiation.
[02:10:21.772 --> 02:10:39.946]  Again, we in this country have all of these old nuclear reactors, many on fault lines and on the ocean as we've talked about, and I have called for some time for
[02:10:41.364 --> 02:10:54.435]  First, no new nuclear reactors because even with a relatively safe nuclear reactor, we still don't know how to get rid of the high-level radioactive waste safely.
[02:10:54.435 --> 02:10:56.997]  But I also call for a
[02:10:59.819 --> 02:11:04.141]  Gradual upgrade of the existing plants.
[02:11:04.141 --> 02:11:10.923]  We can't shut all the nuclear power plants down now because we depend on that electricity.
[02:11:10.923 --> 02:11:16.025]  You've got the grid that goes out from them.
[02:11:16.025 --> 02:11:23.769]  We're dependent on them, but you can shut down a reactor and replace it with a modern new reactor, which is fail-safe.
[02:11:25.069 --> 02:11:28.050]  And then after you got it going, you shut down another reactor.
[02:11:28.050 --> 02:11:31.832]  As a nuclear physicist, what new design do you think is the safest?
[02:11:31.832 --> 02:11:35.133]  The light pebble?
[02:11:35.133 --> 02:11:36.394]  Well, uh...
[02:11:39.102 --> 02:11:59.928]  I think we ought to take a look at France and their experience because they have implemented new designs, they have experience with them, and we can make a study and see with our conditions just what the best design would be.
[02:12:02.731 --> 02:12:16.420]  The important part of any of the fail-safe designs is that without electricity and losing all control
[02:12:18.097 --> 02:12:25.219]  Uh, the thing shuts itself down, cools itself down, and becomes dormant.
[02:12:25.219 --> 02:12:38.562]  And if it can't do that without electricity and pumping water in and so forth, then it's not a fail-safe design, and that's what we have to look for, particularly in these places
[02:12:39.342 --> 02:12:43.065]  Like Diablo Canyon and San Onofre that are especially vulnerable.
[02:12:43.065 --> 02:12:48.129]  When you're in studio next month, when you visit Austin, we will break that down more.
[02:12:48.129 --> 02:12:52.772]  But before we go to these calls, because I want to get to them, Dr. Bowman, the limited time we have.
[02:12:52.772 --> 02:13:02.019]  Statistically, studying history, these Mark I designs, some of the other old designs, 39, 40-year-old designs that are in place at the Fukushima disaster site.
[02:13:04.406 --> 02:13:12.151]  Generally, now that we know that one, guaranteed, two, maybe, have been breached in the containment, what generally is going to happen?
[02:13:12.151 --> 02:13:19.996]  And how much of that plutonium or uranium is going to make its way down to Tokyo?
[02:13:19.996 --> 02:13:25.940]  Oh, I'd say a tiny fraction of 1% would make its way to Tokyo.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:27.581]  Most of it will go west.
[02:13:30.982 --> 02:13:35.978]  Uh, you know, 1% of a big number is still a lot, and it can still do a lot of damage.
[02:13:38.446 --> 02:13:55.874]  I am going, starting the end of April, day after Easter as a matter of fact, on a trip from Florida to California and back, and then later in the summer covering the eastern half of the country.
[02:13:55.874 --> 02:14:04.478]  And people can go to my website, they can see my phone number, they can email me from wherever you are and ask
[02:14:05.818 --> 02:14:10.481]  Are you coming here and can we organize a speaking event?
[02:14:10.481 --> 02:14:17.445]  I'm hoping somebody picks up the ball in Austin and San Antonio and organizes speaking events for me there.
[02:14:17.445 --> 02:14:19.826]  Now sir, absolutely.
[02:14:19.826 --> 02:14:23.949]  So folks can contact you there since you're traveling the country and that's important.
[02:14:23.949 --> 02:14:26.971]  But what I want to nail down here is explain to me directions because
[02:14:27.911 --> 02:14:50.669]  uh... the jet stream goes from west to east around the world so it goes over japan and then to the western united states and back around the globe and so some news reports say that uh... when it's going to the east it's going to the u s we know that's the direction of some of it but then you just called it to the west and i understand technically it's the western side of the u s but it is east
[02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:53.757]  From Japan, because it's on the other side of the world.
[02:14:53.757 --> 02:14:58.672]  I mean, what technically do we call that jet stream going over Japan towards the U.S.
[02:14:58.672 --> 02:14:59.113]  west coast?
[02:15:00.455 --> 02:15:21.788]  Well, there's only one jet stream and it's like a serpent, it goes all the way around the world, but sometimes it goes from Japan up the Aleutians and Alaska and down to Canada and then dips down sometimes all the way to Mexico and then up the East Coast.
[02:15:21.788 --> 02:15:22.949]  But the point is the reactor...
[02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:33.174]  But the reactor, most of it's going out to sea, what would be called the East of Japan, but some of the media, as you said, calls it to the West of Japan.
[02:15:33.174 --> 02:15:37.155]  But technically, it's East of Japan going towards the United States.
[02:15:37.155 --> 02:15:37.776]  Absolutely.
[02:15:37.776 --> 02:15:45.439]  I'm sorry, if I said West, you know, I'm thinking, you know, Tokyo is West and... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:45.439 --> 02:15:51.582]  The media keeps saying to the West as well, because I guess technically we think of Japan to the East.
[02:15:52.222 --> 02:15:58.526]  But I've seen it in AccuWeather, AP Reuters saying the same thing, so I was thinking I was making a mistake.
[02:15:58.526 --> 02:15:59.947]  No, no.
[02:15:59.947 --> 02:16:02.568]  The shortest way to Japan from here is west.
[02:16:02.568 --> 02:16:03.849]  Yes.
[02:16:03.849 --> 02:16:08.532]  And so, yeah, the radiation is coming toward us.
[02:16:08.532 --> 02:16:13.996]  It'll hit us first and then it'll go on and it'll hit Europe and the rest of Asia.
[02:16:13.996 --> 02:16:14.516]  After all,
[02:16:16.397 --> 02:16:22.642]  The radiation from Chernobyl went all the way around and got to the United States.
[02:16:22.642 --> 02:16:27.225]  The levels were very low by the time it got here, but it did get here.
[02:16:34.567 --> 02:16:43.973]  Uh, they're reporting that these things melt down over a while and just kind of off gas, that explosions, uh, you know, generally with the rods themselves aren't that, aren't that common.
[02:16:43.973 --> 02:16:47.115]  But, but how do you statistically see this playing out now?
[02:16:47.115 --> 02:16:49.096]  I mean, how long will this event be going on?
[02:16:49.096 --> 02:16:49.457]  Weeks?
[02:16:49.457 --> 02:16:49.717]  Months?
[02:16:52.822 --> 02:16:58.571]  Well, it could be over in a week or two.
[02:16:58.571 --> 02:17:04.780]  It could play out for a very long time and
[02:17:07.731 --> 02:17:14.412]  There are radiation occasionally still coming out of Chernobyl, so who knows?
[02:17:14.412 --> 02:17:32.015]  But when I was talking about the show, I never gave out the website, and I do want people to be able to go there and get my email address and whatnot, but thepatriots.us, if you would give that out once or twice when you get a chance, I'd appreciate it.
[02:17:32.015 --> 02:17:34.136]  We haven't done that for the whole hour.
[02:17:34.136 --> 02:17:35.396]  Absolutely, give it out right now!
[02:17:36.969 --> 02:17:38.112]  ThePatriots.us
[02:17:42.967 --> 02:17:50.873]  When you get to that website, you can get my email address, you know, just bob at the patriots dot us.
[02:17:50.873 --> 02:17:51.394]  Absolutely.
[02:17:51.394 --> 02:17:53.215]  You're launching a new speaking turn.
[02:17:53.215 --> 02:17:54.476]  You're a powerful speaker.
[02:17:54.476 --> 02:18:05.805]  You spoke at our big 9-11 event that C-SPAN carried, and certainly folks can line that up there and watch a lot of great videos and presentations on a host of important issues that you cover, Dr. Bowman.
[02:18:05.805 --> 02:18:10.828]  Let's jam in a few calls, because I'm going to skip this break, this network break, so we can get a few of these in.
[02:18:10.828 --> 02:18:12.530]  Josh in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:15.971]  You're on the air with Dr. Bob Bowman and Alex Jones, worldwide.
[02:18:15.971 --> 02:18:17.012]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:18:17.012 --> 02:18:18.012]  Good.
[02:18:18.012 --> 02:18:19.673]  So I want to bring up, I want to make two points.
[02:18:19.673 --> 02:18:25.336]  One is, um, what, uh, another, another supplement that can be used too is also liquid chlorophyll.
[02:18:25.336 --> 02:18:33.719]  That's also, you know, extremely important for helping cleanse the blood, uh, as well as everything else that, uh, I forget, the Benjamin Fuchs said as well.
[02:18:33.719 --> 02:18:34.780]  So that's one.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:38.582]  The other thing I want to ask you is, um, and this can be for, for, for both of you.
[02:18:38.582 --> 02:18:41.283]  What do you think, you know, we talk a lot about how, um,
[02:18:42.003 --> 02:18:58.911]  Well, they're going to use it to shut down coal plants and nuclear power plants and further strangle our energy system.
[02:18:58.911 --> 02:19:02.353]  They're using it as a distraction from the bedlam in the Middle East.
[02:19:02.353 --> 02:19:05.574]  Dr. Bowman, what's your view on the Middle East situation?
[02:19:05.574 --> 02:19:09.336]  I mean, they admit MI6, British intelligence is all over this.
[02:19:09.336 --> 02:19:10.817]  What's the endgame there from your view?
[02:19:13.177 --> 02:19:31.683]  Well, I'm afraid the New World Order is attempting to use this to subvert these revolutions and get control and put yet another puppet strongman in each of those places so that they can continue to exploit the resources.
[02:19:33.604 --> 02:19:36.185]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[02:19:36.185 --> 02:19:41.947]  My speaking tour is talking basically about the end of empire.
[02:19:41.947 --> 02:19:51.852]  What we need is a totally new foreign and military policy which abandons this thing of puppet
[02:19:52.032 --> 02:19:52.273]  Yeah.
[02:20:08.871 --> 02:20:10.512]  A no-fly zone in Libya?
[02:20:10.512 --> 02:20:21.820]  Well, I dearly hope that that's all we do and that we don't subvert the whole thing and... Oh, there's already special forces.
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:24.822]  ...make it into a CIA-controlled revolution.
[02:20:24.822 --> 02:20:25.963]  Yeah, they're already on the ground.
[02:20:25.963 --> 02:20:28.485]  They've been... SAS has been caught.
[02:20:28.485 --> 02:20:37.231]  It's... So, I mean... I'm calling for us to end the wars, bring all our troops home,
[02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:45.451]  Well, that would fix the deficit.
[02:20:45.451 --> 02:20:46.372]  We don't have much time.
[02:20:46.372 --> 02:20:48.394]  Let's move to more callers, Dr. Bowman.
[02:20:48.394 --> 02:20:49.035]  Stay there.
[02:20:49.035 --> 02:20:49.836]  Tim in Germany.
[02:20:49.836 --> 02:20:52.279]  Questions for Dr. Bob Bowman or myself or comments?
[02:20:53.493 --> 02:21:16.157]  Question for you, or suggestion, I would suggest the Infowarriors you are helping and instructing and informing should get onto forums or chats in Japan, and for example link the article he had yesterday on the CIA helping in the cover-up, because I think there is a big evidence of a cover-up with the media.
[02:21:16.157 --> 02:21:22.138]  My example for that is whenever the Reactor 3 exploded, the one that you
[02:21:23.587 --> 02:21:29.617]  Uh, so worried about the size of the explosion on NHK World, a Japanese TV station.
[02:21:29.617 --> 02:21:36.527]  They constantly, while this was happening, presumably, or shortly before, they showed the
[02:21:39.403 --> 02:21:43.587]  There's no doubt that they've been trying to play this thing down the whole time to not create panic.
[02:21:43.587 --> 02:21:48.491]  The problem is then they lose all credibility later when they're proven to be liars.
[02:22:03.183 --> 02:22:08.447]  And they don't really know what's going on because they've all basically evacuated from the Fukushima facility.
[02:22:08.447 --> 02:22:11.068]  I mean, how scary is that?
[02:22:11.068 --> 02:22:23.417]  And at the same time, though, it's better just to tell the truth so folks have confidence in what they're being told, so you don't lose total confidence in an emergency, and so people have time to actually get prepared and move into safe areas.
[02:22:23.417 --> 02:22:30.621]  Now that it's getting late and that radioactive cloud they're reporting will be hitting very soon in Tokyo, that's Associated Press.
[02:22:30.621 --> 02:22:32.943]  Now they don't have time to get ready, so it will cause more
[02:22:33.283 --> 02:22:34.044]  Panic.
[02:22:34.044 --> 02:22:35.564]  Very interesting points, Tim.
[02:22:35.564 --> 02:22:40.247]  Comments on what Tim was saying from Deutschland, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:22:40.247 --> 02:22:49.572]  No, I just agree, but, you know, asking governments, any governments, to tell the truth, boy, that's a toughie.
[02:22:49.572 --> 02:22:52.053]  We haven't had a government like that in a long time.
[02:22:52.053 --> 02:22:56.675]  Yeah, Kennedy told the truth quite a bit and they blew his head off.
[02:22:56.675 --> 02:22:57.656]  That's right.
[02:22:57.656 --> 02:22:58.356]  That's right.
[02:22:58.356 --> 02:23:00.177]  Only got a few minutes left with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:23:00.177 --> 02:23:01.318]  Tim, anything else from Germany?
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:08.189]  Yeah, what I wonder about, what they don't get managed, what's really frustrating is me.
[02:23:08.189 --> 02:23:18.304]  They're now thinking about dumping water from helicopters, which was a step that was needed three, four days ago, where they still could have, let's say, blown holes into the roofs and dumped it.
[02:23:19.011 --> 02:23:29.714]  And I wonder why, and I think it's a huge negligence they're showing there, they could have moved firefighting ships like they use in harbor fires or so, in industrial complexes.
[02:23:29.714 --> 02:23:35.936]  Well, see, I think previously they still had people there, so they were pumping it in with generator pumps with water, see?
[02:23:35.936 --> 02:23:39.477]  So, but I appreciate your call, interesting points.
[02:23:39.477 --> 02:23:47.439]  What could they have done better from your, you know, hindsight's 20-20, Dr. Bauman, but from your watching, this is an expert in these issues, what could they have done better?
[02:23:49.482 --> 02:24:00.517]  Well, I agree that using helicopter dumps earlier might have helped as soon as the roof was blown off the building.
[02:24:00.517 --> 02:24:00.917]  Why not?
[02:24:06.831 --> 02:24:07.312]  I don't know.
[02:24:07.312 --> 02:24:10.795]  It's asking a lot of the helicopter crews.
[02:24:10.795 --> 02:24:10.996]  Well...
[02:24:24.648 --> 02:24:29.152]  The water is just to cool them down so they don't melt.
[02:24:29.152 --> 02:24:38.880]  The neutralization, there are some things that they can dump in there that will help, but the water is the most important thing right now.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.822]  Alright, I've only got a couple minutes left with you.
[02:24:40.822 --> 02:24:43.304]  Let's talk to Kelly in Louisiana.
[02:24:43.304 --> 02:24:46.126]  Kelly in Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:46.126 --> 02:24:48.989]  Hi Alex, I'm Kelly and I'm calling from New Orleans.
[02:24:48.989 --> 02:24:50.130]  I'm a first time caller.
[02:24:50.808 --> 02:24:56.090]  And I'm sorry to go off topic, but there's another disaster that's going on here in the Gulf.
[02:24:56.090 --> 02:25:02.332]  Spring break is approaching, and all the college kids are coming down to the beaches, and the waters are contaminated.
[02:25:02.332 --> 02:25:06.594]  They're still contaminated from the oil and the Corexit that has been sprayed on us.
[02:25:07.449 --> 02:25:12.633]  Residents have internal bleeding, seizures, and unexplained bacterial infections.
[02:25:12.633 --> 02:25:17.536]  Yeah, Kelly, that's just like what we saw with the air is safe to breathe on Ground Zero.
[02:25:17.536 --> 02:25:22.540]  This is what governments and corporations do because they don't want to spend the money to try to mitigate things.
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:26.103]  They just tell you out of sight, out of mind, and then your kid gets cancer.
[02:25:26.103 --> 02:25:29.685]  I appreciate your call, but we're not really in that issue right now.
[02:25:29.685 --> 02:25:31.346]  We're covering what's, but it does tie together.
[02:25:31.346 --> 02:25:31.807]  Dr. Bowman,
[02:25:33.708 --> 02:25:42.751]  I'm reading that children, I guess because they have fast-growing cells, are the most affected and embryos and gestating babies.
[02:25:42.751 --> 02:25:43.431]  Why is that?
[02:25:43.431 --> 02:25:46.392]  Because they're fast-growing cells?
[02:25:46.392 --> 02:25:48.753]  Sure.
[02:25:48.753 --> 02:26:01.098]  Yeah, they're much more sensitive to anything which could disrupt the process of cell reproduction and especially cancer.
[02:26:02.663 --> 02:26:11.708]  The numbers I've seen in Chernobyl are around a million have died from complications in 25 years and you're saying this is approaching Chernobyl just from the outside?
[02:26:13.783 --> 02:26:16.485]  Yes, I think so.
[02:26:16.485 --> 02:26:26.973]  It may never cause as many deaths as Chernobyl because of the fact that a lot of the radiation will dissipate over the Pacific Ocean.
[02:26:26.973 --> 02:26:37.721]  But on the other hand, it is possible that the end result is a release of considerably more radiation than came out of Chernobyl.
[02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:40.444]  So, it's not going to be nice.
[02:26:41.825 --> 02:26:45.579]  And we can expect government cover-up like we saw the Russians do in the 1980s.
[02:26:47.609 --> 02:26:48.189]  Absolutely.
[02:27:17.949 --> 02:27:19.109]  They could get a lot worse.
[02:27:19.109 --> 02:27:24.811]  Dr. Bowman, we will stay in continual contact, probably have you pop back in, in the next few days.
[02:27:24.811 --> 02:27:27.832]  Again, give us your website one more time.
[02:27:27.832 --> 02:27:31.853]  ThePatriots.us.
[02:27:31.853 --> 02:27:37.935]  Patriots is plural, and don't forget the T-H-E, because if you leave that off, you get the football team.
[02:27:37.935 --> 02:27:38.495]  Absolutely.
[02:27:38.495 --> 02:27:43.317]  We will be talking to you very, very soon, and hope to have you in studio when you come in April.
[02:27:43.317 --> 02:27:45.858]  So folks, you need to get hooked up with that in Austin to get you to town.
[02:27:45.858 --> 02:27:46.738]  We'll talk to you soon, sir.
[02:27:47.498 --> 02:27:47.878]  Thank you.
[02:27:47.878 --> 02:27:50.982]  Alright, there goes Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:27:50.982 --> 02:28:01.532]  We have another radiation issue that was in USA Today last Friday, and that was 10 times the radiation that the TSA had previously claimed is being released from the detectors.
[02:28:01.532 --> 02:28:04.635]  For a year, they refused to give Congress their test.
[02:28:06.385 --> 02:28:16.353]  Now they've released them, TSA, to reset airport body scanners for radiation, and they report they're 10 times they previously claimed, and that's probably a whitewash as well.
[02:28:16.353 --> 02:28:26.841]  Just another example of how they say DU's good, they don't have any radiology tests at the scanners, they've got high-powered highway scanners going out on the streets, and they have the TSA workers
[02:28:27.930 --> 02:28:31.352]  Standing under those, I mean, they're murdering these people.
[02:28:31.352 --> 02:28:33.373]  And I'm not going in your cooker.
[02:28:33.373 --> 02:28:38.755]  And don't look at me like I'm a crazy man when I go through the airport, you go in the body scanner and I say no!
[02:28:38.755 --> 02:28:42.017]  You don't follow OSHA, plus it violates my Fourth Amendment.
[02:28:42.017 --> 02:28:48.100]  If you're stupid enough to be, and this just happened, by the way, when I was traveling.
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:49.861]  I went over to him and talked to him about it.
[02:28:49.861 --> 02:28:51.081]  I said, don't you understand what's happening?
[02:28:51.081 --> 02:28:52.262]  Well, they would not even talk to me.
[02:28:52.912 --> 02:28:54.893]  They were, and they look completely freaked out.
[02:28:54.893 --> 02:29:00.034]  Look, you can't just wave a magic wand and say radiation ain't gonna do anything.
[02:29:00.034 --> 02:29:01.635]  You know, oh, get cuffed, military!
[02:29:01.635 --> 02:29:02.335]  Use DU!
[02:29:02.335 --> 02:29:02.875]  Gut up!
[02:29:02.875 --> 02:29:03.716]  You know, breathe it in!
[02:29:03.716 --> 02:29:04.476]  You're men!
[02:29:04.476 --> 02:29:10.758]  So we're gonna be breaking that down, continuing with your phone calls.
[02:29:10.758 --> 02:29:13.059]  I said I'd get to this this hour, but I'll have to cover it tomorrow.
[02:29:13.059 --> 02:29:16.300]  Obama has announced a raft of new anti-gun garbage.
[02:29:17.987 --> 02:29:20.448]  And he's launching it against the American people.
[02:29:20.448 --> 02:29:23.810]  And they're going to blame the violence in Mexico on our guns.
[02:29:23.810 --> 02:29:31.194]  And it turns out, red-handed, for two years, they've been shipping guns into Mexico, the ATF has, to then track them back and claim we're causing it.
[02:29:31.194 --> 02:29:37.597]  That's CBS News, that's The Examiner, and it is an Obama government false flag against the Second Amendment.
[02:29:37.597 --> 02:29:42.120]  And a lot of folks are calling for the impeachment of Obama, the Attorney General, and Janet Napolitano.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.101]  These are hardcore criminals.
[02:29:45.171 --> 02:29:47.252]  They set this up to blame our Second Amendment.
[02:29:47.252 --> 02:29:51.435]  They are terrorists.
[02:29:51.435 --> 02:29:52.836]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.836 --> 02:29:55.357]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.357 --> 02:29:58.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.152 --> 02:30:02.794]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:30:53.514 --> 02:30:54.294]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.728 --> 02:31:05.271]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.271 --> 02:31:06.191]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.191 --> 02:31:09.614]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.614 --> 02:31:10.474]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.474 --> 02:31:15.377]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.377 --> 02:31:16.118]  It's true.
[02:31:16.118 --> 02:31:20.981]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.981 --> 02:31:21.821]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.821 --> 02:31:25.404]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.404 --> 02:31:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.306 --> 02:31:30.086]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.086 --> 02:31:32.848]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.848 --> 02:31:36.529]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.529 --> 02:31:37.329]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.329 --> 02:31:41.471]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.471 --> 02:31:46.533]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:01.818 --> 02:32:08.840]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:11.520]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:20.542]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:32:20.542 --> 02:32:28.804]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:32:28.804 --> 02:32:29.684]  Move quickly while
[02:32:29.744 --> 02:32:30.044]  I think so.
[02:33:03.982 --> 02:33:05.283]  We're good to go.
[02:33:34.229 --> 02:33:35.290]  We are back live.
[02:33:35.290 --> 02:33:38.594]  I'll be doing overdrive for your phone calls.
[02:33:38.594 --> 02:33:42.177]  Gord, Gerald, Paul, Will, Donna.
[02:33:42.177 --> 02:33:48.103]  We've got a guest in studio who was already scheduled before this whole crisis began, but it ties into radiation.
[02:33:48.103 --> 02:33:52.027]  TSA to resist airport body scanners for radiation.
[02:33:52.908 --> 02:34:04.541]  And in the report, for a year, Homeland Security wouldn't give Congress, under orders, that's the government, the elected government, wouldn't give them the information on their internal tests.
[02:34:04.541 --> 02:34:06.543]  They're supposed to do monthly radiology tests.
[02:34:06.543 --> 02:34:07.925]  Turns out they weren't doing it.
[02:34:07.925 --> 02:34:12.010]  Then when they did, they found ten times the safe levels.
[02:34:12.010 --> 02:34:13.631]  Because, I mean, why do the companies care?
[02:34:14.332 --> 02:34:14.472]  I think?
[02:34:33.862 --> 02:34:45.971]  When we put a little video together from his radio show, or he was guesting on Leo Laporte's technology show, it's very popular, heard by millions, and dealing with the hands down the pants.
[02:34:45.971 --> 02:34:57.519]  Now, this had happened to my employees, this had happened to people all over the news, back last fall and winter, and the media was still denying it until it happened to more and more reporters and more and more people, and it was...
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:34:59.560]  Owen J.J.
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:09.983]  Stone, known as the O-Doctor, it was his report that finally broke it out into the mainstream media, and he's here for South by Southwest in Austin.
[02:35:09.983 --> 02:35:11.343]  And of course, Owen J.J.
[02:35:11.343 --> 02:35:24.786]  Stone, also known as O-Doctor, hosts his own show, Odoctor.com, and frequently makes appearances on This Week in Tech with Cranky Geeks, Scam School, NSFW, and Beer Diplomacy.
[02:35:24.786 --> 02:35:28.047]  He's also the founder of Inquiring Minds Media.
[02:35:28.707 --> 02:35:38.837]  And his Twitter is at Odocta, D-O-C-T-A-H, and we'll follow him at Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:35:38.837 --> 02:35:40.739]  We'll get that done right now.
[02:35:40.739 --> 02:35:52.871]  In fact, next hour, I will take your questions or your statements, one-line statements on the situation and do you, now they admit at least Reactor 2 has been the containment.
[02:35:53.331 --> 02:35:58.034]  A facility blew away and the internal seals have been broken.
[02:35:58.034 --> 02:36:03.236]  The Mark 1 also blew up yesterday, and they're saying it could be exposed.
[02:36:03.236 --> 02:36:05.838]  That's a plutonium-uranium reactor, very dangerous.
[02:36:05.838 --> 02:36:09.860]  40 years old, 40-year design, 39-year-old facility.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:15.643]  Six plants there, four of them have had fires or explosions.
[02:36:15.643 --> 02:36:17.224]  This is getting worse by the minute.
[02:36:17.224 --> 02:36:20.846]  People are starting to flee Tokyo with the radiation cloud making its way down there.
[02:36:21.406 --> 02:36:22.067]  Here's AP.
[02:36:22.067 --> 02:36:26.109]  Radiation level soars after Japan nuke plant fire.
[02:36:26.109 --> 02:36:28.331]  But then it's just radiation, radiation, radiation.
[02:36:28.331 --> 02:36:32.874]  The TSA now is rolling out at checkpoints, at train stations, bus stations.
[02:36:32.874 --> 02:36:38.037]  They have high-powered radiation systems on the news with the National Guard and their TSA.
[02:36:38.037 --> 02:36:41.840]  2,000 arrests, Fox News reported, in one year in upstate New York.
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:49.305]  Searching citizens with newscasts of them driving under high-powered x-ray scanners that shoot through the metal of the car.
[02:36:49.305 --> 02:36:51.026]  I mean, that makes a chest x-ray look like a joke.
[02:36:51.586 --> 02:36:57.610]  So, it's not just a Fourth Amendment violator, it just shows how government's gone crazy.
[02:36:57.610 --> 02:37:11.520]  And, oh doctor, what, re-describe, well first off, what's your take on the whole disaster in Japan, and the cover-up that's now been exposed, and where this is going, and then we'll go back into your story at the hands of the TSA, and what's unfolded since then.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:13.061]  Um, so two things.
[02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:14.783]  First of all, thank you for having me on the show.
[02:37:14.783 --> 02:37:26.014]  Secondly, uh, the biggest thing is Japan is the third richest nation in the world and all this money we're about to throw at them and banks are gonna, you know, steal the money, hide the money, not send the money.
[02:37:26.014 --> 02:37:28.336]  Can I get some of that off the deficit that we owe them?
[02:37:28.336 --> 02:37:29.698]  The $565 billion we owe them.
[02:37:29.698 --> 02:37:33.782]  I mean, we're about to throw a lot of money at this problem and a lot of that money is gonna disappear.
[02:37:34.542 --> 02:37:40.187]  I would like someone to be keeping an eye on it so that we're not just throwing money away or throwing money at the problem.
[02:37:40.187 --> 02:37:45.912]  Secondly, hopefully this makes the government do something about nuclear plants that are clean and healthy and safe.
[02:37:45.912 --> 02:37:47.614]  There's nothing safe with an earthquake.
[02:37:47.614 --> 02:37:53.179]  So all the things I've heard for my whole lifetime of solar power, we're gonna do all these things that we're gonna do.
[02:37:53.579 --> 02:37:56.121]  Now it's time to start harnessing the sun, maybe, Mr. Obama.
[02:37:56.121 --> 02:37:58.623]  I mean, you keep telling me this is a job for the future?
[02:37:58.623 --> 02:38:03.466]  If a solar farm gets rocked by an earthquake, I don't have to worry about this radiation.
[02:38:03.466 --> 02:38:08.790]  I don't have to worry about the millions and millions of people that are going to die in the middle of the country or wherever these nuclear plants are.
[02:38:09.210 --> 02:38:13.955]  So there's a lot to be going on with this situation that people need to take a look at.
[02:38:13.955 --> 02:38:17.619]  We can sustain with green energy, but we talk about it, we don't do it.
[02:38:17.619 --> 02:38:27.751]  So, sad but true, something like this has to happen to make people realize that it's a dangerous world we live in and we can't just keep eating what people are feeding us because you'll end up sick.
[02:38:28.251 --> 02:38:29.751]  Well, I'm all for real green energy.
[02:38:29.751 --> 02:38:37.534]  The problem is everything the government rolls out are sweetheart deals with big corporations for mega farms that then don't transmit it long distance as well.
[02:38:37.534 --> 02:38:41.775]  The answer is tax incentives to have everybody go solar themselves.
[02:38:41.775 --> 02:38:44.155]  That's what I'm doing without the government.
[02:38:44.155 --> 02:38:47.516]  We need those incentives to be totally on no tax on that.
[02:38:47.516 --> 02:38:52.458]  And I'll guarantee you there'll be solar panels in every house and go decentralized.
[02:38:52.458 --> 02:38:53.738]  But the big boys don't like that.
[02:38:54.338 --> 02:38:58.781]  Case in point, my friend just got solar panels put on his home, paid for it himself.
[02:38:58.781 --> 02:39:01.063]  They won't come out to inspect it to connect it.
[02:39:01.063 --> 02:39:03.605]  He's not allowed to plug it in and start using it.
[02:39:03.605 --> 02:39:06.047]  Six months he's been waiting for an inspector to come out.
[02:39:06.047 --> 02:39:08.469]  After he's paid and bought, had them installed.
[02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.769]  Why?
[02:39:08.769 --> 02:39:12.412]  Because they don't want him- But you get it immediately if you put them in and tie it into the grid.
[02:39:12.412 --> 02:39:13.433]  Exactly.
[02:39:13.433 --> 02:39:14.113]  Exactly.
[02:39:14.113 --> 02:39:15.494]  They don't want you owning your own power.
[02:39:15.494 --> 02:39:19.517]  They don't want you saving your own money after you spent your hard-earned money on solar power.
[02:39:19.517 --> 02:39:22.640]  So it's all a scam and a system that, what you just said.
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:25.221]  The big boys want to keep the money to themselves.
[02:39:25.221 --> 02:39:33.786]  So again, a problem like this, a crisis like this, it puts a huge spotlight on the games that are played with green energy and everyone having green energy.
[02:39:33.786 --> 02:39:35.067]  Let's go back to that split shot.
[02:39:35.067 --> 02:39:36.828]  That looks good, guys.
[02:39:36.828 --> 02:39:37.508]  Wow.
[02:39:37.508 --> 02:39:38.309]  A great crew in there.
[02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:41.691]  Well, it's so good to have you here because I am a fan of the shows you do.
[02:39:41.691 --> 02:39:46.634]  I am a fan of This Week in Tech and everything you're doing.
[02:39:46.634 --> 02:39:49.816]  But this whole TSA thing does get down to radiation again.
[02:39:50.436 --> 02:39:56.578]  And before 1991 they wouldn't let the troops use DU because in all their studies they knew it would not only kill the enemy but kill them.
[02:39:56.578 --> 02:40:01.339]  It has a four and a half billion year half-life and is very radioactive and poisonous.
[02:40:01.339 --> 02:40:02.580]  Now they just use it.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:05.401]  Now they've got the scanners going on the streets much more powerful.
[02:40:05.401 --> 02:40:09.082]  Australia is going to put full body chest x-rays in now.
[02:40:09.082 --> 02:40:19.745]  I mean, since when did government and corporations wave a magic wand and suspend the laws of physics and radiology and break down what happened to you with the TSA?
[02:40:20.465 --> 02:40:24.430]  Um, well, we didn't have the body scanner situation where I was at because they didn't have those there.
[02:40:24.430 --> 02:40:25.451]  They're just the hands down the pants.
[02:40:25.451 --> 02:40:29.236]  They wanted to do the hands down the pants, and they wanted to take me in a private room to do it.
[02:40:29.236 --> 02:40:31.119]  They highly encouraged the private room.
[02:40:31.119 --> 02:40:32.140]  I refused the private room.
[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:34.583]  Probably because they wanted to rob your bags, because they've been caught.
[02:40:34.583 --> 02:40:36.145]  Or, whatever they wanted to do.
[02:40:36.725 --> 02:40:39.648]  I just know that criminals do things in the dark.
[02:40:39.648 --> 02:40:41.109]  You know, they don't do things in the middle of the day.
[02:40:41.109 --> 02:40:43.151]  Yeah, I don't want to be behind closed doors with these goons.
[02:40:43.151 --> 02:40:46.173]  Exactly, because anything can happen and you hear stories and everything's always different.
[02:40:46.173 --> 02:40:48.555]  A lot of people get killed, like that woman in Phoenix.
[02:40:48.555 --> 02:40:52.118]  They beat her to death and said she choked herself on her own handcuffs that were behind her back.
[02:40:52.378 --> 02:40:55.139]  Yeah, well, I don't want anything like that happening to me.
[02:40:55.139 --> 02:40:57.680]  Regardless of what people say, oh, skeptical, you can't believe it.
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:02.802]  All I know is that there's no reason for them to take me in a private room if there's nothing wrong with what they're gonna do.
[02:41:02.802 --> 02:41:08.365]  If your check is so thorough, so legal, so righteous, then stand out here and do it in front of everyone else.
[02:41:08.365 --> 02:41:10.086]  There's no reason to take me in a private room.
[02:41:10.086 --> 02:41:12.987]  I don't have guns, I don't have drugs, I don't have any kind of weaponry on me.
[02:41:12.987 --> 02:41:14.628]  I don't even travel with liquids.
[02:41:14.628 --> 02:41:18.369]  So there's no reason to, I need to go through my bag in private.
[02:41:18.369 --> 02:41:20.110]  So tell us where this airport was and what they did.
[02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:27.773]  This is the Oakland Airport and basically I wore the same clothes a week before flying through San Francisco.
[02:41:27.773 --> 02:41:28.394]  No check.
[02:41:28.394 --> 02:41:29.974]  I just walked through, didn't beep.
[02:41:29.974 --> 02:41:30.955]  Have a nice day, Mr. Stone.
[02:41:30.955 --> 02:41:39.098]  The next week they implemented their new rules with the same exact outfit and they had to put their hands in my pants and they do touch your junk, as it were.
[02:41:39.098 --> 02:41:41.419]  As funny as it sounds for people to say, but they do.
[02:41:41.419 --> 02:41:42.440]  They do that to Ventura.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:42.540]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:44.441]  I mean, that's why he's selling them.
[02:41:44.441 --> 02:41:44.681]  Yeah.
[02:41:44.681 --> 02:41:46.441]  I mean, people say, oh, they don't do that.
[02:41:46.441 --> 02:41:47.242]  I'm like, they do do that.
[02:41:47.802 --> 02:41:50.143]  Um, you know, it's uncomfortable.
[02:41:50.143 --> 02:41:52.083]  No, their manual says actually put pressure.
[02:41:52.083 --> 02:41:52.944]  They check it.
[02:41:52.944 --> 02:41:53.684]  They see what it is.
[02:41:53.684 --> 02:41:59.866]  Oh, let me, let me, they, they, they, I didn't get grabbed, but they were pushing on my stuff in the front and the back.
[02:41:59.866 --> 02:42:00.706]  I can't handle it.
[02:42:00.706 --> 02:42:01.387]  Yeah.
[02:42:01.387 --> 02:42:07.629]  So that's what Ventura said that he really couldn't stand on his word and children listening, but it is a medical turn.
[02:42:07.629 --> 02:42:11.790]  He said they went and press pressed into his quote anus.
[02:42:11.790 --> 02:42:14.731]  I mean, I mean, literally they stick their hand, but I mean, that's incredible.
[02:42:14.731 --> 02:42:14.871]  Yeah.
[02:42:15.051 --> 02:42:15.572]  That's worse.
[02:42:15.572 --> 02:42:16.733]  I mean, I would go crazy.
[02:42:16.733 --> 02:42:19.176]  I mean, yeah, it really makes you freak out.
[02:42:19.176 --> 02:42:20.677]  And the guy was very apologetic.
[02:42:20.677 --> 02:42:26.424]  And I'm like, if this is your job and you're OK with this job, how can you just keep saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:42:26.424 --> 02:42:27.685]  Why are you doing this?
[02:42:27.685 --> 02:42:33.152]  One, because maybe you couldn't pay me a million dollars to stick my hand in people's.
[02:42:33.672 --> 02:42:34.914]  Crack and grab their genitals.
[02:42:34.914 --> 02:42:35.775]  I mean, give me a break!
[02:42:35.775 --> 02:42:38.798]  And they're getting paid nothing to do it, which is the odd part.
[02:42:38.798 --> 02:42:41.101]  I mean, especially with the people that are checking children.
[02:42:41.101 --> 02:42:42.483]  My child has not flown.
[02:42:42.483 --> 02:42:43.223]  She's three.
[02:42:43.223 --> 02:42:44.645]  She won't fly until she's four or five.
[02:42:44.645 --> 02:42:51.553]  You know, this all started when Michelle here in the office with her eight-year-old and her year-and-a-half old, they were having men grabbing them.
[02:42:51.553 --> 02:42:52.474]  Who wants to touch children?
[02:42:53.055 --> 02:42:56.676]  Who wants to touch a child?
[02:42:56.676 --> 02:42:58.917]  It's embarrassing.
[02:42:58.917 --> 02:43:00.037]  It's disgusting.
[02:43:00.037 --> 02:43:04.419]  And that alone is the thing that freaks me out the most.
[02:43:04.419 --> 02:43:07.640]  If they wanted to search my child, I'd walk back out the airport.
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.701]  But now they're saying if you try to leave, they then arrest you.
[02:43:11.341 --> 02:43:15.486]  It's like, it's like, I'm gonna molest, you know, and then we're gonna do this and you're gonna put up with it.
[02:43:15.486 --> 02:43:19.151]  I'm either gonna be arrested or killed because nobody's touching my child.
[02:43:19.151 --> 02:43:20.633]  So they say, we're gonna do this to you.
[02:43:20.633 --> 02:43:29.504]  Yeah, and it's the thing about, a kid doesn't have that moral compass and... Well, it's now causing problems because kids are saying, I thought it's wrong, mommy.
[02:43:29.784 --> 02:43:31.164]  I thought it's wrong, Daddy.
[02:43:31.164 --> 02:43:31.865]  Exactly.
[02:43:31.865 --> 02:43:35.786]  You tell your kids, don't let strangers touch you or take you anywhere strange.
[02:43:35.786 --> 02:43:36.666]  Don't go with strangers.
[02:43:36.666 --> 02:43:38.547]  And as they said, I want to take your child into a room.
[02:43:38.547 --> 02:43:42.308]  And now we see the images of like four year old kids having their shirts taken off?
[02:43:42.308 --> 02:43:43.749]  That was, that was disgusting.
[02:43:43.749 --> 02:43:45.829]  Again, it wouldn't happen to me.
[02:43:45.829 --> 02:43:50.251]  I don't know, I don't know what kind of parents they are, but I saw the video tape where they made the little boy pull his shirt up.
[02:43:51.091 --> 02:43:51.812]  Okay.
[02:43:51.812 --> 02:43:52.992]  This is prisoner training.
[02:43:52.992 --> 02:43:54.273]  This is to break our will.
[02:43:54.273 --> 02:43:57.555]  What do you think of the public announcements that TSA is gonna be all over the streets?
[02:43:57.555 --> 02:44:02.738]  So you pull up to a checkpoint, and they're out there, and they're gonna make you drive under radiators.
[02:44:02.738 --> 02:44:04.239]  I'm just waiting for Egypt and America.
[02:44:05.455 --> 02:44:07.857]  I'm waiting for people to start rioting and burning things down.
[02:44:07.857 --> 02:44:10.019]  People think it's a joke, but that's gonna happen.
[02:44:10.019 --> 02:44:11.901]  At some point, you can only push people so far.
[02:44:11.901 --> 02:44:15.664]  I mean, the gas price is going back up again for absolutely no reason.
[02:44:15.664 --> 02:44:19.047]  And I mean, people sit there and they take it and they take it, but people can't afford it right now.
[02:44:19.047 --> 02:44:24.712]  I mean, maybe four years ago, the economic situation wasn't as bad, so $5, oh, you cry about it, you stay home.
[02:44:24.712 --> 02:44:31.719]  Right now, people being unemployed, and gas prices going up through the roof, and you can't get anywhere to feed your kids or take care of your kids, somebody's gonna set something on fire.
[02:44:32.674 --> 02:44:34.095]  That's what Gerald Salente says.
[02:44:34.095 --> 02:44:36.217]  When people lose everything, they lose it.
[02:44:36.217 --> 02:44:38.659]  And when they lose their jobs, the blood starts flowing.
[02:44:38.659 --> 02:44:39.399]  Yep.
[02:44:39.399 --> 02:44:47.086]  I mean, at some point, I don't understand how you think that you could put so much pressure on someone who has nothing and not have it blow back at you.
[02:44:47.086 --> 02:44:48.607]  And we saw that in Egypt.
[02:44:48.607 --> 02:44:51.309]  I mean, the man running Egypt is one of the richest men in the world.
[02:44:51.309 --> 02:44:56.653]  Literally, the guy could finance his own country, but yet the United States sends $2 billion there a year.
[02:44:56.653 --> 02:44:59.255]  And now they're saying Mubarak had estimated $8 billion, $12 billion.
[02:45:00.316 --> 02:45:02.878]  I mean, and we're sending that country aid every year?
[02:45:02.878 --> 02:45:03.719]  For what?
[02:45:03.719 --> 02:45:15.507]  I mean, this man could fund his own country, but as yet, he robs and steals from it, and it leaves everyone in... The average citizen is paid $2 or less a day, 52%, and this guy's got billions and billions of dollars.
[02:45:15.507 --> 02:45:18.289]  And then he wonders why somebody's out front of his gate with a pitchfork.
[02:45:18.289 --> 02:45:19.490]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:22.312]  So, you know, the Milwaukee situation, with the...
[02:45:23.974 --> 02:45:26.314]  Um, jobs and everything.
[02:45:26.314 --> 02:45:30.095]  Like, that's just a small rumbling of what's going to happen when you start pushing people too much.
[02:45:30.095 --> 02:45:32.076]  Yeah, and folks can demonize unions all day.
[02:45:32.076 --> 02:45:38.317]  I'm not saying they're perfect, but the larger issue is the big banks have stolen $28 trillion in the last two years.
[02:45:38.317 --> 02:45:39.837]  We give them our tax money.
[02:45:39.837 --> 02:45:42.097]  We got to pay it back in taxes and interest.
[02:45:42.097 --> 02:45:46.498]  And then they make the scapegoats some unions and say, oh, this is all happening because of them.
[02:45:46.498 --> 02:45:50.379]  You could get rid of all that and it wouldn't pay any of this fake debt down.
[02:45:51.079 --> 02:45:51.799]  I don't
[02:46:07.967 --> 02:46:13.169]  Can't get a raise of $5,000 a year because, that's just outrageous, we can't pay that much.
[02:46:13.169 --> 02:46:16.530]  Well, the bank stole their money, their pension funds, and gambled them away.
[02:46:16.530 --> 02:46:21.912]  And then our government, your own tax dollars has to bail back out your educators, and people don't care about it.
[02:46:21.912 --> 02:46:23.572]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:46:23.572 --> 02:46:27.514]  And the President of the United States is saying, I wanna put a cap on it softly.
[02:46:27.514 --> 02:46:28.574]  Just do it.
[02:46:28.574 --> 02:46:29.514]  You're the man, right?
[02:46:29.514 --> 02:46:30.755]  Just cut these banks off.
[02:46:31.475 --> 02:46:33.337]  Well, they put him in power.
[02:46:33.337 --> 02:46:35.139]  They control the Republicans too.
[02:46:35.139 --> 02:46:36.700]  It's totally financed.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:42.085]  And if people think you're gonna get any change from these folks, you're gonna get more of the same.
[02:46:42.085 --> 02:46:43.226]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.768]  The dollar's already been devalued.
[02:46:44.768 --> 02:46:48.031]  Look at inflation in oil, gold, silver, food.
[02:46:48.451 --> 02:46:51.012]  Food prices are up over 30% in the last 12 months.
[02:46:51.012 --> 02:46:56.273]  And people, whether they're free market, teachers, whatever it is, they need that money.
[02:46:56.273 --> 02:46:57.934]  People are running out of money.
[02:46:57.934 --> 02:46:59.234]  And what do they think is going to happen?
[02:46:59.234 --> 02:47:04.416]  And then meanwhile the bankers are all raking record profits and telling us about how welfare is bad.
[02:47:04.416 --> 02:47:06.036]  And I'm against it because it makes people dependent.
[02:47:06.036 --> 02:47:08.417]  But the point is they're the biggest recipients of corporate welfare.
[02:47:09.043 --> 02:47:11.665]  The smallest things create the biggest motions.
[02:47:11.665 --> 02:47:15.187]  So the Wall Street raises gas barrel prices.
[02:47:15.187 --> 02:47:18.209]  Then they say, oh, well it costs more money to ship your food to your locations.
[02:47:18.209 --> 02:47:19.310]  Your food goes up.
[02:47:19.310 --> 02:47:22.652]  Then your boss says, oh, well, I've got to cut back because I'm spending more money.
[02:47:22.652 --> 02:47:25.914]  All these things affect each other, and no one says anything.
[02:47:25.914 --> 02:47:28.236]  And that's why I'm waiting for something to erupt and make a change.
[02:47:28.236 --> 02:47:34.720]  Well, you notice, though, government in the last decade has gotten ready for martial law, trained the police, the tasers, admittedly getting ready for this.
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:36.221]  They knew they were engineering this.
[02:47:36.221 --> 02:47:36.361]  Yeah.
[02:47:36.741 --> 02:47:40.992]  And they want to have a big blow up in the country as a pretext to bring in even more control.
[02:47:40.992 --> 02:47:43.058]  I just want to take our government back.
[02:47:43.058 --> 02:47:44.822]  And then we wouldn't have to go that route.
[02:47:45.929 --> 02:47:48.370]  Well, I don't know how it's going to happen without people being upset first.
[02:47:48.370 --> 02:47:53.751]  I mean, even the welfare situation that you talked about, if the government just did something simple like, oh, you're on welfare?
[02:47:53.751 --> 02:47:56.692]  We do a drug test every other month to make sure you're not on any dependency.
[02:47:56.692 --> 02:48:02.173]  You know how many people you'd knock off of welfare and be forcing them to go get a job because they're sitting at home getting high?
[02:48:02.173 --> 02:48:03.934]  And it's not that people on welfare are getting high.
[02:48:03.934 --> 02:48:05.354]  Every kind of person gets high.
[02:48:05.354 --> 02:48:09.956]  But I mean, if you're just giving money away, why don't you cut down on some of the things you're wasting money on?
[02:48:09.956 --> 02:48:12.916]  Why don't we release all the nonviolent offenders out of prisons?
[02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:14.877]  You know how many hundreds of billions that cost?
[02:48:15.177 --> 02:48:16.739]  Because we've got to keep people locked up.
[02:48:16.739 --> 02:48:18.061]  Because it's a business.
[02:48:18.061 --> 02:48:18.902]  It's a business.
[02:48:18.902 --> 02:48:20.323]  They're not making jail- Bingo.
[02:48:20.323 --> 02:48:24.989]  They build two beds for every person that's in jail for the amount of kids they have.
[02:48:24.989 --> 02:48:27.171]  They're preparing for their children to go to jail.
[02:48:27.171 --> 02:48:34.220]  Instead of spending that money to educate children and get them into schools, which would keep them out of jail, they make more beds for them waiting for them to come to jail.
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:35.700]  Oh, I just got locked up?
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:36.881]  I've got two kids?
[02:48:36.881 --> 02:48:38.281]  One of those kids is coming to jail.
[02:48:38.281 --> 02:48:39.762]  We'll have a bed waiting for him.
[02:48:39.762 --> 02:48:41.362]  Again, folks, our amazing guest.
[02:48:41.362 --> 02:48:42.463]  It's great to have him in studio.
[02:48:42.463 --> 02:48:44.723]  I hope we can do Skype interviews in the future.
[02:48:44.723 --> 02:48:47.584]  Stood up to the TSA, spoke out against them.
[02:48:47.584 --> 02:49:01.829]  You know, I see the TSA as the globalist perfect takeover tool, federalization tool, but also the perfect way to bring the left and right together and people all between, libertarians, you know, people off the political reservation, because it's something everybody doesn't like.
[02:49:01.929 --> 02:49:11.116]  It's something that all Americans understand is a violation, and that's why the system is so scared of this, oh doctor, is because they realize it's a political issue that brings us together.
[02:49:11.116 --> 02:49:21.765]  Yeah, and again, maybe what you're saying, I don't want it to blow up, but something's gotta happen where people are just put in this container and they're so tight together that they just have to get out.
[02:49:21.765 --> 02:49:25.768]  And now we unify everyone to move towards something, at least to educate themselves.
[02:49:25.768 --> 02:49:28.550]  Because most people sit at home and they watch things they don't care.
[02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:30.172]  Now that radiation is big,
[02:49:30.672 --> 02:49:31.072]  Right now?
[02:49:31.072 --> 02:49:31.733]  And it's on every channel?
[02:49:31.733 --> 02:49:32.613]  You can't get away from it?
[02:49:32.613 --> 02:49:36.376]  You're gonna think about that the next time you go to the airport and somebody wants to stick you in a booth.
[02:49:36.376 --> 02:49:37.537]  Radiation isn't bad?
[02:49:37.537 --> 02:49:43.681]  Then have an officer stand in that booth all day, every day, and get scanned while one person gets scanned and walks on their way.
[02:49:43.681 --> 02:49:45.862]  I guarantee you they won't do it.
[02:49:45.862 --> 02:49:48.264]  Well, I've looked at the spec studies.
[02:49:48.264 --> 02:49:50.706]  It's splattering and leaking anyways on those guys all day.
[02:49:51.528 --> 02:49:58.353]  And the only person that might be saved is the person hiding behind in the back, scanning the pictures, supposedly deleting them, as soon as you walk out.
[02:49:58.353 --> 02:49:59.754]  But they've been caught not deleting them.
[02:49:59.754 --> 02:50:00.234]  Exactly.
[02:50:00.234 --> 02:50:03.337]  One federal courthouse had 34,000 images.
[02:50:03.337 --> 02:50:05.038]  People are faulty and they're human.
[02:50:05.038 --> 02:50:06.179]  How can you trust anybody, really?
[02:50:06.179 --> 02:50:08.060]  Well, who would want that job?
[02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:20.889]  That's why they've caught so many of them that are perverts, planting drugs, robbing people, and how they do it all over the country is when they bring you, they see something in your purse they want in your bag, or your briefcase, they put you in the room and strip search you while they rob your bags.
[02:50:21.129 --> 02:50:21.810]  Yeah.
[02:50:21.810 --> 02:50:22.771]  And there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:50:22.771 --> 02:50:26.495]  I had a watch stolen out of my bag years ago.
[02:50:26.495 --> 02:50:27.216]  Called the airline.
[02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:28.938]  I've been flying with this airline for forever.
[02:50:28.938 --> 02:50:31.080]  I had sunglasses stolen at JFK.
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:31.540]  Oh, sorry.
[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:32.562]  There's nothing we can do about it.
[02:50:32.562 --> 02:50:36.065]  And after I complained and complained, for an $1,100 watch, they wanted to give me $100.
[02:50:36.065 --> 02:50:39.009]  And I just wanted an apology.
[02:50:39.009 --> 02:50:39.910]  I couldn't even get an apology.
[02:50:40.470 --> 02:50:44.473]  It was just the, we didn't do it, that's not how, this never happens here.
[02:50:44.473 --> 02:50:45.633]  Just say sorry to me.
[02:50:45.633 --> 02:50:47.214]  I'm an adult, I can go buy a new watch.
[02:50:47.214 --> 02:50:48.955]  But just, I know that it was there, I know the story.
[02:50:48.955 --> 02:50:50.636]  They won't even, they want plausible deniability.
[02:50:50.636 --> 02:50:51.377]  They won't even admit.
[02:50:51.377 --> 02:50:53.158]  They've been caught coast to coast.
[02:50:53.158 --> 02:50:56.920]  I've talked to people internally who work at this local airport.
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.661]  They say it's off the charts.
[02:50:58.661 --> 02:51:01.143]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with O Doctor and the nukes.
[02:51:01.303 --> 02:51:07.728]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[02:52:01.158 --> 02:52:04.579]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:52:04.579 --> 02:52:12.401]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:52:12.401 --> 02:52:16.962]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:52:16.962 --> 02:52:18.403]  It is glutathione.
[02:52:18.403 --> 02:52:22.464]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:52:22.464 --> 02:52:25.825]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:52:26.465 --> 02:52:32.251]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:52:32.251 --> 02:52:39.499]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:52:39.499 --> 02:52:45.946]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:52:45.946 --> 02:52:47.988]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.

[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:02.881]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:53:02.881 --> 02:53:07.042]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[02:53:07.042 --> 02:53:13.763]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:53:13.763 --> 02:53:15.043]  You need a backup plan.
[02:53:15.043 --> 02:53:19.044]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.

[02:54:16.302 --> 02:54:19.502]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.351 --> 02:54:26.913]  OwenJJStone.com is his website.
[02:54:26.913 --> 02:54:28.855]  He's known as the O-Doctor.
[02:54:28.855 --> 02:54:32.917]  And he analyzes technology, radio hosts, you name it.
[02:54:32.917 --> 02:54:35.659]  And he stood up to the TSA by speaking out against their evil.
[02:54:35.659 --> 02:54:38.140]  You know, it's also this incredible denial.
[02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:39.922]  Like, oh, there's no radiation in the scanners.
[02:54:39.922 --> 02:54:40.582]  Yeah, there's some.
[02:54:40.582 --> 02:54:41.403]  Don't worry about it.
[02:54:41.403 --> 02:54:44.084]  Okay, it's 10 to 20 to 50 times what we said.
[02:54:44.084 --> 02:54:45.485]  Okay, we covered it up.
[02:54:45.485 --> 02:54:47.847]  We don't put our hands outside your pants.
[02:54:47.847 --> 02:54:48.347]  Oh, yeah, we do.
[02:54:48.647 --> 02:54:50.468]  We don't put our hands inside your pants.
[02:54:50.468 --> 02:54:51.489]  Oh, yeah, we do.
[02:54:51.489 --> 02:54:53.310]  And they just more and more ratchet.
[02:54:53.310 --> 02:54:54.270]  First, take your shoes off.
[02:54:54.270 --> 02:54:55.050]  Take your belt off.
[02:54:55.050 --> 02:54:56.171]  Answer questions.
[02:54:56.171 --> 02:54:57.592]  We're going to separate you from your stuff.
[02:54:57.592 --> 02:54:59.453]  We're going to strip you down in front of people.
[02:54:59.453 --> 02:55:00.753]  I mean, this is prisoner training.
[02:55:00.753 --> 02:55:04.355]  When you show up at a medium security prison, this is what they do to you.
[02:55:04.355 --> 02:55:05.056]  Talk about germs.
[02:55:05.056 --> 02:55:06.857]  How disgusting is that you had to take your shoes off?
[02:55:07.708 --> 02:55:07.788]  Yeah.
[02:55:37.828 --> 02:55:39.549]  Thousands of people in LAX?
[02:55:39.549 --> 02:55:40.449]  I gotta walk through it?
[02:55:40.449 --> 02:55:41.870]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:46.172]  And people, again, people don't even think about the small things that add up to something much bigger.
[02:55:46.172 --> 02:55:48.853]  But at some point, hopefully that changes.
[02:55:48.853 --> 02:55:51.774]  Starting with this tragedy in Japan today.
[02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:53.755]  You know, these nuclear reactors going off.
[02:55:53.755 --> 02:55:54.896]  I mean, really.
[02:55:54.896 --> 02:56:00.599]  I mean, people in Delaware right now are really nervous and really upset about where they live, more than ever.
[02:56:00.599 --> 02:56:03.560]  And they're going to speak out about the new plants that they want to build everywhere.
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:11.727]  Again, we talked about the green energy and how there's a system and a scam, but Lord knows that something's got to change with the way everything gets done in this country.
[02:56:11.727 --> 02:56:17.312]  We're going into overdrive in the fourth hour to take your phone calls and recap the latest off-the-chart news.
[02:56:17.312 --> 02:56:20.515]  Radiation level soars after Japan nuke plant fire.
[02:56:20.515 --> 02:56:25.179]  A lot of folks are fleeing Tokyo as a radiation-filled cloud with strontium
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:32.046]  The CZM, if I'm pronouncing that right, and the radioactive iodine, pray for those folks.
[02:56:32.046 --> 02:56:35.690]  And they now admit at least one reactor core is open and has been breached.
[02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:38.413]  Let me tell you folks, this is serious news.
[02:56:38.413 --> 02:56:41.076]  Look at how government just got caught lying and lying again.
[02:56:41.076 --> 02:56:43.799]  There's mushroom clouds at reactors and they say no problem.
[02:56:45.235 --> 02:56:51.760]  How is it possible that anyone in their right mind sits in an office somewhere and listens to some minion say, we can get away with this?
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:54.002]  Cell phones, cameras, internet everywhere.
[02:56:54.002 --> 02:56:54.902]  Why would you bother?
[02:56:54.902 --> 02:56:57.384]  They bother because most people are ignorant and stupid.
[02:56:57.384 --> 02:56:58.485]  That's the bottom line.
[02:56:58.485 --> 02:57:00.327]  And how you keep them ignorant and stupid?
[02:57:00.327 --> 02:57:01.808]  You keep the teachers underpaid.
[02:57:01.808 --> 02:57:08.073]  It's just a system, like I said, top to bottom of little things that keep people in their little mindset and keep them out of the public.
[02:57:08.073 --> 02:57:10.235]  But that's why things like that, I love when they lie.
[02:57:10.535 --> 02:57:12.477]  I love when they lie because it's going to get caught.
[02:57:12.477 --> 02:57:13.978]  You can't hide anything anymore.
[02:57:13.978 --> 02:57:24.869]  And so to keep doing it just makes them look stupider and stupider and they get weaker and weaker and at some point we'll have... And then the government's filled with dumbed down people now a product of this where everything's just starting to unravel.
[02:57:24.869 --> 02:57:25.209]  Yeah.
[02:57:25.209 --> 02:57:28.573]  A lot of political scientists I talked to say this is a real problem.
[02:57:28.573 --> 02:57:31.596]  Remember what George Carlin said about there's a big club and you ain't in it.
[02:57:32.136 --> 02:57:34.736]  And he said, and they want you dumb, and that whole rap he did.
[02:57:34.736 --> 02:57:38.297]  Yeah, I don't even know if I'd want to be rich and be in that club.
[02:57:38.297 --> 02:57:42.038]  I'd probably be sick from all the sinister things that they have going on behind closed doors.
[02:57:42.038 --> 02:57:53.000]  I mean, literally just to say things when they know it takes one person with a camera and an internet connection to blow it out of the water because now with the Twitters and the Facebook, everything goes viral and they can't control it.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:59.521]  And that's why they're losing credibility, but they're using a 30-year-old Cold War model of lying, and the people don't get it's not working.
[02:57:59.781 --> 02:58:03.922]  And that's why the bigger corporations want to take over the Internet, so they can bottleneck that and keep their power.
[02:58:03.922 --> 02:58:10.004]  Yeah, even Al Franken, Senators out saying, quote, headline, Franken, they're after the Internet.
[02:58:10.004 --> 02:58:13.065]  They've openly announced they want to shut down the web as we know it.
[02:58:13.065 --> 02:58:14.046]  You know what?
[02:58:14.046 --> 02:58:25.470]  I'm going to do at least 30 minutes of overdrive, but I want to do five minutes with you, one minute break, finishing up, oh doctor, on your view of how they're trying to kill the old free Internet as we knew it, that I promise we're going to
[02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:45.060]  Gord, Gerald, Paul, Will, Donna, at 8 after, I'm going directly to your calls, bam, bam, bam, and the latest on the crisis that is the Japan nuclear catastrophe now approaching Chernobyl levels, coming right back.
[02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:48.822]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:52.509]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:52.509 --> 02:58:59.432]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:59.432 --> 02:59:01.993]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:01.993 --> 02:59:07.375]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:07.375 --> 02:59:10.416]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.416 --> 02:59:12.477]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.737 --> 02:59:18.980]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:18.980 --> 02:59:22.361]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.361 --> 02:59:28.144]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:59:28.144 --> 02:59:29.785]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.785 --> 02:59:31.085]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:31.085 --> 02:59:33.766]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.766 --> 02:59:35.167]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:59:35.447 --> 02:59:37.969]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:37.969 --> 02:59:42.592]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:42.592 --> 02:59:45.193]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:59:45.193 --> 02:59:49.056]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:49.056 --> 02:59:52.078]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:52.078 --> 02:59:53.619]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.619 --> 02:59:55.660]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:58.882]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.770 --> 03:00:21.453]  The O-Doctor, technology writer, researcher, inventor, OwenJJStone.com.
[03:00:21.453 --> 03:00:23.995]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:23.995 --> 03:00:30.597]  We've taken a quasi-break from the bedlam, the meltdown, the Armageddon-type nuclear stuff happening in Japan.
[03:00:30.597 --> 03:00:32.378]  It's getting worse and worse by the minute.
[03:00:32.378 --> 03:00:34.079]  We've been proven, unfortunately, right again.
[03:00:34.079 --> 03:00:36.700]  I said Friday that there was meltdowns going on.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:41.842]  I said Saturday with the explosion that there was going to be containment system breaches.
[03:00:41.842 --> 03:00:42.803]  Now that's admitted today.
[03:00:43.363 --> 03:00:44.764]  And no one's at the plant now.
[03:00:44.764 --> 03:00:47.264]  They're talking about having helicopters fly over and drop stuff.
[03:00:47.264 --> 03:00:50.566]  That's coming up in the next segment with your phone calls, I promise.
[03:00:50.566 --> 03:00:52.126]  You were talking about the attack on the Internet.
[03:00:52.126 --> 03:01:00.009]  There's a whole cocktail of Internet IDs, taxes, tracking, throttling back alternative media, the new Google algorithm.
[03:01:00.009 --> 03:01:03.831]  They admit targets alternative growing media because the old line media is dying.
[03:01:03.831 --> 03:01:04.811]  The government's discredited.
[03:01:05.111 --> 03:01:09.194]  They're all teaming up, openly hitting the panic button, saying, shut it down, shut it down.
[03:01:09.194 --> 03:01:11.236]  But isn't Pandora's box already open?
[03:01:11.236 --> 03:01:17.621]  Break down the constellation of attacks you see as a technology researcher in the Internet that they're going after.
[03:01:17.621 --> 03:01:23.486]  So basically, with Twitter and the Facebook sharing, you can't stop something that someone says.
[03:01:23.486 --> 03:01:28.390]  If someone puts something on a Facebook page, oh, the government lied about the radiation levels.
[03:01:28.390 --> 03:01:32.493]  It takes one other person in their network to share with up to 5,000 people, and another person up to 5,000 people.
[03:01:33.334 --> 03:01:33.554]  I don't
[03:01:54.758 --> 03:01:55.578]  You can't lie.
[03:01:55.578 --> 03:01:58.100]  It's circumventing the old controlled media.
[03:01:58.100 --> 03:01:59.981]  Mainstream media can't get a hold of it.
[03:01:59.981 --> 03:02:00.701]  They can't stop it.
[03:02:00.701 --> 03:02:05.864]  They can't rewrite what they want to rewrite because people on the ground are saying, hey, people are dying out here.
[03:02:05.864 --> 03:02:06.904]  People are starving out here.
[03:02:06.904 --> 03:02:08.305]  We're setting stuff on fire here.
[03:02:08.305 --> 03:02:13.288]  You know, Egypt thinks shutting down the Internet was a real big reason why they wanted to keep it out.
[03:02:13.288 --> 03:02:14.868]  They wanted to stop it from getting out.
[03:02:14.868 --> 03:02:17.810]  So what they do, they turn off everyone's cell phones and Internet.
[03:02:17.810 --> 03:02:19.891]  And that's what the control of the Internet here is going to do.
[03:02:19.891 --> 03:02:21.592]  And the whole country came to a grinding halt.
[03:02:21.792 --> 03:02:23.272]  And that's what they want to do with these little things.
[03:02:23.272 --> 03:02:24.833]  They say, oh, well, you're using too much bandwidth.
[03:02:24.833 --> 03:02:31.355]  Well, bandwidth means if you're in a viral sector and you're looking at things, you're trying to get information, you're trying to download, they're going to cap you off.
[03:02:31.355 --> 03:02:32.995]  Look, they've done this for years on YouTube.
[03:02:32.995 --> 03:02:37.877]  We'll have a video that gets a million views in a day, and suddenly they just delist it and remove it.
[03:02:37.877 --> 03:02:39.237]  It's still there, but it just stops.
[03:02:39.597 --> 03:02:43.982]  I'm sure there's someone in government that has a job to just watch these things and make calls and say, could you take stuff down?
[03:02:43.982 --> 03:02:45.864]  Well, no, they admit Joe Laberman does it all the time.
[03:02:45.864 --> 03:02:46.765]  It's his staff.
[03:02:46.765 --> 03:02:54.474]  And the biggest thing, again, when I said bottleneck, you can't keep that information because once it gets out, a spark happens and they could stop it just like how they cut
[03:02:54.514 --> 03:02:54.754]  I think so.
[03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:11.587]  They're exposing them.
[03:03:11.587 --> 03:03:15.649]  You can't lie about a kid in Japan with a cell phone looking up at a mushroom cloud.
[03:03:15.649 --> 03:03:17.229]  You can't tell me there's not a mushroom cloud.
[03:03:17.229 --> 03:03:20.091]  It only takes one person with a cell phone and an internet connection.
[03:03:20.091 --> 03:03:24.053]  I mean, the Apple Store's staying open, giving free Wi- Yeah, they tried to cover up the mushroom cloud.
[03:03:24.053 --> 03:03:25.033]  The Apple Store's out there.
[03:03:25.033 --> 03:03:27.655]  Somebody said they're giving free Wi-Fi and power.
[03:03:27.655 --> 03:03:29.076]  They're one of the only places people have internet.
[03:03:29.076 --> 03:03:33.418]  So, somebody's running around taking video, running back, uploading this video, and then boom.
[03:03:33.418 --> 03:03:35.319]  Your whole lie of telling me, someone who
[03:03:36.019 --> 03:03:38.220]  Is nowhere near Japan that nothing's wrong.
[03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:41.622]  I'm looking at a video, looking at a mushroom cloud from some kid in Japan.
[03:03:41.622 --> 03:03:42.862]  So who am I to believe?
[03:03:42.862 --> 03:03:46.764]  The government or an independent person saying, hey, we're dying out here.
[03:03:46.764 --> 03:03:47.504]  We need help.
[03:03:47.504 --> 03:03:55.408]  Well, Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are said they're going to pose as thousands of alternative media to pump disinfo out to try to discredit us.
[03:03:55.408 --> 03:04:00.310]  But then we get that info and show how they did that because we've got the billions of people.
[03:04:00.310 --> 03:04:01.950]  They've got their centralized lies.
[03:04:01.950 --> 03:04:02.711]  It just doesn't work.
[03:04:03.551 --> 03:04:05.032]  They're burning themselves down.
[03:04:05.032 --> 03:04:08.775]  And the biggest thing too is just anything that threatens their business model.
[03:04:08.775 --> 03:04:11.757]  Comcast wants to kill Netflix because they can't buy Netflix.
[03:04:11.757 --> 03:04:12.697]  So what do they do?
[03:04:12.697 --> 03:04:17.701]  They're going to cut off their throttle, cut off their internet, cut off their service, and in essence, killing a company.
[03:04:17.701 --> 03:04:20.703]  The United States government is going to let one company kill another company.
[03:04:20.703 --> 03:04:27.107]  And not capitalism, not buying them out, not dismantling them, literally taking one service away that's technically- Because they can't compete!
[03:04:27.107 --> 03:04:30.109]  That's technically free, and then just kill another company.
[03:04:30.509 --> 03:04:34.714]  Because the government says- And by the way, we built the internet with the bills we pay.
[03:04:34.714 --> 03:04:37.618]  They charge us for all this bandwidth on both ends.
[03:04:37.618 --> 03:04:38.859]  They're making money.
[03:04:38.859 --> 03:04:40.942]  They start complaining about, oh, you're using bandwidth.
[03:04:40.942 --> 03:04:42.163]  They've got all the algorithms.
[03:04:42.163 --> 03:04:43.485]  They're making huge profits.
[03:04:43.485 --> 03:04:45.127]  And you're paying for it, folks!
[03:04:45.127 --> 03:04:46.669]  You're paying for the stinking bandwidth!
[03:04:47.029 --> 03:04:55.835]  And my favorite thing is, is the price will go up for less usage, and the people who can't afford it, again, people who are on the bottom getting this information that they desperately need.
[03:04:55.835 --> 03:04:56.796]  It cuts off the poor people.
[03:04:56.796 --> 03:04:58.036]  It's the same thing with the power plants.
[03:04:58.036 --> 03:05:00.298]  They shut them down, and they made more money with the few that are left.
[03:05:00.298 --> 03:05:01.439]  Oh, Dr. Great having you.
[03:05:01.439 --> 03:05:04.541]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[03:06:10.137 --> 03:06:13.520]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:17.202]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[03:06:17.202 --> 03:06:18.003]  Have you?
[03:06:18.003 --> 03:06:21.586]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[03:06:21.586 --> 03:06:24.087]  Yet, it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[03:06:24.087 --> 03:06:29.311]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:06:29.311 --> 03:06:30.492]  Could this really happen?
[03:06:30.492 --> 03:06:34.475]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:06:34.475 --> 03:06:36.677]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[03:06:43.551 --> 03:06:46.994]  If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.
[03:06:46.994 --> 03:06:49.256]  You may never think about America the same way again.

[03:07:45.529 --> 03:07:50.673]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:50.673 --> 03:07:52.915]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.457 --> 03:08:20.119]  Okay, I'm going to recap after I take some calls the latest developments.
[03:08:20.119 --> 03:08:23.161]  The people are starting a mass exodus from Tokyo.
[03:08:23.161 --> 03:08:36.009]  There is a big radiation cloud of strontium, I believe he said 90, radioactive iodine, cesium coming that way, and the government is admitting that it will
[03:08:36.189 --> 03:08:38.470]  A little bit of it won't hurt you too bad, but a lot will kill you.
[03:08:38.470 --> 03:08:39.831]  A long exposure.
[03:08:39.831 --> 03:08:41.472]  So pray for those folks.
[03:08:41.472 --> 03:08:44.534]  Radiation levels soar after third nuke explosion.
[03:08:44.534 --> 03:08:48.816]  Tokyo wind radiation plume could reach capital by nightfall.
[03:08:48.816 --> 03:08:51.098]  Europe's energy commissioner calls it an apocalypse.
[03:08:51.618 --> 03:08:53.119]  And guys, print me all those new ones, please.
[03:08:53.119 --> 03:08:53.839]  Thank you.
[03:08:53.839 --> 03:08:56.480]  Spent nuke fuel pool may be boiling.
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:08:59.982]  Panic may dump water on pool by helicopter.
[03:08:59.982 --> 03:09:03.404]  That's boiling with all those radioactive isotopes out into the atmosphere.
[03:09:03.404 --> 03:09:05.325]  Panic residents start to flee.
[03:09:05.325 --> 03:09:14.690]  They're also reporting there's been at least four, perhaps five explosions, two last night, and that at least number two's containment facility is breached.
[03:09:15.430 --> 03:09:15.972]  Is breached.
[03:09:15.972 --> 03:09:17.897]  Now that stuff's on fire in there.
[03:09:17.897 --> 03:09:21.064]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just went to Chernobyl levels.
[03:09:21.064 --> 03:09:23.350]  But you heard Dr. Bob Bowman, a lot of it's blowing out to sea.
[03:09:24.338 --> 03:09:27.560]  Not good, though, if you're eating the fish out of there.
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:31.722]  This is just unspeakable right now, obviously.
[03:09:31.722 --> 03:09:35.844]  And what does that say about the propaganda of the nuclear power industry?
[03:09:35.844 --> 03:09:37.945]  I'm a pro-technology guy.
[03:09:37.945 --> 03:09:40.226]  But, you know, give me coal any day.
[03:09:40.226 --> 03:09:41.487]  I've studied energy.
[03:09:41.487 --> 03:09:43.047]  They've got totally clean-burning coal.
[03:09:43.047 --> 03:09:47.930]  That's why they want to tax carbon dioxide now, because that's all that's coming out in water vapor.
[03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:55.113]  And you can get people, they've done studies where most people will sign on to ban dihydrogen monoxide because it's a scary name.
[03:09:55.113 --> 03:09:56.313]  That's water.
[03:09:56.313 --> 03:09:57.794]  Carbon dioxide sounds scary.
[03:09:57.794 --> 03:10:03.356]  Most people in studies they've done, and you've seen it on TV where they go to an environmental meeting and say, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[03:10:03.356 --> 03:10:04.236]  They say, yes, let's ban it.
[03:10:04.236 --> 03:10:05.377]  And they sign the petition.
[03:10:05.377 --> 03:10:06.677]  Let's ban sodium chloride.
[03:10:06.677 --> 03:10:07.298]  Yes, ban it.
[03:10:07.298 --> 03:10:09.358]  That's table salt.
[03:10:09.358 --> 03:10:10.339]  This is what they're doing.
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:12.942]  Thank you Alex.
[03:10:12.942 --> 03:10:14.424]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[03:10:14.424 --> 03:10:14.725]  Hi Dr. Stone.
[03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:34.852]  I'm a registered herbalist and I've been practicing herbalism just north of Toronto for a while.
[03:10:34.852 --> 03:10:40.755]  And I wanted to cover a few separate things, but quickly go over the dosing of the iodine.
[03:10:40.755 --> 03:10:47.758]  There might be a bit of a misunderstanding about the difference between kelp and elemental iodine.
[03:10:47.758 --> 03:10:57.203]  So when you're taking, like you mentioned, some product that you had in front of you that gives you 150 micrograms per drop, right?
[03:10:57.828 --> 03:11:12.890]  So, to get what would equal 6 milligrams of Lugol's iodine per drop, you'd have to take 40 drops of a regular kelp-based product that yields a smaller amount of iodine.
[03:11:12.890 --> 03:11:13.751]  Are you a pharmacist?
[03:11:14.568 --> 03:11:15.729]  I'm a herbalist.
[03:11:15.729 --> 03:11:29.275]  Well, I mean, I had a degreed pharmacist on the radio broadcast just earlier, and he specifically, with the iodine from kelp, disagreed with the statement you just made.
[03:11:29.275 --> 03:11:42.761]  Right, I know, but that's why I wanted to clear it up, because kelp, like a teaspoon of kelp, 5,000 milligrams, will only give you 1 to 5 milligrams of iodine.
[03:11:42.761 --> 03:11:43.862]  Yeah, you're not listening to me, sir.
[03:11:45.337 --> 03:11:47.938]  We're not even talking about raw kelp here.
[03:11:47.938 --> 03:11:50.640]  We're talking about iodine from kelp.
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:56.703]  Iodine extracted from kelp, like vitamin C extracted from tangerine peels.
[03:11:56.703 --> 03:12:03.346]  Right, I understand that, but you need to take enough kelp to give you the elemental iodine of six milligrams.
[03:12:03.346 --> 03:12:07.928]  And so it's not, you're not taking kelp per se, you're taking the iodine levels.
[03:12:07.928 --> 03:12:08.348]  Yes, sir.
[03:12:08.348 --> 03:12:09.248]  Appreciate your call.
[03:12:09.248 --> 03:12:10.169]  Yes, we understand that.
[03:12:10.169 --> 03:12:11.289]  Thank you.
[03:12:11.289 --> 03:12:13.370]  Let's talk to Gerald in West Virginia.
[03:12:13.370 --> 03:12:14.151]  Gerald, you're on the air.
[03:12:16.072 --> 03:12:20.337]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[03:12:20.337 --> 03:12:22.059]  Okay, I got a couple of questions.
[03:12:22.059 --> 03:12:22.619]  First off,
[03:12:24.801 --> 03:12:26.663]  The iodine.
[03:12:26.663 --> 03:12:31.626]  What about people like me that are extremely allergic to iodine?
[03:12:31.626 --> 03:12:36.090]  I mean, if I eat a couple pieces of seafood, I get extremely sick.
[03:12:36.090 --> 03:12:37.051]  Well, that's the same thing.
[03:12:37.051 --> 03:12:46.198]  If I say a good storable food is peanut butter, but you are allergic to peanut butter, then you don't want to eat peanut butter because you know that.
[03:12:46.938 --> 03:12:49.100]  If you're allergic to penicillin, you don't want to take it.
[03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:53.023]  But yes, that's a good question for a pharmacist or a medical doctor.
[03:12:53.023 --> 03:12:55.444]  What does someone do who's allergic to iodine?
[03:12:55.444 --> 03:12:58.186]  Now, are you allergic to certain types of extracted iodine?
[03:12:58.186 --> 03:13:01.288]  Because iodine is in all sorts of foods.
[03:13:01.288 --> 03:13:06.512]  I mean, can you not eat bread or waffles that have alfalfa in it?
[03:13:06.512 --> 03:13:09.494]  Just seafood.
[03:13:09.494 --> 03:13:12.937]  Like if I eat crab legs or crams.
[03:13:15.627 --> 03:13:19.289]  Well, you might be allergic to something else in there.
[03:13:19.289 --> 03:13:24.892]  I mean, I really, I can't tell you, sir, because I'm not a doctor or a pharmacist, but that's a good question.
[03:13:24.892 --> 03:13:28.434]  What's your overall view of the devastating news that we're being pretty calm about here?
[03:13:28.434 --> 03:13:38.780]  And we did predict this three days ago, that at least the reactor number two at Fukushima has been exposed.
[03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:40.841]  The containment vessel has been exposed.
[03:13:42.524 --> 03:13:47.990]  Okay, I'm from West Virginia, and you know, everybody likes to make fun of all those hillbillies.
[03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:50.052]  But let me tell you something.
[03:13:50.052 --> 03:13:53.455]  I think that this is an extreme cover-up.
[03:13:53.455 --> 03:14:01.022]  I do believe that this is way worse than anybody is letting out.
[03:14:01.022 --> 03:14:03.044]  Well, I agree with you, and I appreciate your call.
[03:14:03.044 --> 03:14:04.686]  Paul in Alabama, you're on the air.
[03:14:06.314 --> 03:14:08.115]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:14:08.115 --> 03:14:12.397]  I know you and Dr. Bowman said that not as much radiation is going to hit the U.S.
[03:14:12.397 --> 03:14:14.558]  because of crossing the ocean there.
[03:14:14.558 --> 03:14:21.841]  Well, I didn't say that because Bowman said that hopefully most of it will go in the ocean and I would imagine that's the case.
[03:14:21.841 --> 03:14:25.782]  And you said there was a slight change in the jet stream too, but I just wanted to
[03:14:27.856 --> 03:14:31.920]  Eat this to death, but distinguish something real quick with the iodine.
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:37.225]  Okay, there's three types of iodine supplements you can use to protect from the radioactive iodine.
[03:14:37.225 --> 03:14:44.972]  There's iodine supplements like the kale that you have, there's potassium iodide, and there's potassium iodate.
[03:14:44.972 --> 03:14:51.678]  Okay, the iostat pills contain 130 milligrams of potassium iodide.
[03:14:51.678 --> 03:14:53.640]  Okay, the equivalents to that
[03:14:54.267 --> 03:14:54.387]  Yes.
[03:15:14.853 --> 03:15:15.853]  Micrograms.
[03:15:15.853 --> 03:15:22.134]  One microgram is the equivalent to .001 milligrams.
[03:15:22.134 --> 03:15:32.096]  And I heard when you were on with Ben Fuchs earlier, and he said the pills, the Isostep pills, contain 130 milligrams of iodine.
[03:15:32.096 --> 03:15:32.756]  Okay?
[03:15:32.756 --> 03:15:36.257]  And those, your drops, are in micrograms.
[03:15:36.257 --> 03:15:37.117]  Okay?
[03:15:37.117 --> 03:15:39.617]  For 130 micrograms, I think your bottle said 120 or 130 micrograms?
[03:15:45.127 --> 03:15:45.228]  150.
[03:15:45.228 --> 03:15:46.328]  150 micrograms.
[03:15:46.328 --> 03:15:50.089]  That would be 0.15 milligrams.
[03:15:50.089 --> 03:15:58.831]  Okay, so for you to get the same equivalent as one of the Iostat pills, you would have to take 130,000 drops of that kale substance.
[03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:09.913]  Fuchs, I'll have to stick with him and research that, but I appreciate that.
[03:16:09.913 --> 03:16:15.157]  Again, I don't want to sit here and obsess over this all day long and just get completely obsessed with it.
[03:16:15.157 --> 03:16:23.744]  You know, the point is, if your thyroid is filled with the good iodine it needs, it will not absorb anymore, if it gets what it needs.
[03:16:23.744 --> 03:16:27.968]  I've read that it is overkill with these pills, these iostats, it makes some people get sick.
[03:16:28.408 --> 03:16:29.509]  I'm not a medical doctor.
[03:16:29.509 --> 03:16:30.529]  I'm not giving you advice.
[03:16:30.529 --> 03:16:31.570]  I've told you what I've done.
[03:16:31.570 --> 03:16:32.630]  Okay?
[03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:36.632]  Folks, we're talking about meltdown going on at four reactors.
[03:16:36.632 --> 03:16:39.133]  We're talking about giant explosions, fires.
[03:16:39.133 --> 03:16:43.075]  We're talking about a radioactive cloud going towards Tokyo.
[03:16:43.075 --> 03:16:49.198]  And as many experts have stated, if we're dealing with uranium and plutonium, it's not even going to matter with iodine.
[03:16:49.198 --> 03:16:49.618]  Okay?
[03:16:49.618 --> 03:16:53.760]  So the issue is, thank God, there's an ocean between us called the Pacific Ocean.
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:55.981]  And I'm not getting in an argument with you, Paul.
[03:16:55.981 --> 03:16:56.942]  It just, it goes on.
[03:16:57.162 --> 03:16:57.963]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:16:57.963 --> 03:16:59.625]  How are you today?
[03:17:16.104 --> 03:17:17.105]  I think it's rotten, man.
[03:17:17.105 --> 03:17:19.227]  I think the government has their hand in it.
[03:17:19.227 --> 03:17:23.812]  They have their hand in everything that goes on around us today in the news.
[03:17:23.812 --> 03:17:25.513]  Before it makes the news, we know about it.
[03:17:25.513 --> 03:17:27.836]  And like you said, the internet is going away.
[03:17:27.836 --> 03:17:35.904]  They're trying to get rid of that part, so that we can't tell them what we think of them, or what's going on, what they're doing behind our backs.
[03:17:37.415 --> 03:17:46.738]  At any rate, I was listening to Dr. Bowman that you had on earlier, and he mentioned something about the iodide and all that.
[03:17:46.738 --> 03:17:52.039]  People hear potassium iodide, they're running crazy to get to the stores.
[03:17:52.039 --> 03:17:56.201]  You go on the internet and look up potassium iodide, all it says is sold out.
[03:17:56.201 --> 03:17:57.601]  Everywhere.
[03:17:57.601 --> 03:17:59.141]  You can't get it.
[03:17:59.141 --> 03:18:02.582]  Absolutely, there we go, another call on that subject.
[03:18:02.582 --> 03:18:03.903]  My whole issue here is,
[03:18:05.521 --> 03:18:09.462]  At this point, we can't... Here's the biggest issue.
[03:18:09.462 --> 03:18:15.324]  We can't trust the Japanese government, the UN, the US government to tell us the truth.
[03:18:15.324 --> 03:18:23.586]  You heard Bowman, that those detectors they've got testing the Japanese people are only gonna pick up the radiation from uranium or plutonium.
[03:18:23.586 --> 03:18:32.689]  They're not gonna pick up, generally, the cesium, the radioactive iodine, the strontium.
[03:18:32.689 --> 03:18:33.469]  So, it...
[03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:35.340]  This is
[03:18:51.088 --> 03:18:56.911]  Over the Middle East, over Russia, over Asia, over Japan, over the Pacific, and back over the U.S.
[03:18:56.911 --> 03:18:58.072]  That was on record in 1986.
[03:18:58.072 --> 03:19:01.054]  It orbited the planet for several years.
[03:19:01.054 --> 03:19:07.738]  So you heard Bowman, he said a lot of it is going to come here, a small amount of the overall, but that itself will increase cancer rates.
[03:19:07.738 --> 03:19:12.961]  There's a reason cancer's already up in the last 60 years of the nuclear age.
[03:19:12.961 --> 03:19:20.325]  Guys, search the term, the factoid, number of above-ground nuclear tests, total number
[03:19:21.584 --> 03:19:30.427]  of above-ground nuclear test with the US, Russia, the British, the French, and many others, the Chinese.
[03:19:30.427 --> 03:19:34.588]  I believe it's in the hundreds.
[03:19:34.588 --> 03:19:36.128]  Let's just do it.
[03:19:36.128 --> 03:19:38.709]  Super dead reckoning from ancient memory.
[03:19:38.709 --> 03:19:43.591]  I believe there's been over 300 above-ground nuclear tests, and the US has done the most of anybody.
[03:19:43.591 --> 03:19:45.851]  We'll see if I'm right after this break.
[03:19:45.851 --> 03:19:47.392]  The point is, what do you think all those did?
[03:19:48.419 --> 03:19:49.060]  Above ground.
[03:19:49.060 --> 03:19:50.362]  Some of them detonated on the ground.
[03:19:50.362 --> 03:19:51.403]  Then you get a lot more fallout.
[03:19:51.403 --> 03:19:56.089]  We're going to come back with more of your phone calls straight ahead, continuing to cover this.
[03:19:56.089 --> 03:19:57.330]  The latest news straight ahead.

[03:20:02.774 --> 03:20:09.799]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[03:20:09.799 --> 03:20:12.480]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:21.526]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[03:20:21.526 --> 03:20:29.771]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[03:20:29.771 --> 03:20:30.412]  Move quickly,
[03:20:30.572 --> 03:20:34.694]  Well, you can still afford it, and eFoodsDirect will pay your shipping costs for you.

[03:21:30.817 --> 03:21:32.078]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:32.078 --> 03:21:36.641]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:21:36.641 --> 03:21:42.445]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:21:42.445 --> 03:21:46.087]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:46.087 --> 03:21:48.809]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.809 --> 03:21:53.872]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:21:53.872 --> 03:21:54.113]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.113 --> 03:21:55.514]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:00.877 --> 03:22:07.543]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:07.543 --> 03:22:15.670]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:23.517]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:23.837 --> 03:22:28.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:34.123]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.123 --> 03:22:38.466]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.466 --> 03:22:39.547]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:39.547 --> 03:22:44.069]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.069 --> 03:22:48.952]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:48.952 --> 03:22:51.474]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:51.934 --> 03:22:55.835]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.835 --> 03:22:57.436]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:57.436 --> 03:23:03.338]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:23:03.338 --> 03:23:13.142]  Did you realize that Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to implement the entire socialist program upon America, but alert congressmen stopped him in his tracks?
[03:23:14.042 --> 03:23:25.947]  And yet over 22,000 of the laws that he's got passed are still on the books even though the Supreme Court said that they were null and void and should not be used today.
[03:23:25.947 --> 03:23:37.753]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are going to affect you and yours in the near future by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[03:23:37.753 --> 03:23:39.133]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800

[03:23:40.894 --> 03:23:41.675]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[03:23:41.675 --> 03:23:44.336]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[03:23:44.336 --> 03:23:45.477]  Call now.
[03:23:45.477 --> 03:23:46.497]  It's a free one-year subscription.
[03:24:14.915 --> 03:24:19.278]  We are continuing overdrive throughout this hour.
[03:24:19.278 --> 03:24:25.563]  It is now being reported by mainstream news that more deadly types of radiation are being ejected directly into the air.
[03:24:25.563 --> 03:24:28.305]  I'm going to be covering that after the break.
[03:24:28.305 --> 03:24:34.369]  We're going to have pharmacist Ben Fuchs back on because this has become a big point of
[03:24:35.692 --> 03:24:37.273]  of debate.
[03:24:37.273 --> 03:24:39.033]  Again, I'm not giving medical advice here.
[03:24:39.033 --> 03:24:40.854]  I've been saying that since Friday.
[03:24:40.854 --> 03:24:42.555]  I have the pills.
[03:24:42.555 --> 03:24:48.217]  I've chosen to go with the liquid because it's better absorbed, and if your thyroid has enough, it shuts off.
[03:24:48.217 --> 03:24:53.579]  There is a lot more, and it is overkill with the iostat, but that's my personal opinion, okay?
[03:24:53.579 --> 03:24:54.580]  I'm not here giving you advice.
[03:24:54.580 --> 03:25:01.042]  We're going to get Ben Fuchs back on, but I went and looked at iodine deficiency sites that do the research, and they talk about how you need 130
[03:25:02.563 --> 03:25:02.763]  I think?
[03:25:24.099 --> 03:25:27.200]  And we eat so many GMO foods, people are allergic to everything now.
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:28.460]  In fact, don't eat any food.
[03:25:28.460 --> 03:25:29.080]  Just stop eating.
[03:25:29.080 --> 03:25:31.000]  I'm joking now.
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:36.762]  Again, this whole iodine thing has completely exploded and gone crazy.
[03:25:36.762 --> 03:25:43.263]  And so we'll continue to discuss that as well.
[03:25:43.263 --> 03:25:45.624]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[03:25:45.624 --> 03:25:47.404]  Donna in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[03:25:48.376 --> 03:25:49.497]  Hi, Alex.
[03:25:49.497 --> 03:26:00.625]  I'm a researcher and moderator over in Prison Planet Forum, and I've done some extensive research on trying to help people detox their bodies, you know, from radiation.
[03:26:00.625 --> 03:26:09.432]  One of the things that I did find out throughout my research, that people can go out and buy a plant called spiderwort.
[03:26:09.432 --> 03:26:17.718]  And what spiderwort does is, the minute any kind of radiation is present in the area they're in, the flower will turn pink.
[03:26:20.543 --> 03:26:23.664]  I wonder how folks are going to find enough spider warts.
[03:26:23.664 --> 03:26:25.425]  Suddenly there'll be a shortage of spider warts.
[03:26:25.425 --> 03:26:27.245]  I'll have to look into that.
[03:26:27.245 --> 03:26:36.328]  Well, you know, and also, if you go to the Prison Planet Forum... That's almost like a canary in the coal mine.
[03:26:36.328 --> 03:26:37.269]  Correct.
[03:26:37.269 --> 03:26:42.530]  But this way, if you have just a little bit of detection of radiation, you can start doing your
[03:26:44.918 --> 03:26:45.078]  Yeah.
[03:27:04.537 --> 03:27:28.443]  So the radiation will go into the dirt and things it's still there but you have a less of a chance of inhaling it directly out of the atmosphere and a lot of it dissipates that way and a lot of it will float over Japan out to sea and go into the ocean and so if people can just stay in their houses obviously if they could get out of the way of the cloud that's now approaching Tokyo reportedly already hitting it that that would be you know number one what you should do.
[03:27:29.582 --> 03:27:34.904]  It's also important to make sure you avoid sugars and sweets during this time.
[03:27:34.904 --> 03:27:39.685]  Way too much of that in your system is going to do danger to it.
[03:27:39.685 --> 03:27:47.587]  Also, it's very important to double up on your D3.
[03:27:47.587 --> 03:27:51.708]  The fact that Americans in general are D3 deficient.
[03:27:51.708 --> 03:27:53.369]  We've got to keep our immune systems up.
[03:27:54.517 --> 03:27:56.886]  Very well said, I appreciate the call Donna.
[03:27:56.886 --> 03:27:58.653]  Trina in Montana, you're on the air.
[03:27:58.653 --> 03:28:00.058]  Hi, how are you?
[03:28:00.058 --> 03:28:00.279]  Good.
[03:28:01.013 --> 03:28:01.653]  Oh, good.
[03:28:01.653 --> 03:28:03.494]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:28:03.494 --> 03:28:04.814]  I wanted to read you a note.
[03:28:04.814 --> 03:28:07.996]  I have a friend who's in Japan and was caught in the earthquake.
[03:28:07.996 --> 03:28:09.936]  And I thought you'd find this rather interesting.
[03:28:09.936 --> 03:28:12.878]  She goes on about, you know, the earthquake and how she's frightened.
[03:28:12.878 --> 03:28:15.819]  Then she said she works in a security firm.
[03:28:15.819 --> 03:28:26.023]  She said there's no announcement by the firm, but I heard from the traders that Goldman Sachs, on the 42nd floor, had already evacuated.
[03:28:26.023 --> 03:28:28.544]  And where is this?
[03:28:28.544 --> 03:28:29.424]  She lives in Tokyo.
[03:28:30.834 --> 03:28:38.577]  Well, I know that they've evacuated many of the foreign embassies, that was reported last night, out of Tokyo.
[03:28:38.577 --> 03:28:45.960]  And so that is confirmed that many foreign embassies, including the British and U.S.
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:52.922]  Embassy, have moved into southern Japan, out of central northern Japan, where Tokyo is located.
[03:28:52.922 --> 03:28:56.724]  And so we can confirm that flights
[03:28:57.364 --> 03:29:06.589]  into Tokyo by British Airways, Lufthansa out of Germany, and others have suspended flights into Tokyo as of last night.
[03:29:06.589 --> 03:29:08.270]  So what does that tell you?
[03:29:08.270 --> 03:29:10.451]  Well, this is the thing.
[03:29:10.451 --> 03:29:13.652]  She wrote this note right after the earthquake.
[03:29:13.652 --> 03:29:22.277]  She said they had email capabilities, so she was writing, her husband's here in the United States right now, so she was writing everybody to let them know that she's okay, the kids are okay.
[03:29:23.343 --> 03:29:31.890]  But that Goldman Sachs had already, at the time of the earthquake, evacuated the building.
[03:29:31.890 --> 03:29:35.873]  Well, you know, that's... I'd like to see some proof of that.
[03:29:35.873 --> 03:29:47.922]  We have gotten proof in that FEMA and Homeland Security are ordering clinics not to prescribe the potassium iodine, the medical-grade type, to people, telling them basically to hoard it.
[03:29:47.922 --> 03:29:50.103]  And we've got that article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:50.103 --> 03:29:50.604]  It just broke.
[03:29:51.704 --> 03:29:55.607]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.607 --> 03:30:01.430]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.430 --> 03:30:04.692]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[03:30:04.692 --> 03:30:09.595]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?
[03:30:09.595 --> 03:30:19.562]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent Americans who want practical advice on how to survive and even prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[03:30:19.562 --> 03:30:21.303]  It's the best way to get a black belt

[03:31:01.181 --> 03:31:03.463]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:31:03.463 --> 03:31:05.825]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:31:05.825 --> 03:31:09.828]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.695 --> 03:31:21.037]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.037 --> 03:31:23.938]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.938 --> 03:31:26.840]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:34.445]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.781 --> 03:31:40.165]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.165 --> 03:31:43.006]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.006 --> 03:31:46.709]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.709 --> 03:31:47.769]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.769 --> 03:31:49.110]  You're everyone else.

[03:32:03.802 --> 03:32:11.587]  Hi, my name's Russ, and after my heart attack, I wasn't sure what was going to happen.
[03:32:11.587 --> 03:32:16.271]  I needed to keep on working, but now it's becoming a problem.
[03:32:16.271 --> 03:32:20.533]  I heard about these garlic cayenne drops and hoped it would help me.
[03:32:20.533 --> 03:32:28.859]  Well, I've been taking them for about four months, and the way I'm feeling now, I can see how I just might make it to retirement, thanks to ExtendoVite.
[03:32:29.119 --> 03:32:33.323]  My name's Don Whiskin, and I want you to know ExtendoVite works.

[03:33:06.103 --> 03:33:12.144]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:12.144 --> 03:33:14.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:16.806 --> 03:33:21.709]  A toll-free number to join us on this Ides of March, the 15th day of March 2011.
[03:33:21.709 --> 03:33:27.192]  This Tuesday edition is 800-259-9231.
[03:33:27.192 --> 03:33:32.275]  I have a special statement to boil it all down coming up after pharmacist Ben Fuchs leaves us.
[03:33:32.275 --> 03:33:33.496]  He's popping back in live.
[03:33:33.496 --> 03:33:34.537]  He was on earlier today.
[03:33:35.905 --> 03:33:44.528]  And yes, if you go up to Infowarsteam.com, they do have the thyroid health kelp iodine based tablets.
[03:33:44.528 --> 03:33:47.529]  They're right there at the top of the site for people that can't see them.
[03:33:47.529 --> 03:33:49.290]  There's also some drops that that company has.
[03:33:49.290 --> 03:33:50.430]  We're gonna get those up on there.
[03:33:50.430 --> 03:33:51.270]  People keep asking.
[03:33:51.270 --> 03:33:52.031]  It's out everywhere.
[03:33:52.031 --> 03:33:53.971]  I haven't promoted it the last four or five days.
[03:33:53.971 --> 03:33:57.693]  It is at Infowarsteam.com if you want it while supplies last.
[03:33:57.693 --> 03:34:01.974]  I don't know how long they will, but it'll be removed once it has been sold out.
[03:34:01.974 --> 03:34:02.954]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[03:34:07.492 --> 03:34:17.234]  I'm going to get into this report after Ben Fuchs leaves us, and then I'm going to get into the latest developments that are earth-shaking, pun unfortunately intended.
[03:34:17.234 --> 03:34:19.854]  Also, this latest article is only at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:34:19.854 --> 03:34:22.455]  It's going up on InfoWars.com in the next five minutes.
[03:34:22.455 --> 03:34:22.715]  U.S.
[03:34:22.715 --> 03:34:31.757]  government blocking Americans from obtaining potassium iodine, and we're getting massive emails and confirmed reports with names of where this is happening.
[03:34:37.202 --> 03:34:39.444]  Now, the man gave us his full name and everything.
[03:34:39.444 --> 03:34:43.567]  We need to have Watson ad name removed for privacy, even though the guy didn't ask for that.
[03:34:43.567 --> 03:34:46.189]  People know this was confirmed, not just a caller.
[03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:47.290]  He gave the name of the place.
[03:34:47.290 --> 03:34:50.513]  We're getting countless calls and emails confirming that they're being told that the U.S.
[03:34:50.513 --> 03:34:54.296]  government has told them not to issue this out to people and to basically keep it.
[03:34:58.291 --> 03:35:02.153]  Germany has announced they're going to shut down pre-1980 nuclear plants.
[03:35:02.153 --> 03:35:03.614]  That's Reuters.
[03:35:03.614 --> 03:35:15.260]  Blast escalates Japan's nuclear crisis, and the government is saying that radiation is now being injected directly out of the four devastated and exploded plants.
[03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:19.102]  One, definitely, reactor number two, has had its core revealed.
[03:35:19.102 --> 03:35:20.562]  The containment vessel is broken.
[03:35:21.943 --> 03:35:23.084]  I'm going to be getting into all of that.
[03:35:51.105 --> 03:35:51.585]  Thank you, sir.
[03:36:16.021 --> 03:36:21.063]  Trying to explain to people the difference between this type of iodine.
[03:36:21.063 --> 03:36:25.045]  We have the headline, Panic Buying Stocks of Potassium Iodine Exhausted in the U.S.
[03:36:25.045 --> 03:36:31.127]  We have a screenshot of IOSAT, Indications Thyroid Blocking and Radiation Emergency Only.
[03:36:31.127 --> 03:36:34.269]  This is the stuff sold out all over the place.
[03:36:34.269 --> 03:36:43.813]  And it says it's 130 milligrams of potassium iodate tablet, USP, and 14 tablets per package.
[03:36:43.813 --> 03:36:43.993]  Now,
[03:36:44.967 --> 03:36:53.086]  Separately, they're available still in some stores, though it's sold out almost everywhere, iodine from kelp or dulse or alfalfa.
[03:36:54.395 --> 03:36:58.740]  And reading mainline medical journals about this for people to have good thyroid function.
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:04.806]  You've heard about the African tribes have the giant jowls because they live up in the mountains and don't get any iodine and they have all those illnesses.
[03:37:04.806 --> 03:37:06.908]  Other tribes that don't know have it.
[03:37:06.908 --> 03:37:14.677]  The point is, is that when your thyroid is filled with natural iodine, according to all the medical doctors, people we've interviewed, then it won't absorb the radioactive iodine.
[03:37:15.097 --> 03:37:27.588]  Now the question is, why is the pharmaceutical stuff 130mg and then this is 150mcg, I guess that's micrograms, so what is the difference?
[03:37:27.588 --> 03:37:35.615]  People are calling in saying, Alex, you need to take thousands of these drops to get the same amount of what is in the Iocent.
[03:37:35.615 --> 03:37:35.956]  Well look,
[03:37:36.656 --> 03:37:39.098]  All I'm doing here is covering alternatives.
[03:37:39.098 --> 03:37:40.539]  I'm not giving medical advice.
[03:37:40.539 --> 03:37:41.120]  I don't know.
[03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:42.701]  Okay?
[03:37:42.701 --> 03:37:45.784]  I just know what people like pharmacist Ben Fuchs have been telling me.
[03:37:45.784 --> 03:37:49.607]  Ben, try to explain this to people in layman's terms who are confused.
[03:37:49.607 --> 03:37:50.728]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:37:50.728 --> 03:37:53.691]  There is the recommended daily allowance of iodine.
[03:37:53.691 --> 03:37:55.372]  The suggested amount of iodine.
[03:37:55.372 --> 03:37:58.595]  There's iodine that you need for daily functioning.
[03:37:58.595 --> 03:38:00.937]  That is based in micrograms.
[03:38:01.747 --> 03:38:04.452]  Then there's the iodine that you take for protection.
[03:38:04.452 --> 03:38:11.344]  For radioactive disasters, for example, such as SSKI or the potassium iodide pills, those are measured in milligrams.
[03:38:11.932 --> 03:38:20.314]  So, when you take iodine for protection from radiation, you need a lot more than when you take a baseline level for daily nutritional purposes.
[03:38:20.314 --> 03:38:24.456]  However, it's important to keep in mind that you can take too much iodine.
[03:38:24.456 --> 03:38:28.777]  So, you don't want to stay on a high dose of iodine for too long a period of time.
[03:38:28.777 --> 03:38:30.817]  For emergencies, it's understandable.
[03:38:30.817 --> 03:38:36.139]  You do need to have a high dose of iodine to just drench your body with it so you don't take in that radioactive stuff.
[03:38:36.719 --> 03:38:37.139]  As a pharmacist,
[03:39:04.795 --> 03:39:10.557]  Does it do any good, then, to take the regular nutritional supplement iodine?
[03:39:10.557 --> 03:39:11.437]  Of protection?
[03:39:11.437 --> 03:39:12.197]  Yes.
[03:39:12.197 --> 03:39:12.918]  No.
[03:39:12.918 --> 03:39:15.178]  There won't be enough for protection.
[03:39:15.178 --> 03:39:20.440]  Unless you've been doing it for a long period of time, and even then, it depends on how much you're exposed to.
[03:39:20.440 --> 03:39:26.502]  I would certainly, if I could find a potassium iodide, if I was worried about protection and I could find a potassium iodide, that's the way to go.
[03:39:26.502 --> 03:39:29.103]  Or SSKI, which is a solution of potassium iodide.
[03:39:30.566 --> 03:39:40.369]  Okay, but if you've been taking the regular type for a long time, though, then that does... It helps, it helps, but again, it depends on the kind of dose of radiation dose that you're getting.
[03:39:40.369 --> 03:39:48.372]  I mean, if you're right by the reactor, and Alex, by the way, iodide, protecting yourself using iodide, does not give you overall protection from radiation.
[03:39:48.372 --> 03:39:52.713]  It gives you protection from radioactive iodine.
[03:39:52.713 --> 03:39:53.673]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:39:53.673 --> 03:39:56.894]  Yeah, it's not from the strontium.
[03:39:56.894 --> 03:39:58.995]  Not from uranium, not from plutonium.
[03:39:59.699 --> 03:40:01.921]  It gives you protection for the thyroid.
[03:40:01.921 --> 03:40:08.087]  Yeah, I think that's why people are freaking out so much about this is because they think it's going to give them 100% protection.
[03:40:08.087 --> 03:40:08.988]  No, it's not.
[03:40:08.988 --> 03:40:13.193]  It's not going to give you... That's why you want to upregulate all of your enzyme systems.
[03:40:13.193 --> 03:40:15.155]  You want to upregulate all of your detoxification systems.
[03:40:15.155 --> 03:40:18.097]  Well, I know there's a whole laundry list of things that help with radiation.
[03:40:18.097 --> 03:40:19.119]  What are some of those things?
[03:40:19.659 --> 03:40:20.480]  There's a lot of things.
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:22.541]  Selenium is very important.
[03:40:22.541 --> 03:40:24.842]  N-acetyl-15 is very important.
[03:40:24.842 --> 03:40:26.423]  Sulfur is very important.
[03:40:26.423 --> 03:40:28.204]  Vitamin C is very important.
[03:40:28.204 --> 03:40:30.866]  The amino acid glutamine is very important.
[03:40:30.866 --> 03:40:34.228]  Building your body's glutathione levels is very important.
[03:40:34.228 --> 03:40:36.409]  Superoxide dismutase is very important.
[03:40:36.409 --> 03:40:46.436]  There's a whole bunch of things, and it's really important if you want to protect yourself from overall protection for radiation that you upregulate all of these systems.
[03:40:46.436 --> 03:40:46.896]  Continue.
[03:40:48.306 --> 03:40:48.746]  I'm good.
[03:41:03.837 --> 03:41:04.457]  Thanks for watching!
[03:41:24.392 --> 03:41:25.692]  Essential fatty acids are very important.
[03:41:25.692 --> 03:41:27.713]  Well, I'm glad we fleshed this out.
[03:41:27.713 --> 03:41:30.974]  So the callers calling up explaining this are correct.
[03:41:30.974 --> 03:41:31.434]  That's good.
[03:41:31.434 --> 03:41:34.395]  That's why I told folks I don't understand all of this.
[03:41:34.395 --> 03:41:37.577]  I'm trying to learn it as we all learn together.
[03:41:37.577 --> 03:41:45.659]  There's a difference between healthy thyroid getting what you need versus totally trying to fill it to block it.
[03:41:45.659 --> 03:41:49.040]  But that's only for the radioactive iodine.
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:53.022]  One of the big isotopes, according to Bob Bowman, released from these melting down reactors.
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:42:05.954]  But keep in mind you can take too much iodine, so if you're going to be protecting yourself using SSKI or using potassium iodide tablets, you want to stop when you don't need the protection anymore because taking too much iodine can also mess up the thyroid.
[03:42:06.621 --> 03:42:08.802]  Well, I'm going to say this, as I've been saying since Friday.
[03:42:08.802 --> 03:42:12.383]  Call your doctor, go to the local clinic, talk to them.
[03:42:12.383 --> 03:42:16.425]  Now, shifting gears briefly, Ben, then I'm going to go back to calls, and I appreciate you coming on.
[03:42:16.425 --> 03:42:19.686]  We have this new report out by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:42:19.686 --> 03:42:22.947]  The calls were pouring in yesterday, the emails.
[03:42:22.947 --> 03:42:26.509]  We've gotten people to send us the name of where it happened, the places.
[03:42:26.509 --> 03:42:28.570]  It's in this article where the U.S.
[03:42:28.570 --> 03:42:29.010]  government
[03:42:29.770 --> 03:42:30.870]  I'm not sure why they're saying that.
[03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:32.131]  They want to hoard it, maybe?
[03:42:56.966 --> 03:42:57.446]  I don't know.
[03:42:57.446 --> 03:43:00.587]  We've got this article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:43:00.587 --> 03:43:11.591]  It's now going up on Infowars.com, but these reports are pouring in, and we've now had listeners confirm and even tell us dates, places, and times.
[03:43:11.591 --> 03:43:16.853]  A doctor refuses to prescribe drug, as they call it, after conversation with CDC.
[03:43:16.853 --> 03:43:23.296]  Amazon.com imposes one month waiting period as supplies sell out on back of panic buying.
[03:43:23.296 --> 03:43:26.117]  But I want to believe what Dr. Bowman's saying.
[03:43:26.937 --> 03:43:31.082]  What are you going to do about the government?
[03:43:31.082 --> 03:43:32.664]  I wouldn't trust the government.
[03:43:44.028 --> 03:43:48.391]  So basically, iodine is only one thing... One thing only.
[03:43:48.391 --> 03:43:57.797]  It's important, and it protects the thyroid because, like your previous guest said, one of the major contaminants in a nuclear disaster is radioactive iodine, but there's other things too.
[03:43:57.797 --> 03:44:04.801]  And so giving yourself overall protection, building up your immune system, using all these substances, all these compounds that we talked about, is very, very important.
[03:44:04.821 --> 03:44:09.262]  Well, the Japanese are some of the longest-lived people, and they eat a lot of seaweed.
[03:44:09.262 --> 03:44:09.902]  That's right.
[03:44:09.902 --> 03:44:10.262]  That's right.
[03:44:10.262 --> 03:44:12.963]  Seaweed is amazingly... It's amazing stuff.
[03:44:12.963 --> 03:44:21.486]  It's got vitamins, it's got amino acids, it's got antioxidants, it's got phytonutrients that protect you from the sun and protect you from just general background radiation.
[03:44:21.486 --> 03:44:22.626]  Amazing stuff.
[03:44:23.206 --> 03:44:23.507]  Seaweed.
[03:44:23.507 --> 03:44:25.249]  We should be eating it all the time.
[03:44:25.249 --> 03:44:26.370]  And green tea, by the way.
[03:44:26.370 --> 03:44:28.152]  I think I said that last hour.
[03:44:28.152 --> 03:44:29.053]  Drinking green tea.
[03:44:29.053 --> 03:44:33.158]  That should be your beverage of choice if you're concerned about radiation poisoning or toxicity.
[03:44:33.158 --> 03:44:34.479]  It should be your beverage of choice anyway.
[03:44:34.479 --> 03:44:36.241]  Well, Dr. Bowman said it best.
[03:44:36.241 --> 03:44:37.643]  Three degrees in nuclear physics.
[03:44:37.643 --> 03:44:40.747]  He said definitely some of this is going to hit the West Coast.
[03:44:41.147 --> 03:44:45.871]  But he said it'll be the type that, you know, takes a long time to cause people to get cancer.
[03:44:45.871 --> 03:44:47.433]  You won't see it overnight.
[03:44:47.433 --> 03:44:50.696]  But if these things completely melt down, then it's going to be more intense.
[03:44:50.696 --> 03:44:54.159]  And it looks like it, unfortunately, is leaning towards that direction.
[03:44:54.159 --> 03:44:56.381]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, thank you for clarifying that.
[03:44:56.874 --> 03:44:57.735]  One last thing if I could say.
[03:44:57.735 --> 03:45:04.220]  In Chernobyl, one of the big problems was milk from the cows that were near the nuclear disaster.
[03:45:04.220 --> 03:45:06.522]  It was bioaccumulating and being excreted in their milk.
[03:45:06.522 --> 03:45:07.142]  That's right.
[03:45:07.142 --> 03:45:09.304]  So you want to be very careful about dairy products.
[03:45:09.304 --> 03:45:12.767]  You want to be very careful about animal products in radiation-contaminated areas.
[03:45:13.127 --> 03:45:15.088]  All right, thank you.
[03:45:15.088 --> 03:45:17.530]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[03:45:17.530 --> 03:45:18.210]  So, there.
[03:45:18.210 --> 03:45:20.611]  Thank you, callers, for correcting me.
[03:45:20.611 --> 03:45:29.676]  Again, I told you, I mean, on this type of stuff, I just know that it helps to have a healthy thyroid so you don't absorb as much, but it's true, you need the medical grade to fully fill it.
[03:45:29.676 --> 03:45:32.518]  As I said, talk to your doctors from Friday, as I told you.
[03:45:33.168 --> 03:45:34.108]  There.
[03:45:34.108 --> 03:45:40.851]  People are just calling saying the potassium iodine medical grade was sold out all over the country as of yesterday.
[03:45:40.851 --> 03:45:43.092]  So I'm like, well, what are alternatives?
[03:45:43.092 --> 03:45:43.712]  And you heard him.
[03:45:43.712 --> 03:45:47.853]  It's a whole spectrum of vitamins, minerals, nutrients, seaweed.
[03:45:47.853 --> 03:45:52.255]  You go to any sushi place and load up or any grocery store in a big city, they're going to have it.
[03:45:52.255 --> 03:45:52.595]  But again,
[03:45:53.135 --> 03:45:55.096]  I'm not saying that's going to protect you totally.
[03:45:55.096 --> 03:45:55.977]  It's not my job.
[03:45:55.977 --> 03:45:56.838]  I'm not God.
[03:45:56.838 --> 03:45:59.019]  I can't, you know, get it all done for you.
[03:45:59.019 --> 03:46:01.220]  We've got a great seaweed supplement from Kelp.
[03:46:01.220 --> 03:46:04.263]  Again, at Infowarsteam.com because it's sold out a lot of places.
[03:46:04.263 --> 03:46:07.625]  I'm told they have a lot of it there, but Infowarsteam.com.
[03:46:07.625 --> 03:46:19.853]  And that also goes to support the broadcast because in the middle of this crisis, I haven't even been plugging sponsors or the online video bookstore or anything because of this or PrisonPlanet.tv, but we couldn't do any of this without you.
[03:46:19.853 --> 03:46:20.433]  Okay.
[03:46:20.433 --> 03:46:22.995]  Let me, man, I'm even going to fifth hour of retransmission.
[03:46:24.536 --> 03:46:34.501]  Hey Alex, I'm not sure what's going on, but the government's definitely planning for something.
[03:46:34.501 --> 03:46:42.725]  I have some potentially imperative information from one of my relatives stationed out at Fort Hamilton, New York.
[03:46:42.725 --> 03:46:43.726]  He sounded alarmed.
[03:46:43.726 --> 03:46:47.168]  He gave me a call and asked if something major was going on here in the U.S.
[03:46:47.168 --> 03:46:49.309]  And I said, no, nothing that I've seen on the news.
[03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:51.410]  It's just Japan.
[03:46:52.396 --> 03:47:02.071]  And he said that they were provided full biohazard radiation suits with gas masks and they were told they were in preparation for a natural disaster here in the U.S.
[03:47:02.864 --> 03:47:06.587]  Well, I know Steve Watson wrote an article, and if the guys can find it, we'll put it up.
[03:47:06.587 --> 03:47:29.105]  It was on PrisonPlanet.com yesterday about solar watchers precisely predicted the Tokyo, the Japanese quake, and there are the predictions by astrophysicists and people like Piers Corbin, who said that big solar flare hit the Earth hours before the earthquake, coinciding with a, quote, giant moon, the closest it's been to the Earth since 1992.
[03:47:31.167 --> 03:47:38.829]  Or 19 years ago, and that those two things manipulate the magma, not just the tides, and that it contributed to that.
[03:47:38.829 --> 03:47:44.930]  And a lot of these solar physicists and people are saying, look for more earthquakes, including the West Coast of the United States.
[03:47:44.930 --> 03:47:51.312]  I'm not trying to scare people, but that is being discussed in mainstream news, and we're seeing a lot of tectonic activity.
[03:47:51.312 --> 03:47:55.793]  But the government also uses things like this for drills, you know, readiness drills.
[03:47:55.793 --> 03:47:57.874]  But I'd like to get some verification of that.
[03:47:57.874 --> 03:47:59.114]  Did he say anything else, Nolan?
[03:47:59.864 --> 03:48:01.526]  Yeah, that's basically what they told him.
[03:48:01.526 --> 03:48:05.269]  It was for preparation for a natural disaster in the U.S.
[03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:07.211]  within 14 days.
[03:48:07.211 --> 03:48:08.652]  So that was yesterday.
[03:48:08.652 --> 03:48:09.873]  So I'm not sure.
[03:48:09.873 --> 03:48:12.615]  I mean, he sounded alarmed, you know, and he's in the military.
[03:48:12.615 --> 03:48:15.157]  So I'm going to try and get more information out of him.
[03:48:15.157 --> 03:48:15.898]  Let's do this.
[03:48:15.898 --> 03:48:16.839]  I'm going to hang up on you.
[03:48:16.839 --> 03:48:19.401]  Nobody else call in on that line.
[03:48:19.401 --> 03:48:23.425]  From now on, we'll go into mega overdrive if we have to.
[03:48:23.425 --> 03:48:24.886]  Only military personnel.
[03:48:28.524 --> 03:48:30.966]  Fast teams with the Marines, you name it.
[03:48:30.966 --> 03:48:32.106]  Call in at 800-259-9231.
[03:48:32.106 --> 03:48:34.488]  Have you been told get ready for an imminent natural disaster?
[03:48:34.488 --> 03:48:34.568]  800-259-9231.
[03:48:34.568 --> 03:48:36.509]  There is the headline from PrisonPlanet.com on screen.
[03:48:46.976 --> 03:48:53.722]  Both Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, were precisely predicted last month by solar watchers.
[03:48:53.722 --> 03:48:54.823]  Is California next?
[03:48:54.823 --> 03:49:01.068]  Steve Watson, PrisonPlanet.com, also on InfoWars.com.
[03:49:01.068 --> 03:49:02.869]  Let's continue with your calls.
[03:49:02.869 --> 03:49:05.191]  Patton, Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:49:05.191 --> 03:49:05.871]  Hello?
[03:49:05.871 --> 03:49:07.052]  Yes, Pat.
[03:49:07.052 --> 03:49:10.895]  Yeah, Alex, I have two questions.
[03:49:10.895 --> 03:49:13.858]  Sunday you were talking about using Patek, because I'm going to follow your lead.
[03:49:14.836 --> 03:49:23.700]  You were talking about using potassium iodate versus... Yes, that's one version, but that's something the military gave out decades ago, and I looked into it.
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:24.881]  You can't even get it anymore.
[03:49:24.881 --> 03:49:28.083]  But I don't want to get... I'm here live on air trying to track all this.
[03:49:28.083 --> 03:49:29.343]  Check it out for yourself.
[03:49:29.343 --> 03:49:30.584]  I don't have all the answers on this.
[03:49:32.420 --> 03:49:42.503]  According to everybody we've talked to, you want Iostat, 130 milligram, but you can only take it for a little while because it's toxic after that, if radiation exposure comes.
[03:49:42.503 --> 03:49:45.464]  You don't want to really even take it as a preventative.
[03:49:45.464 --> 03:49:48.265]  Once it's clear that things get worse, if you could get it.
[03:49:48.265 --> 03:49:50.546]  But it's all sold out, so you can't get it.
[03:49:50.546 --> 03:49:59.028]  And the pharmacist was saying there's a cocktail of things that help you, but nothing's going to help you if you get a big dose of uranium or plutonium.
[03:49:59.028 --> 03:49:59.468]  Right.
[03:49:59.468 --> 03:50:01.769]  But my question was, Dr. Fuchs said that
[03:50:02.259 --> 03:50:05.221]  You have to know when to stop taking it, and what do you do?
[03:50:05.221 --> 03:50:07.743]  You wait until those drugs go away?
[03:50:07.743 --> 03:50:10.105]  Well, it's all on the drug insert.
[03:50:10.105 --> 03:50:14.349]  So I can't give you medical advice, because I don't even have the drug insert here in front of me.
[03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:18.712]  There's 14 tablets in this, and they recommend you take that regimen.
[03:50:18.712 --> 03:50:20.133]  Just go look it up for yourself.
[03:50:20.133 --> 03:50:26.759]  I mean, look up, Google the drug insert, IOSAT potassium iodide tablets insert.
[03:50:26.759 --> 03:50:27.499]  It'll be online.
[03:50:27.499 --> 03:50:28.981]  We can put it up even on screen.
[03:50:28.981 --> 03:50:29.681]  Read it for yourself.
[03:50:29.681 --> 03:50:30.442]  It's like the flu shot.
[03:50:30.902 --> 03:50:32.503]  Where I said, read the insert.
[03:50:32.503 --> 03:50:36.986]  It says it can cause brain damage, Guillain-Barrés, spontaneous abortions.
[03:50:36.986 --> 03:50:38.266]  Just read it for yourself.
[03:50:38.266 --> 03:50:40.468]  Make your own medical decision.
[03:50:40.468 --> 03:50:43.089]  I cannot give you medical advice.
[03:50:43.089 --> 03:50:49.233]  We've got the potassium iodine nuke core type stuff.
[03:50:49.233 --> 03:50:52.294]  It's expired, but we're gonna, I guess, start taking that.
[03:50:52.294 --> 03:50:55.396]  Because, again, this doesn't give you total protection.
[03:50:55.396 --> 03:50:58.138]  But it's only from one isotope anyways.
[03:50:58.138 --> 03:50:59.859]  You can't dodge this bullet if it comes here.
[03:51:02.597 --> 03:51:03.457]  Sore throat?
[03:51:03.457 --> 03:51:05.719]  Spray that with Dermatol.
[03:51:05.719 --> 03:51:06.580]  Diaper rash?
[03:51:06.580 --> 03:51:08.121]  Spray that with Dermatol.
[03:51:08.121 --> 03:51:08.661]  Ouch!
[03:51:08.661 --> 03:51:09.702]  Burn or cut?
[03:51:09.702 --> 03:51:12.704]  Spray that with Dermatol for shockingly fast relief.
[03:51:12.704 --> 03:51:20.190]  If you had room for only one first aid product in your preparedness kit, you need Dermatol because it works on almost every skin irritation or injury.
[03:51:20.190 --> 03:51:28.816]  All natural Dermatol brings amazing relief to burns, cuts, scrapes, bites, boils, shingles, rashes, elderly, skin tears, even chronic diabetic ulcers and bed sores.
[03:51:29.196 --> 03:51:41.111]  Dermatol is an all-natural, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal wound cleanser that speeds healing with no side effects, is safe for all ages and skin types, and is even safe enough to spray on sore throats or onto sore eyes.

[03:51:43.834 --> 03:51:44.695]  Spell D-E-R-M-A-T-O-L.
[03:51:45.015 --> 03:51:47.038]  M-A-T-O-L dot com.
[03:51:47.038 --> 03:51:49.321]  Order online at Dermatol dot com or call 800-217-6677.
[03:51:49.321 --> 03:51:49.521]  That's 800-217-6677.
[03:51:49.521 --> 03:51:51.103]  Effective, efficient, economical.
[03:51:51.103 --> 03:51:52.204]  Spray it all with Dermatol.
[03:51:52.204 --> 03:51:53.346]  America, you've been warned.
[03:52:10.422 --> 03:52:13.803]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[03:52:13.803 --> 03:52:17.485]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[03:52:17.485 --> 03:52:18.285]  Have you?
[03:52:18.285 --> 03:52:21.867]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[03:52:21.867 --> 03:52:29.590]  Yet, it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:30.770]  Could this really happen?
[03:52:30.770 --> 03:52:34.752]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:52:34.752 --> 03:52:39.774]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[03:52:43.302 --> 03:52:44.003]  I don't know.
[03:53:01.803 --> 03:53:03.704]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:53:03.704 --> 03:53:08.887]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[03:53:08.887 --> 03:53:11.708]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.
[03:53:11.708 --> 03:53:14.250]  MaineMilitary.com carries everything you need.

[03:53:50.757 --> 03:53:50.997]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[03:54:08.717 --> 03:54:09.757]  Alright, here's the deal.
[03:54:09.757 --> 03:54:13.078]  I'm going into super overdrive into the fifth hour.
[03:54:13.078 --> 03:54:18.600]  It will not be on the satellites, it will not be on XM, it will not be on the Genesis streams.
[03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:29.284]  You're gonna have to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv if you're a viewer to watch us and listen to us in the fifth hour.
[03:54:30.044 --> 03:54:34.245]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:34.245 --> 03:54:38.887]  We're going internet only as the four-hour main radio broadcast is about to end.
[03:54:38.887 --> 03:54:43.408]  We'll also go off shortwave as well, but I will be back tomorrow live 11 a.m.
[03:54:43.408 --> 03:54:53.431]  and if things worsen and if these meltdowns continue and these reactor cores continue to be exposed as they admit one of them is now, there's been a major breach and I'm going to break all that down in the next hour.
[03:54:54.673 --> 03:55:02.618]  Then you better believe, ladies and gentlemen, that you will see an announcement at InfoWars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com, that I'm going live at a time.
[03:55:02.618 --> 03:55:10.344]  It'll be internet only on PrisonPlanet.tv for the viewers there and the people listening to the streams on InfoWars.com.
[03:55:10.344 --> 03:55:19.990]  We're also going to add a widget today to the bottom of InfoWars.com that is a flash player that you can post on your own site for people that want to be able to get this information.
[03:55:21.351 --> 03:55:21.491]  I think?
[03:55:39.901 --> 03:55:42.604]  Or families of military people that have been told this.
[03:55:42.604 --> 03:55:45.748]  Have you been told prepare for natural disasters that are imminent?
[03:55:45.748 --> 03:55:48.351]  They're always doing drills, but are they saying something's coming?
[03:55:48.351 --> 03:55:50.014]  What do they know about the solar flares?
[03:55:50.014 --> 03:55:51.976]  What do they know about the moon being so close to the earth?
[03:55:51.976 --> 03:55:53.378]  It controls the seas.
[03:55:53.378 --> 03:55:55.801]  It also controls the magma under the crust.
[03:55:55.801 --> 03:55:57.903]  Or are they using HAARP, which they admit
[03:55:58.752 --> 03:56:07.037]  Like, reprint me the quote in 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Army Times, where he said that governments and terrorists do have tectonic earthquake weapons.
[03:56:07.037 --> 03:56:08.978]  That's not me, that's Secretary of Defense.
[03:56:08.978 --> 03:56:10.679]  So, it could be that too.
[03:56:10.679 --> 03:56:12.040]  This could be a staged event.
[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:14.761]  I don't... It exists.
[03:56:14.761 --> 03:56:16.302]  The globalists are totally ruthless.
[03:56:16.302 --> 03:56:16.743]  Who knows?
[03:56:17.803 --> 03:56:24.989]  I've got Times of Australia articles from in the 50s where they wanted to set off nukes on the ocean floor to create tsunamis to flood the Chinese.
[03:56:24.989 --> 03:56:26.791]  I mean, there's no end to this.
[03:56:26.791 --> 03:56:28.232]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[03:56:28.232 --> 03:56:32.996]  But again, if you're listening to the Genesis Streams or on the Genesis Network, we're going into super overdrive.
[03:56:32.996 --> 03:56:39.401]  You'll have to go to InfoWars.com, listen to the free streams there or the video of your PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[03:56:39.401 --> 03:56:42.183]  We'll continue on into the fifth hour today.
[03:56:42.964 --> 03:56:49.369]  And if stations want to carry that, you're welcome to get the internet feed and carry it if stations want it at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:49.369 --> 03:56:58.837]  But let me give the number out to military personnel or emergency personnel, nuclear physicists, corporate people that are being told to get ready for something in the West.
[03:56:58.837 --> 03:57:02.640]  A lot of earthquake predictors and scientists are saying look for big stuff here.
[03:57:03.540 --> 03:57:07.962]  There's all sorts of volcanoes becoming active again all over the world, not just in Japan.
[03:57:07.962 --> 03:57:09.242]  Here's the toll-free number.
[03:57:09.242 --> 03:57:10.182]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:57:10.182 --> 03:57:11.283]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:57:11.283 --> 03:57:19.245]  And have we opened the phone system up yet?
[03:57:19.245 --> 03:57:19.945]  Guys?
[03:57:19.945 --> 03:57:22.706]  Have we opened the phone system up yet?
[03:57:22.706 --> 03:57:23.507]  Phone system's open.
[03:57:23.507 --> 03:57:24.487]  You can call in right now.
[03:57:24.487 --> 03:57:24.947]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:57:24.947 --> 03:57:25.327]  Now listen.
[03:57:27.861 --> 03:57:29.465]  We need this information.
[03:57:29.465 --> 03:57:33.073]  Do not call if you're not someone with bona fide information.
[03:57:33.073 --> 03:57:33.594]  Do you understand?
[03:57:34.394 --> 03:57:46.017]  Because I know you're going to call and we got one person answering the phones and we don't screen your calls except when we ask specific questions and we don't have time to talk to you for five minutes while you tell us information but don't have the bona fides.
[03:57:46.017 --> 03:57:50.458]  This is only... I'm asking you to respect the show, some of you out there.
[03:57:50.458 --> 03:57:55.219]  We appreciate everyone, but only if you have this information, leave the lines open for everybody else.
[03:57:55.219 --> 03:57:55.719]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:57:55.719 --> 03:57:55.919]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:58:00.720 --> 03:58:02.703]  Everybody else will be back tomorrow live at 11 a.m.
[03:58:02.703 --> 03:58:03.725]  Central Standard Time.
[03:58:03.725 --> 03:58:06.329]  That's 12 noon Eastern, 9 a.m.
[03:58:06.329 --> 03:58:07.591]  Pacific, 10 a.m.
[03:58:07.591 --> 03:58:09.053]  Mountain Time.
[03:58:09.053 --> 03:58:10.295]  Pray for Japan.
[03:58:10.295 --> 03:58:11.637]  Pray for the rest of the world.
[03:58:11.637 --> 03:58:14.822]  This is already beginning to dwarf Chernobyl.
[03:58:14.822 --> 03:58:15.804]  Pray for everyone there.
[03:58:16.244 --> 03:58:20.568]  We now know that we were correct Friday, Saturday, Monday, and today that there's been a cover-up going on.
[03:58:20.568 --> 03:58:24.812]  I'll recap and give you the latest information straight ahead after this one-minute break.
[03:58:24.812 --> 03:58:32.098]  But to join us, you need to tune on the web for the free iPhone app or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:58:32.098 --> 03:58:33.239]  Great job to the crew.
[03:58:33.239 --> 03:58:37.002]  Couldn't do it without them and you, the listeners, sponsors, affiliates, everyone.
[03:58:37.002 --> 03:58:37.643]  God bless you.
[03:58:37.643 --> 03:58:38.383]  Pray for America.
[03:58:38.383 --> 03:58:39.084]  Pray for Japan.
[03:58:39.084 --> 03:58:39.885]  Pray for the whole world.
[03:58:43.072 --> 03:58:44.377]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:44.377 --> 03:58:45.159]  Back in one minute.
[03:58:45.159 --> 03:58:45.741]  Stay with us.
[03:58:45.741 --> 03:58:46.765]  Transmission continues.
[03:58:46.765 --> 03:58:48.792]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:52.924 --> 03:58:56.945]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:58:56.945 --> 03:59:00.186]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:59:00.186 --> 03:59:04.987]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:59:04.987 --> 03:59:11.369]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:59:11.369 --> 03:59:13.610]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.450]  Tim Geithner?
[03:59:14.450 --> 03:59:14.970]  Bernanke?
[03:59:14.970 --> 03:59:15.490]  They're arsonists!
[03:59:15.490 --> 03:59:16.731]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:59:16.731 --> 03:59:19.171]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:59:33.055 --> 03:59:35.176]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:59:35.176 --> 03:59:40.338]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:59:40.338 --> 03:59:54.464]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:59:54.464 --> 03:59:56.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:59:56.705 --> 03:59:58.406]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[04:00:05.421 --> 04:00:11.426]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[04:00:11.426 --> 04:00:15.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:22.394]  Okay, we have opened up our phone lines live into the fifth hour for military personnel only.
[04:00:22.394 --> 04:00:25.737]  What have you been hearing about Japan, what's really going on?
[04:00:25.737 --> 04:00:28.039]  About deployments, the fleet pulling out.
[04:00:28.039 --> 04:00:32.062]  A caller earlier, and I'm getting emails saying that they're preparing for earthquakes in the U.S.
[04:00:32.062 --> 04:00:33.163]  saying it's going to happen.
[04:00:34.083 --> 04:00:41.625]  Secretary of Defense Cohen back in 97 said that there are governments and terrorists who have developed tectonic weapons.
[04:00:41.625 --> 04:00:43.886]  Yeah, like the globalists that run our country.
[04:00:43.886 --> 04:00:47.967]  Could this be a tectonic rollout as they bring in global crisis?
[04:00:47.967 --> 04:00:54.049]  Or is it the sun and the moon manipulating tectonic plates with the solar flare and the moon being closer to the earth than it's been since 1992, 19 years ago?
[04:00:57.032 --> 04:01:10.074]  All of this plays in, but we are going to be opening the phones up here for military people or emergency personnel who can confirm this.
[04:01:10.074 --> 04:01:17.295]  877-789-ALEX is the number for you to call and join us as we go into hour number five.
[04:01:17.295 --> 04:01:21.936]  Here's some of the news, and I'll continue with the news as we track this and start going to your calls.
[04:01:21.936 --> 04:01:22.256]  U.S.
[04:01:22.256 --> 04:01:25.897]  government blocking Americans from obtaining potassium iodide.
[04:01:26.397 --> 04:01:29.660]  Panic buying stocks of tassel iodide exhausted in the U.S.
[04:01:29.660 --> 04:01:32.102]  as well as many areas of Europe and Asia.
[04:01:32.102 --> 04:01:43.352]  Mass evacuations begin from northeast of Japan and Tokyo as the scale of the nuclear disaster unfolding at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant begins to finally be realized.
[04:01:43.933 --> 04:01:44.153]  We've been
[04:02:00.021 --> 04:02:04.064]  Radioactive winds head towards Tokyo as some flee capital.
[04:02:04.064 --> 04:02:05.586]  That's the earlier article.
[04:02:05.586 --> 04:02:08.268]  All on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[04:02:08.268 --> 04:02:13.794]  They got better 24 hours a day as this unfortunately worsens and deteriorates.
[04:02:13.794 --> 04:02:17.737]  Japanese Prime Minister attempts to calm nation as mass radiation spreads.
[04:02:17.737 --> 04:02:18.018]  U.S.
[04:02:18.018 --> 04:02:21.901]  Navy low-level radiation detected at some Tokyo area bases.
[04:02:23.922 --> 04:02:36.127]  Continuing online monitors at different Tokyo facilities and other smaller towns around the country are reporting escalations of between 20 and 100 times normal levels of radiation.
[04:02:36.127 --> 04:02:38.608]  And those detectors can only pick up certain types of radiation.
[04:02:38.608 --> 04:02:48.232]  There's many different isotopes blasting out of the Fukushima facility that has had now four, perhaps five, massive explosions, including the mushroom cloud as the mark one.
[04:02:51.109 --> 04:02:51.249]  Let's
[04:03:11.596 --> 04:03:14.760]  Power employees, 500 of them back in.
[04:03:14.760 --> 04:03:17.223]  It appears they're refusing to go back in.
[04:03:17.223 --> 04:03:20.827]  And so you basically got six reactors going completely haywire.
[04:03:20.827 --> 04:03:22.429]  Fires, explosions.
[04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:23.710]  It isn't good.
[04:03:23.710 --> 04:03:24.331]  Okay?
[04:03:24.331 --> 04:03:31.339]  And I told listeners who were in Japan Friday, and you heard me, I said, get out of Tokyo.
[04:03:32.182 --> 04:03:39.785]  Go south, because the winds at that time were going northeast, but I said it may turn south later, but the north predominantly gets most of the winds.
[04:03:39.785 --> 04:03:40.826]  Get out of there.
[04:03:40.826 --> 04:03:41.906]  There's no perfect advice.
[04:03:41.906 --> 04:03:43.367]  I'm telling you what I would do.
[04:03:43.367 --> 04:03:44.668]  That's where people are going.
[04:03:44.668 --> 04:03:46.969]  The government's saying go south.
[04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:47.889]  Four days later.
[04:03:47.889 --> 04:03:49.310]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[04:03:49.310 --> 04:03:50.350]  Four days later.
[04:03:50.350 --> 04:03:51.831]  So, again, not tooting our horn.
[04:03:51.831 --> 04:03:53.351]  We're giving overall good information.
[04:03:53.351 --> 04:03:54.252]  We're not perfect.
[04:03:54.252 --> 04:03:55.032]  We're trying our best.
[04:03:55.032 --> 04:03:56.773]  We're putting our heads together.
[04:03:56.773 --> 04:03:57.353]  Talking to you.
[04:04:00.959 --> 04:04:04.584]  And waiting for phone calls to come in from the military or other emergency personnel.
[04:04:04.584 --> 04:04:07.548]  Have you been told to prepare for earthquakes here in the United States?
[04:04:07.548 --> 04:04:10.993]  Have we gotten any calls?
[04:04:10.993 --> 04:04:11.834]  You didn't have your mic open.
[04:04:13.655 --> 04:04:15.155]  Okay, the phone lines are open.
[04:04:15.155 --> 04:04:19.537]  I appreciate listeners not calling if they don't have specific information.
[04:04:19.537 --> 04:04:24.878]  And we're having no military personnel calling in to confirm what the earlier caller said.
[04:04:24.878 --> 04:04:30.439]  Now, the guy sounded, you know, nice, but you can't believe just what some caller says.
[04:04:30.439 --> 04:04:32.600]  But you look at Steve Watson's article where a lot of
[04:04:33.300 --> 04:04:42.264]  Different organizations that study earthquakes, connecting them to the moon, being closer to the earth and the sun, are saying there's a higher probability of earthquakes.
[04:04:42.264 --> 04:04:47.127]  And obviously, California is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire headline.
[04:04:47.127 --> 04:04:54.550]  Both Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, were precisely predicted last month by Solar Watchers.
[04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:57.212]  Very important article.
[04:04:57.212 --> 04:04:58.732]  Continuing, Brisbane Times.
[04:05:00.504 --> 04:05:02.265]  Escalate Japan's nuclear crisis.
[04:05:02.265 --> 04:05:14.431]  Explosions at fire at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant have unleashed dangerous levels of radiation, sparking a collapse of the stock market and panic buying in supermarkets.
[04:05:14.431 --> 04:05:24.677]  Continuing, the UN weather agency said the winds were currently blowing radioactive materials towards the ocean and that there were no implications for Japan or countries nearby.
[04:05:26.394 --> 04:05:28.015]  I don't know what that means.
[04:05:28.015 --> 04:05:39.144]  France's nuclear security authorities have the disaster now equated to a six on the seven point international scale for nuclear accidents, ranking the crisis second only in gravity to Chernobyl.
[04:05:39.144 --> 04:05:50.372]  Europe's energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, dubbed the nuclear disaster an apocalypse, saying Tokyo had almost lost control of events at the Fukushima power plant.
[04:05:50.372 --> 04:05:54.515]  There is talk of an apocalypse, and I think the world is particularly
[04:05:55.616 --> 04:05:56.877]  Uh, well-chosen.
[04:05:56.877 --> 04:06:00.200]  Again, there is talk of apocalypse, and I think the word is particularly well-chosen.
[04:06:00.200 --> 04:06:11.250]  He said in remarks to the European Parliament, Japan, however, maintained its assessment of the disaster at 4, placing it behind the Three Mile Island accident in the United States at 79.
[04:06:11.250 --> 04:06:12.611]  Oh, give me a break.
[04:06:12.611 --> 04:06:14.593]  Three Mile Island was nothing compared to this.
[04:06:15.761 --> 04:06:18.223]  Oh, this is just amazing.
[04:06:18.223 --> 04:06:21.404]  Japan, radiation linking directly into the air.
[04:06:21.404 --> 04:06:23.826]  Reuters, Vienna.
[04:06:23.826 --> 04:06:31.810]  Japan has told the UN nuclear watchdog radioactivity was being released directly into the atmosphere from the site of the earthquake-stricken reactor.
[04:06:31.810 --> 04:06:35.392]  And again, Reactor 2, its core containment facility, is breached.
[04:06:35.392 --> 04:06:36.473]  We don't know how bad.
[04:06:36.473 --> 04:06:40.595]  And I guess they're seeing that from aircraft because there's really no personnel there, reportedly.
[04:06:41.115 --> 04:06:41.175]  Yes.
[04:07:00.410 --> 04:07:05.071]  Millisvert per hour have been reported at the Fukushima power plant site.
[04:07:05.071 --> 04:07:14.094]  They did not give details or comparisons of the radiation level, but exposure to over 100 milliverts a year is a level which can lead to cancer.
[04:07:14.094 --> 04:07:17.435]  So you're getting 400 milliverts when you're there for an hour.
[04:07:18.055 --> 04:07:19.697]  Or less.
[04:07:19.697 --> 04:07:22.901]  And 100 in a year, more than 100 is bad news.
[04:07:22.901 --> 04:07:25.924]  Because we all live in a radiation-baked environment.
[04:07:25.924 --> 04:07:30.049]  We're close to a sun just blasting different types of radioactive wavelengths at us.
[04:07:30.049 --> 04:07:33.233]  So we're designed to live in this, but not at these levels.
[04:07:33.233 --> 04:07:35.275]  The Japanese, that's one reason we die, folks.
[04:07:35.275 --> 04:07:36.016]  It breaks down our DNA.
[04:07:37.119 --> 04:07:39.801]  We're living in just radiation.
[04:07:39.801 --> 04:07:45.384]  The Japanese authorities are saying there is a possibility that the fire was caused by a hydrogen explosion.
[04:07:45.384 --> 04:07:52.269]  The IAEA said in a statement, it later said that the fire had been extinguished at Unit 4 of the plant.
[04:07:52.269 --> 04:08:04.177]  In Japan, authorities warned radiation levels had begun significantly higher around the nuclear power plant on Tuesday after explosions at two reactors, and the French embassy said low-level radioactivity wind could reach Tokyo within hours.
[04:08:04.557 --> 04:08:07.219]  Ours is now a lapse that reporting the radiation levels going up.
[04:08:35.899 --> 04:08:37.420]  We have Urethi in Texas.
[04:08:37.420 --> 04:08:41.982]  Urethi, do you have any intel specifically on the military?
[04:08:41.982 --> 04:08:48.765]  Are you in the military saying that they're preparing for imminent natural disasters in the U.S.?
[04:08:48.765 --> 04:08:53.708]  Is it a drill, or is your intel that they're saying it's imminent?
[04:08:53.708 --> 04:09:02.712]  Yes, I have a cousin stationed at Fort Cox, and they're preparing for a radiological attack from abroad.
[04:09:02.712 --> 04:09:03.593]  That's a joke caller.
[04:09:04.571 --> 04:09:06.112]  Man, buddy, this isn't funny.
[04:09:06.112 --> 04:09:09.154]  I know in America we've been brainwashed by TV.
[04:09:09.154 --> 04:09:14.358]  Males are put into an arrested development at about a seven-year-old level.
[04:09:14.358 --> 04:09:25.706]  But, you know, just for him, so I can take a two-minute break while we get some more callers lined up, can we play that clip of attention American pigs?
[04:09:25.706 --> 04:09:26.867]  You know, that particular clip?
[04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:57.314]  Yeah, it's up there in the board, that I did a month or so ago to describe the globalist view of us, and you know, the caller thinks it's real funny that all of this is happening, and I will assure you, it will not be funny if this continues to melt down, and if plutonium and uranium gets out, and we're watching a bunch of dead Japanese people, and then that radiation comes over here, and the government tells you that everything is okay,
[04:09:59.295 --> 04:10:03.937]  And basically tells you that everything... I've seen it up on the computer board, just so you know.
[04:10:03.937 --> 04:10:06.278]  I've seen it on one of those blocks.
[04:10:06.278 --> 04:10:10.759]  Or you can play the Ultimate Red Pill if you want, and I'll go out there and look.
[04:10:10.759 --> 04:10:11.740]  I forget the name of it, though.
[04:10:11.740 --> 04:10:12.800]  It's also all over YouTube.
[04:10:14.156 --> 04:10:18.879]  Um, somebody did a video version of it where it says Alex Jones taken over by the new world order.
[04:10:18.879 --> 04:10:20.841]  I probably shouldn't even, it's not even a joke though.
[04:10:20.841 --> 04:10:28.626]  I mean, I did the piece basically from the globalist, uh, you know, perspective, uh, on us and, uh, what they think of us.
[04:10:28.626 --> 04:10:30.067]  So the prankers are out there.
[04:10:30.067 --> 04:10:33.289]  They think it's very funny since I promised to take phone calls.
[04:10:33.289 --> 04:10:36.771]  Uh, we'll just open the phones up, uh, to the general public, 877-789-ALEX-877.
[04:10:39.633 --> 04:10:41.694]  789-A-L-E-X.
[04:10:41.694 --> 04:10:50.036]  That'll give us your overall quick 30-second... It's almost like radio graffiti, as one talk show host I know calls it.
[04:10:50.036 --> 04:10:50.716]  I forget his name.
[04:10:50.716 --> 04:10:54.297]  What's the... Combs.
[04:10:54.297 --> 04:10:55.778]  Combs from Fox.
[04:10:55.778 --> 04:10:57.238]  Calls it radio graffiti.
[04:10:57.238 --> 04:11:00.139]  Just your quick 30-second statement and I'm going to the next person.
[04:11:00.139 --> 04:11:01.379]  Boom, boom, boom.
[04:11:01.379 --> 04:11:03.520]  Deborah in Idaho, you're on the air.
[04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:06.361]  Are you a military caller or just one of the other callers?
[04:11:07.452 --> 04:11:11.275]  Yes, I'm a medical professional, and I just got off the phone with the EPA.
[04:11:11.275 --> 04:11:37.292]  I've been tracking this website, the RADNet, which is the Tracking Environmental Radiation Nationwide Network, and I went in there to try to find out what we were doing here locally in Idaho, and I called the local EPA number here, and they referred me to Seattle, and I have a phone call in to them, and they're supposed to return my call.
[04:11:38.256 --> 04:11:42.380]  The thing I was concerned about is that the website is inaccessible.
[04:11:42.380 --> 04:11:52.188]  They have taken the website down so that you cannot get any live streaming of baseline radiation measurements here in the U.S.
[04:11:52.188 --> 04:12:04.578]  And I called the main laboratory in Montgomery, Alabama, which is where they send the specimens to be measured once they're taken at these various sites across the country.
[04:12:05.470 --> 04:12:12.234]  And they, on their website, it states whether they are either always in emergency or routine mode.
[04:12:12.234 --> 04:12:20.719]  And I asked them and they said that they were in emergency mode and that they are deploying personnel to the West Coast.
[04:12:20.719 --> 04:12:26.562]  Again, ma'am, can you give us specific facilities that you were talking to so we can make phone calls to you guys?
[04:12:26.562 --> 04:12:27.262]  Yes.
[04:12:27.262 --> 04:12:30.224]  The laboratory is located in Montgomery, Alabama.
[04:12:30.224 --> 04:12:33.306]  It's the National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory.
[04:12:34.215 --> 04:12:38.418]  The phone number is 334... Paul, let's not give it out on air or it'll flood them.
[04:12:38.418 --> 04:12:39.859]  Do me a favor.
[04:12:39.859 --> 04:12:41.440]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[04:12:41.440 --> 04:12:50.146]  Will you give us the full name and the phone number and I will call it live on air here in just a few minutes, okay?
[04:12:50.146 --> 04:12:52.988]  Well, they referred me to the Washington, D.C.
[04:12:52.988 --> 04:12:53.408]  office.
[04:12:53.408 --> 04:12:55.509]  They really didn't want to handle any phone calls.
[04:12:55.509 --> 04:12:58.932]  She was kind of hesitant to talk to me or tell me anything.
[04:12:58.932 --> 04:13:00.833]  And I tried calling the Washington, D.C.
[04:13:00.833 --> 04:13:02.354]  phone number and I'm getting a recording.
[04:13:02.574 --> 04:13:09.999]  Well, that's big breaking news that the federal government is deploying people to the West Coast ahead of fallout, showing that they know it's a real danger.
[04:13:09.999 --> 04:13:11.420]  This is unbelievably huge.
[04:13:13.302 --> 04:13:15.423]  We have limited personnel today of all days.
[04:13:15.423 --> 04:13:17.463]  They're doing a great job scrambling in there.
[04:13:17.463 --> 04:13:24.245]  Ma'am, I'm going to put you on hold and give us that full name again and that phone number.
[04:13:24.245 --> 04:13:30.447]  And before they tell him not to talk to us, I'm going to call him live here on air in just a moment.
[04:13:30.447 --> 04:13:32.487]  Bill, will you get on the line with her?
[04:13:35.165 --> 04:13:37.305]  Well, I have several different phone numbers.
[04:13:37.305 --> 04:13:39.366]  Okay, well, give us the one.
[04:13:39.366 --> 04:13:44.647]  What was the name of the person that you talked to when you got on the phone with him?
[04:13:44.647 --> 04:13:47.188]  Well, I talked to several different ones.
[04:13:47.188 --> 04:13:52.469]  I talked to one in Seattle at the EPA station in Seattle that handles radiation.
[04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:55.269]  Did they tell you that people were being deployed?
[04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:56.650]  They are all in meeting right now.
[04:13:58.450 --> 04:14:01.912]  But yeah, she said equipment has been deployed, but it is not.
[04:14:01.912 --> 04:14:05.394]  It's being stockpiled right now at this stage.
[04:14:05.394 --> 04:14:06.594]  They have not actually deployed it yet.
[04:14:06.594 --> 04:14:13.758]  Well, that would tell us why they're telling clinics not to give people prescriptions for the medical-grade iodine.
[04:14:13.758 --> 04:14:15.999]  Could be.
[04:14:15.999 --> 04:14:18.900]  Very, very... I don't know about that.
[04:14:18.900 --> 04:14:21.402]  But I do have the phone number in Washington, D.C.
[04:14:21.402 --> 04:14:24.243]  for the media line as well.
[04:14:24.243 --> 04:14:27.045]  But I don't know that you'd get anybody to answer your questions there.
[04:14:28.544 --> 04:14:37.349]  Like I said, they've taken down the national website so that you can't, because I told her I wanted to see what the baseline data was, because there's nothing recorded for this entire year.
[04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:41.091]  Okay, and to be specific, just for everybody on air, what was the, Montgomery, Alabama?
[04:14:41.091 --> 04:14:42.933]  I couldn't write that fast.
[04:14:42.933 --> 04:14:51.718]  It's the National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory in Montgomery, Alabama.
[04:14:51.718 --> 04:14:53.759]  That's where the actual sampling goes.
[04:14:54.577 --> 04:15:01.566]  They have the scintillation counters there where they can actually break it down into the different isotopes.
[04:15:01.566 --> 04:15:03.429]  Okay, great job Debra.
[04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:07.374]  We're going to put you on hold and get that number so we don't give it out on air.
[04:15:07.374 --> 04:15:08.856]  And then we're going to call it live on air.
[04:15:08.856 --> 04:15:10.258]  Thank you so much for that call.
[04:15:11.727 --> 04:15:13.107]  Let's go ahead and go to Linda in Washington.
[04:15:13.107 --> 04:15:15.068]  We're just talking to Deborah in Idaho.
[04:15:15.068 --> 04:15:16.828]  Linda in Washington, you're on the air.
[04:15:31.121 --> 04:15:32.922]  Hi Alex, first time caller.
[04:15:32.922 --> 04:15:38.286]  Real quick, I did get in touch with the EPA in Washington State yesterday.
[04:15:38.286 --> 04:15:40.207]  And they told me their hands were tied.
[04:15:40.207 --> 04:15:43.989]  The United States government was not telling them what to do.
[04:15:43.989 --> 04:15:46.451]  I told him what my plans were.
[04:15:46.451 --> 04:15:50.834]  It seemed he was on course with me to take some potassium iodate.
[04:15:50.834 --> 04:15:54.196]  So, um, I'm just a regular layman who just got pissed off.
[04:15:54.196 --> 04:15:56.978]  Pardon my language.
[04:15:56.978 --> 04:15:59.720]  And so they just said they're not being told anything by the feds?
[04:16:00.270 --> 04:16:04.074]  They told us we're not, you know, they haven't got any information.
[04:16:04.074 --> 04:16:11.300]  He said no information, they've been inquiring, and I told him what we were doing, and he said spread it to everyone you know.
[04:16:11.300 --> 04:16:17.426]  Alright, so they were concerned, so he was concerned about radiation?
[04:16:17.426 --> 04:16:18.287]  Very concerned.
[04:16:19.275 --> 04:16:20.496]  I'm very concerned.
[04:16:20.496 --> 04:16:23.699]  Alright, thank you so much for that intel.
[04:16:23.699 --> 04:16:25.881]  Linda, let's talk to Rick in New York.
[04:16:25.881 --> 04:16:27.022]  These are great calls.
[04:16:27.022 --> 04:16:28.923]  They're really doing good work out there.
[04:16:28.923 --> 04:16:31.125]  Rick in New York, you're on the air.
[04:16:31.125 --> 04:16:31.645]  Yes, sir.
[04:16:31.645 --> 04:16:32.026]  Hey, man.
[04:16:32.026 --> 04:16:33.207]  How you doing, Alex?
[04:16:33.207 --> 04:16:38.912]  I was at a week-long cleanup project, cleaning up radioactive soil in the South Pacific in 78, 79.
[04:16:38.912 --> 04:16:42.915]  But I've been looking at the HAARP graph on HAARPalaska.edu.
[04:16:42.915 --> 04:16:45.297]  That's the website for HAARP.
[04:16:45.297 --> 04:16:47.499]  And you can look at the graph from the 11th, and it was
[04:16:48.214 --> 04:16:49.715]  Great things going on on the 11th.
[04:16:49.715 --> 04:16:51.715]  You can look at the graph for yourself.
[04:16:51.715 --> 04:16:54.016]  I'll get a chance to get through it tonight.
[04:16:54.016 --> 04:16:58.478]  Well, you sent me an email of that because they do show the power they're supposedly using.
[04:16:58.478 --> 04:17:01.039]  Are you saying they were using more power on the 11th?
[04:17:01.039 --> 04:17:08.042]  Well, I showed the graph going straight across, and on the 11th it goes straight down, all three graphs, downward and east and west.
[04:17:08.042 --> 04:17:13.844]  I don't know what the graph means, wind or amen, but it was powered up and amen down at minus 500, whatever that means.
[04:17:14.468 --> 04:17:21.914]  Well, you can look at Alaska, uh, HarpAlaska.edu, and it shows you a graph of fluctuations.
[04:17:21.914 --> 04:17:24.556]  HarpAlaska.edu.
[04:17:24.556 --> 04:17:27.338]  You know what's weird about... Sir, I appreciate your call.
[04:17:27.338 --> 04:17:33.764]  About four and a half years ago, I get this bizarre call from the commanding colonel at the HAARP facility.
[04:17:33.764 --> 04:17:36.966]  My producer does, saying the director of HAARP would like to be interviewed.
[04:17:36.966 --> 04:17:37.707]  We called the numbers.
[04:17:37.707 --> 04:17:38.608]  It was real.
[04:17:38.608 --> 04:17:40.289]  They had the scientist head on.
[04:17:40.289 --> 04:17:42.751]  He was, I guess, a listener of the show, to explain, oh, it's no big deal.
[04:17:42.751 --> 04:17:43.491]  It's fun and happy.
[04:17:44.352 --> 04:17:48.955]  And then they started cutting him off when he said, but we ignite the atmosphere some nights.
[04:17:48.955 --> 04:17:50.475]  And then the colonel came on and cut it off.
[04:17:50.475 --> 04:17:51.316]  We had to go to break.
[04:17:51.316 --> 04:17:52.496]  That's a famous interview.
[04:17:52.496 --> 04:17:53.337]  We ought to dig that up.
[04:17:53.337 --> 04:17:54.397]  I know it's got to be somewhere.
[04:17:54.397 --> 04:17:56.078]  Alex Jones interviews director of HAARP.
[04:17:56.078 --> 04:17:58.960]  Folks ought to find that and repost it somewhere.
[04:17:58.960 --> 04:18:00.060]  I've never seen it on YouTube.
[04:18:00.060 --> 04:18:01.921]  I would guess it would be.
[04:18:01.921 --> 04:18:07.144]  But just amazing, amazing information.
[04:18:07.144 --> 04:18:10.346]  As soon as we have confirmed
[04:18:12.153 --> 04:18:24.842]  As soon as we've confirmed that I have this phone number and that this is the phone number to the Alabama Air and Radiation Testing Facility in Mobile, Alabama, as soon as we've tested the number and checked it, we're going to call it live on air.
[04:18:24.842 --> 04:18:34.930]  We're going to play this globalist satire piece, what the globals really do think of you, and then we're going to play the red pill video.
[04:18:36.852 --> 04:18:46.858]  So I got a four minute break so I can work on some things behind the scenes and then I'm going to come back and call this number live on air and continue with your phone calls.
[04:18:46.858 --> 04:18:48.739]  But again, we're a small operation.
[04:18:48.739 --> 04:18:59.306]  The listeners are doing what I need to be doing and that is, you know, calling these government agencies about giving us statements, government statements, about concerns of fallout on the West Coast.
[04:19:00.166 --> 04:19:00.507]  I don't know.
[04:19:22.062 --> 04:19:22.302]  to go.
[04:19:40.902 --> 04:19:47.386]  Three months saying, I'm New World Order, and I was gonna be in a bunker today, and that there was gonna be the end of the world and the pole shift.
[04:19:47.386 --> 04:19:50.447]  That didn't happen, but something really did happen.
[04:19:50.447 --> 04:19:51.348]  But I'm not in a bunker.
[04:19:51.348 --> 04:19:53.689]  You see, I'm right here on air.
[04:19:53.689 --> 04:19:56.851]  The crazy conspiracy theories that go viral on the web.
[04:19:56.851 --> 04:19:59.232]  But who would have ever thought this would have happened on top of all of it?
[04:19:59.232 --> 04:20:00.913]  It is very, very strange.
[04:20:00.913 --> 04:20:04.555]  All right, we'll go ahead and go to these clips, and then we'll be back.
[04:20:04.555 --> 04:20:08.458]  We are live, four hours and 20 minutes into transmission.
[04:20:08.458 --> 04:20:08.858]  Stay with us.
[04:20:09.890 --> 04:20:17.355]  Attention American pigs, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, landowners.
[04:20:17.355 --> 04:20:19.216]  We have destroyed your families.
[04:20:19.216 --> 04:20:21.797]  We have destroyed your moral compass.
[04:20:21.797 --> 04:20:23.959]  We have taken your country over.
[04:20:23.959 --> 04:20:27.221]  We are the New World Order banking syndicate.
[04:20:27.221 --> 04:20:30.623]  Our ally China has enslaved and murdered its
[04:20:38.161 --> 04:20:43.023]  The world government is here.
[04:20:43.023 --> 04:20:47.865]  Most of your population has already succumbed to our mind control system.
[04:20:47.865 --> 04:20:51.507]  And now we are going to bring in our world government.
[04:20:51.507 --> 04:20:53.607]  Keep taking the vaccines.
[04:20:53.607 --> 04:20:57.869]  Continue dying from all of the cancer viruses that we add to them.
[04:20:57.869 --> 04:21:02.691]  Drink the sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals that we add.
[04:21:02.691 --> 04:21:05.572]  There is nothing you can do to the New World Order.
[04:21:05.572 --> 04:21:07.073]  There is no way you can stop us.
[04:21:18.420 --> 04:21:20.021]  We're good to go.
[04:21:47.318 --> 04:21:47.939]  We're good to go.
[04:22:01.383 --> 04:22:04.664]  The Federal Reserve is here to help you.
[04:22:04.664 --> 04:22:06.724]  Oh, words are dangerous.
[04:22:06.724 --> 04:22:12.845]  Don't be angry at your government amassing giant paramilitary force against you.
[04:22:12.845 --> 04:22:17.706]  If you are listening to this transmission, you are not the resistance.
[04:22:17.706 --> 04:22:20.126]  You are not the resistance!
[04:22:20.126 --> 04:22:23.287]  No, no, no!
[04:22:23.287 --> 04:22:25.707]  Don't resist the resisting!
[04:22:25.707 --> 04:22:30.148]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[04:22:31.317 --> 04:22:34.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[04:22:54.706 --> 04:23:00.130]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[04:23:00.130 --> 04:23:01.231]  Lay down, GI!
[04:23:01.231 --> 04:23:02.452]  Lay down, GI!
[04:23:02.452 --> 04:23:04.473]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[04:23:04.473 --> 04:23:11.018]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[04:23:11.018 --> 04:23:13.480]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[04:23:13.840 --> 04:23:17.463]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[04:23:17.463 --> 04:23:19.205]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[04:23:19.205 --> 04:23:21.466]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[04:23:21.466 --> 04:23:25.890]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more!
[04:23:25.890 --> 04:23:26.931]  I want freedom!
[04:23:26.931 --> 04:23:29.213]  That's what I want, and that's what you should want!
[04:23:29.813 --> 04:23:38.159]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose and just suffer the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[04:23:38.159 --> 04:23:45.384]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[04:23:45.384 --> 04:23:49.907]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[04:23:49.907 --> 04:23:52.708]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[04:23:52.708 --> 04:23:59.553]  The 21st century is going to be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and individual significance.
[04:24:01.254 --> 04:24:09.278]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[04:24:09.278 --> 04:24:10.238]  What a bunch of garbage.
[04:24:10.238 --> 04:24:12.279]  Liberal, Democrat, Conservative, Republican.
[04:24:12.279 --> 04:24:14.000]  It's all there to control you.
[04:24:14.000 --> 04:24:16.501]  Two sides of the same coin.
[04:24:16.501 --> 04:24:22.204]  Two management teams getting for control the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[04:24:22.204 --> 04:24:23.945]  The truth is out there in front of you.
[04:24:23.945 --> 04:24:25.986]  But they lay out this buffet of lies.
[04:24:25.986 --> 04:24:29.008]  I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[04:24:29.008 --> 04:24:29.548]  Do you got me?
[04:24:29.548 --> 04:24:30.969]  Human kind is too good.
[04:24:30.969 --> 04:24:34.452]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[04:24:34.452 --> 04:24:38.416]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.
[04:24:38.416 --> 04:24:41.739]  We're going to do real things.
[04:24:41.739 --> 04:24:43.140]  The things that matter.
[04:24:43.140 --> 04:24:48.124]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[04:24:48.124 --> 04:24:48.665]  Well, that's it.
[04:24:48.665 --> 04:24:49.806]  That's all I got to say.
[04:24:49.806 --> 04:24:50.607]  Continue your court.
[04:24:55.848 --> 04:25:03.138]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:25:03.138 --> 04:25:05.521]  We are live at 335 Central Standard Time.
[04:25:09.465 --> 04:25:10.905]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[04:25:10.905 --> 04:25:33.692]  We are four hours, 25 minutes into live transmission as Chernobyl-2 unfolds in the middle of populated Japan as the evacuations accelerate from Tokyo, about 150 kilometers south of the Fukushima 6 reactor crisis with four reactors melting down, one core containment facility breached.
[04:25:33.692 --> 04:25:38.013]  Reuters AP reporting as of this morning, more fires, more insanity.
[04:25:40.339 --> 04:25:42.320]  I worked at the Fukushima plant.
[04:26:00.230 --> 04:26:00.830]  Really?
[04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:02.790]  Yes, I worked there in May of 2009.
[04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:04.731]  I'm an American.
[04:26:04.731 --> 04:26:06.171]  I live here in America.
[04:26:06.171 --> 04:26:07.351]  Spent about three weeks there.
[04:26:07.351 --> 04:26:11.552]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they're General Electric-built, so there's a lot of Americans there.
[04:26:11.552 --> 04:26:21.514]  Well, actually, I'll say I've worked at a lot of nuclear plants, and what a lot of these plants do is they buy units from several different manufacturers.
[04:26:21.514 --> 04:26:28.815]  Siemens, Siemens Westinghouse, GE, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, or the old Dallas Chalmers, which they're out of business now.
[04:26:29.355 --> 04:26:32.577]  Anyway, I worked on Unit 6, which is a Toshiba unit.
[04:26:32.577 --> 04:26:38.539]  It's actually shut down for inspection at the time of the earthquake.
[04:26:38.539 --> 04:26:42.241]  This is one of the largest, it was definitely the largest plant I've ever been to.
[04:26:42.241 --> 04:26:43.982]  I was completely in awe working there.
[04:26:43.982 --> 04:26:45.983]  It was so huge, it was like a small city.
[04:26:46.867 --> 04:26:57.055]  And nuclear plants are like little kingdoms in themselves, and they have all their own little systems and units and rules, as well as the federal and international rules that overlay them.
[04:26:57.055 --> 04:27:01.278]  But they all have their own little training facilities and seminars, which, you know, I had to go through.
[04:27:01.278 --> 04:27:02.639]  I did not work in containment.
[04:27:02.639 --> 04:27:07.343]  I worked on the turbine deck as an on-site machinist, and that's my specialty.
[04:27:07.343 --> 04:27:11.106]  I basically machine things that are too big to move.
[04:27:11.106 --> 04:27:14.048]  This is, I think, the third largest plant in Japan.
[04:27:16.212 --> 04:27:21.877]  And something interesting, there's way more people employed there than needs to be.
[04:27:21.877 --> 04:27:29.843]  The Japanese people are very sensitive to nuclear power ever since the bomb, obviously, from World War II.
[04:27:29.843 --> 04:27:31.364]  So they do it as a payoff?
[04:27:31.364 --> 04:27:32.245]  Yes, right.
[04:27:32.245 --> 04:27:37.850]  They try to gain favor with the communities and just add a little bias and they just give them a great wage and they basically do nothing.
[04:27:37.850 --> 04:27:38.130]  In fact,
[04:27:38.650 --> 04:27:44.596]  I even pointed out to my co-worker when I was there, I pointed at these three guys who were actually pushing an empty cart.
[04:27:44.596 --> 04:27:48.860]  There was three guys and all three of them had one hand on this empty cart as they were going across the turbine deck.
[04:27:48.860 --> 04:27:53.104]  And you can just see that there's people there that don't need to be there.
[04:27:53.866 --> 04:28:00.788]  Right now, I know that, um, I think over a hundred people have, um, high dosages of radiation.
[04:28:00.788 --> 04:28:02.089]  Yeah, that was two days ago.
[04:28:02.089 --> 04:28:03.029]  It's off the charts.
[04:28:03.029 --> 04:28:04.410]  Yeah, who really knows?
[04:28:04.410 --> 04:28:09.411]  It's like they say 10,000 have died total, but they admit 10,000 are missing from one fishing village.
[04:28:09.411 --> 04:28:10.912]  Oh, I just mean at this one plant.
[04:28:10.912 --> 04:28:11.712]  No, no, I understand.
[04:28:11.712 --> 04:28:14.633]  Yeah, they're talking about, uh, but, but now, now it's correct.
[04:28:14.633 --> 04:28:20.775]  The Mark 1 with the plutonium in it that blew up yesterday so spectacularly, that is a General Electric.
[04:28:21.135 --> 04:28:22.676]  I believe that's a GE unit.
[04:28:22.676 --> 04:28:26.379]  Now, the reactor doesn't necessarily have to match the... Let me ask you a question.
[04:28:26.379 --> 04:28:27.580]  You've been there.
[04:28:27.580 --> 04:28:30.762]  The Prime Minister's been, for a day and a half, ordering them back.
[04:28:30.762 --> 04:28:32.543]  Reportedly, the workers won't go back.
[04:28:32.543 --> 04:28:33.304]  They said there were 500.
[04:28:33.304 --> 04:28:33.944]  Now they're gone.
[04:28:33.944 --> 04:28:36.006]  I don't blame them.
[04:28:36.006 --> 04:28:37.707]  Well, I do know one of my friends... Let me ask you this.
[04:28:37.707 --> 04:28:42.811]  Watching all these giant explosions and what you see happening there, what do you think it looks like on the ground?
[04:28:43.371 --> 04:28:44.592]  Oh my gosh.
[04:28:44.592 --> 04:28:50.296]  You know, those walls, those outer shell walls, and they are absolutely enormous.
[04:28:50.296 --> 04:29:02.123]  That stuff is thick, and they are designed, and I've actually worked, I worked at a plant, Turkey Point Nuclear in Florida, where they actually had to cut a hole in it to bring the reactor out with a giant crane, and you can see how thick that wall is.
[04:29:02.123 --> 04:29:05.866]  It's designed to be hit with an airplane.
[04:29:05.866 --> 04:29:06.306]  747.
[04:29:06.306 --> 04:29:10.169]  Yeah, and now I don't know if Japan's is that way, I would assume so.
[04:29:11.002 --> 04:29:12.483]  Especially being coastal like that.
[04:29:12.483 --> 04:29:20.506]  Actually, just a few weeks before I was there, North Korea had lobbed a missile over Japan and it splashed off the coast.
[04:29:20.506 --> 04:29:23.727]  And within minutes, the Japanese carrier was out there immediately.
[04:29:23.727 --> 04:29:25.708]  It was visible from the shore.
[04:29:25.708 --> 04:29:32.010]  What other intel can you give us about the Fukushima plant?
[04:29:35.017 --> 04:29:36.238]  Well, it's huge.
[04:29:36.238 --> 04:29:39.902]  I do know that a lot of the people who need to be there can't be there.
[04:29:39.902 --> 04:29:44.467]  One of my friends I'm conversing with over the internet, he's actually in Yokohama.
[04:29:44.467 --> 04:29:46.068]  He's an engineer there.
[04:29:46.068 --> 04:29:48.651]  I worked with him.
[04:29:48.651 --> 04:29:52.935]  He can't even get on site because all of the railroads are down.
[04:29:54.195 --> 04:29:55.136]  They're all just shut down.
[04:29:55.136 --> 04:29:56.376]  The infrastructure's messed up.
[04:29:56.376 --> 04:29:57.777]  He can obviously get online.
[04:29:57.777 --> 04:29:58.797]  He's in Yokohama.
[04:29:58.797 --> 04:30:00.358]  He can't get into the office.
[04:30:00.358 --> 04:30:03.660]  So there's a massive earthquake still ongoing aftershocks.
[04:30:03.660 --> 04:30:03.980]  9.1.
[04:30:03.980 --> 04:30:06.742]  A lot of the rail line's down.
[04:30:06.742 --> 04:30:08.663]  And how many people are in Tokyo?
[04:30:08.663 --> 04:30:08.963]  9 million?
[04:30:10.743 --> 04:30:11.704]  Oh, I was in Tokyo.
[04:30:11.704 --> 04:30:13.546]  I don't remember that statistic.
[04:30:13.546 --> 04:30:15.128]  In fact, you guys found the statistics.
[04:30:15.128 --> 04:30:18.291]  It's over 500 above-ground tests that have gone on.
[04:30:18.291 --> 04:30:20.474]  Let's pull up the population of Tokyo.
[04:30:20.474 --> 04:30:26.140]  Can you imagine if even a fraction of them try to flee south as is now being reported by AP and others?
[04:30:26.140 --> 04:30:30.465]  Can you imagine what that is going to look like with the infrastructure already in shambles?
[04:30:30.905 --> 04:30:38.249]  Right, I can imagine Chicago trying to do such a thing, and having difficulty here in the States, and that country is so tightly compacted.
[04:30:38.249 --> 04:30:41.171]  The roads are not as wide as ours, you know, the cars are smaller.
[04:30:41.171 --> 04:30:58.360]  I know that Japan, under treaty, is not allowed to have nuclear weaponry, and it would surprise me, and as I talked to their engineers, in fact, my escort there, he actually had met the Queen of England, you know, so he was a pretty important person.
[04:30:59.171 --> 04:31:06.655]  And, uh, you know, in talking to him, they were so proud of these plants, and I thought, you know, this is amazing that you would put... So there's six units out there.
[04:31:06.655 --> 04:31:09.176]  They're actually building two more, currently.
[04:31:09.176 --> 04:31:11.017]  And, uh, you know, they don't see an end to this.
[04:31:11.017 --> 04:31:17.040]  It's almost like, since they're restricted from making weaponry, they're kind of showing off with their, you know, nuclear capabilities.
[04:31:17.040 --> 04:31:21.202]  I just wouldn't build... Obviously, there's... They shouldn't be doing this.
[04:31:21.202 --> 04:31:22.683]  One reactor after another is, like, a...
[04:31:23.502 --> 04:31:26.463]  You know, just a chain reaction domino effect blowing up.
[04:31:26.463 --> 04:31:37.589]  You know, my point about those walls being so thick, if those bricks are being blown everywhere like that, you know, like what we saw in that video, I mean, I can just imagine the damage that's doing to everything all around there.
[04:31:37.589 --> 04:31:43.372]  Well, think about it, shooting thousands of feet in the air in a matter of seconds, the explosive power was incredible.
[04:31:43.812 --> 04:31:51.653]  Of course it was going to expose the containment corps, which they now admit has happened at two, perhaps at four.
[04:31:51.653 --> 04:31:53.754]  We have the numbers to give people an idea.
[04:31:53.754 --> 04:32:01.975]  There are 37 plus million people in Tokyo Metro, 8.5 in the city limits.
[04:32:01.975 --> 04:32:12.557]  Can you imagine if even 10% of 37 million try to get out of the city and reportedly it is just bedlam?
[04:32:12.557 --> 04:32:12.737]  Yeah.
[04:32:13.669 --> 04:32:16.751]  Oh, it'll be wild.
[04:32:16.751 --> 04:32:19.172]  In fact, I haven't talked to my engineer friend in two days.
[04:32:19.172 --> 04:32:22.093]  He hasn't responded, so I think he might actually be on the move.
[04:32:22.093 --> 04:32:25.175]  I know a lot of different airlines are refusing to fly into Tokyo right now.
[04:32:26.409 --> 04:32:27.490]  There's another interesting thing.
[04:32:27.490 --> 04:32:31.752]  I know that the Japanese people are very tightly knit, very brave.
[04:32:31.752 --> 04:32:33.653]  I had a great time being out there.
[04:32:33.653 --> 04:32:36.375]  They took me out to dinner every night.
[04:32:36.375 --> 04:32:37.075]  Lots of drinks.
[04:32:37.075 --> 04:32:37.855]  I had a good time.
[04:32:37.855 --> 04:32:39.276]  The culture is just really cool.
[04:32:39.276 --> 04:32:46.640]  I had an awesome time and I stayed up in that northeastern area and the people were so good and everybody's got their own home garden.
[04:32:46.640 --> 04:32:49.142]  They're just very independent style people.
[04:32:49.142 --> 04:32:49.962]  Don't own weapons.
[04:32:49.962 --> 04:32:50.983]  They can't, you know.
[04:32:50.983 --> 04:32:51.523]  Actually, I bought a
[04:32:52.423 --> 04:32:54.705]  450 year old spear I brought home from there.
[04:32:54.705 --> 04:32:55.145]  Authentic.
[04:32:55.145 --> 04:32:55.786]  That was pretty cool.
[04:32:55.786 --> 04:33:02.670]  But the Japanese military, now they all have it ingrained in their minds that their life ends at 24.
[04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:05.331]  They are ready to die for their country.
[04:33:05.331 --> 04:33:06.752]  And at any cost.
[04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:11.773]  I just think that that is somewhat permeated into the culture.
[04:33:11.773 --> 04:33:20.101]  There could be a brevity, you know, a braveness in the people to want to get in there and do their work at the Fukushima plant and get this under control.
[04:33:20.101 --> 04:33:24.926]  I know that the plant is... But how do you do that when there's giant explosions going off everywhere?
[04:33:24.926 --> 04:33:25.827]  Well, yeah, I mean...
[04:33:27.413 --> 04:33:42.166]  You know what, I put myself in that position, and I think about America, and if I was working at the plant and it was like, look, this thing could blow and we could lose, you know, the whole, half the continent, you know, I would put on that suit and go in there and do what I could do, and knowing that I would die.
[04:33:42.166 --> 04:33:45.189]  Why do you think the Prime Minister is trying to, quote, order him back in?
[04:33:49.008 --> 04:33:50.510]  Well, I guess I don't know about that.
[04:34:06.969 --> 04:34:14.572]  That from what I get, it's the Tokyo Power and Electric isn't coordinating things, is what the Prime Minister says, and so things are just exploding.
[04:34:14.572 --> 04:34:17.253]  I mean, that explosion of Reactor 3 yesterday?
[04:34:17.253 --> 04:34:20.855]  I mean, the whole facility had stuff flying all over it.
[04:34:20.855 --> 04:34:23.036]  Yeah, it was felt 25 miles away in the ground.
[04:34:23.036 --> 04:34:24.536]  Yeah, so I mean, what do you expect?
[04:34:24.536 --> 04:34:26.417]  It sounds like there's really nothing they even can do.
[04:34:26.417 --> 04:34:29.498]  That's why they're trying to use helicopters to go in over it right now.
[04:34:29.498 --> 04:34:32.720]  Well, sir, really informative phone call.
[04:34:32.720 --> 04:34:34.600]  Anything else you can add for us, Salem?
[04:34:38.064 --> 04:34:39.705]  No, I just, we just do need to pray.
[04:34:39.705 --> 04:34:43.046]  I mean, we can see that human systems fail, all human systems fail.
[04:34:43.046 --> 04:34:56.392]  I mean, I do believe, you know, God is sovereign, he's in control, and we just pray that all these people's lives individually get touched and they can, you know, connect to the true meaning of life through it all and not be so dependent, no matter, you know, Japan, one of the most complex
[04:34:57.312 --> 04:35:00.775]  Um, countries in the world, you know, we can see it just failing.
[04:35:00.775 --> 04:35:03.337]  So, we can't put our faith in manned systems.
[04:35:03.337 --> 04:35:07.461]  And I think it's absolutely foolish to build plants of this many units.
[04:35:07.461 --> 04:35:10.463]  And I hope that this kind of thing doesn't go on.
[04:35:10.463 --> 04:35:13.886]  Maybe they should start shutting down many of these multiple reactor units.
[04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:17.691]  But, um, hey Alex, I know you're an artist.
[04:35:17.691 --> 04:35:21.193]  I'm actually a professional sculptor full-time, and I know you do oil paintings.
[04:35:21.193 --> 04:35:24.654]  Do you have any sculptural ideas I could incorporate?
[04:35:24.654 --> 04:35:25.914]  I never really have time to paint.
[04:35:25.914 --> 04:35:27.055]  I paint with my kids all the time.
[04:35:27.055 --> 04:35:30.876]  You know, just little things, but I don't know, man.
[04:35:30.876 --> 04:35:31.837]  I'm sure you're a great artist.
[04:35:31.837 --> 04:35:34.858]  You've got your own ideas, but I appreciate your call, Salem.
[04:35:34.858 --> 04:35:37.079]  Very interesting.
[04:35:37.079 --> 04:35:40.220]  A lady called in who sounded very earnest, very focused, very informed.
[04:35:40.220 --> 04:35:43.802]  We confirmed it is the phone number for the Montgomery, Alabama Federal
[04:35:45.062 --> 04:35:49.246]  Sub-agency that tests the air for and water for radiation.
[04:35:49.246 --> 04:36:00.455]  We're going to call them live on air right now because she said that they told her that yes, they are deploying emergency nuclear fallout personnel to the West Coast right now as a precaution.
[04:36:00.455 --> 04:36:03.518]  That's important news because you're not seeing that in the media.
[04:36:03.518 --> 04:36:06.480]  The federal government's not even really debating it or discussing it.
[04:36:06.480 --> 04:36:07.761]  You know, is it a problem?
[04:36:07.761 --> 04:36:10.664]  Guys, can we go ahead and start dialing that number live on air right now, please?
[04:36:12.867 --> 04:36:14.788]  You can let them hear the dialing, it's fine.
[04:36:14.788 --> 04:36:16.850]  Here we go.
[04:36:16.850 --> 04:36:24.616]  We are calling them live on air.
[04:36:24.616 --> 04:36:31.721]  The man got in word.
[04:36:31.721 --> 04:36:38.566]  You have reached the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory in Montgomery, Alabama.
[04:36:39.306 --> 04:36:44.627]  If you know the four-digit extension of the person you are calling, you may dial it at any time.
[04:36:44.627 --> 04:36:49.848]  If you know the name of the person you are trying to reach, press 1 for dial by name.
[04:36:49.848 --> 04:36:58.610]  If you are calling concerning pollution or permitting within the state of Alabama, please call the Alabama Department of Environmental Management at 334- Hit 0 for operator.
[04:36:58.610 --> 04:36:58.630]  7700.
[04:36:58.630 --> 04:37:00.311]  If you require other information, press 2.
[04:37:00.311 --> 04:37:00.411]  Oh, 2.
[04:37:09.187 --> 04:37:13.110]  If you are calling to report a radiation emergency, press 1.
[04:37:13.110 --> 04:37:19.135]  If you require assistance with an administrative issue such as procurement or personnel, press 2.
[04:37:19.135 --> 04:37:25.319]  If you are calling regarding the Radon Proficiency Program or need other radon information, press 3.
[04:37:25.319 --> 04:37:30.683]  For information pertaining to EPA publications or related topics, press 4.
[04:37:30.683 --> 04:37:32.965]  For further assistance, press 0.
[04:37:32.965 --> 04:37:34.006]  Press 0, like I said.
[04:37:37.928 --> 04:37:41.850]  Thank you.
[04:37:41.850 --> 04:37:43.611]  Alright folks, we're going to see what happens here.
[04:37:43.611 --> 04:37:45.152]  You're listening to live, continual coverage.
[04:37:49.742 --> 04:37:51.584]  Hi ma'am, my name is Alex Jones.
[04:37:51.584 --> 04:38:00.731]  I'm doing a syndicated radio broadcast and I've had callers calling in telling me that they, one particular lady who called you just about an hour ago, your office.
[04:38:00.731 --> 04:38:02.493]  Who was that?
[04:38:02.493 --> 04:38:07.137]  It was one of my listeners, so we were just confirming what she said, that she had talked to some folks in your office.
[04:38:07.857 --> 04:38:15.741]  specifically about response to any fallout coming from Japan on the west coast that you were one of the main offices that test that.
[04:38:15.741 --> 04:38:25.105]  Can I be put in contact with the specific sub office, the air and water radiation measurement office there?
[04:38:25.105 --> 04:38:28.026]  Alex, you're a syndicated radio show?
[04:38:28.026 --> 04:38:28.866]  Yes ma'am.
[04:38:28.866 --> 04:38:35.369]  What is your, what is your, your radio, what is it, what station is it?
[04:38:36.444 --> 04:38:37.785]  It's all over the country.
[04:38:37.785 --> 04:38:40.787]  It's on stations like 590 here in Austin.
[04:38:40.787 --> 04:38:42.628]  The website's InfoWars.com.
[04:38:42.628 --> 04:38:45.590]  And again, ma'am, we're broadcasting live right now.
[04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:54.835]  We're getting scores of calls from people who've called different federal agencies, state agencies, that there is a response on the West Coast to measure and prepare for fallout.
[04:38:54.835 --> 04:39:03.180]  And I need to talk to somebody because ferreting through numbers, I'm told that this Montgomery, Alabama office has the sample sent to it nationwide.
[04:39:03.180 --> 04:39:03.941]  Is that correct?
[04:39:04.611 --> 04:39:11.021]  I do not have the answers for you because I am just a front desk person.
[04:39:11.021 --> 04:39:15.628]  Can I talk to the press person or can I talk to the laboratory that does the testing?
[04:39:15.628 --> 04:39:19.413]  The press person, I will be glad to give you her name.
[04:39:27.524 --> 04:39:29.165]  I can't put you through to anybody, sir.
[04:39:29.165 --> 04:39:30.427]  You'll have to call her direct.
[04:39:30.427 --> 04:39:32.149]  She's in Washington.
[04:39:32.149 --> 04:39:33.430]  Her number is... Hold on, ma'am.
[04:39:33.430 --> 04:39:34.471]  Don't give the number out.
[04:39:34.471 --> 04:39:35.612]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[04:39:35.612 --> 04:39:38.495]  Can we get that number from you, please?
[04:39:38.495 --> 04:39:39.797]  Yes.
[04:39:39.797 --> 04:39:42.119]  I'll go ahead and give you her number.
[04:39:42.119 --> 04:39:44.642]  Okay, I'm told they already got that number.
[04:39:44.642 --> 04:39:46.564]  We have that number to DC.
[04:39:46.564 --> 04:39:47.445]  And that's Andy Adora.
[04:39:47.445 --> 04:39:48.005]  We'll call her.
[04:39:48.005 --> 04:39:48.566]  Thank you for the help.
[04:39:50.396 --> 04:39:51.837]  All right, thank you.
[04:39:51.837 --> 04:39:53.858]  Let's go ahead and dial that next number.
[04:39:53.858 --> 04:39:59.781]  And I'll obviously do this once we go off air too and ferret this out because this is important breaking news.
[04:39:59.781 --> 04:40:01.802]  And we need, this is what the media should be doing.
[04:40:01.802 --> 04:40:06.665]  This is what ABC, CBS, NBC, all of them should be doing.
[04:40:06.665 --> 04:40:08.546]  The citizens shouldn't have to be doing it.
[04:40:08.546 --> 04:40:09.966]  I should be doing it.
[04:40:09.966 --> 04:40:12.348]  The callers, you're blind to things.
[04:40:12.348 --> 04:40:14.589]  The callers point out this is something that should be done.
[04:40:14.589 --> 04:40:16.330]  So we're doing it now here live on air.
[04:40:17.782 --> 04:40:22.445]  So we'll die the, uh, when I'm on air four and a half hours, I start babbling.
[04:40:22.445 --> 04:40:23.645]  Got to refocus here.
[04:40:23.645 --> 04:40:32.690]  We will call the DC number for Andy Adora, the press secretary individual, uh, for this outfit.
[04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:39.954]  Uh, but it sounds like the lady we talked to earlier was able to get around to some of the people actually working there with the samples that said, yes, they are moving to the West Coast to respond.
[04:40:56.115 --> 04:41:03.100]  Hi, this is Adora Andy, Deputy Assistant Administrator for EPA's Office of External Affairs and Environmental Education.
[04:41:03.100 --> 04:41:08.024]  Please leave a message now or email me at andy.adora.epa.gov.
[04:41:08.024 --> 04:41:13.528]  That's andy, A-N-D-Y, adora, A-D-O-R-A, at epa.gov.
[04:41:13.528 --> 04:41:24.677]  If you need immediate assistance, please hang up and dial 202-564... Okay, are we blocking that number out or am I allowed to leave a message?
[04:41:28.183 --> 04:41:29.104]  Yeah, I want to leave a message.
[04:41:29.104 --> 04:41:32.986]  I never heard it beep because the audio just cut out.
[04:41:32.986 --> 04:41:37.508]  Are we leaving a message now?
[04:41:37.508 --> 04:41:38.749]  It's okay to give these numbers out.
[04:41:38.749 --> 04:41:40.870]  These are public numbers.
[04:41:40.870 --> 04:41:44.992]  I know earlier I didn't want to give that particular number out because I hadn't called it yet, but this stuff's all on the web.
[04:41:52.116 --> 04:42:11.450]  What I know is that we cannot trust the US government, the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN, the Japanese government, the Chinese government, the Transylvanian government, the South African government, the Israeli government, the German government, the Canadian government, the Mexican government, the Chilean government, the Brazilian government,
[04:42:12.210 --> 04:42:16.812]  The Timbuktu government, the Egyptian government, to tell you the truth on anything.
[04:42:16.812 --> 04:42:19.853]  They're a pack of liars and bureaucracies.
[04:42:19.853 --> 04:42:29.738]  And we need to know if the government thinks it's a serious threat that they're moving emergency personnel to the east coast, to the west coast, from the east.
[04:42:29.738 --> 04:42:33.860]  We've gotten caller after caller confirming they've got family who's in the military.
[04:42:34.844 --> 04:42:42.720]  Who has told them that they are preparing for disasters, they are preparing for radiation fallout on the West Coast.
[04:42:42.720 --> 04:42:44.363]  That is important information.
[04:42:45.558 --> 04:42:49.401]  We know this thing's been covered up from the start and only gets worse and worse by the minute.
[04:42:49.401 --> 04:42:55.865]  The things I was putting out in article Saturday and being laughed at for, and Friday, is now confirmed.
[04:42:55.865 --> 04:42:59.327]  Now I'm telling you this could go from bad to worse.
[04:42:59.327 --> 04:43:09.594]  And the problem is, as I put out in that video last night that's on YouTube and InfoWars and Prison Planet, that we don't know the truth about what's happening in Japan.
[04:43:09.594 --> 04:43:13.176]  Now more and more we're learning that our worst suspicions have come true.
[04:43:16.366 --> 04:43:33.758]  If one or more of those reactors continue to ignite and continue to vent uranium, plutonium, strontium, cesium, radioactive iodine into the air, it is just totally devastating what's going to happen in Japan.
[04:43:33.758 --> 04:43:36.880]  You're going to see people die of radiation poisoning.
[04:43:36.880 --> 04:43:38.181]  The globalists like soft kill.
[04:43:38.181 --> 04:43:39.642]  They like things that kill you in 10 years, 20 years.
[04:43:41.141 --> 04:43:41.301]  I think?
[04:44:04.141 --> 04:44:13.285]  The radiation levels are rising in Japan, and no one really knows what's going on at that plant facility.
[04:44:13.285 --> 04:44:19.809]  But we're going to be here, on the news websites and live on air, covering all of this continually.
[04:44:19.809 --> 04:44:25.451]  We are going to be here covering this, and if things continue to deteriorate, I may be on 9 o'clock tonight.
[04:44:28.341 --> 04:44:28.641]  6 a.m.
[04:44:28.641 --> 04:44:29.542]  in the morning.
[04:44:29.542 --> 04:44:38.548]  Whatever we have to do to really look at every angle of this, and that's why Talk Radio is so good for this, is that we can spend a lot of time looking at every facet.
[04:44:38.548 --> 04:44:41.511]  Debating, discussing, putting our heads together.
[04:44:41.511 --> 04:44:43.372]  I correct callers, callers correct me.
[04:44:43.372 --> 04:44:44.653]  We help each other.
[04:44:44.653 --> 04:44:46.734]  We bring each other the information.
[04:44:46.734 --> 04:44:49.936]  By the way, I know I put it out in the last hour.
[04:44:49.936 --> 04:44:53.239]  Can you guys print me some of the Twitter questions, specifically?
[04:44:53.239 --> 04:44:54.580]  Or I bet you've already brought those in to me.
[04:44:55.439 --> 04:45:07.121]  Stuff stacks up so quick I gave out the the twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones earlier And I promised to answer some of your questions, so we'll go through some of those in a moment Who's up first here in this list of callers?
[04:45:09.343 --> 04:45:10.644]  Paul in New York.
[04:45:10.644 --> 04:45:12.326]  Before we go to Paul, I want to say this.
[04:45:12.326 --> 04:45:23.096]  Everybody, especially media outlets, who I know are listening, contact the government and force them to give a statement about what they're doing, about preparations for fallout, because we're getting the intel that that's happening.
[04:45:23.096 --> 04:45:25.658]  We need to confirm this right now, okay?
[04:45:25.658 --> 04:45:31.084]  You know, we sit here for hour after hour covering this, and in a way, you kind of get punch drunk to all of it.
[04:45:34.864 --> 04:45:37.325]  My children are in the fallout path of the jet stream.
[04:45:37.325 --> 04:45:38.386]  Yours are.
[04:45:38.386 --> 04:45:44.048]  Your mother, your daughter, your sons, your grandmother, your children.
[04:45:44.048 --> 04:45:46.549]  I am upset about this and I know you are.
[04:45:46.549 --> 04:45:49.750]  Yesterday I blew up a lot on air because it was still cover-ups going on.
[04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:53.532]  You notice I'm pretty calm now because the cover-up is unraveled.
[04:45:53.532 --> 04:45:57.634]  At least we have some preparation and can see it coming.
[04:45:58.374 --> 04:46:05.206]  Even though it's invisible, if government and industry and private groups do what they have to, to test.
[04:46:05.206 --> 04:46:06.628]  I mean, there should be aircraft.
[04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:07.991]  In fact, I gotta write articles about this.
[04:46:07.991 --> 04:46:09.173]  I should do a YouTube video.
[04:46:09.173 --> 04:46:09.714]  There should be U.S.
[04:46:11.434 --> 04:46:12.816]  Naval aircraft, U.S.
[04:46:12.816 --> 04:46:14.077]  Air Force aircraft, U.S.
[04:46:14.077 --> 04:46:20.063]  Army aircraft, all over that area of the Pacific with radiation meters, reporting back to the public.
[04:46:20.063 --> 04:46:24.508]  Now, I'll guarantee you they're up there right now, and they know exactly what's coming this way.
[04:46:24.508 --> 04:46:25.569]  They know what isotopes.
[04:46:25.569 --> 04:46:29.133]  They've got the devices that pick it all up with precision.
[04:46:29.133 --> 04:46:32.377]  Now, you notice we're four days into this, and you're not heard anything about that.
[04:46:33.490 --> 04:46:41.674]  You just know that yesterday morning when Fukushima 3 blew up, that plutonium-powered plant, they, the main fleet, hightailed it out of there.
[04:46:41.674 --> 04:46:44.836]  It started running south as fast as they could.
[04:46:44.836 --> 04:46:53.180]  That's not a good indicator, is it?
[04:46:53.180 --> 04:46:55.581]  Paul in New York, you're on the air.
[04:46:55.581 --> 04:46:56.602]  Hey, can you hear me?
[04:46:56.602 --> 04:46:57.922]  Yes, I can.
[04:46:57.922 --> 04:47:03.065]  Hey, Alex, thanks for, you did a great job covering all of this and I really appreciate it.
[04:47:03.433 --> 04:47:14.982]  I just wanted to bring up a quick point that I think is getting lost in this story, is that the Saudi Arabian Army is now all in Bahrain, and they're killing protesters... Sir, are you on speakerphone?
[04:47:16.145 --> 04:47:16.886]  No, I'm not.
[04:47:16.886 --> 04:47:18.087]  I'm on the telephone.
[04:47:18.087 --> 04:47:18.847]  Can you hear me okay?
[04:47:18.847 --> 04:47:20.588]  I can hear you better.
[04:47:20.588 --> 04:47:28.454]  Getting lost in this is that the Saudi Arabians have rolled into Bahrain with a bunch of troops and tanks and everything's getting wild, yes.
[04:47:28.454 --> 04:47:34.018]  They're shooting protesters and if you go on Al Jazeera and you look at the video on there,
[04:47:34.884 --> 04:47:38.289]  Titled, Bahrain Imposes State of Emergency.
[04:47:38.289 --> 04:47:41.314]  I think it's, uh, pretty compelling that you're using her-ass.
[04:47:41.314 --> 04:47:41.895]  Well, that's the thing.
[04:47:41.895 --> 04:47:43.958]  They never call martial law, martial law.
[04:47:43.958 --> 04:47:47.203]  If people are ever waiting for that term to be used, they call it civil emergency.
[04:47:48.925 --> 04:47:50.646]  So, I just wanted to point that out.
[04:47:50.646 --> 04:47:58.472]  If people want to go on Al Jazeera and look at Bahrain Imposes State of Emergency and see for themselves what's going on there.
[04:47:58.472 --> 04:47:58.972]  Thank you, sir.
[04:47:58.972 --> 04:48:00.833]  We'll get that up on screen for folks right now.
[04:48:00.833 --> 04:48:03.555]  Al Jazeera, Bahrain Imposes State of Emergency.
[04:48:03.555 --> 04:48:05.617]  I've actually got reports here saying that.
[04:48:05.617 --> 04:48:10.440]  I haven't seen the video of them shooting people, but that's par for the course in these third world countries and now here in America.
[04:48:10.440 --> 04:48:11.301]  Pete in Michigan.
[04:48:11.301 --> 04:48:12.021]  You're on the air.
[04:48:12.021 --> 04:48:13.542]  Welcome.
[04:48:13.542 --> 04:48:14.063]  Hi, Alex.
[04:48:14.063 --> 04:48:15.003]  Can you hear me okay?
[04:48:15.003 --> 04:48:15.364]  Yes, I can.
[04:48:16.405 --> 04:48:17.326]  Okay.
[04:48:17.326 --> 04:48:20.869]  I just wanted to ask you kind of a bit of a question.
[04:48:20.869 --> 04:48:28.435]  A couple months ago or a month ago, you were talking about how the elites were moving down to South America around Chile and Argentina and all that.
[04:48:28.435 --> 04:48:38.624]  And it's been kind of the talk that they were possibly going to try a nuclear attack in America to kill a bunch of people and then impose martial law.
[04:48:38.624 --> 04:48:43.088]  What do you think about the possibility that maybe they caused the earthquake
[04:48:44.117 --> 04:48:54.285]  Which made this nuclear disaster in Japan with the Tesla weapons they have and maybe that's why they, you know, they knew they were going to do that ahead of time.
[04:48:54.285 --> 04:48:55.866]  That's why they're down.
[04:48:55.866 --> 04:48:58.669]  I'm not saying you're bad for asking that question but...
[04:49:00.159 --> 04:49:00.419]  I don't
[04:49:16.084 --> 04:49:20.046]  And yes, that's a real situation, but we also had a huge solar flare hit the Earth.
[04:49:20.046 --> 04:49:27.749]  The top astrophysicists say it manipulates the magnetic field, the tectonic plates, along with the Moon being the closest to the Earth it had been in 18 years.
[04:49:27.749 --> 04:49:33.312]  And a lot of top scientists predicted massive earthquakes, especially around Japan, because of this.
[04:49:33.312 --> 04:49:36.753]  So I think my gut leans more towards it not being HAARP.
[04:49:36.753 --> 04:49:38.334]  Folks love to blame everything on the government.
[04:49:38.334 --> 04:49:43.076]  I certainly, certainly am happy to, when they're involved in it.
[04:49:43.076 --> 04:49:44.297]  And they may be.
[04:49:45.117 --> 04:49:47.778]  But the globalists are mainly moving out of the U.S.
[04:49:47.778 --> 04:49:52.199]  and the West because they've so robbed it blind, they're worried about getting arrested.
[04:49:52.199 --> 04:49:53.180]  I appreciate your call.
[04:49:53.180 --> 04:49:53.660]  Good points.
[04:49:53.660 --> 04:49:56.541]  Who's up next here?
[04:49:56.541 --> 04:49:57.361]  Richard in Vermont.
[04:49:57.361 --> 04:50:00.122]  You're on the air worldwide.
[04:50:00.122 --> 04:50:01.082]  Hi, Alex.
[04:50:01.082 --> 04:50:02.203]  Yeah, I spoke with you yesterday.
[04:50:02.203 --> 04:50:04.103]  I'm the guy that built the submarines there for 13 years.
[04:50:04.103 --> 04:50:04.444]  Yes.
[04:50:04.444 --> 04:50:10.306]  And I was telling you about the Mark 1, Mark 2, Mark 3.
[04:50:10.306 --> 04:50:14.027]  Okay, that was, you were wondering, and I was wondering,
[04:50:15.154 --> 04:50:19.397]  What we saw fall out of that cloud of smoke from number three.
[04:50:19.397 --> 04:50:39.070]  On the article that you guys have posted and I've seen it all over the internet today by Kirk James Murphy regarding the Chernobyl on steroids, there is one paragraph in there which gives a pretty good indication of what's going on here and I checked the schematic diagrams of the Mark 1
[04:50:40.129 --> 04:50:52.219]  Uh, reactors, and these particular reactors, not the two and three, but these particular ones, have got their spent fuel rods sitting on top of the containment vessel.
[04:50:52.219 --> 04:50:53.340]  No, I saw that in the news!
[04:50:53.340 --> 04:51:02.848]  They admitted that the spent fuel rods are sitting inside of the containment deal, and that's what it looked like to me, shooting up in the sky.
[04:51:02.848 --> 04:51:05.150]  On top of the containment vessel.
[04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:08.193]  In other words, when that explosion went, there was enough
[04:51:09.096 --> 04:51:15.840]  There was enough pressure underneath the bottom of that to shoot that containment vessel with those spent rods in it.
[04:51:15.840 --> 04:51:22.724]  It says right here, I've got the... Give me the headline on that because I did see that in a whole bunch of articles.
[04:51:22.724 --> 04:51:31.430]  It just, side note, mentioned that in several of the reactors sitting inside on top of the containment vessel are the spent fuel rods and that was the fire.
[04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.730]  I don't
[04:51:56.449 --> 04:51:57.910]  Man!
[04:51:57.910 --> 04:52:03.131]  Fuel rod fire at Fukushima reactor would be like Chernobyl on steroids.
[04:52:03.131 --> 04:52:04.692]  Let me write it.
[04:52:04.692 --> 04:52:15.095]  Fuel rod fire at Fukushima reactor would be like Chernobyl on steroids.
[04:52:15.095 --> 04:52:21.557]  And it was written by Kirk James Murphy, who is an MD.
[04:52:21.557 --> 04:52:22.857]  He's a doctor.
[04:52:22.857 --> 04:52:24.118]  And what do we repost that from?
[04:52:24.118 --> 04:52:24.978]  What's the original source?
[04:52:27.013 --> 04:52:41.051]  Uh, it's on your front page of InfoWars.com, and it is one of the highlighted articles down there that, if you click on it, was, uh, the original source was FTL, whatever that is.
[04:52:42.370 --> 04:52:43.351]  Alright, I see it.
[04:52:43.351 --> 04:52:44.672]  I'm going to get Watson on this.
[04:52:44.672 --> 04:52:45.713]  This is hidden in plain view.
[04:52:45.713 --> 04:52:49.877]  We're more than 24 hours out of Fukushima 3 blowing.
[04:52:49.877 --> 04:53:04.690]  So that Mark 1 was, because I saw that, absolutely, spent fuel rods sitting on, which are highly radioactive, sitting on top of the containment vessel, and that's what it looked like was rod casings shooting up into the sky.
[04:53:04.690 --> 04:53:07.212]  Those are plutonium that's mixed in there.
[04:53:08.190 --> 04:53:12.054]  Inside of that, inside those spent rods are plutonium rods.
[04:53:12.054 --> 04:53:15.397]  Those things fall into the water or anywhere on the ground around there.
[04:53:16.778 --> 04:53:23.743]  Absolute shit is going to hit the fan because those things are going to get into the water and like we were talking yesterday, a particle of dust.
[04:53:23.743 --> 04:53:29.127]  Like if you were dusting your furniture, you see all these little, you have a little ray of sunlight shining through it.
[04:53:29.127 --> 04:53:30.308]  Sir, incredible info.
[04:53:30.308 --> 04:53:33.130]  Guys, get me Watson on air right now, please.
[04:53:33.130 --> 04:53:34.271]  Please, I'll call him.
[04:53:34.271 --> 04:53:36.793]  I want him, call him on his cell phone.
[04:53:36.793 --> 04:53:37.854]  It's the only thing that ever answers.
[04:53:37.854 --> 04:53:39.015]  I want him on air right now.
[04:53:39.015 --> 04:53:40.536]  This is an emergency situation.
[04:53:42.130 --> 04:53:46.952]  Yeah, because he won't answer his homes, I'm telling you.
[04:53:46.952 --> 04:53:47.853]  Richard, this is huge.
[04:53:47.853 --> 04:53:49.353]  You know why this is huge?
[04:53:49.353 --> 04:54:05.461]  Because I read that in AP, in article after article this morning, oh, there was a fire at two and a thing at four, and yeah, and I read plant after plant, multiple ones, they're storing the spent fuel rods inside of the,
[04:54:08.721 --> 04:54:09.222]  I think?
[04:54:27.683 --> 04:54:33.726]  Oh my gosh, because they're all saying, don't worry, it's safe, it's inside.
[04:54:33.726 --> 04:54:38.009]  They know full well with the design that it blew them sky high.
[04:54:38.009 --> 04:54:39.590]  Oh my gosh.
[04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:41.791]  That's why we've been on air for almost five hours.
[04:54:41.791 --> 04:54:44.432]  We're putting our heads together hidden in plain view.
[04:54:44.432 --> 04:54:44.893]  Whoa.
[04:54:46.267 --> 04:54:48.890]  Whoa, man, that means fallout.
[04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:50.591]  Oh, man.
[04:54:50.591 --> 04:54:51.252]  Oh, my gosh.
[04:54:51.252 --> 04:54:51.992]  Can you imagine?
[04:54:51.992 --> 04:54:55.095]  Those things, when they get hot, are basically like graphite.
[04:54:55.095 --> 04:54:59.099]  They fall apart easily, especially spent rods that have already been in heat.
[04:54:59.099 --> 04:55:01.922]  How much of that would be aerosolized?
[04:55:01.922 --> 04:55:06.005]  How much of that would be aerosolized, Richard?
[04:55:06.005 --> 04:55:06.506]  Richard's gone.
[04:55:06.506 --> 04:55:07.507]  We got Paul.
[04:55:07.507 --> 04:55:08.508]  Paul Watson, are you there?
[04:55:11.693 --> 04:55:13.854]  Okay, I'm actually staggered right now, Paul.
[04:55:13.854 --> 04:55:17.336]  This is an emergency situation.
[04:55:17.336 --> 04:55:20.098]  I know you've already written three articles today, busting your butt.
[04:55:20.098 --> 04:55:21.739]  You're six hours ahead of us.
[04:55:21.739 --> 04:55:24.020]  You are my number one guy to get this right.
[04:55:24.020 --> 04:55:26.241]  I want you to take notes right now.
[04:55:26.241 --> 04:55:29.383]  This is an emergency situation.
[04:55:29.383 --> 04:55:36.888]  Now, I have literally, this morning, probably read 50 or more articles in entirety.
[04:55:36.888 --> 04:55:38.949]  I'm just putting some background here so people know where I'm coming from.
[04:55:40.316 --> 04:55:42.456]  I am exhausted.
[04:55:42.456 --> 04:55:45.977]  So, you're gonna have to dig this out.
[04:55:45.977 --> 04:55:48.358]  But it's everywhere.
[04:55:48.358 --> 04:55:54.179]  But I know I've read it in no fewer than 10 or 12 articles, and put the one on screen that has the links to the mainstream news.
[04:55:54.179 --> 04:55:56.199]  I'm gonna give this to Watson as a source right now.
[04:55:56.199 --> 04:55:57.699]  Listen to me carefully.
[04:55:57.699 --> 04:56:04.260]  Fuel rod at Fukushima reactor would be like Chernobyl on steroids by FDL, Kirk, James, Murphy, and MD.
[04:56:04.260 --> 04:56:05.341]  Now listen.
[04:56:05.341 --> 04:56:06.981]  This is what's key, my friend.
[04:56:09.073 --> 04:56:10.114]  This is what's key.
[04:56:10.114 --> 04:56:13.957]  I have read it in article after article, and we just had the guy that worked on nuclear submarines.
[04:56:13.957 --> 04:56:25.145]  He looked up the schematics of a Mark 1 General Electric box reactor that's 7% plutonium, 93% uranium driven.
[04:56:25.145 --> 04:56:30.609]  And I read this in article after article after article, and it's in that article, but you've got to search the term.
[04:56:32.125 --> 04:56:34.547]  Spent fuel rods, fire.
[04:56:34.547 --> 04:56:36.608]  Spent fuel rods, fire.
[04:56:36.608 --> 04:56:48.496]  That will bring you up the upteen jillion, because if I saw 10 or 12 I read without looking, I just saw it in the footnotes, didn't know what I was seeing, I was like, hmm, spent fuel rods, caught on fire, but they were able to put them out.
[04:56:48.496 --> 04:56:51.438]  And knowing that that would release some stuff, well guess where they store it?
[04:56:51.438 --> 04:56:54.300]  And this is in the news, hidden in plain view, no one has picked up on this.
[04:56:55.040 --> 04:56:59.422]  People are saying, oh boy, if there is a fire with these, which has now happened, it'll be Chernobyl.
[04:56:59.422 --> 04:57:01.323]  Forget that, there was an explosion.
[04:57:01.323 --> 04:57:19.713]  They store, on top of the containment vessel, inside, on top of it, inside the dome, inside the blast shield, the main overall containment dome, they store, because they're highly toxic and radioactive, the mark
[04:57:20.971 --> 04:57:24.775]  One, uranium plutonium spent rods on top of it.
[04:57:24.775 --> 04:57:35.664]  I know when he said it, bingo, because I read that in article after article after article, because at the other plant that blew up today, I think it was four, they were storing them in there too, but it's a different design.
[04:57:35.664 --> 04:57:39.748]  At the mark one, and he looked up the schematics, they are on top of it.
[04:57:39.748 --> 04:57:46.975]  So the media is saying, don't worry, okay, we have a breach at two, probably at four, but it's only little, the seals may be broken, some may get out.
[04:57:47.935 --> 04:58:01.418]  The truth is, they were storing inside the main containment dish, over the internal containment of the active reactor, the spent fuel rods of the last bunch that the Mark 1 had used.
[04:58:01.418 --> 04:58:03.058]  It's been there for 40 years.
[04:58:03.058 --> 04:58:07.719]  And looking at it, studying nuclear reactors, I know what rod casings look like.
[04:58:07.719 --> 04:58:17.501]  And I blew up the video and saw black rod casings and set it on air yesterday when it blew up at Fukushima 3, that that looks like, you know, the guts of a reactor.
[04:58:18.496 --> 04:58:19.217]  Well, of course!
[04:58:19.217 --> 04:58:24.522]  They've got all the old, pulled, spent batteries sitting there, still deadly radioactive.
[04:58:24.522 --> 04:58:32.629]  And so it was the big... It makes... It makes... It makes Chernobyl look like a joke.
[04:58:32.629 --> 04:58:35.592]  And Bob Bowman has now agreed this is as big as Chernobyl.
[04:58:35.592 --> 04:58:37.174]  This is past that.
[04:58:37.174 --> 04:58:38.915]  You understand?
[04:58:38.915 --> 04:58:40.217]  Massive cover-up, Paul.
[04:58:41.584 --> 04:58:54.715]  They were storing spent plutonium-uranium fuel inside the overall containment facility over the sealed container over the active system.
[04:58:54.715 --> 04:58:57.297]  And it's all over the news.
[04:58:57.297 --> 04:59:00.699]  But it's hidden there, no one paying attention, no one understanding it.
[04:59:00.699 --> 04:59:03.542]  Took a guy that worked on nuclear submarines to call in and connect the dots.
[04:59:06.175 --> 04:59:11.080]  And this is horrible news, Watson, but we've got to warn people.
[04:59:11.080 --> 04:59:31.179]  So the issue is, you can show that it's not just a fire, and other areas getting into these, that if indeed they were storing the fuel rods, which you can find the news from memory, again, I've read this all, but I'm telling you now, we're moving fast, look it up, find it, they were storing rods, the evidence shows, inside, not the sealed container,
[04:59:33.652 --> 04:59:55.882]  Not in the sealed area, which they're now saying several of them are breached, at least one, but not just a seal broken, ejecting in that huge mushroom cloud the last group or more of, the news is saying some of them have repeated groupings, into the air, and one particle of that, it kills somebody.
[04:59:55.882 --> 04:59:57.823]  Watson, what do you say about this information?
[05:00:01.348 --> 05:00:15.130]  There's an NPR story which basically says the same thing called spent fuel rods now a concern at nuclear plant and it has a graphic which shows them stored next to the actual reactor core.
[05:00:17.247 --> 05:00:24.530]  Yeah, but to be specific, in the Mark 1, it's not within the sealed final containment.
[05:00:24.530 --> 05:00:31.373]  They are sitting inside of the overall containment facility at Blue Sky High.
[05:00:31.373 --> 05:00:32.434]  That's what we've got to look into.
[05:00:32.434 --> 05:00:40.417]  Yes, we know that in some of the other plants, they caught on fire these spent fuel rods.
[05:00:40.417 --> 05:00:41.037]  Hold on one second.
[05:00:41.037 --> 05:00:41.838]  My wife keeps calling me.
[05:00:41.838 --> 05:00:43.078]  Hold on one second.
[05:00:43.078 --> 05:00:44.099]  Hey, honey, I'm still on air.
[05:00:44.099 --> 05:00:44.879]  I'll call you back, okay?
[05:00:46.742 --> 05:00:49.003]  This situation is terrifying.
[05:00:49.003 --> 05:00:52.003]  Okay, there it is.
[05:00:52.003 --> 05:00:53.424]  They have a map of it.
[05:00:53.424 --> 05:00:54.544]  Is that from NPR?
[05:00:54.544 --> 05:00:55.604]  And there it is.
[05:00:55.604 --> 05:00:58.705]  Spent fuel rods.
[05:00:58.705 --> 05:01:01.245]  Blow that up so I can read it, please.
[05:01:01.245 --> 05:01:01.965]  Thank you.
[05:01:01.965 --> 05:01:08.047]  Okay, it won't get any bigger than that.
[05:01:08.047 --> 05:01:10.267]  Are they saying that's the Mark 1?
[05:01:10.267 --> 05:01:12.928]  We're not talking about number 4 that got on fire today.
[05:01:14.141 --> 05:01:24.584]  They're talking about, that's number two reactor that also blew up, and they're saying that spent fuel rods, there you go, they were able to blow it up.
[05:01:24.584 --> 05:01:24.824]  Okay.
[05:01:26.365 --> 05:01:32.568]  I usually can take breaks, folks, and get my wind back for here on air, but Watson, I'm going to take a five-minute break.
[05:01:32.568 --> 05:01:33.889]  You've got the floor.
[05:01:33.889 --> 05:01:37.991]  Give people the latest you know at Prison Planet Infowars, and you talk for five, ten minutes.
[05:01:37.991 --> 05:01:41.412]  I'm going to go do some research on this and nail it down, but you've got to ferret this out.
[05:01:41.412 --> 05:01:49.016]  The Mark I was storing them inside, not the main containment vessel, but above that, what do they call the larger dome?
[05:01:50.877 --> 05:01:51.598]  Well, Elias, the
[05:02:20.485 --> 05:02:42.321]  ISIS, which is the Institute for Science and International Security, has basically said that the crisis is now closer to a Level 6 event, which is obviously more serious than Three Mile Island, and that, quote, it may unfortunately reach a Level 7.
[05:02:42.321 --> 05:02:49.186]  So now the top US-based science and international security agencies basically
[05:02:50.063 --> 05:02:59.508]  Admitting that, the two articles I wrote earlier today were about the shortage in potassium iodide.
[05:02:59.508 --> 05:03:13.334]  Basically, you've got private sellers on eBay selling a blister of potassium iodide tablets, 14 tablets in a pack, and that's it.
[05:03:13.334 --> 05:03:15.095]  Everywhere else it's sold out.
[05:03:15.095 --> 05:03:15.496]  Amazon.com
[05:03:17.851 --> 05:03:28.575]  If you try to purchase potassium iodide off Amazon.com, they're sending out an email saying that their manufacturers have completely run out of supply.
[05:03:28.575 --> 05:03:35.238]  Indeed, on Saturday, before this even really got serious, they had already run out of supply.
[05:03:35.238 --> 05:03:41.740]  And they're not going to have any supply back in stock before April at the earliest, or even May.
[05:03:43.278 --> 05:03:49.000]  I am planning to visit China in a couple of weeks, which of course is not far from Japan.
[05:03:49.000 --> 05:03:55.822]  So I tried to buy some potassium iodide just in case.
[05:03:55.822 --> 05:03:58.743]  Obviously, you only take it in an emergency.
[05:03:58.743 --> 05:04:00.644]  It's not some kind of supplement.
[05:04:00.644 --> 05:04:04.605]  It's not the liquid form, which is a lot weaker.
[05:04:04.605 --> 05:04:07.426]  You only take this in times of emergency.
[05:04:07.426 --> 05:04:11.407]  So I tried to buy some just for preparedness.
[05:04:12.613 --> 05:04:36.197]  Purchased it off eBay and then lo and behold I got an email about three hours later Saying that they will not have any back in stock until the end of April or even May so Basically, there's there's no supply for the whole of next month is what they're saying then of course you have the caller earlier in the show saying that
[05:04:36.957 --> 05:04:50.604]  He tried to get it through prescription because we're also getting a lot of reports where chemists or health stores actually have small amounts of it in stock but they're just refusing to sell it.
[05:04:50.604 --> 05:05:01.330]  One email said that a guy tried to buy it and he was told that it's used in the production of methamphetamine so they just point blank refused to sell it to him.
[05:05:01.330 --> 05:05:06.413]  And then you had the case of course which you covered earlier where this guy went to his doctor
[05:05:07.396 --> 05:05:08.557]  I don't know.
[05:05:27.597 --> 05:05:46.342]  Panic buying has resulted in a massive shortage and what's amazing about it is that it's been going on since Saturday before they even admitted to the fact that any kind of radiation had been injected into the atmosphere at that point.
[05:05:46.342 --> 05:05:54.604]  They were still claiming it was all hydrogen blasts and that there was no real threat apart from the immediate vicinity.
[05:05:55.666 --> 05:06:10.732]  But after, of course, the reports that we covered of the jet stream potentially carrying this across the Pacific, people are trying to acquire this potassium iodide, and it's all basically run out.
[05:06:10.732 --> 05:06:13.173]  So, good luck!
[05:06:13.173 --> 05:06:24.757]  Of course, you can still get the weaker liquid form of it, which is iodine, but it's far less concentrated than the pill format.
[05:06:25.399 --> 05:06:36.567]  The pill format is at 130mg and that's the amount that you need to take once a day to protect you from radiation fallout.
[05:06:36.567 --> 05:06:42.090]  But the liquid format is down at around 80mg.
[05:06:42.090 --> 05:06:51.557]  Iodide, that's the strongest that you can get from my research and I've been looking, obviously looking to buy it for hours today.
[05:06:52.429 --> 05:06:58.392]  Managed to get some more liquid, but the tablets are completely sold out.
[05:06:58.392 --> 05:07:05.316]  Apart from that, the latest developments are, of course, the radiation they said was an immediate threat.
[05:07:05.316 --> 05:07:09.618]  We had people fleeing Tokyo earlier today.
[05:07:09.618 --> 05:07:15.941]  Later, the government said that radiation had now fallen.
[05:07:15.941 --> 05:07:19.823]  But of course, since they've been caught underplaying
[05:07:21.332 --> 05:07:24.894]  Uh, the situation all along, nobody really trusts them.
[05:07:24.894 --> 05:07:35.922]  That's why a lot of people now start to leave Tokyo after the early reports of small levels of radiation reaching Tokyo.
[05:07:35.922 --> 05:07:44.928]  And basically, you've got evacuations taking place, you've got the French Radio, uh, Radio France, which is the state
[05:07:45.926 --> 05:07:53.069]  Uh, radio station for France, they pulled basically all their staff from Japan over radiation fears.
[05:07:53.069 --> 05:08:01.893]  The Chinese government has, uh, started to set up flights to evacuate its people out of the affected areas.
[05:08:01.893 --> 05:08:11.657]  Um, and so you've got a lot of people trying to leave as the crisis gets worse, which it only seems to have been doing.
[05:08:12.609 --> 05:08:26.778]  Every single morning in Japan, people wake up to this 6.30 announcement from the government, and it seems that each time they've made this announcement, the situation has got worse and worse.
[05:08:26.778 --> 05:08:34.242]  Their methods of dealing with the nuclear crisis have taken on a more and more desperate tone.
[05:08:34.242 --> 05:08:38.705]  It went from injecting seawater in to try and cool the nuclear on,
[05:08:40.419 --> 05:08:46.724]  Now they're failing to do that and these rods are being exposed because of the water levels going down.
[05:08:46.724 --> 05:08:55.990]  They're talking about flying over helicopters to dump water on there to try and cool them down.
[05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:59.253]  Paul, going back to Friday and Saturday, our little debates.
[05:09:01.405 --> 05:09:14.289]  I did a lot of research on this and I have to say the reportage and our analysis has been absolutely dead on from the beginning of this just because we know the history of other nuclear disasters and the cover-ups.
[05:09:14.289 --> 05:09:21.712]  We understand the technology and I've got to commend you, Kurt Nemo, Steve Watts and your brother Aaron Dykes, the entire crew here.
[05:09:22.592 --> 05:09:33.978]  Matt Ryan, Jaron Neihardt, Marley Jones, Matt, Bill, Max, the entire crew, everybody in this office and
[05:09:36.013 --> 05:09:45.535]  I tell you, if this continues to melt down the way it has, we're going to have big problems, not just in Japan, but in Hawaii, in Northeastern Russia, Alaska.
[05:09:45.535 --> 05:09:50.056]  Those winds just gyrate and go all over the place, but mainly towards the U.S.
[05:09:50.056 --> 05:09:54.357]  And I was hoping and praying that they could get this under control.
[05:09:54.357 --> 05:09:58.158]  But Paul, you understand the complete mission today and tomorrow now
[05:09:59.691 --> 05:10:12.961]  is the fact that that Mark 1 blew up and that they're reporting that it had rods not in the super powerful internal chamber but the larger blast shield containment over that it was inside of there.
[05:10:12.961 --> 05:10:18.766]  Some of the reactors tore it inside the inner chamber, others outside.
[05:10:18.766 --> 05:10:21.908]  The caller who worked on nuclear submarines was totally proven right yesterday.
[05:10:21.908 --> 05:10:25.731]  Today he called in very credible and said he looked at the specs on a Mark 1
[05:10:26.992 --> 05:10:42.367]  And he reported to me that it's in the press and I remember reading it again I'm live on air so it's hard but go in there find out if they were storing it because I saw it all over the news that some of these reactors they were stored outside the inner containment facility and so if that thing totally blew away
[05:10:43.348 --> 05:10:48.671]  And then there was rods inside of there that weren't in the main containment facility, but were in the outer one.
[05:10:48.671 --> 05:10:50.092]  Those were ejected up into the air.
[05:10:50.092 --> 05:10:53.214]  We're dealing with something that makes Chernobyl look like a joke.
[05:10:53.214 --> 05:10:55.796]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[05:10:55.796 --> 05:10:57.997]  This is the number one imperative.
[05:10:57.997 --> 05:10:59.879]  I need to let you go.
[05:10:59.879 --> 05:11:02.940]  What is your ETA on research on this?
[05:11:02.940 --> 05:11:07.143]  How long till we can get this key report out so we can get it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com?
[05:11:07.143 --> 05:11:09.725]  Because obviously, Paul, if there...
[05:11:10.145 --> 05:11:17.749]  Because we know at other reactors at Fukushima, they were outside the facility as well, caught on fire and the explosion blew up.
[05:11:17.749 --> 05:11:18.810]  We know that happened.
[05:11:18.810 --> 05:11:22.912]  But they were not ejected 3,000 feet in the air.
[05:11:22.912 --> 05:11:29.995]  I mean, you watch that plume in seconds go up, and you see the guts of what looks like a reactor and rods just falling back down.
[05:11:29.995 --> 05:11:32.497]  I mean, this is... Folks...
[05:11:33.976 --> 05:11:34.236]  We're
[05:11:55.956 --> 05:12:01.700]  Stronium, the cesium, the cesium, the radioactive iodine.
[05:12:01.700 --> 05:12:05.782]  That's bad, but nothing compared to uranium and plutonium.
[05:12:05.782 --> 05:12:08.124]  So what's your timeline on researching this?
[05:12:08.124 --> 05:12:17.110]  I'll help you ferret it out as soon as I get off air, but I'm telling you, I've read it over and over again that they were storing rods outside the inner containment facility
[05:12:17.870 --> 05:12:20.513]  That's hidden in plain view.
[05:12:20.513 --> 05:12:24.477]  Separate from the other plants with them stored outside that just caught on fire.
[05:12:24.477 --> 05:12:32.725]  If that huge explosion happened and they were storing things inside the general containment area over the inner, that's the issue.
[05:12:32.725 --> 05:12:37.590]  If that happened, we know that this is worse than Chernobyl and it's being covered up.
[05:12:38.251 --> 05:12:39.992]  And everything else has been covered up, Paul.
[05:12:39.992 --> 05:12:46.216]  Like when I called you Saturday morning and I said, Fukushima 1 just blew up, I would doubt that the containment facility would be intact.
[05:12:46.216 --> 05:12:53.361]  And now they're admitting that, oh, 1, 2, 3, maybe a bunch of them, the seals are broke, you know, of the impregnable.
[05:12:53.361 --> 05:12:56.603]  I saw Glenn Beck yesterday saying it was just impregnable, the inner one.
[05:12:56.603 --> 05:12:58.284]  And great, hope that all you want.
[05:12:58.284 --> 05:13:03.267]  I mean, the explosion we saw at Fukushima 3, and we don't know the explosions.
[05:13:03.267 --> 05:13:05.068]  Have you seen the explosions that went on during the night?
[05:13:05.068 --> 05:13:07.290]  Because I can't find video of that because it was dark.
[05:13:07.890 --> 05:13:11.512]  I mean, do we know how big those were?
[05:13:11.512 --> 05:13:13.373]  Right, but there's no one there.
[05:13:13.373 --> 05:13:17.656]  That's why they said they heard an explosion, because there's hardly anyone there to see it.
[05:13:17.656 --> 05:13:22.039]  There's only 50 people left in the actual vicinity.
[05:13:22.039 --> 05:13:33.946]  But, um, I mean, I saw that Glenn Beck last night, and he was basically downplaying it, that it wasn't even as urgent as Three Mile Island, and, uh, you're gonna have a bit of egg on his face tonight by the looks of it.
[05:13:34.580 --> 05:13:36.541]  No, he's busy.
[05:13:36.541 --> 05:13:38.022]  I just saw him during the break when I took a break.
[05:13:38.022 --> 05:13:47.328]  He's back there saying that look at how great the Japanese people are, how they handle things, praying and being good versus Americans rioting.
[05:13:47.328 --> 05:13:49.249]  And I absolutely agree with that.
[05:13:50.269 --> 05:13:50.510]  I think?
[05:14:12.210 --> 05:14:13.351]  I hope they're lying to people.
[05:14:13.351 --> 05:14:16.713]  I'm just sick of it.
[05:14:16.713 --> 05:14:18.734]  But you understand how critical this is?
[05:14:18.734 --> 05:14:20.575]  You understand how critical this is?
[05:14:20.575 --> 05:14:27.740]  That if they were storing rods outside the Central Containment Facility, those blew sky high and this is the biggest nuclear disaster in history.
[05:14:27.740 --> 05:14:30.841]  You understand the UN already listed as the second worst after Chernobyl.
[05:14:30.841 --> 05:14:32.162]  This is way past that.
[05:14:32.162 --> 05:14:34.424]  You confirm it, you break it right now, Paul.
[05:14:34.424 --> 05:14:34.924]  Okay?
[05:14:34.924 --> 05:14:36.785]  And if it isn't confirmed, thank God.
[05:14:36.785 --> 05:14:38.406]  But it looks like that's what happened.
[05:14:38.406 --> 05:14:39.547]  Are you on the job, Watson?
[05:14:41.069 --> 05:14:41.169]  Yeah.
[05:14:41.169 --> 05:14:41.269]  Yeah.
[05:14:41.269 --> 05:14:43.791]  I'm looking at a graphic of it now.
[05:14:43.791 --> 05:14:44.672]  I can see that they are.
[05:15:10.552 --> 05:15:14.455]  Mark, Fukushima No.
[05:15:14.455 --> 05:15:20.479]  3, fuel rods ejected in explosion, and the fact that no one's seeing it right there.
[05:15:20.479 --> 05:15:20.999]  This isn't it.
[05:15:20.999 --> 05:15:24.461]  The other plant, too, with some getting on fire.
[05:15:24.461 --> 05:15:28.424]  Them catching on fire, some of it fizzes and gets out, but not a lot.
[05:15:28.424 --> 05:15:34.909]  When they're blowing up into the sky, and they fall into particleized dust when they're spent, this is just...
[05:15:35.869 --> 05:15:37.291]  Well, they're saying that the, uh,
[05:15:54.542 --> 05:15:56.643]  The blast that affected the No.
[05:15:56.643 --> 05:16:04.627]  2 reactor affected the suppression pool, which is down below from where the spent fuel rods are stored.
[05:16:04.627 --> 05:16:06.588]  Yeah, but we're not talking about No.
[05:16:06.588 --> 05:16:06.608]  2.
[05:16:06.608 --> 05:16:08.169]  We're talking about No.
[05:16:08.169 --> 05:16:09.970]  3 Fukushima.
[05:16:09.970 --> 05:16:12.671]  It's the Mark 1 plutonium-uranium reactor.
[05:16:12.671 --> 05:16:15.933]  That's the issue in the big explosion yesterday morning.
[05:16:15.933 --> 05:16:16.613]  That's the point.
[05:16:16.613 --> 05:16:19.855]  These aren't rods on fire at another plant next door.
[05:16:19.855 --> 05:16:21.476]  This is them ejected into the sky.
[05:16:21.476 --> 05:16:22.717]  Do you understand that?
[05:16:22.717 --> 05:16:23.397]  That's the big issue.
[05:16:26.156 --> 05:16:31.518]  Folks are seeing some behind-the-scenes things here where Paul will call me with news, I'll call him with news, we'll work through it together.
[05:16:31.518 --> 05:16:32.819]  I've just been handed more information.
[05:16:32.819 --> 05:16:36.920]  Japan races to contain meltdowns after two blasts, third reactor losing cooling capacity.
[05:16:39.111 --> 05:16:40.872]  And they've got it underlined here.
[05:16:40.872 --> 05:16:52.881]  At the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi Unit 1, where an explosion Saturday destroyed a building housed in the reactor, the spent fuel pool, in accordance with General Electric's design, is placed above the reactor.
[05:16:52.881 --> 05:16:58.545]  Okay, so 1 and 3 are the General Electric's, and it does say they're placed above the reactor.
[05:16:58.545 --> 05:17:03.109]  Tokyo Electric said it was trying to figure out how to maintain water levels in the pools.
[05:17:03.109 --> 05:17:05.651]  The question is, is that
[05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:11.652]  Outside of the internal containment.
[05:17:11.652 --> 05:17:13.573]  And according to these reports, it is.
[05:17:13.573 --> 05:17:14.614]  That's the point.
[05:17:14.614 --> 05:17:15.634]  That's the point.
[05:17:15.634 --> 05:17:21.057]  Everybody's talking about the active reactor, not the other reactor cores, the batteries, basically.
[05:17:21.057 --> 05:17:21.738]  They've pulled.
[05:17:21.738 --> 05:17:22.798]  That's the issue.
[05:17:22.798 --> 05:17:24.219]  The mother of all dirty bombs.
[05:17:24.219 --> 05:17:33.044]  It said that would be like Chernobyl on steroids, said Arnie Gunderson, a nuclear engineer at Fairwinds Associates, a member of the public oversight panel for Vermont Yankee Power Plant.
[05:17:33.880 --> 05:17:34.501]  I don't think so.
[05:17:58.584 --> 05:18:03.185]  Just the fact that a lot of people are still in denial.
[05:18:03.185 --> 05:18:24.590]  For example, there's a lot of British people who live in Japan and on the BBC, I'm talking about the people who live about 30 to 50 miles away from the actual reactor, they're just saying that they're taking their kids to the park and they're still drinking the tap water because they just believe that everything is going to be fine.
[05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:25.570]  You're talking about Japan?
[05:18:27.196 --> 05:18:32.100]  Yeah, I'm talking about British people reporting from Japan.
[05:18:32.100 --> 05:18:39.426]  So the Japanese, in an orderly fashion, are fleeing, but the Brits are just bumbling about like Americans.
[05:18:39.426 --> 05:18:50.415]  Yeah, because their downfall is that they believe the authorities and their lies that everything is going to be fine, and so they're going to pay the price in the end.
[05:18:50.415 --> 05:18:52.777]  You still planning to go to Asia in a few weeks, Paul?
[05:18:55.203 --> 05:18:56.744]  No, I just bathed in radiation.
[05:18:56.744 --> 05:18:59.344]  No, but I'll have to wait and see.
[05:18:59.344 --> 05:18:59.725]  Alright, thanks.
[05:19:23.953 --> 05:19:29.116]  Let's go ahead, and I've tried to do the best job I can doing five hours of radio here.
[05:19:29.116 --> 05:19:31.377]  Five plus hours now.
[05:19:31.377 --> 05:19:34.639]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Germany.
[05:19:34.639 --> 05:19:35.480]  David, you're on the air.
[05:19:35.480 --> 05:19:39.622]  This is David from Germany.
[05:19:39.622 --> 05:19:41.303]  How are you, Alex?
[05:19:41.303 --> 05:19:43.865]  Very upset, trying to maintain calm.
[05:19:43.865 --> 05:19:46.286]  Very angry at General Electric.
[05:19:46.286 --> 05:19:48.207]  Very angry at the globalists covering this up.
[05:19:48.207 --> 05:19:49.208]  But what's your view, David?
[05:19:51.158 --> 05:19:59.225]  Cool, I have one information, one question and one suggestion to make it very short.
[05:19:59.225 --> 05:20:11.576]  So I'm InfoWarrior since two decades and Paul, what you are doing is just, I'm just, wow, I'm off the words now.
[05:20:11.576 --> 05:20:14.919]  So the question is, why the heck
[05:20:15.922 --> 05:20:22.467]  Do they have plutonium in there, which is normally only used for weapons?
[05:20:22.467 --> 05:20:41.321]  Because they've created the Mark I's to get rid of hydrogen bomb fissile material, and so what they burn there reportedly is American decommissioned plutonium from warheads.
[05:20:41.321 --> 05:20:41.602]  Oh, wow.
[05:20:42.640 --> 05:21:01.698]  So, beyond the information in the mainstream media here in Germany that BMW is pulling out people and Simons is pulling out people and which all confirms what is going on there, beyond that I did energy projection management training years ago and I was in Ohu too.
[05:21:01.698 --> 05:21:08.344]  So I have seen a power plant, I know how it works and I've made a lot of very bad questions there that didn't like me at all.
[05:21:09.546 --> 05:21:18.130]  Beyond all that, you pointed out the question, why the heck they always build that power plant at fault lines.
[05:21:18.130 --> 05:21:38.639]  And the information I've got years ago from a guy which is called, or named, Ron Wilmer Hesedek, is the only reason is to have it really work good, you need a negative spot, which is the dragon lines, or however you call it, the magnetic lines, a negative spot, to work
[05:21:39.446 --> 05:21:41.888]  Good for a nuclear facility.
[05:21:41.888 --> 05:21:56.922]  You know, that sounds crazy, but I've talked to engineers, and they say that they're, depending on it, whether it's superstition or whatever, that they do believe, and the globalists believe in all this stuff, and it's very bizarre.
[05:21:56.922 --> 05:21:58.403]  David, good to hear from you.
[05:21:58.403 --> 05:22:01.045]  I really appreciate your great points from Deutschland.
[05:22:01.045 --> 05:22:02.747]  Let's talk to Dana in Colorado.
[05:22:02.747 --> 05:22:03.548]  You're on the air, Dana.
[05:22:05.566 --> 05:22:07.607]  Wow, okay.
[05:22:07.607 --> 05:22:14.550]  I was just watching eBay and two blister packs of IoSat started at $29.
[05:22:14.550 --> 05:22:20.292]  There were 38 bidders and it just sold for $610.
[05:22:20.292 --> 05:22:29.596]  Wow, and I just threw away about a year ago two boxes of it that I'd bought because it said it was expired.
[05:22:29.596 --> 05:22:30.597]  Sorry, go ahead.
[05:22:30.597 --> 05:22:30.977]  Actually,
[05:22:33.440 --> 05:22:37.102]  So, what do you think of this overall situation?
[05:22:37.102 --> 05:22:45.967]  Well, I actually have to tell you about another fact that I had seen on the internet when you were talking about units being deployed.
[05:22:45.967 --> 05:22:55.673]  On the FEMA website, I already emailed it to your division, their fact sheet reads that there's a national level exercise, 2011, called NLE 2011.
[05:22:55.673 --> 05:22:58.234]  On the Madrid fault lines.
[05:22:58.234 --> 05:22:58.574]  Correct.
[05:22:58.574 --> 05:22:59.595]  The 200 year anniversary.
[05:23:02.424 --> 05:23:10.677]  And it's got eight states participating in this drill, and how ironic.
[05:23:10.677 --> 05:23:13.080]  That is, I tell you, there's a lot of creepiness going on.
[05:23:13.080 --> 05:23:14.843]  We can't rule out HAARP here.
[05:23:14.843 --> 05:23:16.445]  They admit they've got that weapon system.
[05:23:16.445 --> 05:23:17.948]  Do we ever find the Secretary of Defense quote?
[05:23:19.161 --> 05:23:21.202]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen, 1997.
[05:23:21.202 --> 05:23:25.783]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen talks about tectonic weapons.
[05:23:25.783 --> 05:23:26.724]  That'll pull the quote up for you.
[05:23:26.724 --> 05:23:27.984]  I want to read the exact quote.
[05:23:27.984 --> 05:23:28.604]  Thank you, Dana.
[05:23:28.604 --> 05:23:29.605]  Thank you.
[05:23:29.605 --> 05:23:31.405]  Let's talk to Mark Enmash.
[05:23:31.405 --> 05:23:32.266]  Mark, you're on the air.
[05:23:32.266 --> 05:23:33.046]  Moving along here.
[05:23:33.046 --> 05:23:34.467]  Hi, Alex.
[05:23:34.467 --> 05:23:35.387]  Hi.
[05:23:35.387 --> 05:23:37.047]  I just, first of all, a major thank you.
[05:23:37.047 --> 05:23:39.628]  This is beyond incredible.
[05:23:39.628 --> 05:23:41.649]  You're not the only one whose head is spinning right now.
[05:23:41.649 --> 05:23:43.230]  Let's put it that way.
[05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:45.370]  I'm a geologist, among other things.
[05:23:45.370 --> 05:23:46.791]  I've been following this, you know, right along.
[05:23:47.563 --> 05:23:49.644]  And just talk about spiraling out of control.
[05:23:49.644 --> 05:23:52.066]  You've heard terms, obviously, like culture shock.
[05:23:52.066 --> 05:23:56.328]  The news is coming in left and right so fast, so rapidly.
[05:23:56.328 --> 05:23:58.910]  You know, hearing you and your energy is incredible.
[05:23:58.910 --> 05:24:03.673]  It reminds me of things I heard about Nikola Tesla, where he realized he only needed, I think, 20 minutes of sleep.
[05:24:03.673 --> 05:24:04.493]  He'd get up, like, at 4 a.m.
[05:24:04.493 --> 05:24:05.914]  and he'd just get back up, you know?
[05:24:05.914 --> 05:24:07.155]  Well, I'm not Nikola Tesla.
[05:24:07.155 --> 05:24:09.576]  That guy probably had a 250 IQ.
[05:24:09.576 --> 05:24:11.437]  I'm lucky if I'm pushing 120, pal.
[05:24:11.437 --> 05:24:12.238]  You're pretty good, man.
[05:24:12.238 --> 05:24:13.138]  You're pretty good.
[05:24:13.138 --> 05:24:14.919]  I got a couple things to share with you really quick.
[05:24:14.919 --> 05:24:16.020]  I'll try to be concise here.
[05:24:17.046 --> 05:24:20.809]  Um, just what you just said about, you know, when they were telling everyone not to worry.
[05:24:20.809 --> 05:24:23.511]  It really reminds me of, like, the, uh, Martians and Mars attacks.
[05:24:23.511 --> 05:24:28.535]  You know, they're going around saying, everything is fine, do not worry, while they're nuking people at the same time.
[05:24:28.535 --> 05:24:30.016]  You know, destroying the planet.
[05:24:30.016 --> 05:24:31.918]  But everything is fine.
[05:24:31.918 --> 05:24:34.520]  Um, your information is ground zero.
[05:24:34.520 --> 05:24:35.161]  Let's put it that way.
[05:24:35.161 --> 05:24:36.862]  Number one, for everybody out there listening,
[05:24:37.800 --> 05:24:40.642]  Uh, this might, this is not the most important point, but it is a good point.
[05:24:40.642 --> 05:24:46.686]  There's a song on YouTube, and if you can get access to it, I already told your, uh, staff about it, called The Apple Tree.
[05:24:46.686 --> 05:24:47.006]  Came out in 1985.
[05:24:48.277 --> 05:24:51.100]  By Different and Tilbrook, the main guys from Squeeze.
[05:24:51.100 --> 05:24:53.382]  And it's the ultimate song for what's going on right now.
[05:24:53.382 --> 05:24:56.004]  Not that songs are important, but you know, you have bumper music.
[05:24:56.004 --> 05:24:56.825]  It's eerie.
[05:24:56.825 --> 05:25:01.749]  Every line in the song, it's about the nuclear meltdown that kind of causes doomsday.
[05:25:01.749 --> 05:25:02.630]  It's amazing.
[05:25:02.630 --> 05:25:03.390]  Beyond amazing.
[05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:06.633]  So I told them, anyone out there listening, check out the apple tree.
[05:25:06.633 --> 05:25:07.654]  Alright, we'll do it, Mark.
[05:25:07.654 --> 05:25:08.555]  Thank you.
[05:25:08.555 --> 05:25:09.556]  Got six more callers.
[05:25:09.556 --> 05:25:10.917]  I'm going to take it and that's it, folks.
[05:25:10.917 --> 05:25:12.038]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[05:25:12.038 --> 05:25:13.779]  Dan in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[05:25:13.779 --> 05:25:14.120]  Welcome.
[05:25:14.969 --> 05:25:16.410]  Yeah, kudos to you, Alex.
[05:25:16.410 --> 05:25:24.216]  This is kind of off-topic, but it's about all of the nuclear power plants that are around and about the country and everything.
[05:25:24.216 --> 05:25:34.404]  It's about, what is it, retrofitting them with cold fusion from a gentleman out in Italy, Mr. Rossi.
[05:25:34.404 --> 05:25:40.549]  And they want to put one in Greece, but they have to
[05:25:41.676 --> 05:25:44.558]  Um, what is it, wait for authorization for it?
[05:25:44.558 --> 05:26:01.088]  I mean, I believe this is a technology that's, you know, way beyond... Well, you know, they've done some hoaxes claiming that it isn't real, but now it's been duplicated thousands of times, and the establishment doesn't want people having close to free energy, so there is a lot of suppression of it, like my guest earlier in the show today talked about.
[05:26:01.088 --> 05:26:06.751]  When you try to get your own solar panels hooked up at your house, they'll never come in per minute, so just ignore them, just do it.
[05:26:08.462 --> 05:26:12.506]  Then if you agree to put solar panels in and put it in the grid, then they come right out and do it.
[05:26:12.506 --> 05:26:13.588]  They want to control your life.
[05:26:13.588 --> 05:26:15.249]  Thank you, Dan.
[05:26:15.249 --> 05:26:15.970]  Fred in Florida.
[05:26:15.970 --> 05:26:17.832]  You're on the air worldwide.
[05:26:17.832 --> 05:26:19.194]  Hey, Alex.
[05:26:19.194 --> 05:26:22.597]  I just had a little bit more to add to this.
[05:26:22.597 --> 05:26:25.320]  I emailed you an image I found.
[05:26:25.320 --> 05:26:28.824]  It's a fairly high resolution satellite image on top of Unit 3.
[05:26:30.419 --> 05:26:44.951]  And when you see the explosion, that plume that went up, I mean went pretty near a mile up, and you could see chunks of stuff falling out, well on this satellite image you could see what looks like the whole guts of the reactor just
[05:26:45.792 --> 05:26:58.476]  Laying across... But now we know why it looked like that, because the evidence shows they had the original guts of the previous load of plutonium-uranium rods in there.
[05:26:58.476 --> 05:27:01.817]  And so that was sitting on top of the inner containment.
[05:27:01.817 --> 05:27:04.978]  When the outside blew up, it ejected it into the air.
[05:27:04.978 --> 05:27:05.318]  Right.
[05:27:05.318 --> 05:27:13.520]  So what I'm wondering is, it looks like when you read, what I learned about what a meltdown is, is that the main core melts.
[05:27:14.238 --> 05:27:18.239]  And then melts down through the earth until it hits groundwater.
[05:27:18.239 --> 05:27:21.460]  And then it has a steam explosion and blows up.
[05:27:21.460 --> 05:27:24.020]  Just like what I imagined that video looks like.
[05:27:24.020 --> 05:27:25.181]  It blew a mile up.
[05:27:25.181 --> 05:27:28.621]  How many kilotons of energy was that going up?
[05:27:28.621 --> 05:27:34.363]  So Mike, what I'm wondering, has the main containment shell disintegrated in that plume?
[05:27:34.363 --> 05:27:36.023]  Or is it just the spent fuel rods?
[05:27:38.246 --> 05:27:41.707]  Oh, the outer containment shell evaporated and exploded.
[05:27:41.707 --> 05:27:42.708]  Good points.
[05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:43.808]  Sorry, go ahead.
[05:27:43.808 --> 05:27:44.908]  There's three shells.
[05:27:44.908 --> 05:27:50.430]  There's the square outer one, and then there's an inner safety shell.
[05:27:50.430 --> 05:27:52.991]  Yeah, and then there's the main containment shell.
[05:27:52.991 --> 05:27:54.892]  Yeah, and what I'm saying is they store...
[05:27:55.752 --> 05:28:05.062]  Exactly, in the, above the first shell, the inner shell, they storm above that and they have another shell above it, another shell above it, and clearly, look at the photos, it's all blown to kingdom come.
[05:28:05.062 --> 05:28:05.923]  I appreciate your call.
[05:28:05.923 --> 05:28:11.009]  That's the big issue, is the spent fuel rods spraying all out in the air, breaking up in the wind.
[05:28:11.009 --> 05:28:14.413]  I mean, this is just, that stuff is so deadly, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:28:16.049 --> 05:28:16.269]  Alex,
[05:28:39.208 --> 05:28:41.792]  Um, hats off, tip of my hat to you.
[05:28:41.792 --> 05:28:47.520]  Sir, I wanted to mention to you, the guy that mentioned from, he worked at Oyster Creek Nuclear Power Plant.
[05:28:47.520 --> 05:28:50.444]  I worked at Three Mile Island, Stevensville, Michigan, D.C.
[05:28:50.444 --> 05:28:50.704]  Cook.
[05:28:50.704 --> 05:28:52.447]  I'm 63 years old.
[05:28:52.447 --> 05:28:54.029]  I've worked at quite a few of these plants.
[05:28:54.449 --> 05:28:59.236]  And it's amazing what goes on.
[05:28:59.236 --> 05:29:04.944]  Everybody kind of touched on the points that I wanted to touch on.
[05:29:04.944 --> 05:29:09.211]  I worked at Indian Point, which is a nuclear power plant right above New York City.
[05:29:09.891 --> 05:29:24.369]  And many years ago when I was just a young man they had some problems in there and in order for the people to go inside the plant to repair them they could only stay in there at 15 minutes at one time and that was it for a year's work.
[05:29:24.369 --> 05:29:28.975]  So they were going through welders that were it was so quick and so fast it was unbelievable.
[05:29:29.415 --> 05:29:38.859]  And I was lucky, I was fat, and I couldn't fit in the containment vessel, so I had to stay, I was outside testing the welders constantly, the ones that were going in to weld.
[05:29:38.859 --> 05:29:40.499]  It was kind of an interesting thing.
[05:29:40.499 --> 05:29:42.660]  And one last thing I want to ask you really quick.
[05:29:42.660 --> 05:29:54.245]  The Reverend from, that was up, that's from up on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, I was up there in 1976, 77, 78 when he was, and I just would like you to ask him sometime if he enjoyed the BP Hilton.
[05:29:55.894 --> 05:29:58.055]  All right, what was the BP Hilton?
[05:29:58.055 --> 05:30:00.237]  Well, that was what British Petroleum had.
[05:30:00.237 --> 05:30:08.863]  They had this huge, magnificent building where the uppity up lived, and they had the swimming pool in it, and I mean, it was gory.
[05:30:08.863 --> 05:30:10.444]  It was high up on stilts.
[05:30:10.444 --> 05:30:18.749]  Now, we're talking about 30, 40, 50 degrees below zero, and occasionally I got invited in because I was an inspector, and I got to swim in it.
[05:30:18.749 --> 05:30:21.671]  And I said, what would happen if that window broke while we were swimming?
[05:30:21.671 --> 05:30:22.712]  He said, don't worry, you never know.
[05:30:23.305 --> 05:30:24.266]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[05:30:24.266 --> 05:30:25.226]  Appreciate your call.
[05:30:25.226 --> 05:30:26.567]  Interesting points.
[05:30:26.567 --> 05:30:28.629]  Well, we have Robert, Bob, and David left there.
[05:30:28.629 --> 05:30:36.695]  Okay, we're going to go to three final calls and end this transmission and go into rebroadcast with key information with Dr. Bob Bowman and others.
[05:30:36.695 --> 05:30:38.336]  This is from Defense.gov.
[05:30:38.336 --> 05:30:42.359]  It was also in the Army Times, Army Press Conference.
[05:30:42.359 --> 05:30:49.785]  Let me ask you specifically, last week, the scare here in Washington and what we might have learned from how prepared we are to deal with inaudible.
[05:30:51.367 --> 05:30:54.388]  And it goes on at B'nai B'rith.
[05:30:54.388 --> 05:31:00.591]  And he went on into super Ebola viruses, constructing them, how governments have them.
[05:31:00.591 --> 05:31:10.435]  He says, others are engaging even in eco-type terrorism, whereby they can alter climate, shut off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely, through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[05:31:10.435 --> 05:31:12.416]  Well, what do you think HAARP is?
[05:31:14.346 --> 05:31:15.207]  So he continues...
[05:31:36.209 --> 05:31:44.376]  Reports, for example, that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola virus that's airborne and would be a very dangerous phenomenon.
[05:31:44.376 --> 05:31:49.240]  Meanwhile, the UT professor, Bianca, talks about how wonderful it'll be to kill everybody.
[05:31:49.240 --> 05:31:57.607]  To say the least, Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens which would be ethnic-specific.
[05:31:57.607 --> 05:32:01.571]  You mean Dick Cheney, September 20th, 2000, promoting race-specific bioweapons?
[05:32:01.571 --> 05:32:02.772]  Austin American-Statesman reported on it?
[05:32:04.201 --> 05:32:16.128]  Again, in their laboratory trying to devise, you mean South Africa and Israel, to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic-specific, wiping out certain races, so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups or races.
[05:32:16.128 --> 05:32:23.233]  And others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops, like the U.S.
[05:32:23.233 --> 05:32:24.713]  government did to Guatemala.
[05:32:24.713 --> 05:32:32.498]  Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism, whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely, with the use of electromagnetic waves, and it goes on.
[05:32:34.793 --> 05:32:37.395]  Defense.gov, boys and girls.
[05:32:37.395 --> 05:32:38.116]  Okay?
[05:32:38.116 --> 05:32:39.436]  This stuff's real.
[05:32:39.436 --> 05:32:40.717]  It's going on.
[05:32:40.717 --> 05:32:42.138]  Ignore it at your own risk.
[05:32:42.138 --> 05:32:43.940]  Can I say this was a government operation?
[05:32:43.940 --> 05:32:48.403]  Hey, God's harp's a lot bigger than Beelzebub's.
[05:32:48.403 --> 05:32:55.889]  What the devil can do through man is bad, but let me tell you, what God can do is, in God's plan, we can't even grasp.
[05:32:55.889 --> 05:32:58.070]  And let's get that through our heads right now.
[05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.771]  Let's think about that.
[05:33:00.455 --> 05:33:05.961]  The sun, the moon, the manipulation of our weather systems, the magnetic fields, the magma.
[05:33:05.961 --> 05:33:13.828]  The moon doesn't just pull the oceans and cause literally from satellites, so the ocean bulging towards the moon.
[05:33:13.828 --> 05:33:14.870]  That's what creates the waves.
[05:33:15.942 --> 05:33:17.443]  It manipulates the magma.
[05:33:17.443 --> 05:33:18.543]  So we don't know.
[05:33:18.543 --> 05:33:36.213]  We just know the government's been lying about this the whole time, and there's clear evidence that they had spent fuel rods outside all these facilities, blown sky-high, confirmed at Mark 1, I mean, confirmed at Fukushima 1, and we're looking at the Mark 1, Fukushima 3, where it went straight up in the sky, thousands of feet, 3,000 feet.
[05:33:36.213 --> 05:33:40.055]  I don't think that's a mile, but let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas.
[05:33:40.055 --> 05:33:41.296]  Robert, you're on the air.
[05:33:41.296 --> 05:33:44.098]  Part of this five-hour, 33-minute so far transmission.
[05:33:44.098 --> 05:33:44.418]  Go ahead.
[05:33:44.798 --> 05:33:45.638]  Two quick things.
[05:33:45.638 --> 05:33:54.823]  First, on those spent fuel rods, I found the Union of Concerned Scientists have a page dedicated to that.
[05:33:54.823 --> 05:33:58.224]  It looks like there's two different kinds of spent fuel rods.
[05:33:58.224 --> 05:34:04.467]  One is in the wet storage, and then after five years, the rods are put into a dry interim storage cask.
[05:34:05.496 --> 05:34:08.937]  Yeah, they're reporting that both were in these facilities.
[05:34:08.937 --> 05:34:16.920]  Yeah, well, the casks look like, in one of the pictures here, it looks like they might have those casks stored on the roof, as that first caller who reported this had said.
[05:34:16.920 --> 05:34:18.300]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[05:34:18.300 --> 05:34:19.920]  Will you email that right now?
[05:34:19.920 --> 05:34:29.804]  I'm going to put you on hold to my producer, and so he can relay that to Paul Watson, because that's good research for his article he's doing right now.
[05:34:29.804 --> 05:34:34.085]  I'm going to put you on hold in a minute, then give him Jaron's email, please, because we're going to bounce that over to Watson.
[05:34:34.806 --> 05:34:36.351]  Uh, but go ahead and finish your point, Robert.
[05:34:41.603 --> 05:34:44.645]  Uh, we haven't seen, uh, the robots in action.
[05:34:44.645 --> 05:34:56.251]  I mean, the United States is famous for surveillance drones, and Japan's famous for robots, and why aren't the robots flying and crawling all over this thing, uh, giving us, uh... Because they don't want us to see what's going on.
[05:34:56.251 --> 05:35:05.656]  When they've got some gun owner at a farm cornered, they got robots and the cops on record roast hot dogs and play the sound of squealing dying animals.
[05:35:05.656 --> 05:35:09.939]  This is on record, and high five and call another jurisdiction and burn it down and
[05:35:11.139 --> 05:35:11.799]  Robots!
[05:35:11.799 --> 05:35:13.380]  Send robots in!
[05:35:13.380 --> 05:35:15.241]  A box falls off a car here in Austin.
[05:35:15.241 --> 05:35:18.782]  They got multi-million dollar robots rolling out hysteria.
[05:35:18.782 --> 05:35:22.003]  But when there's a real crisis, government hightails it.
[05:35:22.003 --> 05:35:22.884]  Sorry, go ahead.
[05:35:22.884 --> 05:35:23.864]  Yeah, well, that was my point.
[05:35:23.864 --> 05:35:24.624]  Where are they?
[05:35:24.624 --> 05:35:30.747]  I mean, both countries are famous for having drones and robots, and you would think that they would be all over the place.
[05:35:30.747 --> 05:35:36.449]  But, yeah, I'll go ahead and give the concerned side this spent fuel report to your guy.
[05:35:36.909 --> 05:35:37.870]  All right, thank you.
[05:35:37.870 --> 05:35:43.875]  Let's give him Jaron's little secret mouse email and let's get that bounced over to Watson right now.
[05:35:43.875 --> 05:35:45.817]  Call Watson, make sure he knows it's coming.
[05:35:45.817 --> 05:35:46.897]  Okay, thank you.
[05:35:46.897 --> 05:35:51.261]  Hey, you guys can use the comment sections on InfoWars and Prison Planet to add links.
[05:35:51.261 --> 05:35:52.742]  Intel, help us.
[05:35:52.742 --> 05:35:58.267]  I mean, we're doing a decent job, but sometimes I'm floundering around because there's just too much data.
[05:35:58.267 --> 05:36:01.289]  Bob in California, you are the next to the last in line.
[05:36:01.289 --> 05:36:01.850]  Go ahead, Bob.
[05:36:02.372 --> 05:36:11.756]  Yeah, by the way, you just went on our local talk station here about two weeks ago, and I called up the program director and thanked him because I'm just amazed that they put you on.
[05:36:11.756 --> 05:36:13.277]  What station is that?
[05:36:13.277 --> 05:36:16.198]  It's KIXW Talk 960.
[05:36:16.198 --> 05:36:20.440]  And we're up in the high desert, up in the Victorville-Apple Valley area.
[05:36:20.440 --> 05:36:24.121]  We're at 3,000 feet, above 3,000 feet up here.
[05:36:24.121 --> 05:36:25.202]  But I go into L.A.
[05:36:25.202 --> 05:36:30.084]  all the time, and I can hear this station all the way clear down into Orange County.
[05:36:31.401 --> 05:36:32.662]  In the daytime.
[05:36:32.662 --> 05:36:33.923]  Well, some things happen.
[05:36:33.923 --> 05:36:36.204]  Most people aren't New World Order controlled.
[05:36:36.204 --> 05:36:38.326]  They just are controlled by the propaganda.
[05:36:38.326 --> 05:36:42.769]  And more and more station owners and program directors have seen everything we talk about come true.
[05:36:42.769 --> 05:36:44.910]  They care about America and their families.
[05:36:44.910 --> 05:36:49.213]  We're gaining about three stations a week right now, which, it's just explosive.
[05:36:49.213 --> 05:36:54.276]  We're on the cover of Talkers next month, and I am the keynote speaker at their yearly event.
[05:36:54.276 --> 05:36:55.617]  Usually it's Rush Limbaugh.
[05:36:55.617 --> 05:36:58.459]  So, believe me, sir, we have broken through thanks to you.
[05:36:58.459 --> 05:36:58.999]  Go ahead, Bob.
[05:36:59.059 --> 05:36:59.880]  Well, that's good.
[05:36:59.880 --> 05:37:05.424]  Well, listen, one piece of news, of course, you're talking about those spent fuel rods being stored.
[05:37:05.424 --> 05:37:09.808]  Yeah, they are stored, but they've got to be stored in something, because they're still radioactive.
[05:37:09.808 --> 05:37:17.014]  They've got to be stored in something fairly secure, but when an explosion like that happens, all the security just goes right out the door.
[05:37:17.014 --> 05:37:18.816]  That's the side note of what I called about.
[05:37:18.816 --> 05:37:27.303]  What I'm worried about is, if there is a lot of radiation going to be floating over here, and I would hope that they've got Air Force planes up there collecting air samples,
[05:37:28.089 --> 05:37:29.850]  Between here in Japan and along the way.
[05:37:29.850 --> 05:37:30.550]  You know they are.
[05:37:30.550 --> 05:37:32.831]  But they're not telling us, have you noticed?
[05:37:32.831 --> 05:37:42.835]  Well, they won't be telling us, but what I'm afraid of, Alex, is your worst concern, is this is the perfect chance for them to throw in martial law.
[05:37:42.835 --> 05:37:46.737]  Well, notice Obama came out against the guns yesterday while we're busy watching this.
[05:37:46.737 --> 05:37:47.697]  Yes, I know.
[05:37:47.697 --> 05:37:54.580]  And here's their perfect chance to roll out the National Guard and martial law, tell everybody to stay indoors and nobody go anywhere.
[05:37:55.325 --> 05:37:56.786]  Shut the whole system down.
[05:37:56.786 --> 05:37:58.247]  Lock the banks up and everything.
[05:37:58.247 --> 05:38:01.389]  Let's not let a good crisis go to waste.
[05:38:01.389 --> 05:38:17.278]  The main thing that I did learn from nuclear physicists up in the Bay Area, who's Dr. Bill Wattenberg, he says what happened over there is the reactor shut down when the earthquake hit, but there's residual heat in those fuel rods.
[05:38:17.913 --> 05:38:25.979]  And he says when the tsunami came in, it killed the diesel generators, and that's what they relied on to cool them down.
[05:38:25.979 --> 05:38:26.699]  And the batteries.
[05:38:26.699 --> 05:38:27.340]  Great point, Bob.
[05:38:27.340 --> 05:38:28.400]  Right, it killed everything.
[05:38:28.400 --> 05:38:30.042]  So that's why this whole thing happened.
[05:38:30.042 --> 05:38:33.044]  But I used to think nuclear power was safe.
[05:38:33.044 --> 05:38:35.525]  I'm beginning to think like you now.
[05:38:35.525 --> 05:38:40.269]  There's just no way you can out-think every possibility of what could happen.
[05:38:40.269 --> 05:38:43.751]  Well, more than that, Japan, I understand why they did it.
[05:38:43.751 --> 05:38:44.952]  They don't have any coal or oil.
[05:38:44.952 --> 05:38:46.153]  They need energy.
[05:38:46.153 --> 05:38:47.094]  But at the same time,
[05:38:48.155 --> 05:39:04.262]  I mean, Japan, if you look at it, is on the great rim of fire, great ring of fire, in probably, they estimate, the most unstable volcanic tectonic area in the world, and they've got more reactors per capita than anybody, and they've got a bunch of aging ones, 40 years old.
[05:39:04.262 --> 05:39:06.443]  I mean, what did they think was going to happen?
[05:39:06.443 --> 05:39:07.523]  I appreciate your call, Bob.
[05:39:07.523 --> 05:39:09.564]  Final caller, David in Wisconsin.
[05:39:09.564 --> 05:39:10.744]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[05:39:10.744 --> 05:39:11.865]  You'll take us out as tail gunner.
[05:39:12.305 --> 05:39:14.827]  Thank you, Alex, and I really appreciate your coverage.
[05:39:14.827 --> 05:39:18.429]  I'll tell you, when you go off the air, the only thing you can rely on is Drudge.
[05:39:18.429 --> 05:39:18.889]  He's good.
[05:39:18.889 --> 05:39:22.671]  Al Jazeera and BBC, because nobody else is covering this in the U.S.
[05:39:22.671 --> 05:39:23.612]  media.
[05:39:23.612 --> 05:39:25.293]  This is real journalism, what you're doing here.
[05:39:25.293 --> 05:39:26.174]  We really appreciate that.
[05:39:26.174 --> 05:39:28.255]  I want to tell you, where's our president in times like this?
[05:39:28.255 --> 05:39:32.577]  He's hanging around with the NCAA today, talking about basketball games.
[05:39:32.577 --> 05:39:33.258]  And let me say this.
[05:39:33.866 --> 05:39:35.427]  Breaking news just came out on Drudge.
[05:39:35.427 --> 05:39:36.127]  It says U.S.
[05:39:36.127 --> 05:39:40.630]  Surgeon General encourages West Coast residents to buy iodide tablets.
[05:39:40.630 --> 05:39:43.912]  It just popped up there, Alex, while you were talking to that last caller.
[05:39:43.912 --> 05:39:45.794]  But meanwhile, we gotta get it to Drudge.
[05:39:45.794 --> 05:39:52.458]  We have the article up on Prison Planet and InfoWars where the government is telling clinics not to give it to people when they ask.
[05:39:53.433 --> 05:39:54.134]  And how do you like that?
[05:39:54.134 --> 05:39:54.574]  Here it is.
[05:39:54.574 --> 05:39:55.495]  It's in the red letters.
[05:39:55.495 --> 05:39:56.376]  Top left column.
[05:39:56.376 --> 05:39:56.977]  Drug Report.
[05:39:56.977 --> 05:39:58.238]  Take a look at it.
[05:39:58.238 --> 05:40:00.880]  I'll let you get going and I appreciate your coverage.
[05:40:00.880 --> 05:40:05.225]  We wish you could stay on longer and, you know, give us some more information because you're the source.
[05:40:05.225 --> 05:40:06.946]  Well, my crew wishes we'd stay on longer.
[05:40:06.946 --> 05:40:08.808]  You guys want to do a couple more hours?
[05:40:08.808 --> 05:40:09.509]  I'm joking.
[05:40:09.509 --> 05:40:10.410]  I mean, you really need that.
[05:40:10.410 --> 05:40:14.374]  With a cabinet that we got and a president that's just hanging around
[05:40:14.983 --> 05:40:17.565]  Running some kind of an NCAA meeting?
[05:40:17.565 --> 05:40:18.326]  It's ridiculous.
[05:40:18.326 --> 05:40:19.748]  And I'll tell you another thing, he plays golf.
[05:40:19.748 --> 05:40:22.590]  I heard, what is it now, two or three months total out of his whole presidential
[05:40:36.863 --> 05:40:41.765]  Well, he's a teleprompter reading frontman, so what do you expect?
[05:40:41.765 --> 05:40:43.685]  David, we're out of time.
[05:40:43.685 --> 05:40:44.926]  There's the headline.
[05:40:44.926 --> 05:40:50.247]  What is that, MSNBC or ABC News?
[05:40:50.247 --> 05:40:51.187]  Yeah, it's NBC.
[05:40:51.187 --> 05:40:52.608]  I recognize the font.
[05:40:52.608 --> 05:40:56.609]  NBC reporting Surgeon General buying iodine a precaution.
[05:40:56.609 --> 05:40:59.650]  Conflicting messages appear in effort to buy iodine tablets.
[05:41:00.529 --> 05:41:06.451]  Well, we've got it confirmed that the government's telling people not to prescribe it to folks.
[05:41:06.451 --> 05:41:08.572]  It's not even prescription, but it's sold out of stores.
[05:41:08.572 --> 05:41:10.733]  You go to the clinic, say, I want it, and they go, no.
[05:41:10.733 --> 05:41:13.914]  Homeland Security says, no, no.
[05:41:13.914 --> 05:41:16.015]  So they can't even get their act straight on that.
[05:41:16.015 --> 05:41:19.256]  That's an important article we've got up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[05:41:19.256 --> 05:41:27.980]  Watson's big article is going to be coming out in the next hour, dealing with reactor rods, spent rods, plutonium, uranium on top
[05:41:29.500 --> 05:41:32.862]  Go ahead and take us out, boys and girls.
[05:41:32.862 --> 05:41:39.187]  Those spent rods packed and stacked up on top the inner containment unit blowing sky high.
[05:41:39.187 --> 05:41:40.228]  We know they've caught on fire.
[05:41:40.228 --> 05:41:42.049]  We know they're stored at some of the others.
[05:41:42.049 --> 05:41:43.610]  Were they in Mark 1, Mark 3?
[05:41:43.610 --> 05:41:44.351]  We know they were in Mark 1.
[05:41:45.615 --> 05:41:59.834]  I mean, that's the huge news, that this happened, that this is going on, that this is unfolding, and they're still trying to play it down, when if those reactor rods were on the outside, we know they were at some of the plants, and were ejected in explosions.
[05:41:59.834 --> 05:42:02.678]  This is a super huge, horrible disaster.
[05:42:03.158 --> 05:42:08.860]  And people should be getting the warnings, and we should be getting ready here in the path of the jet stream.
[05:42:08.860 --> 05:42:11.381]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[05:42:11.381 --> 05:42:14.122]  Central Standard Time, live, covering this.
[05:42:14.122 --> 05:42:22.125]  If you want your friends and family to hear an in-depth, full analysis, the caller's perspectives, nuclear physicists and more, tell folks that you know to tune in tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[05:42:22.125 --> 05:42:26.126]  Central, and watch us at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com for the latest developments.
[05:42:26.126 --> 05:42:26.886]  Get that article.
[05:42:26.886 --> 05:42:28.287]  Watson's got it coming out in the next hour.
[05:42:28.687 --> 05:42:32.870]  We're gonna cut back into the retransmission with Key and Tell, so stay with us.
[05:42:58.280 --> 05:42:58.360]  Yeah.
