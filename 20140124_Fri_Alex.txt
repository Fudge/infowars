[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:43.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.000]  back there in the coffee room we've got different state-run media channels up in all the studios in
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.080]  the hallways in the writers offices we were monitoring C-SPAN CNN MSNBC Fox you name it and
[01:00.080 --> 01:08.680]  I barely made it back because Obama just ended his 15 8-minute speech just about two minutes ago
[01:08.680 --> 01:16.800]  on C-SPAN they were carrying it and he said the NSA agents are our neighbors and our friends
[01:16.800 --> 01:23.440]  even though panels admit that the program hasn't prevented any terrorist attacks and say that we
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.600]  are now a police state and spies want Edward Snowden dead that's from Buzzfeed we're gonna
[01:29.600 --> 01:35.680]  tie it all into the NSA takeover folks this is all illegal it has nothing to do with fighting
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.760]  terrorism it is all about dominating and controlling markets and society for select
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.600]  inside groups it is the total monopoly it is like all of us living in glass houses all
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.200]  the establishment is making everything they do more secret and they've got all these different
[01:53.200 --> 01:58.640]  people calling for Snowden's death and that's up on info wars dot com right now and what else
[01:58.640 --> 02:05.640]  is up on info wars dot com is just a mega important article that I've got Paul Watson joining us
[02:05.640 --> 02:15.360]  on at the start of the next segment from England from Albion from Britannia Watson will be joining
[02:15.360 --> 02:22.120]  us ladies and gentlemen the think tanks aren't just calling for Snowden to be killed this ties
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.120]  in to the article on Drudge where the spies won Edward Snowden dead the author of the
[02:28.120 --> 02:39.160]  shocking on doctrine Harlan K. Ulman has come out at an Atlantic Council meeting this is
[02:39.160 --> 02:42.280]  the guy that meets with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs the chairman and the other joint
[02:42.280 --> 02:50.160]  chiefs and called for eliminating quote and I tweeted this out of real Alex Jones non-state
[02:50.160 --> 02:57.080]  actors and empowered individuals and he said the state is failing the New World Order is
[02:57.080 --> 03:03.040]  failing it is failing by the way it's about ten years behind and it's still in the pole
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.360]  position but they got three laps to go fires coming out of the engine it's gonna blow it's
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.360]  gonna blow and I don't know if they can put up the dump you back together again they may
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.400]  be able to the nuclear war or something and that's what he said he said without a giant
[03:17.400 --> 03:24.080]  mega worldwide crisis they're done and they are they're done they're done so they're on
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.360]  the bridge of their ship it's on fire they're attacking the ship of liberty and if they're
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.760]  going to blow up they're going to blow us up that's basically what they're threatening
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.840]  to do they're holding us hostage like when you catch the bank robber and the cops come
[03:38.840 --> 03:41.800]  in and he grabs a woman and puts the gun to her head he says get back or I'll blow her
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.000]  head off I mean that's what they're doing right now and you know what I just we just
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.480]  exposed are the ones behind it and we say okay go ahead pull the trigger go ahead pull
[03:53.480 --> 03:59.160]  the trigger because there's going to be no mercy for you and yours when you do and you're
[03:59.160 --> 04:02.960]  not going to get away with this but when we tell them go ahead and pull the trigger they're
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.160]  going to pause for a moment and then we politically pull the trigger and they won't know what hit
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.200]  them you understand that go ahead pull the trigger right as they hesitate boom we pull
[04:13.200 --> 04:19.600]  the trigger politically but I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen they are getting ready
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.640]  and I don't know what false flags are going to pull but my spidey sense is pegging the
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.000]  meter everybody else who's got discernment got their head screwed on straight knows we

[08:42.120 --> 08:48.040]  phone sweeps the president's plan to limit the nsa's most controversial program will
[08:48.040 --> 08:57.560]  it be enough to calm privacy fears I love how the dinosaur media sits there while Obama
[08:57.560 --> 09:05.120]  and the other globalist front people run around denying the nsa sweeping up all the data denying
[09:05.120 --> 09:09.440]  that they're tracking everywhere you go and what you do denying they have plans to tax
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.760]  your car by the mile or the smart meters are dialing into all the hidden chips in all the
[09:14.760 --> 09:21.560]  new appliances to listen to you and watch you while they simultaneously make hundreds
[09:21.560 --> 09:30.520]  of billions of dollars a year just in western Europe the United States England Australia
[09:30.520 --> 09:35.320]  multinational corporations make over a hundred billion dollars a year conservatively getting
[09:35.320 --> 09:44.240]  paid by governments to spy and to run the spy networks and the entire infrastructure
[09:44.240 --> 09:51.840]  of the technotronic technological age since the nineteen seventies under the brzezinski
[09:51.840 --> 10:00.960]  plan has had backdoors tracker chips tracker wireless systems hidden cameras microphones
[10:00.960 --> 10:09.600]  built into it several orders worse than nineteen eighty four and it's all coming out now and
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.080]  they're still busy going oh we don't troll all the email we don't troll all the phone
[10:14.080 --> 10:19.040]  data we're not and then of course it comes out there they are so they'll focus in on
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.120]  one area of a program where they intercepted a hundred thousand plus packages of people
[10:24.120 --> 10:31.520]  having computers mail to them from apple microsoft you name it when the government puts a surveillance
[10:31.520 --> 10:38.760]  chip that transmits everything back to them in your computer that is the tip of the tip
[10:38.760 --> 10:46.400]  of the tip of the iceberg all the major computers and quote smartphones for over a decade have
[10:46.400 --> 10:55.120]  capacitor chips that can be activated by remote control and powered by outside microwaves period
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.880]  that's patented that's in the computers we've written articles a year ago listing the chips
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.840]  that do it now that all broke on monday and the new york times is patting themselves on
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.600]  the back for telling you they saw a snowflake falling in the north atlantic well meanwhile
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.360]  we're in the middle of a giant iceberg field and they're saying you know we're breaking
[11:14.360 --> 11:21.040]  some news that there might be some frozen ice around here this is ridiculous and they're
[11:21.040 --> 11:29.120]  only doing this because they become so passé they become so dinosaur they become so absolutely
[11:29.120 --> 11:37.280]  discredited they know all of this they know what's going on they know the system a bipartisan
[11:37.280 --> 11:44.640]  global long-term strategic program to roll out what they call the technocracy for the
[11:44.640 --> 11:53.680]  quote scientific autocratic global rule of a leech to quote Zbigniew Brzezinski I call
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.080]  it the scientific dictatorship and then they talk to you like your children and go there's
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.200]  none of that happening why there was another huffington post article out yesterday that
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.240]  I never mentioned it's for the GOP unabyss instead of ideas and they say many of the
[12:11.240 --> 12:15.480]  ideas or media matters put this out last week so the huffington post everybody's picking
[12:15.480 --> 12:22.720]  it up salon all of government run grapes government fellow travelers jones claims the government's
[12:22.720 --> 12:28.520]  buying armored vehicles and bullets and preparing for civil unrest he's and they just say he's
[12:28.520 --> 12:36.200]  discredited and it's not true that's like saying it's not 1112 central as we broadcast
[12:36.200 --> 12:42.240]  live and then I don't give you any proof I mean of course it is 1112 central am from
[12:42.240 --> 12:46.960]  austin texas is where I come to but it's just like no no alex jones wasn't on the air at
[12:46.960 --> 12:56.760]  1112 central on the 17th day of january 2014 in fact it's not even 2014 right now that's
[12:56.760 --> 13:01.480]  just discredited as well in fact there's not even a planet earth that you don't even exist
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.480]  all this is a dream none of it's real all there is this big brother in obama or your
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.760]  racist and the health care plan doesn't kick you off your doctor and doesn't raise any
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.360]  premiums and that's a conspiracy theory if you say it does and then well ok obama you
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.560]  said it wouldn't do this but now it does I never said that see that's right there's
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.000]  no drones there's no bullets there's no armored vehicles there's no black uniforms there's
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.800]  no nsa there's no war it's only peace he got a piece right here's box news channel thanks
[13:29.800 --> 13:37.760]  for taking my question will you taught data center hold the data of american citizens
[13:37.760 --> 13:46.480]  no that's a clapper head of cyber security who also told congress along with alexander
[13:46.480 --> 13:54.240]  and others that that we're not spying on anyone there's no surveillance we hold no data I mean
[13:54.240 --> 14:01.400]  it's just it's not happening conspiracy theorist and again they have the huffington post come
[14:01.400 --> 14:08.480]  out and literally say oh my gosh the republicans listen to alex jones oh they're so discredited
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.040]  oh no alex jones says the federal reserve's private alex jones says he's called his unit
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.880]  21 takeover with the health care to create death panels and cut the quality of care and
[14:16.880 --> 14:21.320]  bring in total social control and alex jones says there's a cloud and pivot plan to bankrupt
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.760]  the nation to socialize us to alex jones said and of course it's all true so so so what
[14:26.760 --> 14:33.000]  do we do I mean it's scary there's all these libertarians and freedom lovers they're listening
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.640]  to alex jones and and he's discredited he's discredited because we said because we have
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.600]  the moral authority we're in charge and you do what we say so you don't lose your doctor
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.200]  none of your health care premiums one up even though they're doubling tripling and by the
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.840]  way obama never promised they wouldn't so they went up but they didn't and obama promised
[14:54.840 --> 14:59.280]  they wouldn't but it's a conspiracy you ever said that so he never did you understand that
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.960]  good i'm glad you understand that now okay now drink your fluoride take your vaccines
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.680]  eat your gmo's and roll over and watch the television and get Alzheimer's and die okay
[15:10.680 --> 15:16.840]  how's that sound so here's the huge news ladies and gentlemen and i'm gonna get into all the
[15:16.840 --> 15:22.200]  rest of it this is so mega massive in the backdrop of obama saying quote calm down these
[15:22.200 --> 15:27.120]  agents are our neighbors and our friends of course the nsa didn't exist it wasn't spying
[15:27.120 --> 15:33.480]  on you illegally now that's all come out so they're like we come in peace we're your
[15:33.480 --> 15:38.440]  friends they're just hands down that's just handing those guns you know are you sure your
[15:38.440 --> 15:41.880]  neighbors are being trained to spy on you that's freedom we're like well this sounds
[15:41.880 --> 15:46.920]  like every other authoritarian regime now those don't exist and yes the olympic committee
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.880]  has banned a hockey goalie designing her own helmet as others are allowed to do that says
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.520]  we the people on it that's bad propaganda because bill Ayers was in austin last night
[15:56.520 --> 16:00.880]  our reporters confronted him we're gonna air that in the third hour today and he was saying
[16:00.880 --> 16:06.200]  i'm an anarchist i'm against government but we need total government for anarchy no what
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.000]  he is is a total foundation elitist by the mega banks to train the general public that
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.320]  revolution against tyranny is through collectivism when it's the opposite that simple liberty
[16:18.320 --> 16:23.400]  develops unlimited wealth collectivism delivers unlimited poverty and pain and suffering and
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.080]  unfairness and inequity and injustice and you know that history shows that now here is
[16:28.080 --> 16:38.760]  the mega massive breaking news on info wars dot com american spies want edward snowton
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.320]  dead they're all over the news constantly saying he's the number one enemy he needs to
[16:43.320 --> 16:52.960]  be killed he needs to be murdered he needs to be executed for releasing documented absolutely
[16:52.960 --> 17:01.440]  documented real information about a total takeover now that article is up on info wars
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.280]  dot com right now american spies when edward snowton dead i would love to put a bullet
[17:06.280 --> 17:10.360]  in his head one thing i got official told buzzfeed the nsa leaker is enemy number one
[17:10.360 --> 17:15.880]  among those inside the intelligence world yeah because he's exposing your criminal activities
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.520]  now let's move to the top story here and we're gonna go to break and come back to paul watson
[17:19.520 --> 17:31.200]  from england think tank extraordinary crisis needed to preserve new world order author
[17:31.200 --> 17:38.720]  of shock and awe doctrine says elite threatened by non-state actors like edward snowton he
[17:38.720 --> 17:48.720]  goes on to say quote the elimination of non-state actors and empowered individuals quote must
[17:48.720 --> 17:56.400]  be done now now listen empowered individuals are the enemy of the state and he says in
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.240]  this a public journal war on terror is not the only threat get it war on terror no no
[18:01.240 --> 18:06.280]  no now the terror is now the threat is an al-qaeda that these people openly run no no no now
[18:06.280 --> 18:12.840]  it's empowered individuals what it presents he said the council on fine relations in canada
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.800]  a couple years ago we're gonna play the clip coming up he said the whole world is awakening
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.760]  politically for the first time in history it's over for the elite we cannot do this
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.120]  it's cheaper to kill a million people than to use propaganda to control them and he went
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.160]  on to say that word for word in his book that came out last year so now rosinski's at the
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.040]  top of the food chain when it comes to actual planners he shaped our world more the last
[18:37.040 --> 18:42.480]  40 years than probably anybody else the elite have adopted his particular stratagem and
[18:42.480 --> 18:48.120]  strategies in this overall program so we better study the people that run things omen
[18:48.120 --> 18:53.680]  is is an acolyte of this guy and is implementing the same plan he developed shock and awe current
[18:53.680 --> 19:02.480]  strategies for a new world order and he's saying we need to kill empowered individuals
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.920]  we need to kill people that are criticizing the state he says in here those that are disc
[19:07.920 --> 19:13.840]  crediting and he goes on to say the new world order is failing in its governance you are

[25:03.600 --> 25:10.560]  and part of the next i i cannot state to you how big a deal this is when you read what
[25:10.560 --> 25:21.440]  brzezinski has to say and you read what other globalists are saying it is simply amazing
[25:21.440 --> 25:25.960]  that they are openly saying hey the war on terror is not really what we're worried about
[25:25.960 --> 25:32.640]  now it's the war on quote empowered individuals and non-state actors so he says we got to
[25:32.640 --> 25:39.000]  take out people like snowden but also empowered individuals i have the quotes here there why
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  the state is failing because we won't just give up all our rights and be slaves to these
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.880]  guys and it just shows how disconnected from reality are that we're just going to roll
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.920]  over just because they've gotten the majority of people to roll over into a trance watching
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.400]  television and all the rest of it not everyone has slipped into unconsciousness most people
[25:59.400 --> 26:04.320]  that i know are waking up and they're waking up fast they're waking up to more and more
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.120]  every minute but this story should be red linked that's up on info wars dot com and quite
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.480]  frankly polls a better writer than i am a better researcher but but i would have the
[26:14.480 --> 26:24.440]  headline saying you know top government strategist take out empowered individuals i mean this
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.600]  is a declaration of war and i love how they're always on the news going let's kill snowden
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.200]  he's a trader know the people funding al-qaeda through our government or traders the people
[26:34.200 --> 26:39.040]  spying on the tea party and gun owners and christian groups and try to take their 501
[26:39.040 --> 26:43.840]  c3 you're the authoritarians and you know you are that's the thing they know they're
[26:43.840 --> 26:51.400]  taking over this is a gang takeover this is a foreign spy corporate espionage infiltration
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.400]  but that isn't rhetoric these are people in the pentagon teaching that the bill of rights
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.320]  is bad because it stands in the way of their criminal operations and this is the 53rd anniversary
[27:02.320 --> 27:11.200]  of eisenhower's farewell address in 1961 i'm going to play the entire 15 minute address
[27:11.200 --> 27:14.960]  at the bottom of the next hour i'm gonna play later in this hour the clip where he says
[27:14.960 --> 27:21.880]  we're in danger of a technocratic elite that controls the military industrial complex totally
[27:21.880 --> 27:25.480]  taking over our civilization and creating a breakaway society that's because he was
[27:25.480 --> 27:29.960]  brought in on the plans and didn't like him he refused to stage false flags to start a
[27:29.960 --> 27:36.440]  war with russia he refused operation northwood before kennedy did so this is the real world
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.200]  okay we've been seized by criminals they're illegitimate they're in a race to impoverish
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.120]  us and break us politically to complete our journey into slavery where that one of the
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.200]  only countries that haven't been disarmed they're coming we're the enemy foreign globalists
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.160]  are occupying us face the facts now paul watson we got two minutes before break you're gonna
[27:55.160 --> 27:59.120]  come back and expand and we're going to read some of these clips of these quotes and place
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.480]  some clips of brzezinski and others saying basically the same thing but this is serious
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.680]  when brzezinski says it's cheaper to kill a million people than to convince them now
[28:08.680 --> 28:14.880]  no one believes us time to start killing and this guy is basically saying the same thing
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.280]  well this is a trend alex that we've been tracking since around 2010 when brzezinski
[28:20.280 --> 28:25.240]  gave that speech to the cfr where he said that you know there's a global political
[28:25.240 --> 28:31.360]  awakening taking taking place the infighting is amongst the elite because we've got people
[28:31.360 --> 28:38.520]  on the inside who are on our side and now this article comes out of the atlantic council
[28:38.520 --> 28:43.520]  which if you look into the background of that group is basically a revolving door to the
[28:43.520 --> 28:49.840]  obama administration uh james l jones was the former chairman he stepped down to become
[28:49.840 --> 28:57.520]  obama's national security advisor numerous other major players in the obama administration
[28:57.520 --> 29:04.240]  susan rice richard holbrook chuck haigle the current defense secretary uh were were a part
[29:04.240 --> 29:09.880]  or are still a part of this think tank the atlantic council and this article came out
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.960]  a few months ago but it basically got no attention whatsoever and as you said it's on a similar
[29:14.960 --> 29:19.880]  theme to the brzezinski speech he basically says that and this is the author of shock
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.080]  and awe the military doctor doctor who's writing this article he basically says that we need
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.920]  a new extraordinary crisis to preserve the new world order because it's being completely
[29:31.920 --> 29:38.960]  undermined by non-state actors like edward snowden and he actually dismisses the threat
[29:38.960 --> 29:44.840]  to the new world order from superpowers like china and says that it's all coming from non-state
[29:44.840 --> 29:50.840]  actors and self-empowered individuals that's right it is the individual we're on the march
[29:50.840 --> 30:00.200]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:43.800 --> 33:50.000]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you again so much for joining us think about
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.600]  it you've got the big number is asking we're going to give you this quote coming up in
[33:53.600 --> 33:58.680]  his book last year where he said it's easier to kill a million people now than to convince
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.440]  a million people you've got him a few years ago at the council on foreign relations on
[34:03.440 --> 34:10.920]  c span saying that the state is losing people are awakening worldwide and then now you've
[34:10.920 --> 34:17.200]  got all these other globalists coming out including top technocrats that advise the security
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.640]  council at the UN that advise the national security council that actually runs this
[34:22.640 --> 34:32.360]  country that are setting up a COG continuity of government coup d'etat program against
[34:32.360 --> 34:39.160]  humanity and they are setting up this program and then you using the threat of terrorism
[34:39.160 --> 34:46.080]  as the pretext to take our liberties and then the article up on info wars.com think tank
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.960]  extraordinary crisis needed to preserve new world order that's a quote and I read from
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.240]  Robert Shapiro advising Obama in the financial times of London yesterday I read that quote
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.280]  on on air where he said we need major terror attacks so we can take over that's how dumb
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.080]  they think you are in newspapers they admit they're using this to take over and pick winners
[35:09.080 --> 35:13.840]  and losers and spy on everyone and give the data to select corporations and Obama is going
[35:13.840 --> 35:18.360]  to save us and getting rid of the borders and coming after our guns and the state saying
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.800]  our kids belong to them and teaching five year olds about homosexuality they shouldn't
[35:22.800 --> 35:28.200]  be teaching about heterosexuality the state is a bunch of crazy people that want to be
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.480]  empowered to run our lives and I'm not saying everybody in the state is but the people that
[35:32.480 --> 35:38.600]  run the state apparatus and the media apparatus are very very dangerous anti humans engaged
[35:38.600 --> 35:44.120]  in major social engineering so Paul Watson joins us to read over this article and give
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.600]  us his take on it but here they are saying you know the good news is their programs
[35:48.600 --> 35:53.160]  and trouble people are waking up to them the bad news is they're saying we need to kill
[35:53.160 --> 35:59.960]  non-state actors like Edward Snowden we need to also take out we need to take out and get
[35:59.960 --> 36:08.120]  rid of eliminates the word empowered individuals who know the globalist retirees who are conscious
[36:08.120 --> 36:12.800]  who is empowered people that know what's going on and who are instinctively threatened
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.680]  by it and won't go along with it this shows we're in the fight this shows the huge effect
[36:18.680 --> 36:28.200]  that we can have this shows what we can do this shows the power of humanity but it also
[36:28.200 --> 36:33.640]  shows we're right there at the edge here we're in the fight we could win this but folks have
[36:33.640 --> 36:39.800]  to admit how much danger we're in that the global governance heads are saying the enemy
[36:39.800 --> 36:44.040]  is libertarians that's what Edward Snowden is the enemy is empowered individuals the
[36:44.040 --> 36:50.360]  enemy is Thomas Jefferson the enemy is George Washington the enemy is 1776 worldwide the
[36:50.360 --> 36:54.560]  enemy isn't communist China the globalists run and work with a bunch of you know fellow
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.360]  communists and killers and psychopaths and monopoly men the enemy is in North Korea it's
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.240]  not Germany it's not all the corrupt ruling elites they can all get together and meet
[37:05.240 --> 37:09.760]  and decide you know new criminal operations against humanity their enemy is the individual
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.560]  standing up and saying no and the individual linking up with other individuals and collectively
[37:15.560 --> 37:21.240]  as individuals saying we recognize your illegitimate criminals we withdraw our consent we withdraw
[37:21.240 --> 37:25.280]  our support you're not going to build your technocracy we're aware of it we're going
[37:25.280 --> 37:31.880]  to dismantle it you've declared war on us we declare survival on you we're not declaring
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.720]  war on you we're declaring that we aren't slaves we have an alienable rights we run
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.200]  up the flag of liberty and we do not submit we do not comply we are awake we are conscious
[37:42.200 --> 37:48.280]  you people are declaring war on yourselves you are mentally ill power drunk out of control
[37:48.280 --> 37:54.320]  playing God with your technological elite as Eisenhower said and we are not going to
[37:54.320 --> 38:01.520]  put up with it anymore now let's go to Paul Watson Paul Watson break it down well Alex
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.920]  I see this as an incredibly positive development because you know in his editorial for the
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.320]  Atlantic Council Allman states quote very few have taken no and fewer have acted on
[38:13.320 --> 38:19.480]  this realization the realization that empowered individuals are the major threat to the power
[38:19.480 --> 38:27.680]  elite quote information revolution and instantaneous global communications that's what he identifies
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.200]  as the major threat he's talking about the internet of course Hillary Clinton a couple
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.320]  of years ago said that quote we're losing the info war that's what it's all about the
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.160]  info war they don't even realize that they're losing it you know these guys in these think
[38:42.160 --> 38:48.040]  tanks are in their 60s and 70s their years and years behind suddenly they're starting
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.240]  to realize that they're losing the ideological battle and it's starting to cost them because
[38:53.240 --> 38:59.980]  as I said before people on the inside and out on our side you know Edward Snowden Bradley
[38:59.980 --> 39:06.360]  Manning the entire collective hacktivist organizations that have sprung off from them
[39:06.360 --> 39:10.040]  were winning the information war and they're in a blind panic because it's undermining
[39:10.040 --> 39:15.320]  their system which is emphasized by what happened last year with Syria when you know the military
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.360]  generals went to Obama and basically basically said what the hell are you doing this is not
[39:20.360 --> 39:26.440]  going to wash and it prevented that attack so the info war which they now lament is actually
[39:26.440 --> 39:32.360]  having a very real direct effect on their actions and it's preventing them from carrying
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.840]  through this quote new world order which they identify in this article and they define the
[39:38.840 --> 39:43.440]  new world order if you read their other writings on the Atlantic Council website which again
[39:43.440 --> 39:49.680]  is a major think tank NATO heads have heralded it as hugely influential it's a revolving
[39:49.680 --> 39:54.880]  door to the Obama administration they define the new world order as a global technocracy
[39:54.880 --> 40:01.560]  run by basically corporate fascism the fusion of big government and big business and Skowcroft
[40:01.560 --> 40:08.360]  particularly talks about their ultimate agenda being a transhumanist singularity that will
[40:08.360 --> 40:14.840]  replace individuality so that's how they plan on eliminating self empowered individuals
[40:14.840 --> 40:20.240]  by moving towards this transhumanism so now they're in a blind panic that people have suddenly
[40:20.240 --> 40:25.560]  started to wake up and realize that this is what's been going on all along the years and
[40:25.560 --> 40:31.920]  years behind so now they're saying well we need a new crisis a new 9 11 style event we
[40:31.920 --> 40:37.240]  know where we heard that before project for a new American century in 1997 to get this
[40:37.240 --> 40:44.760]  all back on track to re-enrich the state with carte blanche power to do what it likes for
[40:44.760 --> 40:51.920]  the president to have 80 90% approval ratings like Bush had after 9 11 to get this executive
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.640]  dictatorship through so now they're starting to lament it and starting to realize that
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.960]  they may need to stage certain crises to get it all back on track and let's be clear the
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.360]  council on foreign relations heart rudman committee 10 months before 9 11 issued a report
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.000]  calling for giant catalyzing events just as the PNAC report 12 months before 9 11 called
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.640]  for a catalyzing Pearl Harbor event with 3000 dead incredible how they could say 3000 dead
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.480]  and that's what died unbelievable and then it magically happens they are now making the
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.720]  announcement across the board to their operatives hitting the panic switch to begin the new false
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.320]  flag and you see him said going saying it's not al-qaeda now in his quotes we're going
[41:35.320 --> 41:42.480]  to read some of these now it's domestic empowered individuals so as I've said folks in the last
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.160]  few years you can see all the scripting and the TV the movies preparing the public or
[41:47.160 --> 41:52.360]  the militia releases a bio weapon the militia nukes a city working with al-qaeda totally
[41:52.360 --> 41:58.360]  ridiculous saying the tea party works with al-qaeda in pentagon training manuals where
[41:58.360 --> 42:03.280]  they invade North Carolina that got leaked last year and people say well that doesn't
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.120]  make sense the tea party is Islamophobic it doesn't matter they will nuke a city and
[42:08.120 --> 42:12.960]  they will have some drugged up militia guy with a drugged up al-qaeda guy and they'll
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.840]  have been electro shocked and don't even know who they are to get up on TV and say yeah
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.880]  I did it these guys have probably been you know six months in a torture dungeon then
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.560]  they'll later kill them bring out body doubles I mean that's the kind of stuff they do in
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.920]  these operations they will nuke a city they will release a bio weapon I'm telling you
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.120]  they will do one of those two things or they will nerve gas a football game I'm telling
[42:35.120 --> 42:40.640]  you something big in fact I think to really bring us to our knees I think they're gonna
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.840]  nuke a city I mean I just cannot believe I'm on air talking about this I cannot believe
[42:44.840 --> 42:48.680]  it's this real I cannot believe I'm not even afraid of being killed and I'm not saying
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.800]  I'm a hero here folks I'm just telling you you better know nobody else gets it like we
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.440]  do nobody else will hardcore go up against the enemy and I hope you realize as listeners
[42:57.440 --> 43:01.880]  this shows we're in the game the fact that so many people in military are awake the fact
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.240]  that so many media people behind the scenes are awake the fact that more and more media
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.520]  people in the mainstream are leaking what they can telling me off record hey I've been
[43:10.520 --> 43:15.040]  sent here by you know AP or Reuters do a hit piece on you but I'm not going to I've been
[43:15.040 --> 43:19.160]  sent here by hey we all know what's going on you know the revolution's coming it's all
[43:19.160 --> 43:23.680]  gonna come down they know behind the scenes they've lost the military they're losing the
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.400]  media they're losing conservatives they're losing liberals and they want us all in fight
[43:28.400 --> 43:33.200]  they may stage a race war or something I don't know but I don't think that's enough for them
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.800]  they are in a desperate situation if you read his quotes on info wars dot com right now in
[43:37.800 --> 43:43.080]  this article he says the new world order is done global governance is failing if they
[43:43.080 --> 43:48.760]  don't have a giant crisis like a new war or a terror attack and the Chinese behind the
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.800]  scenes are working with these people the Chinese chai comms they may let them attack that Philippine
[43:53.800 --> 43:57.640]  island or one of those other islands off Japan as the Chinese say they're getting ready to
[43:57.640 --> 44:04.440]  do and even have a limited exchange between ships and and have a real war but not nuke
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.440]  each other and then have a big fake peace deal that's the governments have done this
[44:08.440 --> 44:14.760]  I've read stuff from 600 years ago 700 years ago where you'd have 50 year 20 year 100 year
[44:14.760 --> 44:20.240]  wars between France and England and they'd be you know the the British royalty was really
[44:20.240 --> 44:25.280]  at that time Norman Viking slash French and they would say I'm having uprisings cousin
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.720]  to the other king we're going to invade it Brittany again and then you let us have some
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.640]  area then we'll let you invade we need to kill off some peasants and cause a distraction
[44:34.640 --> 44:41.440]  knowing the uprisings in England and France would stop if they could get each other fighting
[44:41.440 --> 44:46.440]  so these were hereditary cousins and these are public letters now many of these are
[44:46.440 --> 44:50.960]  famous you can pull them up they're online doing this so they're making deals with China
[44:50.960 --> 44:56.360]  I believe to have a limited staged police action war which could get out of hand quite
[44:56.360 --> 45:01.040]  easily the war with Russia is real from everything I've seen the move in the missiles in trying
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.200]  to destabilize Russia trying to do all that stuff but I'm telling you that could be the
[45:05.200 --> 45:10.320]  false flag it could be a nuke going off and that's why I'm so concerned because they're
[45:10.320 --> 45:17.120]  losing the info war in their own words we are absolutely turbo charging at every level
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.120]  over the enemy right now we're now getting into their main command bases if you would
[45:21.120 --> 45:26.640]  use this in a two-dimensional classical battlefield scenario we are about to route their general
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.680]  staff we're about to take out the command structure we are engaged in an information
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.360]  war you know during the Cold War we did a great job in getting America's message out
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.720]  after the Berlin Wall fell we said okay fine enough of that you know we've done it we're
[45:41.720 --> 45:48.560]  done and unfortunately we are paying a big price for it and our our private media cannot
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.920]  fill that there you go so now what are they doing they're coming out with fake foundation
[45:52.920 --> 45:56.320]  alternative media they're activating their operatives and alternative media to start
[45:56.320 --> 46:00.960]  infighting and lies you're going to see all hell breakless before they physically kill
[46:00.960 --> 46:05.960]  me they will plant stories make stuff up you name it they'll do it to other people but
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.640]  we now have the moral high ground and we have so many people in the FBI NSA CIA Defense Intelligence
[46:12.640 --> 46:19.200]  Marine Corps Army Air Force private corporations our people are everywhere when they stage an
[46:19.200 --> 46:24.600]  underwear bombing we within two days have the lawyer on who saw it all staged and then
[46:24.600 --> 46:31.680]  later it all comes out the CIA ran it we have Q met organic true operatives that are the
[46:31.680 --> 46:38.320]  organic battle response of a free nation in our forebearers worldwide not just in America
[46:38.320 --> 46:45.120]  there is an organic autoimmune response to a takeover like this we are the organic military
[46:45.120 --> 46:51.000]  cultural response we are in a war ladies and gentlemen this is it and we are literally
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.840]  in a battle with these guys and we're all bleeding but we're in the fight we're getting
[46:55.840 --> 47:01.240]  the initiative the enemy is losing strength they've got wounds all over them we're about
[47:01.240 --> 47:07.920]  to win and I'm telling you I'm telling you they're going to pull out all the stops because
[47:07.920 --> 47:12.640]  we've already begun to one to win that now Watson I'm ranting but I just played that
[47:12.640 --> 47:17.280]  clip we got a Brzezinski clip coming up but when I read these these quotes this morning
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.440]  and I went and found some c-span footage of him saying similar things I mean it is chilling
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.760]  why do you think they operate with a with like a thinly veiled Bible page thick veil of not
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.280]  being obvious that they're going to stage stuff I mean is that to normalize it in front
[47:32.280 --> 47:37.680]  of the the ruling class and all the minions so they feel confident in the criminal actions
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.080]  that that they would openly say stuff like this in major public journals and they're
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.920]  all saying it in unison now I mean why do you think they're so public about it well
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.400]  because they own the media Alex and they can rely on the mass media not to cover it and
[47:52.400 --> 47:59.080]  they know that 99.9% of the American people are not going to read think tank websites
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.600]  where they openly talk about this stuff but more and more people are which is why they're
[48:03.600 --> 48:10.800]  starting to panic about it you know the political class needs to create and maintain this irrational
[48:10.800 --> 48:17.480]  world it's like what the Saxo CEO talked about last week so they need to stage crises to
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.400]  maintain that irrational world because they only remain relevant in an irrational world
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.000]  and using that irrationality they can then blame us for the terror attack which is apparently
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.120]  coming because we opposed NSA surveillance and that was necessary to prevent the terror
[48:33.120 --> 48:40.440]  attack you just you know played Hillary Clinton claiming victory for the Cold War and Angela
[48:40.440 --> 48:47.360]  Merkel the German Chancellor who had her mobile phone spied on by the NSA compared the NSA
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.760]  to the Stasi who were of course on the opposite side in the Cold War and now Obama today I'm
[48:53.760 --> 48:59.520]  just reading says that the United States is not spying on ordinary people this applies
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.800]  to foreign leaders as well again that's a blatant lie it came out that they were spying
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.320]  on Angela Merkel's cell phone and he says you know these are your friends and neighbors
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.680]  well yeah they're your friends and neighbors that are spying on quote love interests that
[49:15.680 --> 49:21.160]  came out in the Wall Street Journal I actually have a name for it called Love Int where these
[49:21.160 --> 49:27.320]  NSA analysts go in and read their ex-girlfriend's email to see what they're doing in the private
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.760]  life so lie piled upon lie upon lie and they don't care anymore they're just brazenly lying
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.880]  in public because again they think they insult our intelligence and think the American people
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.560]  are stupid but they're gonna have this crisis and they're gonna blame it on people who opposed
[49:42.560 --> 49:47.960]  NSA surveillance and they say they say the threat is no longer a foreign terrorist it
[49:47.960 --> 49:53.000]  is empowered individuals that need to be eliminated so they're going to stage a domestic attack
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.720]  and blame it on the Liberty Movement because we are the resistance and they say we're a
[49:56.720 --> 50:03.120]  bigger threat than China and you know what we are because the globalist help run China
[50:03.120 --> 50:08.720]  the globalist are in bed without other criminal group and then Obama says if only you'd have
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.680]  let us collect this metadata without complaining we'd have identified the Al Qaeda hijackers
[50:13.680 --> 50:19.560]  they were living with FBI agents the CIA was tracking them in and out of Malaysia a year
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.920]  before the attack they knew the hijackers they trained the hijackers so then Obama comes
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.760]  out with this ball about if only you'd have not complained about this you know if we'd
[50:28.760 --> 50:34.720]  have had this tool back in the year 2000 we'd have stopped 9 11 complete baloney on the
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.760]  face well we've had Edmunds who was there listening to the 9 11 communicates with the
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.280]  CIA groups were running Al Qaeda protecting him from the army that was set to kill bin

[54:52.720 --> 54:56.600]  america and the crisis of global power and in the book i went and bought it and read
[54:56.600 --> 55:01.280]  it he he says the patriot movement worldwide of just people that want to be free are the
[55:01.280 --> 55:09.920]  enemy so so this is a organized governmental system that says quote empowered individuals
[55:09.920 --> 55:13.400]  are the enemy they've already taken over national sovereignty worldwide they're mopping up a
[55:13.400 --> 55:19.520]  few countries now it's the individual and then you look at who runs this and you know
[55:19.520 --> 55:24.080]  the average people out there are good or moral or hardworking there's so many good professionals
[55:24.080 --> 55:30.160]  in this country doctors lawyers police officers school teachers factory owners business people
[55:30.160 --> 55:36.760]  i mean the artist i mean the list goes on and on service folks there's so many good people
[55:36.760 --> 55:41.600]  but we just seed control to guys in suits that land in helicopters and have red carpets
[55:41.600 --> 55:47.680]  because you know they're on red carpets they must be good guys well president eisenhower
[55:47.680 --> 55:54.920]  53 years ago today said beware the technocratic technological elite getting control and we're
[55:54.920 --> 55:57.280]  going to play that entire speech coming up at the bottom of the hour i'm going to be
[55:57.280 --> 56:01.880]  talking over it adding points so it's very very important to understand that but this
[56:01.880 --> 56:08.160]  is so huge folks you should go read the quotes for yourself on info wars dot com i know it's
[56:08.160 --> 56:11.880]  not you know the latest justin beaver stuff your new listener but this is a guy that
[56:11.880 --> 56:18.800]  advises the national security council that runs things that are busy purging a military
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.920]  preparing for war domestically their own training manuals preparing for treason preparing for
[56:22.920 --> 56:29.080]  hot coup preparing for a purge of the american people preparing for civil war i mean we're
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.040]  talking about just hellish stuff when they finally dropped the hammer and implode the
[56:33.040 --> 56:36.720]  economy completely they're going to stage terror attacks they're going to blame it on
[56:36.720 --> 56:39.640]  us they're going to come after anybody that criticizes them and folks if you roll over
[56:39.640 --> 56:45.320]  to them they win i mean these people are so bad and they lie to you openly like obama
[56:45.320 --> 56:55.280]  just did for an hour and olman again for the atlantic council he says without an extraordinary
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.680]  crisis little is likely to be done to reverse the limit reverse or limit the damage imposed
[57:00.680 --> 57:05.560]  by failed or failing governance writes olman implying that only under 911 style cataclysm
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.360]  will enable the state to research dominance while containing reducing and eliminating
[57:09.360 --> 57:14.480]  the dangers posed by newly empowered non-state actors he goes on to say this is the only
[57:14.480 --> 57:20.880]  way to secure a new world order and that the quote must be done and then he goes on to
[57:20.880 --> 57:28.040]  say we must also eliminate empowered individuals i mean what's and i can't think of a more
[57:28.040 --> 57:33.760]  creepy open declaration of war i mean these people indict themselves publicly what's
[57:33.760 --> 57:40.240]  another key point well we've seen the move to demonize patriots to terrorists but what's
[57:40.240 --> 57:46.880]  amazing now is that this has just gone up on info wars dot com obama is now associating
[57:46.880 --> 57:52.640]  himself with the founding fathers and saying that people who oppose nsa surveillance are
[57:52.640 --> 57:58.120]  basically anti-american and anti-patriotic he said quote at the dawn of our republic
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.080]  a small secret surveillance committee born out of the sons of liberty was established
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.860]  in boston the groups members included paul revere and at night they would patrol the
[58:06.860 --> 58:11.080]  streets reporting back any signs that the british were preparing raids against america's
[58:11.080 --> 58:18.680]  early patriots i think i woke up in the twilight zone he's actually comparing warrantless mass
[58:18.680 --> 58:25.400]  nsa surveillance of innocent american people to the founding fathers of america and what
[58:25.400 --> 58:33.680]  they did yeah they were spying on an invading occupying army of their fellow countrymen
[58:33.680 --> 58:40.920]  because they declared a new country oh this is unbelievable stay there i gotta talk more
[58:40.920 --> 58:50.240]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[58:50.240 --> 58:55.520]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[58:55.520 --> 59:01.560]  the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else
[59:01.560 --> 59:07.360]  is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal
[59:07.360 --> 59:13.160]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[59:13.160 --> 59:19.400]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point
[59:19.400 --> 59:25.000]  iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine

[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:18.120]  want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:31.160]  austin texas alex jones i cannot believe it it just went up on info wars dot com by steve
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:42.320]  watson paul watson's brother absolutely incredible to see this obama justifies nsa spying paul
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.440]  revered it first yeah military spying on military movements not peeping through the windows
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.840]  or stealing the mail of all the colonists argues us is always offended freedom through
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.800]  surveillance but you're not defending freedom you're butchering the entire bill of rights
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:05.280]  and constitution absolutely off the charts insane watson i've been ranting here you
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.400]  got four minutes in the short segment you've got the floor to talk more about the incredible
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.400]  news that we've been breaking where top atlantic council advisors the national security council
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.160]  call for huge catalyzing terror attacks in america as a pretext to go after the liberty
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:26.640]  movement and quote empowered individuals well yeah just on that last point i mean rend paul
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.400]  immediately came out and said paul revere was warning us that the british were coming
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.960]  it wasn't warning us that the americans were coming and even the washington post completely
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.280]  ripped it apart saying if the british redcoats had access to the type of metadata and processing
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.120]  power the nsa does today revere probably would have been caught before he could go on his
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.400]  legendary midnight ride indeed revere would have been outed as a terrorist so even the
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.480]  washington post is completely eviscerating this lewdick that's what i'm saying everyone's
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.880]  realizing they're a bunch of lying crooks who are going to wreck everything people are
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.760]  not going to play ball with us anymore that's what i'm saying and that's why they're going
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.600]  to nuke a major city in blaming honest paul i'm telling you it's the only move they've
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.120]  got or start war or something what do you think they're going to do i think the buildup
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:19.600]  of rusher and china which we've been closely tracking over the past three to six months
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.840]  definitely indicates that there's some kind of conflict two or three years down the road
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.840]  i mean china has been bellicose in its threats they actually put out a map of u s major u
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:37.400]  s cities saying what the effect would be if each one was nuked by their pl a submarine
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.240]  force they've been talking about invading islands china just came out with their first
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:52.200]  major aircraft carrier they put out a an image to go along with their lunar rover program
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.400]  which depicted a mushroom cloud over europe and this is all while they're in their own
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.360]  state media saying about how they could attack america and win a war and a lot of the chinese
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.160]  media is talking about when this war is going to take place and the fact that china is going
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:13.120]  to win it because america is basically going the way of rusher it's collapsing into complete
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.960]  nothingness and that china is the the emerging military power so it seems you know that's
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.920]  the way we're heading also they've got this ace card of the catalyzing event which you
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.040]  talked about but i think the the positive thing is the fact that the political class
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.520]  which as i said before relies on creating an irrational world through these manufactured
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:43.800]  false flags and crises is shrinking because more and more people on the inside as proven
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:50.240]  by the derailment of the attack on syria last year more and more people on the inside are
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.840]  on our side and they're fighting back against this so these sixty seventy year old people
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:01.760]  that staff these think tanks are increasingly becoming irrelevant they don't even understand
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.120]  the power the massive power of global communications and the internet to derail their agenda they're
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.160]  only just starting to understand the true threat that that poses which is of course outlined
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.800]  in this article that we're focusing on today and basically it's too late for them it's
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:24.920]  game over but as you said they they do have the ace card of these extraordinary crises
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:31.160]  that they can create in an effort to re-energize popular support for big government and basically
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.360]  totalitarianism paul i really appreciate your time but i want to do five more minutes with
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.240]  you on what you think they're going to pull i really want to give you the floor when we

[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:48.240]  as the president general eisenhower president eisenhower warning of a technological elite
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.400]  in control of a military industrial complex and how they were the main threat to america
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.320]  and how america would be discredited worldwide and destroyed if we let this group continue
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.080]  to take over because this group had come to him and said let's bomb us cities and take
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.880]  over american liberty and set up a dictatorship with you at the head of it and have war with
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:18.280]  russia and eisenhower said you're fired the adjuncts of those guys came to kennedy and
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.360]  said do it he said you're fired they said we're going to blow your head off and they
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  took over and they've been in control ever since and they built all of this you're saying
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.200]  and they brag they built this and they brag they state terror attacks the pina which is
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.440]  written by people that were protogees of l.l. limnitzer that wrote the north woods plant
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:46.760]  the protogees of that guy rumsfeld nuthers wrote that and they said we need a catalyzing
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.160]  pearl harbor giant event to take over central asia and and brzezinski wrote the book on
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.720]  that the grand chessboard i mean i've read all their books they admitted it's like a
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:02.240]  confession that's what's so frustrating and they've been so arrogant criminals always
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.000]  brag that now good people in the government cia fb i military you name it the government
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.400]  drug dealing by the dea is coming out from the top the money laundering by the big banks
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.360]  they run it all the only real drug war is against people they don't control that's a small minority
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.480]  the drug war is to keep prices up the drug war is to keep it illegal the drug war is
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:27.000]  to launder the money and to control competition people are waiting up to that and brzezinski
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.680]  came out i played the clip earlier and he said look we just need to kill it's easier
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.920]  to kill a million people now than to convince them the world is awake and staring i'm gonna
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.200]  play the full clip coming up but but here is eisenhower next hour i'll play the full
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.960]  15 minute farewell address and then make comments throughout it but but but here is some of
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:52.880]  the meat of it the essence of it we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:01.360]  that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.920]  and the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:15.240]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex there you go and he had
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.120]  just fired a whole bunch of people because they came to him and said everybody loves
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.460]  you this has come out by the way you ought to try to stay on the way to do it is to blow
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:31.340]  up bases and blow up movie theaters and shoot people on the street and blame it on domestic
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:36.400]  groups working with communists and we can take over and he said you know what you're
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:43.520]  fired and the memoirs he alluded to it but more came out later he didn't want to shake
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.280]  up the country he didn't come out against it all because he didn't want to destroy confidence
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.480]  in government it's always that same story eisenhower was not a bad guy and he was like
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.280]  he was more old fashioned he wasn't perfect by any stretch and he's like no we're not
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.720]  going to create a dictatorship I don't want to be a dictator he's like George Washington
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.280]  they came to him and said be king be dictator they the people love you and he said no america
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.760]  has been saved over and over again by presidents that refuse the dictatorship smithley butler
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.280]  two time congressional medal of honor winner set to be the command on the marine corps
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.360]  marine major general and they came to him and said we're going to stage a coup d'etat
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.280]  with 500,000 men you're going to lead and we're going to merge with the fascist and
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:34.960]  he said you know what he'd overthrown a bunch of countries that was his job as as a marine
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.240]  he said no and then he blew the whistle on him to the mccormick dickstein committee and
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.920]  this isn't taught in schools folks we almost never had world war two because it wasn't
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.920]  like the nazis were going to take over there were a lot of people that had taught germany
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.440]  everything it knew that was the nuremberg defense was the cold springs harbour labs
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.960]  had set up the keiser philham institute with the rockerfeller money hitler had been financed
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:07.960]  by the the harramans and others here in the u.s. they were competing elites and basically
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.240]  the liberal elite who weren't really liberal they adopted the fascist nazi model but with
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.520]  a quote liberal progressive icing and that's their program and that's their dominant operation
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.680]  here and so they've used terrorism cog to set up this illegitimate criminal government
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:30.400]  separate from the constitution and now they're absorbing the old original republic now going
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.800]  back to paul watson till we go to break i want to give you the floor watson to talk
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.400]  about the state of the world watson editor of prison planet dot com roving editor of
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:47.280]  info wars dot com what is the bottom line here with what you see and and the pieces
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.400]  on the chessboard and where things are going and what do you and your gut think they're
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:59.560]  getting ready your plan to do the bottom line alex is that the elite knows that not only
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.840]  is this global revolution restoration insurrection call it what you want going to happen it's
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.800]  already unfolding i'm looking at a picture of activists in paris france who hired a
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:19.680]  giant 18 wheeler truck to dump horse manure in front of the national assembly in paris
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.800]  france i'm looking at you know italy with the pitchfork movement again uniting left
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:32.400]  and right with even the italian president now warning of violent unrest in 2014 this
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.240]  is unfolding it's not only coming it's unfolding right now so the the the concern of the global
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.360]  elite is to try and infiltrate those movements and use them to enrich the state with more
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.920]  power by pretending that the problem is a lack of collectivism within government they're
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.600]  trying to you know polarize it into that left right issue because both left and right especially
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.440]  in europe are joining together in places like france in italy in italy you've got the student
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.840]  movement and the farmers who've joined together with this pitchfork revolt and the elite will
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.760]  need to infiltrate that in order to derail it i think they're going to go with the the
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:20.320]  einrand blueprint atlas shrugged where they basically try and completely wreck the economy
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:27.120]  wreck human ingenuity and entrepreneurship and you know grandstand as if the problem
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:34.040]  is a lack of power concentrated within the state so people then beg for more centralization
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:40.920]  of power to solve the very problems that they created which is exactly what the saxo bank
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:46.320]  ceo warned of last week so they're going to keep on they're going to keep on making these
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.160]  mistakes in the economy which make people poorer and poorer and say that the only solution
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:59.320]  is more power in the hands of the state which of course as we know is not some utopian idea
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:05.360]  of socialism it's corporate fascism because the the same big businesses that oversee that
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.440]  system work hand in hand with the government it's a revolving door they get the special
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.640]  exemptions of special favors in america you've got the obama administration shutting down
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.880]  the coal plants giving special waivers to general electric so they're going to go with
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.920]  that totalitarianism but i mean did you hear michelle's turning 50 i mean don't you want
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.640]  to celebrate that i mean that's what's important well that's the bread and circuses that they
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.080]  try and keep the 95 percent the rest of the population distracted with so they're going
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.400]  to turn up that so bottom line where do you see it going because they can't help but steal
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.840]  everything with their crony system which destroys productivity so then they argue well it's a
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:48.120]  cosmology of agenda 21 when the truth is they're just a bunch of locusts but now we're going
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.920]  to be here exposing that they're the authors of it how does this end well they intend to
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:58.280]  use homeland security systems worldwide to suppress the population they're going to they're
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.400]  going to hope that we haven't remembered history but precisely because of the internet because
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.400]  now which no other generation ever before has had access to the entire history of the
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:14.520]  world all the information at our fingertips now we do know our history and they're not
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.920]  going to be able to pull that off so in the end we're going to win the human spirit human
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.920]  ingenuity is going to win out and we're going to move into a gradually more free world and
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.240]  a more prosperous world for everybody i agree and humanity is going to split into two groups
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.400]  consciously it already has we'll have the tv heads that are still fed on by the predator
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.760]  groups and by the con artist and who don't even know what planet they're on versus a
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:44.000]  large minority of empowered enlightened people that are going to build our own systems that
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.720]  will then be so successful culturally without force we will then dominate and take over
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:59.200]  the world by pure virtue and by pure competition we will end up unseating the establishment
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.520]  and the problem is though they're going to try to use chemical and biological systems
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:09.240]  to suppress our free will in the battle towards that point but because they're so spiritually
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:16.280]  blind and don't see the fourth dimensional aspects of this they're going to fail what
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.240]  exactly it's always going to be a game of brinksmanship isn't it we're never going to
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.240]  be able to declare total victory over tyranny because that's what drives the human spirit
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:31.080]  it always has throughout history so it's always going to be a game of brinksmanship but eventually
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.240]  people are going to see as he said we're going to be the example that everybody is
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:41.560]  biased to human ingenuity creativity and basic individual freedom is going to triumph as
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:50.120]  the ultimate zenith of the human race that's right honor being good building being honorable

[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:12.080]  media and they fear quote empowered individuals it is empowering to fight evil it is empowering to
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:20.960]  do the right thing it is empowering to fight the good fight i want to hear from people in the system
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.800]  university professors people in hollywood are told if you don't put out anti-human pro-government

[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:49.120]  documentaries even though they make you know 40 million dollars like obama 2016 this is the issue
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.760]  and sometimes i start hyperventilating and sometimes i start talking fast because it's exciting
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.600]  to see all the globalists and all their white paper saying there's a global awakening they're
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:06.000]  losing the info war the liberty movements the enemy the tea parties the enemy uh rand paul
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.960]  uh the enemy alex jones is the enemy matt drudge is the enemy i mean the pentagon came out three
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:16.800]  months ago gave a briefing this this deputy secretary of defense we played the clips and said
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:24.400]  the public doesn't believe us we have our systems in sa um over 90 believe we lying we've got to quit
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.560]  lying and we've got to engage the public and convince them we're their friends well the pentagon
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.400]  on average isn't bad people but the leadership's pure evil they're globalist and but they're not
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:42.080]  suicidal some of them and everybody's freaked out and all the syops people are in there's like 500
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.320]  of a military civilian and they get up and go you mean we don't have to lie anymore because nobody
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.880]  believes us there's the headline government promises to stop lying because of drudge report
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:58.960]  but then they go on in the article in the video and said we're going to go out and engage the
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.280]  alternative media that means buy them off infiltrate takeover and that's why everybody looks really
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.720]  upset in the meeting and mad except for one junior lady who's in pr who doesn't seem to understand
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.760]  what's happening but they're saying we're going to quit lying now this is not an assault this is
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.280]  not a war sorry they don't believe us anymore so we're going to not lie when it's incredibly obvious
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.160]  and we're going to get caught he actually says that where it's already admitted but then we come
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.880]  out and lie like when obama says i never said you'd lose your doctor i never said uh that you wouldn't
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:37.840]  have your premiums go up well he guaranteed it but it was all lie that's the kind of lie they're
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:43.440]  saying they can't tell anymore stop using the stonewall false reality with people that doesn't

[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.320]  the republicans are insane for having bills to cut buying billions of bullets for homeland security
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.760]  and they say there are no bullets being bought i'm a liar now does it matter they are buying the
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.680]  bullets does it matter they're training with paper targets and patriots does it matter they're
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.760]  openly trying to take on the tea party and gun owners and that's in the news they just say i'm
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.680]  a liar with no proof to where i'm a liar like they say i'm deeply racist with no proof on msnbc

[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:04.480]  world has become politically awakened and no matter where you go politics is a matter of
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:12.240]  social engagement and most people know what is generally going on generally going on in the
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:21.840]  world and are consciously aware of global iniquities inequalities lack of respect exploitation
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.840]  mankind is now politically awakened and stirring the combination of the two the diversified
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:36.160]  global leadership politically awakened masses makes a much more difficult context yeah for any
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.560]  major power yeah for their new world order and he goes on to say we gotta go to break it's easier

[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:15.920]  this unfold and watching our society collapse by design what are you going to do about it you know
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:21.520]  they use the kind of fake right wing counter to communism in the 50s to bring in a lot of tyranny
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:27.120]  in this country to counter communism and then now that they've got the tyranny in place they're now
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.280]  moving into a type of communism and they've got all the horrible hollywood people selling their
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.320]  collectivist worldview they are brainwashing our youth they're targeting young children they're
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:46.080]  demonizing vatamir putin because he says gays must leave children in peace ap reports that he says
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:52.960]  that um russian president vatamir putin says gay should feel welcome at the upcoming winter olympic
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:35:01.280]  games but they must leave the children in peace well i mean heterosexuals shouldn't come up and try
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:07.440]  to target children with sexual propaganda i mean that's the thing about the so-called gay lobby the
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:13.840]  democratic party one is that they will they want your children but they want your children period
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.640]  where they say the state rules your kids and we got to get past this idea that uh kids belong to
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.520]  their parents they belong to the collective they belong to the village that's run by a bunch of
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:30.960]  chipitos so see that's it pedophiles are now calling themselves gay to be able to get political
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.760]  correct coverage that's the plan putin told volunteers friday that gays visiting the city
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.880]  can feel calm and at ease and vowed that there would be no discrimination at the games but he
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.080]  emphasized that according to law banning homosexual propaganda among minors gays cannot express their
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:52.560]  views on gay rights issues anyone underage yeah no kidding and and they're saying he's like hitler on
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.040]  you know j lino because of that putin and other political politicians have defended the june
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.760]  propaganda law as the protection of child rights but critics believe that the law discriminates
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.840]  against sexual minorities and folks it's not that putin's even some angel we in this country allow
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.200]  them to teach five-year-olds all of them okay you're not learning how to read and write did you
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.480]  know some boys like the word dresses and some girls like to be boys and you can go in any bathroom
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:27.600]  you want i mean that is trying to screw the kids up oh we're teaching tolerance no you're recruiting
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.920]  because you already run everything and now you want our kids and if you can get away with that
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.240]  get away with anything i mean it just shows how crazy it is it's like the immigration issue
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:44.400]  yeah put that article back up that was amazing kansas school poster listing sex acts part of
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:54.400]  health and science curriculum oral sex sexual fantasy caressing anal sex dancing massage masturbation
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.400]  holding hands see oh anal sex is like holding hands
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:09.760]  cuddling on the couch what's the anal sex say oh it's by anal sex and kissing vaginal intercourse
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.360]  hugging chucking each other's genitals how do people express their sexual feelings
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.320]  this is not the school's business
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.840]  but again these are a bunch of pervs ladies and gentlemen gallop only three percent of americans
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.160]  rank immigration reform as a top priority a new gallop poll yeah i mean you can't go down to mexico
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.440]  and just live unless you've got a bunch of money and get authorized you sure can't go down there
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.960]  and get welfare and have your baby for free they've got one of the strictest immigration laws in the
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.080]  world they put guatemalan's for six months to a year in forced labor camps in mexico if you come in
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.240]  but we're like hey free tuition in state tuition free health care everything anchor babies come on
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.600]  it's racist if you don't the country's going bankrupt i saw john carrion a north american union
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.000]  meeting on c span earlier during a break in their pushing open borders and they're just doing it by
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.320]  fiat and most hispanics in polls don't want open borders they're not stupid they make it a hispanic
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.200]  issue because the majority are spanish there's 650 million people in latin america their population
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.320]  is doubling every 25 years i mean we can't take all these people especially if they're going to get
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:23.200]  welfare when we're bankrupt the big banks the republicans and democratic leadership all want
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.160]  this just like they all wanted obama care the republican party leadership wanted it they're
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:32.000]  not getting rid of it now if you noticed they could repeal it it's totally unpopular even
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.800]  amongst democrats they're not going to because it's a planned takeover they want our guns i'm
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.800]  against it they want open borders i'm against it they want obama care i'm against it they want to
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:48.400]  attack syria the al-qaeda i'm against it anything therefore i'm against everything therefore is
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:57.600]  bad everything they stand for is bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad you don't even have
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.320]  to intellectually analyze it i want you to but if you listen to the rhetoric of being nice and
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.960]  legalize the 30 million illegal let them have everything free or you're racist and americans
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:14.480]  are so nice we go okay here everything's for free if an old lady whose husbands die doesn't pay her
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.720]  property taxes they come and the city sells their house on the courthouse steps next time i want my
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:24.800]  reporters to go out to travis county the next time they're having an auction and they'll be crying
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.960]  old people mainly we should do this and then we go into meldwell spears the county tax assessor at
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.920]  the time i don't even know if she's a county tax assessor at this time and and we'd say on camera
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.960]  why are you taking the mr johnson's house because of uh you know three years of unpaid stuff she doesn't
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.720]  have any money she'll sell security she goes we don't take people's homes and we said well here's the
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.240]  and then we show the video of it happening and then they don't even announce them a lot of times
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.560]  they have insiders there that are getting the houses or they won't really put it on the auction
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.440]  they'll go quietly behind the courthouse and have another auction with their friends and give it to
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:03.360]  them for nothing i mean they're it's unbelievable it's unbelievable how evil this government is
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:08.240]  you will take people's houses if they don't pay income tax if they don't pay property tax if
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:15.360]  they're bankrupt and that's loving and good but then it's it's it's it's you know just absolutely
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:23.280]  horrible if we don't give all this free stuff to anybody that doesn't want to work and by the way
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:27.920]  the illegals all are pretty hard working okay and in many cases haven't been under american culture
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.160]  and have better family values on average but the system set up where mama stays at home
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:40.160]  look at the statistics and gets three or four welfare checks so dad can work for reduced wages
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:48.400]  and still be the patron that's it most the illegals don't even need to work folks they're
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.320]  driving around in brand new cars everywhere i see it doing awesome because they're out there
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.520]  working on a construction job or out there working at a restaurant out there running the
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.040]  business working hard have a work ethic and mama sits at home having kids and gets all the free
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.480]  welfare and you got a lot of hispanic families statistically that are too proud in fact of
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.360]  blacks or whites to take welfare you have one of the largest groups is is illegals that will get
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.040]  welfare but it's also a large statistic of groups that will take none of it there are a lot of
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.920]  hispanics that will take no welfare so they have tv and radio ads nationwide going hispanics who are
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.040]  illegal by the way come get the welfare trust the system get on the welfare
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:31.840]  and of course they're old-fashioned so like americans used to be they won't do it
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  out of self-respect but they're going to get them don't worry they'll break them by the time they're
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.920]  done and that's what all this is about ladies and gentlemen because they already taught americans
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.040]  black white hispanic doesn't matter not to have kids we're all dying 1.3 replacement rate so the
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.120]  argument's true to support social security all of it you got to bring in 30 million illegals every
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:56.160]  10 years because that many people are dying basically boy haven't they screwed things up by design
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.200]  but they don't care because they run the train wreck i want to hear from you if you work for the

[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.840]  stage something and openly admitting it so katie bar the door uh let's talk to shall
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.880]  former new york police officer what is your take on all this coming from south carolina
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:29.440]  hey alex how you doing i'm doing i'm like i said best of times worst of time brother hey listen
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:36.160]  um i've been uh i was a cop for 16 years in new york city i relocated down south carolina
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.720]  can't afford to live up north people up north i think are basically clueless to what's going on
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:49.200]  they don't they don't have a grasp i've been listening to you for about two and a half years
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:56.880]  i actually got turned on to you from glenn beck and uh you just take it a step further i don't
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:02.640]  know what happened to glenn beck he uh he kind of changed his uh tone rhetoric he was all against
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.480]  the new world order when he was on fox and uh since he's uh got his own channel it seems
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:14.240]  that he's toned it down an awful lot i don't know if he's been threatened or not he's undoubtedly
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.360]  listened he's undoubtedly been threatened he's scared to death upwards of 10 bodyguards in any
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.000]  one time i i know people obviously they're you know in and out of glenn beck circle and he's
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.880]  scared to death glenn ought to just walk around in public get over it and go up again but he's
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.160]  doing some good work i don't want to criticize him go ahead no no i i totally agree i mean i
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:41.120]  i backed him 100 when he was on fox uh like i said he was he was the person who got me into
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.440]  what was really no i mean i mean he read three different democratic party funding letters where
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.680]  they said we need a stage terror attack to blame on the tea party i mean you've got to cover that
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:53.680]  when they're openly saying we're going to stage terror attack these are criminals admitting it
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:59.440]  and so he did that and they came to show but sorry go ahead yeah i you know i try to get the word
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.400]  out as much as i can uh living out in south carolina i spotted my own little farm here
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.800]  try to become self-sufficient i got some cow and goats and and stuff and i'm ammoed up and i'm
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.360]  i'm prepared as much as i can uh i i like your format because you bring god into everything
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.360]  and i i really think that's going to be the uh well i bring god into it because when i wake up
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.000]  scared at three a.m. in the morning god is the comforter and my fear goes away believe me i mean
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.720]  i i bring god into it because as stuff gets worse and worse god goes right to the center of my life
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.720]  yeah yeah 100 right i've tried the week in my family they're all living in new jersey
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.840]  they're all clueless they they think i'm half out of my mind which you have to be half out of your
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.880]  mind you know to even go down this road i believe because most people are just too afraid to face
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.680]  what's really happening well that's it they're children they're children and they were brought
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.000]  up everything's okay everything's going to be all right and it's not going to be all right i
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.880]  i you know i i got my cousin my cousin tommy you know he's one of the only family members i have
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.000]  that i'm you know he's actually listening and trying to prepare and and learn the main thing
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.240]  is to learn because there's so much to learn and uh when you talk to people like i guess where i'm at
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.640]  is kind of like where you're at when we talk to people they must think we're out of our mind like

[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:29.200]  there to be found people just don't want to do the research exactly it's so alien to people
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.400]  to know data that they think you're showing off when you're trying to save them because
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.880]  if we don't wake them up we've got to wake them up to save ourselves and but believe me it's
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.640]  starting to happen god bless you keep it up we're going to talk to brett who's a four-year

[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:28.480]  they have such bad smog that they put up giant telescreens showing a sunrise for everyone
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:33.280]  and the people flock to it that's because no environmental standards are allowed
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:40.240]  to fully deindustrialize the u.s. and the west so it's so cheap to make things there everything
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:45.200]  moves there that's economic warfare with kiss and jerk with the globalist we're going to go to
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:52.640]  travis and michelle and burt and tom and john but right now you know it was my uncle william
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:59.280]  farce hamlin who recommended that song about 10 years ago for the show sundown on the union
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.320]  and of course he died a few weeks ago i just always remember him but he lives on by recommending
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:13.440]  that song for the show from the broadway to the milky way that's a lot of real estate indeed
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:21.200]  and uh let's go to uh who's up next brett uh who was a marine for four years and now is tsa what
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:27.360]  is your take on everything that's happening hey alec stop in the morning tia thanks for calling
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:35.360]  yeah i'm not in the tsa anymore i was when it was uh first started so oh you were in it before
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:43.760]  they started uh roping people's genitals and putting them in microwave ovens right right absolutely so
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:49.680]  that's a good thing to do well absolutely so so what's your take on all the stuff that's happening
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:58.960]  well you know uh my my entire family's been in the military as long as i can remember and
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:08.080]  i'm pretty disgusted by what's going on uh the cops beating up this guy to death getting away
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:17.200]  with it um that that recruits that's uh supposed to be uh a marine saying that he's gonna eat the
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:24.080]  crap out of people and this that and the other uh it's disgusting that that's to me that's not a
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:33.040]  mine he's uh he's not deserving of that title if that's how he's going to uh treat his fellow man
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:43.760]  and uh no i'm really scared of uh where it it's all going just you know with uh the bombings and
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:51.840]  bullgrad and with uh winter olympics coming up um like you said you know your your spidey
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:58.400]  senses start tingling and uh something's going to happen whether it's an NFL game or winter olympics
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:05.200]  just too many things going on nukes coming up missing uh all these strikes from uh omen
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:13.440]  i had that that was really um i tell tell sign that something's getting ready to come i agree and
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:18.800]  you know they want to corrupt the government so good people don't want to serve that's why it's
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:22.720]  important to not just attack police out of hand because then it keeps good people from
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:29.280]  joining and then only scum join but the corruptors know that that's why they give the police
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:36.720]  missions that are dishonorable to dishonor them so they can fully dishonor them great points we're

[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:01.120]  to travis in washington wife works in medical system and data mining what's your take on all
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:07.920]  this stuff that's happening oh my gosh alex it's crazy um well first i'm caller i've been
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:14.960]  listening to you about a year and a half or so i fell back asleep for a lot of years wife kids all
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:21.680]  that stuff kind of how it is i'm there a little bit um you made a point a while back that you
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.120]  said that some people are immune to all the crap that they shove at you and i think that's true to
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:32.080]  a certain extent i've always kind of seen past things seen things differently and whatnot but
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.720]  that's the one thing you know you push the fluoride stuff the you know everything else that's the one
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:44.560]  thing most people aren't immune to is that numbing effect um that being said yeah my wife came home
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:51.040]  yesterday and she looked kind of strange and to practice this she was she's starting to wake up
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.720]  but she thinks i'm nuts half the time but she came home with this weird look on her face and
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:02.960]  said you wouldn't believe what i found out today and she told me she works in mental health care
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.320]  her job right now is basically as a care coordinator and she basically mitigates the
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.360]  amount of hospital care and whatnot the patients go through to keep you from going into the system
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:22.640]  too much so she tells me that the program that they use to basically correlate all the data
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.200]  and figure out why they're seeing the doctors too much or you know to slow them down what not
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:34.800]  the other is called prism and i went what what do you mean it's called prism and she said um that
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.120]  she it caught her eye or caught her ear because she had heard me talking about it before yeah that's
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:45.840]  nsa yeah yep and i said well that's what nsa's program is and she said no this is the nsa's
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:54.000]  program the medical industry is basically they have limited access to um health histories and
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:00.320]  yeah sir sir let me stop that's what i'm saying over a thousand major companies just in the us
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:06.960]  alone nexus into the nsa this is actually public and they dump all your data into the nsa and then
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:12.560]  they get to share limited data back out and they're nexusing this so that if you ever go see the
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.360]  psychologist and want to put it on your insurance to get it paid for they're going to give you a
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:22.560]  psychological designation they're going to take your guns so yes when you go to the psychologist
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.400]  now that now the little one down the street for now that just puts it on paper records and stuff
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.760]  that's not happening yet but it's going to be phased in so uh yes sir so so tell me what else your
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:38.640]  wife said um well she said that uh she asked right there's a whole lot of you know bureaucracy
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:43.600]  involved in it and one of the things that she asked was well why can't i just get a an access code
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:50.000]  to the program to go in and and do the calculations myself and she said oh no her boss said oh no we
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.960]  can't uh they only give us limited access because if you had access to the whole thing you either
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:01.120]  have access to classified stuff and everything else and it she said it shocked her that that system
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.720]  was integrated into the health care as well and that's one of the things that i think people need
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:09.280]  to realize it yes sir we wrote articles last year you can pull them up on info wars.com uh that
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.960]  obama health care uh obama care puts your health records into the nsa and and and that's what it
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.880]  is yes sir so i think you should write a report up you can put a known diploma on it if you want
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.040]  or she could write a report send it to us and we'll publish it and then we'll tie it in uh
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.040]  though to all the articles but when it's a person on the inside talking about it even though she's
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:31.840]  not whistleblowing it still has more of an effect with people do you understand absolutely well and
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.840]  that's one of the things that i that first stuck out my head is was to ask her a lot i'm gonna start
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:42.400]  to work her a little bit see if she'll uh get a screenshot or something redacting any personal
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:47.600]  information but get some sort of screenshot or or any kind of documentation on it and she might not
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.920]  but uh well no i mean that's why the new obama care thing says when you have it that you wave all
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:55.520]  your rights to privacy but they're doing it to everybody get a screenshot send it to

[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:25.840]  all right we have a guest the top meteorologist and astrophysicist coming on who a year ago
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:31.200]  early 2013 was on and then i also had him on after bill deberg as i saw him out there in england
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:36.480]  pierce corbin not pierce morgan pierce corbin and he's going to be joining us coming up to
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.520]  about five minutes from england from weather action dot com he predicted extremely cold
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.600]  weather because of the sun decreasing its activity and some other issues and of course the media
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:50.720]  said it was going to be record hot and was proven wrong but show up their pack of liars by design but
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:55.600]  i want to explain something through the total information awareness network
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.720]  that admiral poindexter rolled out in 2001 when everybody was scared it was already in place
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:05.120]  they tried to get everybody to accept total nsa surveillance in and he wrote an article for the
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.440]  new york time saying everything you do is watched every major corporation from piece of places
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.640]  to you name it when you buy something uploads it to us if there's a warrant out for your arrest
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:20.080]  when you order a pizza the police are coming and every bank account everything you do and everything
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.480]  you eat we're going to track it for your own good and people freaked out so they backed
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:30.080]  office and we're not doing that and we were talking to travis and the only reason i i'm holding him
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:34.880]  over is because a he sounds credible b i already know what he's saying is true but to hear it from
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  his wife who is a health care manager over the mental health division of a hospital
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:48.000]  and now under obama care they go into the prism system you've heard of the prison software
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:55.040]  prism that's been used to spy on everybody and it is an nsa database and she's not allowed to get
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:10:00.880]  into it because she'd see everything the whole file on you everything you're doing that the
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.200]  app that the nsa people can go in and see everything you don't want to turn on their
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:11.360]  girlfriend's webcam or the school must turn on webcams and watch people they do it and all the
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:17.200]  government bureaucrats will end up being given access to this to run rough shot over everybody
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.520]  that's called infrastructure protection and so they're phasing it in first to power plants and
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:31.360]  then into police stations and then into everything and then you get your data and you put it in there
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.760]  imagine what richard nixon did with income tax records against people in an enemy's list
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:38.640]  look at how obama has an enemy's list and i'm on it's been reported
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:45.920]  now they've got access into your data and they got access into your computer to plant whatever
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:53.120]  they want a rogue criminal global system of spying uncontrolled that's totally illegal
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.920]  every time they do it felonies and so this fellow called in and said his wife thought he was a
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:03.280]  cook until recently she's starting to wake up but she came home because you know all the sitcoms
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.120]  say the woman's the boss and the man's the cook and even if she loves her husband or whatever
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:12.400]  still it's kind of like an attitude all you know she's all women have seen hundreds of
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.320]  thousands of times since they were kids the image that men are buffoons and women know best and the
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.800]  state knows best above women and that there's nothing going on bad only cooks believe it and
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.760]  i'm not psychoanalyzing his wife from afar but as she begins to see more is going on oh maybe her
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:31.280]  husband knows something maybe he does care about her maybe he's not just paranoid and then she goes
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.600]  and says yeah we have a prism system now under obama care he goes oh that's the name of the
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:41.520]  nsa thing and she goes no it is the nsa they told us i'm dialing into the nsa of course you are
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.560]  when i went to get some clarity in last week because of allergies at walgreens
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.440]  the woman obviously knew who i was at the pharmacy i had to stand in line for 30 minutes
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.280]  waiting for them to come to me to buy an over-the-counter medication they're going to make everything
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:04.080]  behind the counter basically is what this is a digital wall and i went up and she goes do you
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.480]  know about this medication do you know what it can be used for and i'm just like yeah there's a huge
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:13.280]  you know cedar fever in austin she goes i know it's sold out except for a few boxes she says uh
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:17.600]  give me your driver's license she swipes it now they don't just check it to see you know who you
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.600]  are and put it in the log because you could make methamphetamine with it hypothetically well so
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.840]  what i could make them all off cocktails with gasoline do i need to show my id to do that well
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:30.160]  yes now they're saying they want that it's all about you show your id to buy and sell to then get
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.640]  the cashless society in where even if you pay with cash they track what you do and then they
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:41.120]  can put the the vat tax on it the national sales tax see this is the total control grid going in here
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.560]  and it's all conditioning us conditioning us and everyone's a secret police officer when you're in
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:51.200]  a car when you get a hotel when you do anything there's 20 questions they're putting you in
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:59.040]  an nsa database the hotels the car rentals the aircraft the airports but it's not to keep you
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:04.720]  safe it is to watch you so the criminal group has all the data on how to rig the economy
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:09.920]  how to actuary the economy and how to go after anybody they don't like this is hellish this is
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:14.240]  hellish so fit recap your story sir and then finish up then i'm going to go to our guest
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.320]  after he's gone i'll go back to the callers that are holding but finish your point travis
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  from washington was this a wake-up call for her and what was the rest of the story
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:29.440]  yeah it was a bit of a wake-up call it kind of put two and two together in her head and she is a
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.360]  she's a strong-willed intelligent woman that has bought into a lot of stuff but she is starting to
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:42.800]  you know reclaim a bit of her her true independence not her socially authorized
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:50.160]  uh feminist garbage and that's one of the things that i explained to her is that this isn't some
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.440]  some huge thing right now but it's like you said it's an incremental process this is what
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.240]  they're getting people used to to say okay well we think you've seen the doctor too many times
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:06.400]  we're not going to allow this one or um you have a reoccurring issue that seems to be
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.000]  something mental so we're going to you know based on all your information we're going to
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  file you over in this direction and put you on our mental health side and she said that that's
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.680]  one of the things that she noticed is that she one of the the program is just a medical side
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:27.120]  home health care and the other is a mental health and she sees clients being transferred from the
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.280]  standard medical side to the mental health side when that's what they're doing under insurance
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:36.160]  they go you know you're stressed i'm going to transfer your insurance over to this area it'll
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:41.840]  get you more coverage now you're in their special needs area now they can take your rights away
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  now they can surveil you and i knew this when we had our first child my son 11 years ago
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:54.240]  the nurse had nurse for that floor asked me will you take this down to the first floor for me
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.440]  and then when i came back my wife goes man she was asking if we have money if if you hit me
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.920]  uh if uh you know how nice i am and she said you know he's great well the lady came back
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.920]  and i said you put that in a database didn't you she goes yeah the health department were required
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:11.440]  to and i said really you're required to kind of like cops walked up to our reporters and said
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:15.920]  you're not allowed to film a wastewater plant from a public you know sidewalk and we said is
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.840]  there a law and they said no but you know we'll arrest you if you don't i mean there's no law
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.480]  we're just doing it we have guns and and and you know why are you giving us trouble you know your
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:28.640]  first amendment's trouble uh being a media is evil you know you're a empowered individual
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.200]  you're the enemy i mean the cops don't know this their brainwash too i'm telling them i'm
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:37.840]  reverse engineering this forum and and this is the takeover and they're putting everyone in the
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.520]  mental health system that's the new freedom initiative is to make at least half the public
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.320]  basically mentally ill listed and people are going to go mentally ill society's breaking down it's
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:52.320]  screwed up the radiation the food the the uh you know the garbage the gmo the fluoride i mean
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:58.720]  society screwed up men have been emasculated women have been turned into tarts uh the children
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:04.720]  are falling apart i mean this is a societal overwrite a societal crisis they create to then
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:11.520]  collapse things into their own hands and everything is being fed into the nsa the nsa is a front
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:18.880]  computer database for the fortune one thousand really who set it up and get paid there as i've
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.880]  said microsoft and all those guys apple you name it google they're really the corporate nsa and then
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:31.120]  the nsa is only their mass interface that they integrate into forcing all the smaller companies
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.320]  and corporations and groups to put their data in so they can then mine it and control it to
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:42.480]  actuary the shutdown of all the competition you understand that does that make sense brother
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:50.640]  absolutely well hey one thing i want to say to everybody that is the most important thing if
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.560]  you've got any any inkling that things just aren't right there's a reason for that that's your instinct
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:02.720]  your god given nature looking around you seeing what's going on saying something's not right
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:08.480]  use that look into things question things question everything my goodness when i first
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:12.000]  started listening to you i thought you were a bit radical and extreme and then i started
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.240]  looking into things and started remembering that sense from when i was younger before i had kids
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:21.280]  that something's not right and it's there the information's out there it's hard to get to
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:27.600]  sometimes but look for it dig absolutely i mean you mentioned healthcare hooking into the nsa
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  that actually came out in you know just the back of financial publications and trade publications
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:38.960]  dealing with how everything's nexusing into this but then you call in and i remember
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.360]  how much worse it is than i'm even saying and then we pointed out on air and now it'll draw
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:48.800]  attention uh undoubtedly under whistleblowing now in this new tyranny who knows everything's
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:54.080]  illegal and anything good is illegal she can undoubtedly take screenshots of all of that
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:00.560]  as long as there's no personal data or you know no information on the people but what's more important
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:09.200]  is her testimony uh if you email it to us uh her testimony not with the name of the hospital not the
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:14.640]  group not any of that because that is proprietary but protected under whistleblowing but let's just
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:19.680]  not do that write a five page or five paragraph then we'll write a five page article around it
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:25.840]  with all the documents with open source information to prove it have a write up a five paragraph
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:31.760]  write up send a screenshot of the prism nsa interface her testimony that she was told this is
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.520]  the nsa that you're interfacing with and then we'll have a huge national breaking story on that
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:41.680]  again out of washington state just like a whistleblower there gave us the data
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.640]  on the police under nsa with illegal spy hubs grabbing all the cell phone traffic and lying
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:51.440]  to the city council about it that program has now been suspended is in deep trouble and the
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:55.600]  legislature is moving to criminalize it it's already illegal but they're moving to double
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:01.760]  criminalize it so uh give us that data and uh that testimony will then link it to open source
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:08.000]  proves and we will hammer the enemy god bless you i appreciate it travis thanks alice all right
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.200]  we're going to be calling you okay uh rob do get his info and then give this to mackayl thalen
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:19.840]  or give it to gucciardi or give it to watson uh and just make sure they know we already broke
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:24.400]  this last year we got to go find all the articles we wrote about it that obama care
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:28.560]  use the back door for nsa takeover of your medical records i believe that was the headline if we
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:34.480]  search that i mean i know i said that 500 times on air and then pointed out where it was so i
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.280]  just want to show people that okay we're going to come back with pierce corbin of weatheraction.com

[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:29.440]  bell gore in 2007 and in 2009 on record we'll show you some screenshots of these news articles
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:34.880]  said that the arctic the north pole would be completely melted completely melted in winter
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:44.560]  by 2013 it's expanded and is the thickest in many many decades being recorded the northern
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:49.760]  hemisphere has seen record cold temperatures across the board temperature records have been
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:58.960]  smashed all across north america it goes on and on and on and pierce carbon in the last five years
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:05.920]  has come on a few times a year and we appreciate it he's the owner and operator of weather action a
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:15.360]  very powerful web presence exposing what's happening uh he heads up weather action dot
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.760]  com and he's been featured on fox news bbc you name it many other news programs for accurately
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:29.440]  predicting what would happen 30 45 60 days in advance and sometimes six months to a year ahead
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:35.600]  dealing with the solar winds and the moon and how that affects climate now the un says that's not
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.640]  the case it's your car you got to pay them money and they'll save you but they've been fully discredited
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:45.920]  but they don't care they're still moving forward so he predicted record cold temperatures a year ago
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:50.640]  on this show and then about six months ago on this broadcast he's back to tell us how he was able
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:55.040]  to predict that and then coming up in the next segment he's going to tell us what he sees for
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:02.640]  the spring what he sees for the summer into the fall and next year looking into not a crystal ball
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:09.120]  but into the heavens and that big ball of gas that huge nuclear reactor burning in the sky
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:14.960]  that actually drives our climate piers thanks for coming on thank you it's great to be on your show
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.520]  alec great to have you this is a short segment long segment coming up how did you predict it all
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:28.400]  as usual well we uh understand in a predictable way the key things the sun is going to do and
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:37.280]  how the moon will modulate the particles coming from the sun in what is called the solar wind
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:44.000]  the rush of particles which comes to the million miles an hour and the sun of connection is primary
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.640]  magnetic and the moon's modulation of it is magnetic so we can ascertain when similar
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:57.200]  sun of magnetic states happened in the past as will take place sometime in the future
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:04.000]  and we use the weather in the past to predict the future so these very extreme events in
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.520]  europe and in america were things that have happened in the general terms in the past and
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.800]  we use those as the predictors and that includes things like this pole of vortex which is a kind of
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:23.840]  well media term if you like but that type of very cold weather has happened before in the in the usa
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.160]  well when my dad was a little boy it was a lot colder than it even is now but now it's going
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.760]  and now it's going back towards being called again that's right that's right are we in danger of
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:42.160]  slipping back into a mini ice age as many people think we are yes the big variations in the jet
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:50.400]  stream which is this kind of guiding uh thing behind where the low pressure systems track these
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:57.840]  are these it now goes up to the north and down to the south in great big long deep waves and this
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:05.120]  is a characteristic of mini ice ages so it means on average the northern hemisphere is colder with
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:13.040]  longer colder winters late springs and wet summers but sometimes in some places sometimes is also
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:20.160]  going to be very mild where the jet stream is going taking warm air northwards and for example the
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:27.040]  british is now is in fact in such a situation so we've got a mild winter whereas you've got
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:34.880]  understandably cold episodes happening in in the north well in most many parts of the usa
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:42.320]  especially the north central and northeast parts amazing and again you don't like to
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:47.440]  toot your horn but you do have the reports from last year and absolutely yes yes and interestingly
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:54.400]  of course the warmest have got nothing to say except lie and i do mean lie they they claim oh yes
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:29:01.120]  this is all co2 now i was at a meeting last year in october in the wall society in london
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:07.680]  where the ipcc that's the united nations climate committee we're reporting you know to the public
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:13.200]  and scientists mainly what's going on and they said there there's all these variations in the jet
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:19.680]  stream happening uh we don't know why and it doesn't doesn't follow from anything to do with our co2
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:26.000]  more co2 doesn't make these wild ways in the jet stream so i stood up and said well we predicted
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.080]  these things are going to happen some time ago we know why it's happening is to do with
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:37.840]  solar lunar effects and uh that is the only way you can understand these things certainly not by
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:42.480]  co2 tell you what stay there it's simply incredible and people can go to your site and see the

[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:22.640]  to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born by patriot supply has never
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:28.400]  taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:33.840]  over 50 hardworking american men and women it is rare to find companies who practice what they preach

[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:40.400]  ladies and gentlemen the man who continues year after year to predict the weather accurately
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:47.520]  down dealing with the sun and the cycles it's going through he's with us and by the way i've
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:53.440]  interviewed many other astrophysicists scientists let me tell you meteorologists it's been with
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:34:00.400]  with the who are on record i've been down on bended knee talking to the man from who
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:07.600]  who are on record saying the exact same thing it's it's not like only pierce corbin is saying
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:12.880]  this he's just very good with the mathematics to break it down for decades you know as a meteorologist
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:18.080]  as an astrophysicist at weatheraction.com but i want to give you the floor the next 10 minutes sir
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:24.560]  to know your time's important to present to us the you know the fraud of the warmest how they're
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:29.600]  wanting to demonize co2 so they can tax it all ignoring real environmental issues and then
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.320]  tell us what you think's coming in the future with their movement how we counter it when we've
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:38.800]  been proven totally accurate and right algor has been proven to be a fraud saying polar bears can't
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.880]  swim and that it's all just a power grab and then tell us most importantly what's coming up now
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:52.480]  where most of our listeners are in the northern hemisphere europe and the united states canada
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:35:00.480]  what we can expect according to past trends with similar solar and lunar activity.
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:08.480]  Yes right okay well first of all the co2 story or lie and then secondly what's
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:15.920]  happening next well first of all on the co2 story i mean the reason for it is as you said it's a
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:26.160]  tax collecting scam it's social control it's a way of creating a bubble of full value through carbon
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:34.800]  trading and there's a lot of people riding on it so they are prepared to tell lies in order to
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:41.200]  keep the story going and that means for example that people like me just never get a look in on
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:48.000]  bbc television even though they'll have the other side on all the time talking nonsense now
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:55.600]  they claim basically were claiming before that the world was warming due to co2 now the world
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:02.240]  is not warming in fact on real data it's cooling and even on their fiddle data it's not warming it's
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:07.840]  staying flat or cooling a little bit um so they can't say that anymore instead they talk about
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:13.680]  climate change and now we've got all these quite considerable extremes going on they say that
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:22.000]  extremes are caused by co2 now this is a lie and the people who put this forward know it's a lie
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:28.480]  um because they also know these scientists that they cannot explain the variations in the jet
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:35.920]  stream which are the root cause of these extremes whereas we can the solar lunar theory can and we
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:43.600]  can prove absolutely that it is due to the sun because we can predict solar events corona holes
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:50.000]  big solar flares and when these are going to happen and then what will follow and one thing
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.560]  which follows is at times you have these warmings of the stratosphere now when these warmings of
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:03.040]  the stratosphere happen they encourage changes lower down in the troposphere that is where the
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:08.240]  weather happens and bigger variations in the jet stream and that is what is happening now
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:13.280]  we predicted some warmings on the stratosphere they have happened or indeed are happening as we
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:20.880]  speak whereas the co2 people can explain none of this whatsoever so they know when they say at co2
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:28.960]  they are lying and they can carry on lying as long as the governments allow them to and encourage
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:34.160]  them to and shovel the money in order to lie so what can they probably do about that well the
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:40.640]  thing is you have to demand your politicians only listen to proven science and just say look
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:46.160]  the co2 people have got no evidence and if any politician says they have just say to him okay
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.720]  where is it and you'd be surprised that politicians will then shut up and they probably refuse to
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:56.320]  talk to you or you might get some on your side and they're all right well in america there's more
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:03.840]  politicians skeptical or you know or know the co2 stories to lie to prevent to say that in brit but
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:08.880]  we do have a increasing number in brit and i think there will be a change at some point but it has to
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:13.680]  be worked on i was about to say just last week it came out in the news that the bbc has secret
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:19.360]  meetings with their thousands of news presenters of how to defraud the public and keep the lie
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.960]  going that's right absolutely a completely see the bbc is meant to be publicly controlled it's
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:31.440]  meant to be open accountable now this was a lie they had this meeting in january 2006 where they
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:37.120]  said they had calling together 28 scientific experts to establish beyond any reasonable
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.760]  doubt what was really going on actually there were two scientists present and the rest were all
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:50.080]  greenpeace fraudsters various people on the gravy train assorted liars people of whom i have absolutely
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:55.440]  zero respect um and there were two scientists who were on the gravy train themselves now of course
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:02.320]  that meeting wasn't discussing science it was discussing how to lie which is why the bbc spent
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:10.640]  a huge amount of effort legal defenses to prevent who was at this uh meeting being made no no the
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.320]  the judges judges to give them their credit i've said no no bbc can't hide these things
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:21.680]  and the list of who was there is public no i've met three of those people and uh you know it's
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:26.720]  very interesting what happened subsequent to that meeting because uh one of the very interesting
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.640]  things was about the insurance industry in britain we have been predicting floods that happened in 2007
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:39.120]  for example and the insurance industry has spent six million pounds on predicting on a flood map
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:45.840]  flood risk map to show when floods are most likely to happen not where they'll happen here and if
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:50.400]  they happen are you who's going to be affected so i found them off i said well that's a great map
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.960]  you've got do you want to know if it's actually going to flood and they said no no we don't want to
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:00.240]  know i said what you don't want to know no we don't want to know no in the conversation that
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:05.440]  followed it was basically the reason they said well you're on the wrong bus mr corbin and you
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:09.760]  think about it the reason why they don't want to know is kind of obvious they are defrauding the
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:13.520]  public by claiming there's going to be loads of floods no there will be floods of course there's
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:20.400]  sometimes but they want people to buy insurance that they won't use um and of course me popping up
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:25.600]  one year saying oh there will be floods this year or there won't be uh would mean that someone who
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.080]  bought the insurance uh when the insurance companies knew there was going to be no floods
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:34.160]  could take them to court you see and i'll give it off so they don't want to hear i remember you were
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.520]  on a couple years ago talking about the drought in the midwest in texas absolutely and then you
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:46.960]  predicted solar activity uh and and that that the flooding would come soon and then now we've seen
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:52.400]  some of the worst flooding on record again how do you do that so actually and then a on the time
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:58.080]  we've got left well okay what's coming what's coming in january for example that was uh
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:03.200]  with those uh snowmagedons if you like you had three of those also in december and these super
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:09.840]  cold wax in january we predicted those from the careful timing of the solar lunar effects and when
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.760]  they happened in the past sometimes a number of times in the past and then say okay so this message
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:21.600]  is on and we can say when give or take a day or so i mean i suppose the super cold came
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:27.280]  of day or two earlier than we said but you know it carried on in it was pretty you know it was
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.800]  basically there when we said in where we said as well so um we're pleased with that and uh i've
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:38.960]  just been thinking about your people who listen to your show and what we ought to do i think is we'll
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:45.680]  give them a free extra forecast for the next three days for anyone getting us a forecast and we'll put
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.560]  on the website this is for alex jones show listeners but of course anyone who gets on there will
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:54.800]  take advantage of it but that doesn't matter so for the next three days we'll give people extra
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.840]  forecast so you instead of buying one you get two you see so when you pay for one month you get two
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:04.400]  months well it's certainly worth it and we should probably try to even get you as well at action.com
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:09.360]  yeah absolutely but but in general coming up uh because you make these predictions each year on the
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:17.120]  show yes we're coming up well we have not yet done actually a detailed forecast for the uh usa all
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:24.640]  written uh for the coming uh six months but we are doing it and extending the time ahead
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:32.160]  and uh uh what is obvious is that these uh world swings of the jet stream are going to continue
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:40.320]  so it will mean again another summer of dramatic contrast in in the in the usa so you know very
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:50.400]  hot dry bits in places and breaking down in other parts to you know severe rain and and cold bits
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:57.520]  and similar type of contrast in in in britain although britain is smaller so it you know
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:02.720]  uh the variations across it might not be so large as they are across the us of a
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:09.440]  but uh a characteristic of last summer for example a lot of or even this this winter was
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:16.400]  we had um quite warm in the south west usa a very warm at times as well as been very cold in the
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:22.000]  northeast now this type of conflict will continue i'm not saying it'll be that contrast exactly but
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:28.400]  that type of thing will continue and that's because the jet stream is is is moving wildly
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:36.400]  because the sun is doing what and the sun is the main driver explain that to people yeah the sun
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:42.480]  sending its particles out charge particles uh captured by the various planets one of them
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:49.840]  being the earth and uh uh they're magnetically connected to the sun so when the magnetic connections
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:56.000]  are favorable you get more of these particles and the moon interrupting or not the solar wind also
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.560]  again changes the number and effective particles and these particles they change the rate at which
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:10.240]  weather fronts operate so when we have our five periods they call that means red red action red
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:16.400]  weather action period five level five it means that weather fronts are much more intense and you
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:23.680]  can see that in this very cold bit um uh as it was warming up we warned there will be tornadoes
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:28.000]  somebody emailed and said what tornadoes and of course they started at the start of this period
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:33.840]  i said well just wait and see and um sure enough the word tornadoes uh the end of that in various
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:40.080]  places as the the warm air met the colder as as as we predicted well i mean the big issue here is
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.280]  farmers going back thousands of years looked at how the sun was acting how the moon was acting and
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:51.040]  uh you know had lore about weather according to the sun and moon because they didn't know that the sun
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:56.640]  had basically these winds to boil it down and then when the moon got and then when the moon gets in
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:01.040]  front of the earth i mean it's it's more complex than that but that obviously that's one of the
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:06.080]  main drivers of climate but you talk to a mainline meteorologist they'll tell you the sun has nothing
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:11.760]  to do with it i mean that's asinine well it's mental it's mentally defective frankly you know i mean
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:16.640]  we ought to call the the science of these so-called scientists what it is it is mentally defective
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:22.240]  it's cretin it's cretinism i mean you know the vikings knew that when there was aurora
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:28.160]  as sure as night follows day storms will follow and that always it's always the case
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.080]  you have big aurora you will have big storms especially in the northern hemisphere for those
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:37.680]  that don't know that's when there's more radiation coming in from the sun causing an aurora borealis
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:43.520]  i mean everybody knows now that when you get a big solar flare that hits the earth it it will
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:48.720]  produce nuclei then you'll have a bunch of rain come out of a clear sky it'll form clouds and
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:54.880]  you'll get rain i mean it's one of the astrophysicists all know this nasa knows this but even their own
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:59.840]  scientists won't come out and say it it's just ridiculous they won't say it after all who's
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:05.760]  paying them i mean they're on a government payroll which is there to um rob the public
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:14.560]  through you know carbon taxes subsidies to various uh green dodgy operations and and so
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:21.200]  forth so we have a lack of accountability in the state operators when that should be where we
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  have accountability and it's only when voters rise up and demand accountability from their
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.440]  politicians that we're going to get somewhere i mean you should vote out chuck out the people that
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:38.480]  that don't believe in accountability very well said sir well listen i appreciate your time thank you
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.200]  do we have any idea in this sun cycle i mean i know when you know the sun's doing something or
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:48.400]  going in a certain cycle you can predict with 90 percent or more accuracy what's going to happen
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:54.320]  but but generally you know the sun we don't know always acts the same yeah so what's happening
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:59.760]  yeah we around now with these this month and last month well the early part of this month
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:04.720]  we've had a lot of extra solar activity which we predicted and it came on time i'm very pleased
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:09.920]  with that the next few months though month or two is going to be much quieter there'd be much
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:19.200]  less solar activity less aurora which often favors um cold weather and less active weather
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:24.000]  fronts so there will be some more cold blast in general we can say without doing the detail
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.160]  forecast but uh you know you can't tell for sure where and uh one thing we're pretty aware of
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:38.240]  already though is that the olympics in um the winter olympics in russia they will be uh there
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:44.320]  will be a lot of very cold air there and cold snowy blast so they're not going to be uh troubled by
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:50.880]  mild uh air which is probably good news what about the olympics coming up that they want to have out
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:56.160]  in the middle of the desert in the middle east well i think that's insane by any measure you
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:02.800]  know it's just complete balmy insanity i mean there's a reason why people don't live there
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:08.800]  i mean it's because it's too damn hot so i mean to run olympics there is just just completely stupid
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:14.480]  it's some money grabbing operation well we are seeing more and more insane behavior thank you very
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:21.680]  much thank you very much here's all right there he goes the head of weather action uh the man who
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:25.200]  predicted so much of what happened this winter you can go back to the show last time he was on
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.680]  i mean it's amazing it really is amazing and he like i said the vikings basically knew this stuff
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:34.880]  when there's a big aurora borealis that means they didn't know what was causing that the northern
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:40.400]  lights they thought it was Thor riding around this chariot uh they just knew that that mean a bunch
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:46.400]  of weather was going to come the next few days because all that nuclei comes in creates static
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:51.360]  electricity to boil it down to layman's terms that then allows water droplets to condense to make
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:59.520]  bigger droplets clouds rain thunderstorms snow i mean it's just it's just the sun folks the if it
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:08.080]  wasn't for the sun the earth would be absolute zero absolute zero no life on it but the un says
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:12.720]  the sun has no effect on climate i mean that's like saying the sun has no effect on plants growing

[02:54:52.960 --> 02:55:00.240]  having me um michael i'm calling out of the west coast in san diego and oh i don't even know where
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:06.080]  to start i want to start i work at a big kind of financial institution out here in san diego
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:12.800]  i won't name their name but it starts with three letters and there are just things that we are
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:20.480]  doing within our industry that i cannot take anymore um personally i'm 26 i took a service
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:26.640]  job i was questioned for two months on any outside meetings that i have which i don't i
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:33.360]  don't invest i was also asked to not disclose our certain fees that we are sliding into customers
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:39.360]  accounts but also we're on recorded lines being in the service center been asked not to go into
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:45.840]  anything political and aside from that we're about 12 miles away from your mar airspace
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:53.120]  and i have seen just tenfold increase in kind of military presence um looks like military
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:58.880]  operations drills and wanting to get your take on that and then secondly i had an uncle who did
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:05.760]  some work with jacksa he works with nasa for the precipitation satellite that they launched and
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:11.840]  he's just got some photos stories from japan on the radiation over there japanese government
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:18.640]  coming out saying that iodine is in fact not helpful and toxic he's got pictures of the
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:24.000]  coastal regions over there and just wanted to get your your take on all that what do we do
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:30.480]  and it's the iodine back in supply well i mean i haven't seen the japanese government say that
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.320]  but it's on record that iodine's good for you with different isotopes protect the thyroid so
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.880]  doesn't absorb the bad isotopes but the japanese government has been lying saying there's no
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:44.320]  radiation they've been caught lying that's all on record uh they've got all sorts of propaganda
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:48.080]  here saying don't worry about radiation on the west coast it's just all part of this attitude
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:54.400]  of not caring but i do know financial institutions are jacking up fees and stuff across the board
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:59.840]  and then trying to deny it later uh like jp morgan chase and others and remember bank of america
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:04.800]  tried the five dollar fee every time you use your debit card i mean they're talking about in the news
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:10.400]  making you pay to deposit money now because money is so worthless the the globalists can give themselves
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:15.840]  all the fiat money they want so that's why they don't even need us in their economy anymore because
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.320]  it's so fraudulently based thanks for the call let's go to john in wisconsin you're on the air go
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:25.520]  ahead thanks for holding yeah i've got about two or three comments for you all for uh first of all
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:31.760]  this nsa thing you know they really wanted to change the nsa works they should get congress to
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:40.960]  enact a a law that dissolves the uh uh uh uh uh like the courts you don't need a secret court to do
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:51.040]  business and to just delete everything that they don't need you know because otherwise it's just
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:56.640]  all rhetoric no i know that they have secret courts about how they're spying on us and they've
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.880]  been caught lying over and over again and they have lapdog people in these courts but that's
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:05.680]  a red herring too because most of spying goes on outside that court anyways it's just like a
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:13.840]  distraction like well we have a court over here uh yeah but you know they kind of like to use that
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:18.960]  to make us think that the government's working no no i totally agree with you i totally agree with
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:23.680]  you anything else yeah the uh as far as the environment's concerned you know a lot of people
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:30.080]  don't realize that there's more active volcanoes right now since you know biblical times and
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:36.720]  each one of those volcanoes is peeling out so much sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide oh exactly no no
