[00:00.000 --> 00:10.200]  The FBI just announced that they're investigating Epstein's death as murder.
[00:10.200 --> 00:11.200]  It's all coming up.
[00:11.200 --> 00:13.920]  But first, what makes the globalist tick?
[00:13.920 --> 00:19.120]  The world want to know what makes the powerful billionaires tick.
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.920]  Don't you want to know about who runs the global government and what their plans are
[00:23.920 --> 00:25.420]  for you and your family?
[00:25.420 --> 00:27.080]  What's their cosmology?
[00:27.080 --> 00:28.080]  What's their worldview?
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.080]  What makes them tick?
[00:29.080 --> 00:33.520]  And if you know the answer to that, well, you know the answer to everything.
[00:33.520 --> 00:39.240]  Searing social critic Mr. Huxley 27 years ago wrote Brave New World, a novel that predicted
[00:39.240 --> 00:44.560]  that someday the entire world would live under a frightful dictatorship.
[00:44.560 --> 00:49.960]  Today Mr. Huxley says that his fictional world of horror is probably just around the corner
[00:49.960 --> 00:50.960]  for all of us.
[00:50.960 --> 00:54.720]  Are the enemies of freedom here in the United States?
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.000]  Well, I don't think you can say who in the United States.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.320]  I don't think there are any sinister persons deliberately trying to rob people of their
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.320]  freedom.
[01:04.320 --> 01:10.160]  But I do think, first of all, that there are a number of impersonal forces which are pushing
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.520]  in the direction of less and less freedom.
[01:14.520 --> 01:20.320]  And I also think that there are a number of technological devices which anybody who wishes
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.960]  to use can use to accelerate this process of going away from freedom of imposing control.
[01:27.960 --> 01:31.720]  That's something they don't want you to even discuss or look at.
[01:31.720 --> 01:36.000]  But it's our mission to actually dig into who those people are.
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.360]  Turns out the most powerful consortium of parallel governments, what the group called
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.960]  it 13, 14 years ago when they did a PR push, they called it a parallel world government.
[01:47.960 --> 01:50.240]  House Bill Gates called it that.
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.960]  And they were meeting in secret locations in New York and locations in New Mexico and
[01:55.960 --> 01:58.000]  locations in the Caribbean.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.600]  And they were training larger groups outside of the central cult from there.
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.920]  And of course, you know that cult and it's Mater D. It's master of ceremonies.
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.680]  It's hotel manager as Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:11.680 --> 02:18.480]  And of course, then his girlfriend, whose father had formerly run that job for British
[02:18.480 --> 02:22.800]  intelligence and Israeli intelligence as well.
[02:22.800 --> 02:25.280]  And that's all come out in the news now.
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.120]  I told you about it more than a decade ago, but Epstein was only one player in the larger
[02:30.120 --> 02:32.240]  house of cards that is coming down.
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.320]  And now we see Prince Andrew, the Duke of York caught up in the spider web.
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.040]  Going to Peter Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do.
[02:43.040 --> 02:50.800]  I have a peculiar medical condition, which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at
[02:50.800 --> 02:51.800]  the time.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.600]  What do I really want to do here on air?
[02:53.600 --> 03:00.880]  I want to tell you about what's coming again in 10, 15, 20 years instead of just pointing
[03:00.880 --> 03:03.200]  out all the things I was dead on about.
[03:03.200 --> 03:06.080]  Why don't we get into more and more here on the show?
[03:06.080 --> 03:07.080]  What's coming next?
[03:07.080 --> 03:09.000]  Because that's really what everybody wants to know.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.520]  And you know, I do know what's coming next.
[03:11.520 --> 03:14.360]  When you look at a streetlight, what do you see?
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.480]  Municipality see them as one of the largest portions of their energy costs.
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.320]  Street lights are everywhere.
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.920]  So what if you take all those street lights and make them hubs of smart technology while
[03:24.920 --> 03:30.360]  helping provide their communities with significant energy savings and a safer environment?
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.040]  What if you could add programmable street signs to reroute traffic or digital signage
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.520]  to announce events and advertise merchants?
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.960]  What about adding accent lighting or audio features to play music and make announcements
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.920]  or public safety options for important messages?
[03:46.920 --> 03:48.640]  All of these things are possible.
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.160]  The Smart City Ecosystem Framework, a model for planning smart cities.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.520]  Google tells us all about it.
[03:56.520 --> 04:02.120]  And then it ties to this, fears of 5G weapons system in the UK after conspiracy theorists
[04:02.120 --> 04:08.720]  takes apart a light and shows people secret 5G, but still, he's the bad person.
[04:08.720 --> 04:11.280]  Nothing more than a weapon.
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.480]  Now I know it's masquerade and there's a light, but it's a weapon.
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.880]  And I thought I'd show you the first known article exposing the 5G by name.
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.720]  Nine years ago, new street lights to have Homeland Security applications.
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.120]  Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[04:31.120 --> 04:34.920]  And I and Paul wrote that article back there nine years ago.
[04:34.920 --> 04:39.000]  And now smart street lights to track everything we do all the time.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.800]  That's six years ago.
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.280]  And now a few years later, the sci-fi future of Lamp Post, remember when Drugs linked to
[04:45.280 --> 04:51.760]  Paul's article nine years ago, the media came out and said it wasn't true.
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.400]  We had made it up.
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.280]  Just like I made it up that Jeffrey Epstein was working for International Intelligence
[04:57.280 --> 05:00.280]  Agency's blackmailing thousands of.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.680]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most
[05:04.680 --> 05:09.440]  of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[05:09.440 --> 05:11.440]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.160]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.480]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed, that they were really
[05:20.480 --> 05:27.280]  setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and
[05:27.280 --> 05:33.080]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be
[05:33.080 --> 05:34.080]  opposed.
[05:34.080 --> 05:40.080]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[05:40.080 --> 05:46.120]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because
[05:46.120 --> 05:50.320]  they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.320]  pushing to succeed.
[05:51.320 --> 05:56.200]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than
[05:56.200 --> 06:25.560]  ever.
[06:25.560 --> 06:33.200]  Daring this incredible age of information overload, deciphering, breaking down the forces
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.600]  of evil and the forces of good contending over the destiny of humanity in full wars
[06:39.600 --> 06:46.400]  is the destination for those that want the truth and those that believe humanity deserves
[06:46.400 --> 06:50.560]  and has a fighting chance.
[06:50.560 --> 06:57.200]  It is Tuesday, November 19, 2019, I am your host, Alex Jones, have several very informative
[06:57.200 --> 07:01.320]  important guests joining us today in studio.
[07:01.320 --> 07:07.800]  Before I get into that, let me lay out some of the incredibly important news.
[07:07.800 --> 07:19.560]  Now, 20 minutes before we went live, we had crew actually watching some of the congressional
[07:19.560 --> 07:27.040]  testimony in the judiciary committee.
[07:27.040 --> 07:36.160]  And boom, there was the admission that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation
[07:36.160 --> 07:41.600]  of organized crime carrying out the murder of Jeffrey Epstein.
[07:41.600 --> 07:49.440]  So you talk about the collapse of an official narrative, this is spectacular.
[07:49.440 --> 07:57.360]  You've got all the pedophilia rings coming out, you've got the queen's son implicated
[07:57.360 --> 07:58.360]  and connected to it.
[07:58.360 --> 08:03.000]  They're doing a limited hangout by diverting off into the 17-year-old woman, hoping everybody
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.280]  just stays focused on that.
[08:05.280 --> 08:11.040]  You've got globalism itself being exposed.
[08:11.040 --> 08:17.760]  It's an amazing time to be alive, we're going to be laying all of that out here.
[08:17.760 --> 08:22.280]  And no one has this video clip yet, we've been checking on Twitter, we've been checking
[08:22.280 --> 08:27.160]  on YouTube, because it literally just happened and it's hard to back up live streams when
[08:27.160 --> 08:30.000]  they're live, but we've been able to do it.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.840]  So as we speak, they're cutting these clips out now.
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.400]  It turns out they're having a hearing on Epstein's death, even though the hearing was about
[08:39.400 --> 08:41.080]  other matters, it's being brought up.
[08:41.080 --> 08:43.880]  This is big.
[08:43.880 --> 08:50.840]  And so we will have some of those clips for you by the next segment and then more throughout
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.840]  the hour.
[08:51.840 --> 08:52.840]  But it's ongoing.
[08:52.840 --> 08:58.760]  It's a Kit Daniels article that he hammered out very quickly, more is being added at infowars.com.
[08:58.760 --> 09:09.520]  FBI Now, treating Epstein's death as a criminal matter, FBI probing possible criminal enterprise.
[09:09.520 --> 09:16.960]  Those are quotes, says Bureau of Prisons Director, because she's being asked about his mysterious
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.080]  death in there, the FBI is now treating Epstein's death as a criminal matter, according to Bureau
[09:22.080 --> 09:29.420]  of Prisons Director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, during just your committee hearing today,
[09:29.420 --> 09:33.520]  Sawyer said the FBI is probably the possibility of criminal enterprise, close quote, involving
[09:33.520 --> 09:34.520]  with Epstein.
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.760]  Sawyer was responding to questions from Senator Lindsey Graham, who asked the FBI was probing
[09:38.760 --> 09:42.640]  both the possibilities of major malfunction and criminal enterprise, the tributed Epstein's
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.640]  death.
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.240]  It's near the beginning of the hearing.
[09:47.240 --> 09:52.280]  We have the live hearing posted there, but we are grabbing it out right now.
[09:52.280 --> 10:01.240]  And now a zero hedge boom has it as well, so good job, zero hedge.com.
[10:01.240 --> 10:09.640]  So that is all breaking right now at infowars.com and newswars.com, as well as herohedge.com.
[10:09.640 --> 10:12.440]  And again, that's an ongoing hearing.
[10:12.440 --> 10:14.880]  We're getting the clips together.
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.360]  I was just right before the show, right before I went live, almost got laid on air.
[10:18.360 --> 10:21.320]  In fact, I had to air that little special report that was still informative, because
[10:21.320 --> 10:27.160]  I just wasn't ready to go on because I was in one of the studios looking at the raw footage.
[10:27.160 --> 10:34.440]  It's spectacular, because the whole House of Cards is literally coming down on this.
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.800]  There's a lot of fun stuff going on.
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.280]  Eric Swallowswell, who famously said that we'll be able to confiscate all semi-autos
[10:43.280 --> 10:44.280]  nationwide.
[10:44.280 --> 10:49.920]  He was Beto before Beto was the big, we'll confiscate your semi-autos, damn right.
[10:49.920 --> 10:50.920]  We will.
[10:50.920 --> 10:53.280]  Superstar got all the other Democrats to agree.
[10:53.280 --> 11:00.440]  Swallowswell, remember last year, said we'll use nuclear weapons on American gun owners.
[11:00.440 --> 11:02.720]  So that deserves to be revisited.
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.920]  But it's big news, what they're calling Fartgate.
[11:06.920 --> 11:11.520]  And he's now known as Eric Fartswell, and I got to tell you, you know, I like to have
[11:11.520 --> 11:18.040]  some juvenile fun occasionally.
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.120]  I like to have some fun occasionally, you know, with all this serious news.
[11:22.120 --> 11:29.160]  But it turns out scientific forensic evidence has been done with an infrared scan of Mr.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.160]  Swallowswell.
[11:30.160 --> 11:37.160]  But first, let's go to the raw footage of him on Fartball with Chris Fartswell, who's
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.880]  known for flatulating on air himself, famously.
[11:40.880 --> 11:44.740]  So there's a debate about, because it's a real life feed, which one was firing cannons
[11:44.740 --> 11:45.740]  on air.
[11:45.740 --> 11:46.740]  Here it is.
[11:46.740 --> 11:50.600]  The evidence is uncontradicted that the President used taxpayer dollars to ask the
[11:50.600 --> 11:53.200]  Ukrainians to help him cheat an election.
[11:53.200 --> 11:54.840]  And the complaint that I've heard from.
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.880]  Now you notice Kennedy's head went back into the left, because he was shot in the front
[11:59.880 --> 12:00.880]  on the right.
[12:00.880 --> 12:03.280]  The bullets went out the back, back into the left.
[12:03.280 --> 12:10.800]  Well, now the forensic expert, you see him rise up and now he's denied it happened.
[12:10.800 --> 12:13.160]  It turns out it was on the live feed.
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.680]  People are strategizing, is he lying or was it Chris Matthews and it's become a big conspiracy.
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.920]  They're announcing that they're going to sue anyone that questions the official story that
[12:21.920 --> 12:23.920]  you did not hear of Fart.
[12:23.920 --> 12:26.960]  Of course that means sarcastic, but that's where things are now.
[12:26.960 --> 12:32.320]  I've got, what, seven lawsuits against me right now for questioning official stories,
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.320]  which we should all do.
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.480]  We get lied to all the time, but don't question who farted, was it Chris Matthews or Eric
[12:38.480 --> 12:41.280]  no longer Swallowswell, but Eric Fartswell.
[12:41.280 --> 12:46.560]  But let's get serious, we've got some forensic evidence here that shows exactly who did it,
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.320]  a major heat signature and gaseous signature from the man who threatened mushroom clouds
[12:52.320 --> 12:53.320]  on Americans.
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.320]  They didn't turn their guns in.
[12:54.320 --> 12:55.320]  Here it is.
[12:55.320 --> 12:59.320]  Taxpayer dollars to ask the Ukrainians to help them cheat in an election.
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.160]  And the complaint that I've heard from Republicans again, folks, that's not actually infrared.
[13:04.160 --> 13:07.120]  You'd have to have an infrared camera actually scanning heat to pick that up.
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.280]  That's a joke.
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.760]  I'm not trying to put off fake video like Carpe Donckton shows a Biden groping Biden
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.440]  in the media CNN.
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.520]  Another said he put a fake video out of Biden groping Biden.
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.040]  No, that's called a joke.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.040]  That's called a joke.
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.040]  Oh my gosh, I didn't know there was already a Biden meme of it.
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.560]  No, Biden did not grope.
[13:33.560 --> 13:34.560]  Swallowswell.
[13:34.560 --> 13:36.960]  Okay, this crew is the best.
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.440]  They pulled that up within a half a second of me saying it.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.920]  I don't know how they did that.
[13:41.920 --> 13:42.920]  That was magic.
[13:42.920 --> 13:43.920]  That was not preplanned.
[13:43.920 --> 13:49.400]  Now, we just tried to put a fake video out of Joe Biden smelling the fart.
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.800]  Oh my gosh, can we can we combine those two together?
[13:53.800 --> 14:00.160]  It'll be tonight done done done ABC nightly news, Alex Jones has done it again, a fake
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.160]  video.
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.680]  Joe Biden did not huff Eric Fartswell's gas.
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.040]  I decided I'm going to go back to joking around on air.
[14:09.040 --> 14:10.040]  I used to do it.
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.040]  People liked it.
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.000]  I don't want to say I'm depressed, but I'm sick of being so serious.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.480]  It is a serious world and be serious 90% of the time.
[14:19.480 --> 14:24.200]  Like I used to be, I was 10% of the time screwing around and I'm going to have some fun before
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.120]  we get into all of the really serious news about the murder of Jeffrey Epstein and the
[14:27.120 --> 14:29.200]  FBI is now open to criminal investigation.
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.600]  That's up on enforce.com.
[14:30.600 --> 14:33.880]  The video that nobody's got will exclusively be posted.
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.680]  I'm told very, very quickly to rob news Twitter and we'll post it there.
[14:37.680 --> 14:45.520]  But if you want more comedy document cam shot, please, which ones reeled and which ones

[18:00.920 --> 18:05.640]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.880]  New York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left
[18:10.880 --> 18:13.400]  got so excited.
[18:13.400 --> 18:20.080]  They said oh he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running
[18:20.080 --> 18:21.480]  to Florida.
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.240]  Well now we know why the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts
[18:26.240 --> 18:30.520]  were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and
[18:30.520 --> 18:36.880]  harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.720]  with and by moving his domicile from New York to Florida that gets around the New York
[18:41.720 --> 18:48.440]  law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private so all those people
[18:48.440 --> 18:54.680]  out there holding their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep
[18:54.680 --> 18:59.080]  states ass and he's never going to resign.
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.040]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've said it many times I will never
[19:05.040 --> 19:12.760]  give in I will never give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see
[19:12.760 --> 19:18.880]  them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and
[19:18.880 --> 19:25.080]  to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most Americans
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.000]  have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most Americans feel powerless
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.040]  and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot
[19:37.040 --> 19:42.400]  com info wars dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.520]  more than ever and then if you tell people hey the banned truth they don't want you to
[19:46.520 --> 19:52.480]  have is it info wars dot com forward slash show and banned on video so take heart folks
[19:52.480 --> 19:56.560]  they've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they
[19:56.560 --> 20:14.200]  can't beat us fair and square you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:14.200 --> 20:26.440]  raging war on corruption it's alex jones we are living in a time of incredible change
[20:26.440 --> 20:32.480]  and when you've been out at sea in a storm you're thrown overboard you toss you turn
[20:32.480 --> 20:37.360]  and if you're blessing up to make it to shore when you're going over those reefs and rocks
[20:37.360 --> 20:42.720]  in the first sand you might cut your knees up you might be confused you might be nauseous
[20:42.720 --> 20:48.640]  but at least you've made it to land and I see that as the process humanities going through
[20:48.640 --> 20:53.920]  we can give up hope now that all these skeletons in the closet are coming out now that we're
[20:53.920 --> 21:02.240]  learning just how corrupt and evil the establishment has become it's depressing but it was already
[21:02.240 --> 21:12.640]  going on at least we know it's there now like a cancer that can be removed and that's not
[21:12.640 --> 21:19.200]  a good process it's not a fun process but there's still time to reverse the situation
[21:19.200 --> 21:27.880]  knowing is literally half the battle now we have a story up on info wars dot com and as
[21:27.880 --> 21:34.800]  far as I know as we look for it we have the exclusive video more of it is coming FBI now
[21:34.800 --> 21:45.840]  investigating Epstein's death for signs of criminal enterprise Bureau of Presidents the
[21:45.840 --> 21:54.480]  records as FBI now treating Epstein's mysterious death as a criminal matter very very important
[21:54.480 --> 22:03.240]  US charges to jail guards over Jeffrey Epstein death that of course is broken we're going
[22:03.240 --> 22:12.040]  to be getting to all of it but here is the segment where the head of the Bureau of Presidents
[22:12.040 --> 22:22.320]  Lindsey Graham is questioning gets into this here's the director Catherine Hawk Sawyer
[22:22.320 --> 22:31.000]  here at us I wanted to talk about the death Mr. Epstein do you concur with the opinion
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.640]  that it was a suicide that was the finding of the coroner sir okay do you have any evidence
[22:36.640 --> 22:42.520]  suggest otherwise I do not how could this have happened unfortunately sir this thing
[22:42.520 --> 22:47.120]  is this the death and the whole situation is still under the investigation of the FBI
[22:47.120 --> 22:52.320]  and the inspector general's office and I'm really not at liberty to discuss specifics
[22:52.320 --> 22:58.400]  of this case I can discuss issues around institution operations but I can't specifically talk about
[22:58.400 --> 23:06.080]  that particular issue okay well the case this high profile there's got to be their major
[23:06.080 --> 23:11.920]  malfunction of the system or criminal enterprise at foot to allow this to happen so are you
[23:11.920 --> 23:17.560]  looking at both is the FBI looking at both the FBI is involved in they are looking criminal
[23:17.560 --> 23:24.720]  enterprise yes do we have people in custody today of this high profile major have we done
[23:24.720 --> 23:31.080]  anything to adjust since mr. Epstein's death sir we take every inmates life very seriously
[23:31.080 --> 23:35.840]  in the Bureau of prisons a high profile inmate is no more important or significant in terms
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.080]  of our operations than just the average inmate that comes already now profile somebody's
[23:40.080 --> 23:44.920]  on the suicide watch I would like to explain our suicide watch system if I may I can't
[23:44.920 --> 23:49.560]  talk specifically about Epstein but we have different tiers of response if we identify
[23:49.560 --> 23:54.280]  an inmate who appears to be having suicidal thinking and I came into the Bureau's a psychologist
[23:54.280 --> 23:57.760]  I've worked with lots of suicide inmates I was working in our psychiatric facility in
[23:57.760 --> 24:01.600]  Butner and I know how difficult it is to always be able to predict who's suicidal and who
[24:01.600 --> 24:06.000]  is not but once an inmate is identified as potentially suicidal we have a suicide watch
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.840]  operation that we can place them in it's a very stark very difficult setting where everything
[24:10.840 --> 24:15.840]  is stripped from the room except a mattress they get a coarse gown like to wear that
[24:15.840 --> 24:19.960]  cannot be twisted in any way that they could hang themselves from it they have one mattress
[24:19.960 --> 24:24.360]  and one blanket and they are watched constantly there's nothing else in that room Mr. Epstein
[24:24.360 --> 24:29.320]  on suicide watch yes he watched however the average time on suicide watch is only about
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.560]  24 hours because it is such a stark and actually depressing situation we then can move them
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.800]  to another tier of observation which is called psychological observation that happened in
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.080]  this case I can't speak specifically but I am sharing this with you so that you understand
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.680]  our procedure sir all right and more more coming on that but oh yeah we think it's
[24:49.680 --> 24:53.560]  a suicide because that's the official story we never want to throw others under the bus
[24:53.560 --> 25:03.120]  but we're looking at it as a criminal enterprise and two jail guards have been charged in association
[25:03.120 --> 25:09.400]  with that so we'll be looking at that more later in this hour in the next hour and we're
[25:09.400 --> 25:14.440]  going to have more of those clips for you that is posted at info wars dot com fbi now
[25:14.440 --> 25:21.800]  investigating Epstein's death as a criminal enterprise says the director of the bureau
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.400]  of prisons now let's get back to what I was covering last segment since we're in the whole
[25:26.400 --> 25:34.280]  comedy vein here swallow as well is on television he rises up sounds like there's a large amount
[25:34.280 --> 25:44.720]  of gas released and then it's confirmed that was indeed on the live feed so was it Chris
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.480]  Matthews or wasn't him and I'm simply saying whether it's something silly like this or
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.280]  babies and incubators to start the Iraq war that Saddam bashed the brains out of which
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.920]  didn't happen it's our right and our duty to question all of this but swallow as well
[25:57.920 --> 26:04.000]  as gotten very sanctimonious I got a call last night I don't know right after hardball ended
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.400]  from Millie Weaver and she said have you seen this and she sent me a link to it on Twitter
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.880]  that 10,000 views in five minutes it had 300,000 views and there were hundreds of versions of
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.560]  it this morning with millions of views apiece I mean just everywhere this is gone totally
[26:17.560 --> 26:25.880]  viral and the jokes the way people are riffing like jazz off of it calling in fart well saying
[26:25.880 --> 26:29.560]  it's the clearest thing he's ever said it's the most honest thing he's ever said I mean
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.800]  the jokes are incredible I spent about an hour last night an hour I'll never get back
[26:34.800 --> 26:39.000]  looking at all the jokes and this morning my phone was ringing dozens of people were
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.560]  sending it to me it's just funny how I can capture somebody imagination because it's
[26:44.560 --> 26:51.400]  not just hot air coming out of swallow as well or Eric fart well as he's now known it's
[26:51.400 --> 27:01.120]  that if you question him they get so upset they get so sanctimonious but for me and for
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.800]  others it brings up the fact that this is a man I can read the quote here there's an
[27:05.800 --> 27:12.640]  article on him for his dot com it quotes it by Tom Papert from national file dot com
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.600]  where he's the guy that threatened to nuke gun owners if they didn't turn their guns
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.240]  in he went further than that though he didn't say I'll just come to your door and confiscate
[27:20.240 --> 27:26.720]  him he said we'll use nuclear weapons on you so so I I want to speak to that later
[27:26.720 --> 27:30.200]  which is a very important issue not not that he made that threat that's important showing
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.000]  his mindset but the fact that the US had thousands of nuclear weapons and couldn't beat the Vietnamese
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.280]  because they wouldn't give up and you don't use nuclear weapons to kill armies you kill
[27:39.280 --> 27:44.760]  them to wipe out entire populations or damage infrastructure or foreign militaries you do
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.120]  it to wipe out civilization and if they try to take the guns that's what it'll do but
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.720]  it won't be nukes that are getting dropped it'll be a civil war that levels the leftist
[27:53.720 --> 28:00.560]  parasite establishment and once it starts if it does no mercy can be shown to these individuals
[28:00.560 --> 28:04.600]  they're gonna have to be totally routed out and I don't want to go down that road but
[28:04.600 --> 28:10.360]  if they keep pushing it with their pedophilic avarice that's where this whole thing is headed
[28:10.360 --> 28:15.680]  now I said I'd get to it this segment but I ran out of time when we come back which
[28:15.680 --> 28:21.080]  which story is true and which is false did South Dakota really say meth we're on it it's
[28:21.080 --> 28:26.480]  an article in fours dot com find out or did abc news really say justice genbergs admitted
[28:26.480 --> 28:32.480]  the hospital for routine emergency surgery misses next few oral arguments we'll hit that
[28:32.480 --> 28:36.920]  I promise right when we come out and then all the other news that I haven't even begun
[28:36.920 --> 28:42.120]  to scratch the surface on but it's fair to say the house of cards that's Jeffrey Epstein
[28:42.120 --> 28:47.480]  and the black no pedophile rings hasn't just fallen it's fallen and knocked a giant hole

[30:01.280 --> 30:10.280]  was once posed to thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take
[30:10.280 --> 30:16.200]  humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which
[30:16.200 --> 30:25.320]  other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless
[30:25.320 --> 30:33.040]  pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there
[30:33.040 --> 30:37.680]  is no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these
[30:37.680 --> 30:44.680]  rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[30:44.680 --> 30:50.520]  can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's

[30:55.560 --> 31:02.640]  people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them beto roark came out dozens
[31:02.640 --> 31:06.920]  of times and said we're gonna confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all
[31:06.920 --> 31:12.720]  the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think
[31:12.720 --> 31:17.480]  about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control their
[31:17.480 --> 31:23.880]  blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[31:23.880 --> 31:29.800]  and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the supreme
[31:29.800 --> 31:34.920]  courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals
[31:34.920 --> 31:39.760]  do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under such incredible
[31:39.760 --> 31:45.320]  attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second
[31:45.320 --> 31:49.560]  amendment and they're gonna follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're
[31:49.560 --> 31:54.320]  not gonna help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal
[31:54.320 --> 32:02.320]  aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws i've made a lot of predictions that have
[32:02.320 --> 32:07.720]  come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came
[32:07.720 --> 32:13.080]  out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their
[32:13.080 --> 32:18.160]  in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting us up to
[32:18.160 --> 32:24.200]  be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to
[32:24.200 --> 32:31.160]  to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so
[32:31.160 --> 32:37.440]  that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared was independent
[32:37.440 --> 32:43.680]  media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the information
[32:43.680 --> 32:49.080]  that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[32:49.080 --> 32:54.000]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air
[32:54.000 --> 33:14.560]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:14.560 --> 33:35.880]  ending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[33:35.880 --> 33:46.880]  thing i've noticed about really evil people is that they are what i call tone deaf how
[33:46.880 --> 33:54.480]  things they do come across and they may be really really cunning when it comes to doing
[33:54.480 --> 34:00.480]  evil corrupt things and conning people that are stupid and they can also tend to be extremely
[34:00.480 --> 34:10.760]  bold and because normal people aren't seeking out power and control we tend to just advocate
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.400]  the authority and step down and give it to them now i'm not saying that whoever came
[34:16.400 --> 34:26.680]  up with this pr anti drug campaign in south dakota's evil but they're either extremely
[34:26.680 --> 34:36.160]  autistic or so sociopathic that they don't even have a sense of humor and they don't
[34:36.160 --> 34:46.960]  have depth that you would find in a shallow rain puddle but you see this where the establishment
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.320]  does things that anybody who's conscious would tell them isn't going to go over well like
[34:52.320 --> 34:58.480]  hillary clinton looks like a jack o'lantern demon her face is scarier than the headless
[34:58.480 --> 35:05.160]  horsemen's the pumpkin he's got in his hand jack o'lantern nests but she does that shark
[35:05.160 --> 35:10.600]  face and that weird crazy smile everywhere in person and people actually are scared of
[35:10.600 --> 35:16.000]  her and there's a mass stock home syndrome where her followers deep down know she's a
[35:16.000 --> 35:23.360]  vicious warmongering child molester supporting criminal but then you have to ask the question
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.120]  why do all these leftists then follow her because they believe she's the big tough mommy that
[35:28.120 --> 35:34.000]  could get things done i was in an airport at the flight to la in august when jeffrey
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.760]  epstein was announced dead and we walked on the plane i shot a video in the plane before
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.520]  they closed the cabin door and i heard a whole bunch of leftist men and women couples most
[35:44.520 --> 35:51.160]  of middle age though we're glad she killed him that shows the world we're tough better
[35:51.160 --> 35:56.880]  than trump he'd never have the will to kill somebody like that and i talked about that
[35:56.880 --> 36:03.200]  at the time those people didn't realize what they sounded like but really it was because
[36:03.200 --> 36:10.760]  they were so weak and so soft like hillary that they project this power so other weak
[36:10.760 --> 36:14.960]  empty people then pick up on that and say well of this sack of garbage that can hardly
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.640]  walk has got half the world scared of her well then she must be powerful and i must
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.240]  be powerful so they're basically birds of a feather fly together now we've talked a lot
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.200]  about brian stelter in almost every photo of brian stelter that he officially releases
[36:30.200 --> 36:39.080]  through cnn as a public relations photo he looks like an abject demon let's do a wide
[36:39.080 --> 36:45.400]  shot please i mean zoom in on that and then show people that photo in hd that is the look
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.920]  of a homicidal child molester rapist in my view once saying he actually does it but let
[36:52.920 --> 36:59.200]  me tell you when kids are getting raped that's the type of face they see that's just a fact
[36:59.200 --> 37:07.000]  that is the face of the the demon now would you buy a car from him would you let him babysit
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.960]  your young son or daughter would you marry him no you'd run from him and then of course
[37:13.960 --> 37:20.080]  the book cover matches the interior he's an anti-free speech anti-american anti-gun anti-christian
[37:20.080 --> 37:27.360]  anti-god piece of filth but he in hundreds of publicity photos releases photos where
[37:27.360 --> 37:37.520]  he looks like a psychotic killer and that's a halloween mask right there that's a predator
[37:37.520 --> 37:45.520]  that's that's so into himself that he doesn't see what he is because to him it is a mask
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.600]  there's no smiling there's no happiness there's nothing but avarice and self loathing that
[37:50.600 --> 37:57.120]  he's projecting out i mean that is a sack of garbage right there look at that i mean
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.560]  just hundreds i'm fascinated with him because so many of these globalists you watch a CFR
[38:01.560 --> 38:06.840]  meeting they all act like that they'll smile and they all creep around everybody hates
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.960]  them women hate them society hates them that's why they like putting flora in your water
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.360]  and giving you deadly vaccines and running your life because that gives them that little
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.160]  added secret you don't know that they're really wrecking your life because yes he's a sack
[38:19.160 --> 38:25.160]  of garbage turned over to satan but he's putting poison in your water so he gets the last laugh
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.480]  he's coming for it now let me get back to what i was covering the reason this is so
[38:29.480 --> 38:35.640]  important is i saw this yesterday on info wars dot com the afternoon and i i thought it must
[38:35.640 --> 38:43.040]  have been a joke i i i didn't think it was serious and then last night i i i looked at
[38:43.040 --> 38:49.320]  and i said oh my god is this real i said paul watson doesn't write satire articles and sure
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.680]  enough it was real and then i began to go to the site the state website of south dakota
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.680]  and i began to look at dozens of ads they put out the first one is the symbol of the
[39:01.680 --> 39:09.960]  state a rectangle like a cow under hanging on the back and it says meth we're on it so
[39:09.960 --> 39:16.200]  that's kind of the meth titty right there the hind tit hanging off right there we take
[39:16.200 --> 39:21.040]  down the cube you can see it so that's like a big breast full of yellow meth they even
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.680]  made the state yellow i guess like meth is or some types of meth so meth we're on it
[39:27.680 --> 39:34.480]  looks like a disease mammary gland filled with poisonous methamphetamine now it gets
[39:34.480 --> 39:42.360]  better these are look at this meth we're on it football players mess i'm on it a black
[39:42.360 --> 39:50.840]  guy at a coffee shop mess i'm on it meth we're on it now how did this get approved who didn't
[39:50.840 --> 39:55.120]  see what it was and then how did it get passed down by government everyone too scared to
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.600]  saw it to say this is an insane idea you know i've tried to find out we don't know yet whoever
[40:00.600 --> 40:05.800]  the director of pr for the anti drug campaign the state's money i guarantee you came up
[40:05.800 --> 40:10.160]  with this they didn't want to tell he or she hey this is a terrible idea and is the most
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.640]  unintentional comedy in the universe but it's an example of how when you get it up down
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.840]  power structure to no one will is this who came up with it okay i'm gonna find out more
[40:19.840 --> 40:26.920]  during the break okay well then we'll we'll find you guys found it we'll we'll come back
[40:26.920 --> 40:37.600]  and tell you more so this person is either seriously autistic in my view or there's the
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.160]  funniest comedian ever but but but but it's not a joke now so so meth we're on it is a
[40:42.160 --> 40:51.880]  real campaign not speed kills methyl destroy your life losers use meth do that a prison
[40:51.880 --> 40:58.800]  if you use meth no meth we're on it meth i'm on it now there's the old cowboy old guy you
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.520]  wouldn't think he's on meth you don't have meth mouth but you know meth he's on it and
[41:03.520 --> 41:10.880]  it goes on and on there's a problem in South Dakota and we all need to get on it because
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.360]  together we can get meth out of here i guess by if you use it all up yeah there won't be
[41:15.360 --> 41:22.640]  any left in the state so this had to be done on purpose is a sick joke that's another thing
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.840]  these psychos will do some of them don't have any humor others do it's always a sick form
[41:27.840 --> 41:36.960]  of it but it shows the total disconnect that this was and oh i forgot last night the news
[41:36.960 --> 41:42.480]  was defending and it was like well this is a controversial ad campaign that's turning
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.520]  heads is it bad does it does it make sense the fact that we have to have a discussion
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.320]  like is cnn right that men can have babies
[41:52.320 --> 42:00.080]  no cnn's not right and they're just trying to get you to accept that if there's peer pressure
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.240]  you better let men and your girls showers
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.200]  and you better you know when the man shows up and he wants a pap smear done to his cervix
[42:09.760 --> 42:12.320]  you you better give him on even though he doesn't have a vagina
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.880]  all part of them training you in a cult to accept whatever they want whenever they want
[42:20.880 --> 42:25.520]  however they want so that's that
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.520]  and that's where we stand as a civilization that's where we stand as a society and it's
[42:33.520 --> 42:40.160]  very very dangerous and it's only getting worse because is this a sign of plunging IQs a sign
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.680]  of master mental illness we know that people don't have attention spans anymore every metric shows
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.920]  humanities and crisis and admitting that is going to lead us out of it admitting we have a problem
[42:49.920 --> 42:55.440]  finding out what the problem is and how to reverse it is key to our species let's do it together it's
[42:55.440 --> 43:03.040]  not work it's called survival i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.280]  you most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the
[43:09.280 --> 43:15.600]  globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.320]  when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to
[43:20.320 --> 43:28.640]  take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake
[43:28.640 --> 43:35.040]  whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.760]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[43:41.760 --> 43:47.920]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.200]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now
[43:53.200 --> 44:02.160]  more imperative and more vital than ever a question was once posed to thomas jefferson
[44:02.160 --> 44:11.920]  what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's
[44:11.920 --> 44:20.240]  their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is
[44:20.240 --> 44:28.320]  there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture in society
[44:28.320 --> 44:35.200]  that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very
[44:35.200 --> 44:42.720]  same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[44:42.720 --> 44:48.320]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[44:48.800 --> 44:55.040]  oxford's band clapping university's the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are
[44:55.040 --> 45:01.760]  dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them the globalists know that i will never
[45:01.760 --> 45:08.880]  willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in i will never give up but i could
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.280]  give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[45:15.840 --> 45:22.800]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most americans have already been silenced
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.960]  in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that
[45:28.960 --> 45:36.160]  most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word
[45:36.160 --> 45:41.920]  about news wars dot com info wars dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the
[45:41.920 --> 45:47.520]  truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the banned truth they don't want you to have
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.200]  is it info wars dot com forward slash show and banned on video so take heart folks they've had to
[45:53.200 --> 45:57.920]  censor everybody and show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair
[45:57.920 --> 46:04.560]  and square i spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.960]  that without you we won't be on the air and i spent a lot of time thanking you but i really
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.200]  think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.000]  better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres but something i should spend more time on
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.560]  is just reminding you that these products are really amazing you've got that pledge from me but
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.440]  you've seen the third party test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements
[46:31.440 --> 46:36.800]  are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere
[46:36.800 --> 46:44.560]  else that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's not a burden to support info wars it really
[46:44.560 --> 46:51.280]  is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.160]  life and your family's life and your children's life so much better so visit info wars store
[46:56.160 --> 47:17.600]  dot com today you're listening to the alex jones show

[47:29.280 --> 47:48.960]  it's alex jones
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.640]  so

[48:06.720 --> 48:13.760]  and that creature imagine what his mission is take down america launch operations
[48:13.760 --> 48:21.280]  create post-human world exterminate on all sapiens make way
[48:27.760 --> 48:33.120]  all right we are back let me finish up with this because it is really a window into the mind
[48:33.120 --> 48:38.880]  of bureaucracy and yes man south dakota governor we don't know who came up with the
[48:38.880 --> 48:46.480]  meth we're on it as the new state motto south dakota governor doubles down on bizarre anti
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.760]  drug campaign targeting meth where it shows groups of people saying we're on it
[48:54.720 --> 49:02.080]  and others individually saying i'm on it and of course they're not backing down
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.160]  they're defending it ladies and gentlemen those articles are up on info wars dot com right now
[49:08.160 --> 49:15.040]  meth we're on it south dakota's anti-meth campaign raises eyebrows well don't ask questions government
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.680]  just said that now the ruth bader ginsberg story is not true just as genberg admitted to hospital
[49:21.680 --> 49:26.080]  for routine emergency surgery misses an x fewer arguments that's because they keep saying oh she's
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.320]  in great health she just had three or four surgeries this year has pancreatic cancer that most people
[49:30.320 --> 49:38.640]  only live about four months 98 per cent died within one year but if you question that you're a
[49:38.640 --> 49:45.840]  conspiracy theorist but that is a joke meme the thing on south carolina uh is not ladies and
[49:45.840 --> 49:51.200]  gentlemen and that's just par for the course but if you believe that men can have babies
[49:51.200 --> 50:00.000]  well then you believe that saying meth we're on it means that uh you're on the problem
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.280]  of course it turns out the dare program and things in the 1980s and early 90s actually
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.200]  caused people to get on drugs because they come in and advertise you tell you how to use it and
[50:11.200 --> 50:17.360]  turns out the leftist controlled cia was shipping it in and put out the crack cocaine recipe doesn't
[50:17.360 --> 50:22.400]  mean the whole government did that but that's what went on that's declassified just like they put
[50:22.400 --> 50:26.800]  fluoride in our water to lower our cues and give us cancer just like the vaccines are spiked on
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.840]  record cancer viruses and so many other things there's an agenda to dumb us down by the scientific
[50:33.840 --> 50:39.200]  elite that's international and have international treaties with the un and they're working against
[50:39.200 --> 50:44.720]  america and they use the compartmentalization and the magnitude of the crimes they're committing
[50:44.720 --> 50:54.560]  against us to hope that it's so huge we just can't even believe it or don't even want to tackle it
[50:55.760 --> 51:01.520]  when really there is a post-human anti-human agenda going on what's running it the devil
[51:05.040 --> 51:11.440]  aliens whatever you think's running it that's the agenda you can't deny that you can't deny
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.880]  fluoride's putting the water to brain damage you and lower fertility and it does massively
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.680]  you can't deny that 5g massively grows cancers you just pull that up it's all admitted major
[51:21.680 --> 51:28.400]  studies you can't deny that gmo is leaking rna and dna into our cells and causing cancer mutations
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.840]  you can't deny any of this you can't deny it's being deployed and done by design you can't deny
[51:35.840 --> 51:39.280]  that they're dumbing people down through the educational system and then you can read it in
[51:39.280 --> 51:42.880]  government documents and wiki leaks that they admit they're doing it you can't deny there's a
[51:42.880 --> 51:49.440]  program to break up the family you can't deny any of it ladies and gentlemen because it's a fact
[51:51.760 --> 51:58.960]  and it's going on guys can i have my uh folder over there on dna force please i forgot to put
[51:58.960 --> 52:04.880]  that back on my desk and i need that please i want to plug dna force right now and then i'm
[52:04.880 --> 52:11.040]  going to get back into the news but but speaking of the subject that i was uh just covering here's
[52:11.040 --> 52:17.520]  the governor of south dakota defending the meth we're on it campaign solutions and hope and how
[52:17.520 --> 52:24.880]  every single one of us in south dakota can partner to be on meth um really the tagline is i'm on meth
[52:24.880 --> 52:29.600]  and what it's talking about is that each one of us no matter who we are that we're on the case of
[52:29.600 --> 52:33.120]  meth that we're protecting our family we're protecting our friends we're protecting our
[52:33.120 --> 52:38.880]  communities from this epidemic that we see and that we're all going to be taking some responsibility
[52:38.880 --> 52:42.400]  and battling it and making sure that it's not going to have a place here in our state in the
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.800]  future so i left at the other studio last night i did all of i would show your state so a little
[52:48.800 --> 52:59.360]  just be in there thank you um that is a shocking video isn't it way more shocking and swallow
[52:59.360 --> 53:06.320]  as well farting on national television was a big one though and even lifts up you know get it out
[53:06.320 --> 53:14.080]  of there because she's saying the same slogan over and over again is a sick joke i'm on meth
[53:14.080 --> 53:20.880]  you're on meth the shows we're on meth together always doubling down never saying it was a bad idea
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.480]  that's how from the top guarantee people said this is a terrible idea but whoever was on top said no
[53:26.480 --> 53:30.800]  we're going ahead with it i didn't know this video existed to the governor 20 minutes ago and i
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.080]  first heard talking about this on air i said but you know somebody up top doubled down and said no
[53:36.080 --> 53:43.040]  we're going ahead with this a national campaign i guess is all the kid out do this of saying america's
[53:43.040 --> 53:51.920]  on meth and then people complain they just doubled down and say no it's a good campaign
[53:51.920 --> 53:58.080]  but it really shows the pigheadedness and the insanity of these individuals now
[53:59.600 --> 54:03.440]  we have a guest scheduled to be in studio next hour and i'll tell you about that guest once
[54:03.440 --> 54:07.840]  they're here but it's a really really big subject and it ties into everything we're talking about
[54:07.840 --> 54:16.240]  so that's coming up um let me first though just tell you about dna force plus dna force plus
[54:16.240 --> 54:22.080]  this is something that could save this country and could save the planet and that's not an
[54:22.080 --> 54:28.000]  exaggeration that's that's really true if people take action and expose globalism and its anti
[54:28.000 --> 54:37.200]  human agenda then we'll be able to really change the world together in a big big way
[54:37.200 --> 54:47.280]  so that's just on its face and buying this product funds our operation and makes our
[54:47.280 --> 54:53.120]  operation possible so if this was full of sawdust it would be a really great thing to
[54:53.120 --> 55:01.120]  fund their operation it's not dna force plus has the pqq and the coq 10 in it of the very
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.360]  best types you can find out there with a lot of other things that mother nature has produced
[55:05.360 --> 55:10.160]  that are known to help it get past the blood brain barrier and into your cells and pqq is
[55:10.160 --> 55:18.800]  certified in legions of studies to help regrow mitochondria and make the cells last and live
[55:18.800 --> 55:26.000]  longer and it's known to make telomeres in the dna last longer and not divide as fast so they
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.000]  don't grow telomeres they just make the telomeres not shrink as fast which is the same thing from
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.440]  another direction and then it's got these other known ingredients in it that are just incredible
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.840]  you talk about skin health heart health brain health every cell in your body and it's the
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.960]  japanese that over a decade ago discovered this and it's the number one product pqq and coq 10
[55:48.960 --> 55:53.360]  together are the number one thing in japan they are the longest lived people on the world for any
[55:53.360 --> 56:00.560]  large industrialized nation and now it's all the rage here we we we brought you dna force plus
[56:00.560 --> 56:06.640]  i guess it was uh five and a half years ago and said it was the next big thing and it is and it
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.640]  really deserves the next big thing and now it's being adopted all over but if you go to the story
[56:10.640 --> 56:16.720]  you'll see little bitty bottles of coq 10 or pqq for 30 40 50 bucks a lot of it's synthetic it's not
[56:16.720 --> 56:23.920]  high quality and it's overpriced you get a big bottle of this if you try to get something similar
[56:23.920 --> 56:29.120]  to this at a lot of what they call medical clinics that are called clinical class they still
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.760]  they still mark it up five to seven times so it's 300 bucks 400 then they mark it down to 200
[56:34.320 --> 56:37.200]  and because your doctor's selling it to you it's not prescription but you still pay it
[56:38.160 --> 56:44.640]  if you get this at his regular price of 140 it's a great deal but at half price it's 74
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.480]  dollars right now and when we first came out with this it was costing us 50 something bucks a bottle
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.480]  i signed a two-year contract you made it even stronger got a better deal on it so it's not
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.880]  costing us that much that bottle but it's still costing close to that and you're not going to get
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.440]  pqq and coq 10 with these other ingredients at this level anywhere near this price anywhere
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.800]  and other places you buy it are our globalist or new world order and are funding going for your
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.720]  guns going for your family trying to destroy our sovereignty so getting your pqq and your coq 10
[57:16.720 --> 57:22.160]  and these other great products that are in one pill from us is a total no-brainer at 360 win
[57:22.160 --> 57:30.400]  info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine again triple eight two
[57:30.400 --> 57:36.960]  five three three one three nine and just commit to get dna force plus at info war store dot com
[57:36.960 --> 57:40.960]  today and we can continue to operate and hopefully expand the face the globalist who are working
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.920]  around the clock to shut us down we'll be back with hour number two please stay with us
[57:45.920 --> 57:54.640]  there's a famous quote by marine corps general in the korean war when three million
[57:54.640 --> 58:01.440]  chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some
[58:01.440 --> 58:07.360]  estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general
[58:07.360 --> 58:13.600]  were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point
[58:13.600 --> 58:19.760]  that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this
[58:19.760 --> 58:27.520]  far without all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[58:27.520 --> 58:32.640]  becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[58:33.200 --> 58:39.760]  when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking
[58:39.760 --> 58:46.000]  out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist
[58:50.240 --> 58:55.280]  i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you most of those really
[58:55.280 --> 59:01.520]  weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i
[59:01.520 --> 59:07.520]  could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting
[59:07.520 --> 59:13.680]  a sub to bd platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air
[59:13.680 --> 59:21.200]  to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that
[59:21.200 --> 59:27.760]  their false narratives couldn't be opposed but the globalists really feared was independent media
[59:27.760 --> 59:34.240]  and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the information that had
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.160]  to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil
[59:40.160 --> 59:45.360]  they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and
[59:45.360 --> 1:00:07.440]  more vital than ever you're listening to the alex jones show welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:15.920]  well the video is posted up on infowars.com fbi now treating epstein's death as a criminal matter
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:20.400]  that's right if you're receiving this transmission you are the resistance fbi now
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:25.360]  treating epstein's death as a criminal matter they have the video of that congressional
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:33.440]  testimony and the house of cards is coming down very very quickly but the system's striking back
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:38.160]  and persecuting people especially pro-lifers and unprecedented ways and david night's
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:42.400]  going to be in studio with me next segment to lay it out but there is a lot of good news happening
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:48.480]  and prince andrew's a big part of that house of cards coming down creepyest portion of the duke
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:55.600]  of york prince andrew's recent wall of denial tv interview was his strange response when asked if
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:02.240]  he had any regrets for having known international sex trafficking pimp jeffrey ebsting you said
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.120]  you went to break up the relationship and yet you stayed at that new york mansion several
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:11.440]  days i'm wondering how i was doing a number of other things while i was there but you were
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:18.800]  staying at the house of a convicted sex offender it was a convenient place to stay there is i mean
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:27.120]  i've gone through this in my mind so many times at the end of the day um uh with the benefit of
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:34.480]  all the hindsight that one can have um it was definitely the wrong thing to do um but at the
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:39.120]  time i felt it was the it was the honorable and right thing to do i had to go and see him
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:44.000]  i had to stay with him and stay in the house i could easily have gone and stayed somewhere else
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:50.960]  but but sheer convenience of of of being able to get a hold of the man is was i mean he's he was
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  he was in and out all over the place so getting him in one place for a period of time to actually
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.560]  have a a long enough conversation to say look these are the reasons why i'm not going to and
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:08.080]  that happened on the walk other than that admission prince andrew had an answer for everything
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:14.800]  concerning his alleged illegal relationship with ebsting sex slave virginia roberts seemingly
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:21.280]  scripted and well rehearsed in order to curb the ebsting embarrassment plaguing buckingham palace
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:25.600]  prince andrew says that on the night of march the tent he couldn't have been dancing and having
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:31.840]  sex with a teenager because he was in suburban woking taking his daughter Beatrice to a party
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:41.360]  here at pizza express i'd taken Beatrice to uh a pizza express in working for a party at a
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:46.880]  i suppose sort of four five in the afternoon um and then because the dutchess was away
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.640]  we have a simple rule in the in the family that that that when one's away the other one's there
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:58.560]  i was on terminal leave at the time um from the royal navy so therefore i was at home
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:03.200]  why would you remember that so specifically why would you remember a pizza express birthday and
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:08.960]  being at home because going to pizza express in woking is an unusual thing for me to do
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:15.040]  a very unusual thing for me to do i've never been i've only been through woking a couple of times
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:21.600]  and i remember it weirdly distinctly but as soon as somebody reminds me of it i went oh yes i remember
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:28.720]  that isn't it odd how andrew's story changed early on when everything broke he never denied at least
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:34.800]  knowing robert said now i have no recollection of ever meeting this lady and then there is the
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:40.960]  sweat claim virginia jeffrey says on their first encounter she and prince andrew danced at tramp
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:48.000]  nightclub she recalls him being a hideous dancer and sweating profusely she was very specific about
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:55.440]  that night she described dancing with you and you profusely sweating and that she went on to have
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:03.360]  bath possibly there's a slight problem with with with with with the sweating um because uh i i
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:11.440]  have a peculiar medical condition which is that i don't sweat um or i didn't sweat at the time
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:19.120]  and that was oh is she yes i didn't sweat at the time because i um had suffered what i would
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:27.200]  describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the falcons war when i was shot at uh and i simply it was it
[1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:34.800]  was almost impossible for me to sweat regardless many photos of a sweaty prince andrew prove otherwise
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:40.640]  prince andrew did reveal at least one thing from his interview it would be that him and his fellow
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:47.760]  elite scumbags that deny all wrongdoing from high places continue to be virtually impenetrable
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:57.280]  i think that photo has been faked nobody can prove uh whether or not um that that photograph is
[1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:05.280]  a question was once posed to thomas deverson what is the level of tyranny
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:12.720]  that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:22.640]  limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:30.960]  bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture in society that evil doesn't exist or that there's
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:36.400]  no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these rules for us
[1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:43.120]  about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:49.840]  they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band clapping
[1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:55.200]  university's the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:06:04.720]  and it's time to reject them there are of course those who do not want us to speak we think just
[1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:10.480]  let me think even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will be on their
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:16.800]  words it's chances that that's why because while the truncheon may be used loo of conversation
[1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:23.280]  words will always retain their power words are for the means to meaning and for those who will
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:30.320]  listen the annunciation of truth that the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this
[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:34.400]  country isn't that you designed it sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in
[1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:39.760]  longer cruelty and injustice intolerance and oppression and where once you have the freedom
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:45.520]  to object to something can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:51.440]  coercing your conformity and so getting your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:57.760]  blame certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable
[1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:03.360]  but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:12.160]  i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:18.960]  a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:25.120]  the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.880]  you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:44.880]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:49.760]  has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:02.160]  and ladies and gentlemen we are live into the second hour and our co-host david night who
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:07.200]  hosted a bit night show weekday mornings 8 a.m to 11 a.m is with me i was watching his show
[1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:14.560]  yesterday and it was so informative going into what's happened in texas and what's happened
[1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:22.160]  in california and other areas where the judiciary is going after activists that go into these
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:27.360]  laboratories and these Planned Parenthood facilities that are selling baby parts and
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:32.560]  promising to sell people live babies and we've seen the governor of virginia talk about keeping
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:36.800]  babies alive to keep them comfortable and then harvesting their organs we're talking about that
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:42.640]  next segment because there was a ruling last week by a particular judge that one that continues
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:48.000]  to try to overturn trump uh saying that uh you know exposing this is the criminal action
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:53.520]  and so we're really seeing judicial tyranny uh really bipartisanly a lot of republican judges
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:59.360]  have done it as well the judiciary uh truly in many cases has become a dangerous tyranny
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:02.880]  it was our forebears talked about the out of control judiciary of king george the third
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:09.120]  one of the reasons we went to war in 1776 and we were rapidly approaching that point one can
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.920]  just look at the ongoing kangaroo public hearings the third round are now public but still highly
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:19.040]  controlled uh happening where we're no evidence of any crimes being brought forward uh but everybody
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.200]  felt like what the president did was bad it's david great to have you here with us i wanted
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:30.000]  to get into just this current history we're in and what you would call this period because a lot
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:36.240]  of people i know get frustrated they get upset with the president and with the justice department
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:41.680]  not taking action against the censorship against the racketeering against the organized abuse of
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:46.880]  nationalists and christians and others uh really precursors like we saw in the soviet union people
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:52.000]  being persecuted the christian internationalist or in the in the lead up to hitler and the things
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:59.280]  that he did it all started the way it's starting now in germany in 1933 34 35 and in the old
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:05.600]  soviet union on 1917 1820 21 22 took them a few years to get going as well i mean we know what this
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:13.280]  is it's classical tyranny what would you call this period i would say that it is uh a weaponization
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  of the legal system and this is a strategy that democrats have adopted across the board not just
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:22.400]  against president trump but against whistleblowers everywhere because right after the election you
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:27.920]  had obama and eric holder talk about how they were going to have a number of lawsuits so we're
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:34.320]  going to challenge uh basically redistricting gerrymandering which is something that has been
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:40.080]  there from the very beginning uh the the party in power and state gets to draw the uh jurisdictional
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  lines but what they've not been able to accomplish and win at the ballot box alex they have decided
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:50.400]  that they're going to do in the courtroom and that's really what they're doing with president
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:57.600]  trump as well and so we see them weaponizing the judicial system across the board uh you know with
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:02.640]  with these impeachment proceedings but the same thing is happening at every different level if
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:06.880]  they don't like you politically they will come after you to destroy you whether it's uh roger
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:13.600]  stone or whether it's these um these whistleblowers who are doing legitimate journalistic investigation
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:18.560]  undercover investigation this is a violation now of not only the first amendment but there were many
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.200]  many violations in this particular trial in california came out the same day later in the same day
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.400]  as the roger stone verdict uh this was something that was a trial that was going on for six weeks
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:32.960]  and they took very little time and what came out of the trial was they were advertising to
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:38.320]  stanford we can deliver whole babies with beating hearts yeah that means living babies they declare
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:43.040]  them dead uh and and and then you know uh said that they're not resuscitated meaning we don't count
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:49.600]  them as as a legal human three of the via the bioethics board but the babies are being kept alive
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:54.960]  just incredible things and this judge presided over this macabre to then turn around we're
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:59.200]  going to hit that next segment and this is something i really don't do a good enough job of
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:05.920]  just this morning we've got a big high powered dc lawyer here and i can't get into what's going
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:12.560]  on there but you know they filed over 30 lawsuits against this operation uh and and uh they you know
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:18.640]  they did all of these things and those are ongoing court battles uh and i've talked to all these
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:23.760]  different law firms and they say in these cases in austin and in virginia and in connecticut
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:29.440]  they have and in san francisco this is the same judge that uh just did this ruling had one of our
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:34.240]  cases and i'm not going to get into what happened but let me tell you it was unbelievable uh and
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:40.320]  they just tell you up front what they're going to do to you uh and uh judge jackson laughed from
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.800]  the bench at everybody and was cackling like an actual witch and snorting this was in the news
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:49.840]  yeah roger's trial is cackling and snorting and so people say well we better shut up and get into
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:55.680]  them no everybody better get politically active and double down we're not backing down and i can't
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:01.280]  get into strategy i have ways as long as i don't die or get put in prison and i even have ways
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:06.560]  there where they're not going to shut down this operation okay but it takes a lot of money and
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:11.040]  so that's another reason i wanted to get uh david on when you hear all the things with this case
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:19.520]  remember i can't get into my cases at this point for strategic reasons uh but again never before seen
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:26.080]  by the law firms i've got and i've had other ones look at it and this is beyond railroading okay
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:32.400]  but again that's where we are our forebears had to die to give us this country uh we're going through
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:36.800]  a lot of hell and and that and that may happen too so people better decide which side they're on
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:42.000]  but capitulating to this is a fate worse than death and i'd rather die on my feet than die a
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  thousand deaths on my knees looking boots in a ditch but when you spread the word about the
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.360]  broadcast when you buy the products well when you pray for us when you do all of those things
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.040]  it keeps us in the game to the absolute enragement of the globalist so thank you all for your support
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:01.200]  but remember what you're about here from david is also happening to us it's it's happening project
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:06.720]  veritas this is a war yeah and we can see it at the upper level with president trump
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.880]  when he comes in and he says well i'm gonna put restrictions on people coming in from countries
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.560]  that obama has gone to war with for example they say well that's a muslim band and we're gonna stop
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:20.240]  it all it takes is one federal judge now we assume uh that it just takes one federal judge to black
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:26.000]  ball any policy from the president and of course when he had those seven countries uh venezuela
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.720]  is not muslim and neither is north korea but they called it a muslim band that left five muslim
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:35.760]  countries but there's 50 muslim countries so he restricted travel from 10 of the muslim countries
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:40.640]  they called it a muslim band they can do anything they want alex because the the strategy that they've
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:47.440]  taken both with the president and then with any individual journalists or whistleblowers or any
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:53.440]  other organizations they use the criminal justice system and i talked about that yesterday i said
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.800]  it's kind of like the the scene from Breaking Bad where one of the guys is in trouble and the guy
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:03.680]  says you need a criminal lawyer and he says i got a criminal lawyer and he goes no i mean a criminal
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:09.280]  lawyer well we've got a criminal justice system because they're not bound by any law they make
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:12.960]  up the law they write the law they whether we're talking about marriage or we're talking about
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:18.640]  abortion i mean this is just one of these issues whenever they can't win in the ballot box or they
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:25.680]  can't win in public opinion they just mandate this and they rig the system as they see fit and so
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.640]  that's just one of the many aspects that we're seeing here and the the fact that this is about
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:37.680]  taking innocent life is just icing on the cake well that's right they really crossed the big
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:44.160]  indelible red line here that they came out in the case which is incredible keeping babies alive
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:52.400]  harvesting their organs and the judge then viciously civilly convicts the heroes wow well that judge

[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:14.640]  globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:19.360]  when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:27.680]  take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:34.080]  whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:40.800]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:46.960]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:52.240]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:20:08.160]  more imperative and more vital than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:38.160]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:43.920]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide and the social engineers want to train us not to appreciate
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:48.720]  human life they want to train us not to defend each other they want to train us to not take care of
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:53.600]  our our young and any species that's taught to hate itself and and and taught to not stick
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:59.440]  together and taught to target its young and to kill its young is a species that will not
[1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:05.200]  be around very long uh look at some of these headlines stem cell express ceo admits selling
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:13.600]  baby beating hearts intact baby heads in the pre-trial hearing this was a few months ago
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:21.920]  ago in san francisco now here's another one selling baby scalps the ghastly practices of
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:28.000]  Planned Parenthood this has got quotes out of the court body part buyers were scalping the babies
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:34.720]  Planned Parenthood trial reveals and then of course your big report on info wars dot com
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:42.480]  Planned Parenthood judge punishes baby parts whistleblower and the folks that exposed it
[1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:49.360]  so so let's get into this and uh this this ruling and what she's done to these to these heroes
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:54.000]  yeah you know alex what you were just talking about there uh if we allow this to happen to the
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:59.280]  most innocent among us i mean look at what's going on with china it's uh we've had testimony
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:04.400]  after testimony from whistleblowers in china who have escaped uh some of these uh facilities or
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:13.280]  witnessed this they are doing live organ harvesting from adults and if we don't support the innocent
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:18.800]  life this is going to be done to all of us it's not just the babies uh those you know we're not
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:23.600]  superior to them in any way shape or form and what happened on friday alex those again it was a
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:29.360]  trial that lasted for about six weeks the jury took absolutely no time to arrive at a verdict just
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:34.800]  like uh they didn't with roger stone because the verdict was already booked in uh cooked into uh
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:41.920]  what the judge had done there they put a 2.3 million dollar fine against the people who had
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:47.680]  blown the whistle about this uh you know of what i would call murder for hire and trafficking and
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:54.080]  baby parts uh against the people center for medical progress david leiden and those uh who
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:00.320]  did the reporting they did this under the riko statue that's the racketeer influenced and corrupt
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:05.760]  organization statue that by the way has been used against other pro-life people in the past
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:11.280]  very famously in the 1990s you had a pastor and perhaps you're familiar with him randy alcorn
[1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:18.640]  he's written a lot of books uh he over a period of nine months uh he um over a period of 12 months
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:24.320]  rather he appeared nine times at an abortion clinic they blocked the doors and peaceful civil
[1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:31.280]  disobedience to talk to people who were having abortions they charged him with racketeering
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.640]  influence corrupt organizations they got an 8.2 million dollar judgment against him and even
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:41.920]  though he was a very successful author he decided that he wasn't going to pay them a dime and so he
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:46.720]  lived off of what the court would allow him a minimal amount of money he did it for 20 years
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:52.720]  until the judgment expired even though he had big big hits i mean he's written books uh fiction
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:58.480]  books novels he did one about the underground christian church in china safely home he wrote a
[1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:03.760]  book about heaven which was very big a few years ago and so he made a lot of money but he didn't
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:10.160]  give a single dime to plan parenthood because plan parenthood is a racketeering organization and you
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:15.120]  can see it from these undercover videos what's really amazing about this alex is the irregularities
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:23.040]  in this trial this judge was a bundler for obama and he was given a judgeship there he was also
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:29.360]  however very specific to this case a conflict of interest he was a founder of an abortion clinic
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:34.800]  in northern california and so of course that's a a major conflict of interest uh the defense
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:39.920]  attorneys tried to get him removed he didn't have the integrity to remove himself and the judicial
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:44.320]  system did not have the integrity to remove him either they covered up for him and they
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:53.360]  let him preside over this case and uh he also then alex told the jurors that uh the the investigators
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.520]  were guilty because they had trespassed he said there's no question that they trespassed
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:02.400]  they're guilty you're so you trespassed to save a woman tied up who's about to have her organs
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.960]  harvested he would say it's okay they killed the woman they trespassed no that's not how
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:10.880]  whistleblowing works it's not you know let's say you broke your neighbor's house because the guy
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:15.520]  was killing his wife he wouldn't be trespassed that's in law that if there's extenuating
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:20.960]  circumstances they were showing what is admitted to be illegal that's why the democrat party run
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  states like california virginia uh new york and other areas are passing laws to keep babies alive
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:32.240]  and kill them if the bioethics board says the mother didn't want it they call that not resuscitating
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:38.080]  the heart still beating the babies alive they're just passing the baby into another world saying
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:44.560]  we choose to say it's not a human that's bioethics that's right and when we were talking about trespassing
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.360]  i mean this was not a protest that these people were doing they had an appointment uh they were
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.720]  invited in to talk to these people about business you know the business of baby body uh parts and so
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:26:00.400]  but this judge blocked the jury from seeing these videos oh that's right that's right they made
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:05.440]  appointments they were invited in about the prospect of buying baby parts which they ended
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:10.880]  up could have doing so it wasn't even a fraud but they invited them in still the judge so it
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:15.760]  wasn't even trespassing fraud on top of fraud yeah yeah it wasn't a threat to protect a bunch
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:20.160]  of people trying to sell baby parts and i think that you know clearly we understand because we've
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:24.960]  watched these videos we know that if the jury had seen this they would have seen these people saying
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  hey i want a lamborghini you know i want to yeah let's let's do this i can get exactly what you
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.440]  need you didn't do the full head we can do the full head uh want to be a heart yeah exactly you
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:37.120]  want a beating heart and that was one of the key things as well you know he was saying well
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.720]  they didn't have any reason to investigate this in 2000 you had uh congress investigating that
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:49.920]  actually had uh 2020 abc did an expose about a planned parenthood clinic that was in kansas
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:57.600]  and that clinic was selling baby parts and then in 2012 there was also the uh stem x express was
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:02.720]  saying that they were uh using fetal hearts and they were using fetal hearts that needed to be
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:06.880]  taken from babies that were still alive and so because of all of these different things they
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.840]  had a reason to do an investigative report and so this wasn't under false pretenses they weren't
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.840]  inventing a crime i mean the judge is saying there's no reason to investigate and you're not
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.000]  journalist uh in fact they're in court cases against me they're trying to argue in court oh he
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.960]  doesn't have protection some of the law of a journalist we say jones isn't well once they do
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:27.920]  that they can strip everyone of that as well that's right that's right what they're doing is they're
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:33.840]  stripping america's rights that people fought and died for including say imagine 30 years ago if you
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:38.400]  heard people would be getting multi-million dollar judgments against them for calling up and saying
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:44.400]  i want to buy live babies oh come on down we've got them for you and then you're the bad guy
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.240]  that's america today in the blue cities which have become abodes of evil the bible talks about
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:56.720]  wicked places wicked areas where the evil congregate they take over the cities they and then they do
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:03.280]  whatever they want whatever imagine the crime going on in san francisco if we know about this
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:10.000]  24 000 reports of human feces they think that about one out of a hundred gets reported
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:15.200]  tens of thousands of needles tens of thousands of assaults why are these places when we come
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:22.640]  back david sinking into hell on fire collapsing why everywhere that evil abodes do you see this
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:28.960]  oh yeah well this is san francisco of course and the plan parenthood council actually lied
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.280]  in court and said that uh they knew about this stuff and they didn't follow police report they
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:38.720]  actually did but of course at san francisco the police don't care you know that has a new meaning

[1:30:03.680 --> 1:30:10.480]  chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:16.400]  estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:22.640]  were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point
[1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:28.560]  that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone
[1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:36.560]  this far without all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:41.120]  becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:47.520]  silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:53.440]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform
[1:30:53.440 --> 1:31:03.360]  that checkmates the globalist a question was once posed to thomas deverson what is the level
[1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:11.760]  of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit
[1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:20.160]  and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no
[1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:28.320]  limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:34.240]  doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very
[1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:41.760]  saint people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:47.280]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:54.080]  oxford's band clapping universities the u.s of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are
[1:31:54.080 --> 1:32:01.520]  dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them beto roark came out dozens of times and said
[1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:06.400]  we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:12.720]  stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:19.120]  taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with
[1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:25.280]  needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know
[1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:30.960]  what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:36.240]  sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen
[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:41.680]  this country is under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:45.680]  they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:51.040]  rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot
[1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:55.280]  of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:02.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:04.480]  so
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:18.560]  aborted babies incinerated to eat the uk hospitals
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:26.080]  silent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people but now children are literally being
[1:33:26.080 --> 1:33:32.880]  passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the uk they're being sacrificed on the altar
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:42.720]  of efficiency and prosperity that is the secret of silent green the powdered flesh from dead babies
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:48.800]  some people believe they can cure disease because of its enormous popularity silent green is in
[1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:56.720]  short supply remember tuesday is silent green day the supply of silent green has been exhausted
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:58.480]  you must evacuate the area
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:07.920]  is that the rule that the shareholders of pepsico big builder bird group company are not allowed to
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:14.800]  know uh what they're using the baby parts for for in the flavoring but we already know so enjoy
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:18.880]  the flavor we're going to get the real solution which is going to be a combination of death panels
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:25.280]  and and sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death i'm for assisted suicide i'm for regular zones
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:29.760]  i'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million dollars on that last three months of
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:37.520]  life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those ten teachers and to make that
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:41.920]  credit for medical costs but that's called the death panel uh and you're not supposed to have
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:49.360]  that discussion they told me to uh to say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:01.840]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:07.920]  its children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that kind of
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:13.920]  society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quizlings
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:20.960]  and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult the scoops are on
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:29.360]  their way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way you will find out why
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:46.000]  soylent green means life you will find out why soylent green means death you've got to warn them
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:59.040]  we're being taught to have a collapse civilization we're going to go back
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:05.680]  to the latest on the baby park farms all over america and how different uh judicial tyrants
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:13.760]  are trying to persecute people hoping everybody else gets scared and runs the other direction
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:19.840]  well folks aren't mad at trump because they've been persecuted for supporting him
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:24.000]  folks are mad because trump hasn't taken action yet against this tyranny but it's
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:28.560]  not too late for that to happen and things take time so i still have faith that we need to put
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:35.440]  pressure on them i just want to tell the listeners that dna force plus is not made out of people
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:42.000]  it's made out of coq 10 and pqq and i was looking to really repush this flagship product and went
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:47.280]  back and researched what's in it again why it's so important there are certified mainline studies on
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:54.320]  coq 10 that it's known to be able to regrow or relive and reactivate
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:37:00.160]  heart tissue that dies in heart attacks it's still there but doesn't work anymore it makes it work
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:06.560]  again look that up hell let me just show you some of the studies instead of just saying that i mean
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:11.280]  i've gone over this you need to look at this for yourself and then it's got all these other great
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:21.440]  ingredients in it organic reese astragalus membranous root extract elv atp and so much
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:28.080]  more and it's of the organically derived type now i want to explain what that means a lot of pqq
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:35.120]  coq 10 is synthetic doesn't work the same none of the places it's extracted is really organic
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:41.680]  they have modified bacteria production it's very expensive to get tens of thousands of dollars a
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:49.200]  kilo just for the pqq okay and the pqq has been proven you can say that it makes telomeres last
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:56.400]  longer it regrows the insides of cells the mitochondria including in brain tissue you
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:00.560]  really need to go research it info or store.com go read the thousands of five star reviews
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:08.000]  this is the highest quality you're going to find anywhere everybody owes it to themselves
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.280]  their families to get it similar formulas are sold in medical facilities not by prescription but by
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:19.840]  the doctors with five to seven times markup of three hundred four dollars this is a great deal at 130
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.800]  but it's a really good deal at seventy four dollars right now it is 50 off and free shipping
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:30.400]  dna force plus then for store.com now we have other products you know that are a lot lower price
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:35.440]  that are high quality because it doesn't have the huge cost of pqq and coq 10 the other things this
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:41.280]  is a very good dose of it synergistically and if everybody gets it everybody needs to take it
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:44.880]  at least one pill a day this is as close to the fountain as you're going to get
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:52.960]  and then it funds the info war total 361 and then separately this new toothpaste is not designed

[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:31.520]  because it cost a lot less to make super blue that said though this has a lot of patented

[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:12.000]  points as well okay david for this segment the next we we played that intro from six years ago
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.240]  yeah uh the darren mcgrain put together from you and i talking on the show about the uk saying
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.840]  we're heating the hospitals with baby bodies that's done to dehumanize that that's done to
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.560]  to to to do not have sanctity of life so we don't stand up for each other it's very very simple
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:31.840]  yeah and you want to look at uh what happened with the governor of virginia ralph northern
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:35.040]  when he said well we just set the baby over on site and we keep it comfortable
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:39.040]  you know america was outraged about that now it's because they didn't understand what was
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:43.840]  going on they didn't know that explain to them david well going back i've talked to fellow macalire
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.440]  several times and of course uh he put together with another author they put together the book
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:56.640]  about kermit gosnell who went to prison because uh he killed a couple of babies um one of them he
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:02.400]  bragged about he was so big he could have walked to the bus station and so forth and a lady died
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:08.080]  under his care uh that triggered a law here in texas where they said well you got to be able
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:12.080]  to get emergency gurneys through the hallways to the patients in case something goes wrong
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:17.440]  and again you know there was a long tortured process through the legal system shut that down
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.080]  but going back to what happened to the baby during the trial and of course uh i had uh
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:25.920]  fell him on to talk about the book and then to talk about the movie that came out he said the
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:31.360]  key thing that happened in the trial that really surprised everybody you had to be a supportive
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.280]  of abortion to be able to be a juror they were not going to make it about abortion but when they
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:39.360]  had people who were just fine with abortion as they had an abortionist talking about the
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:44.800]  difference between what uh gosnell did and what they did uh she described what comfort care was
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:50.720]  and it was what the ralph northern is uh talking about and this is something that has been happening
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:55.600]  in several states the idea that if the baby survives their attempts to kill it they can
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:00.320]  take this baby and set it over to the side and let it die a natural death and they call that
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:06.000]  comfort care and they're using that to expand it now and keep them alive while the orders come in
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.080]  for the organs because if they butcher them on the spot little seven pounds of meat as they
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.640]  want us to think of them to humanize then the prices might not be fully there because they don't last
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:20.560]  more than a you know a few hours on ice seen as fresh as the chai comms advertise their people's
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:24.800]  organs as well but if they can keep them alive a few days then they can get
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:29.360]  three hundred four thousand dollars for the organs not fifty thousand and that was the thing that
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:34.000]  absolutely blew these jurors away they had no idea that was happening just like the american
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.640]  people had no idea that was happening until ralph northern let's talk about where juries really
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:41.840]  got to hear what happened even though they were all pro-abortion they changed their mind
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:47.120]  versus this latest ruling going after whistleblowers and valiant heroes david knight's heart guests
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:51.600]  is critical info please get this out to everyone you know the babies deserve it they're hoping for
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:43:01.120]  us to stand up to them i spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners

[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:07.840]  really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:13.920]  were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:19.360]  were setting a sub to bd platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.760]  off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:33.040]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:39.760]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:45.920]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:50.720]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air
[1:44:50.720 --> 1:45:00.320]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever i've made a lot of predictions that have come
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:06.080]  true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:12.160]  crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:17.680]  what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platformed that they were
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:25.360]  really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:31.920]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:38.480]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:44.880]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:49.680]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:54.640]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:05.280]  a question was once posed to thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:12.720]  that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:22.640]  limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:30.960]  bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:37.040]  no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these rules for us about
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:44.320]  speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:50.960]  want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the us of
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:56.400]  band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:06.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:24.800]  remember you are listening to an infowars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:31.920]  transmission you are the resistance remember how far we've come together exposing evil and
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:38.560]  corruption and so when things seem bleak 10 years ago most people thought the federal reserve was
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:42.640]  federal people didn't know about globalism of the new world order they didn't know they were keeping
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:46.640]  babies alive and selling their body parts people didn't know about the pedophile rings they thought
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:53.040]  that was crazy 25 years ago i thought ted gunterson was nice everything he said it turned out was true
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:58.640]  in triplicate and i wish i could interview him again now i mean i knew he was for real years later
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:03.760]  i just it was just amazing and and and he was just such a patriot gave up everything he had to
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:11.200]  fight the satanist and so much more and now they're externalizing the method they're they're
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.680]  mainlining it let's let's play that clip of the governor when he's not in blackface or dressed up
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.600]  in the kkk outfits uh talking about how they keep the baby comfortable they that they make the
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:26.400]  decision the mother doesn't want it doesn't want to resuscitate then they keep it comfortable people
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:31.360]  go you you don't resuscitate you just keep it comfortable well resuscitate would mean start
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:37.520]  the lungs start the heart perform a defibrillation perform mouth to mouth you hit the chest trigger
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:44.400]  the electrochemical ganglia in the top of the heart uh to get the heart beating again so why do
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:50.000]  you then oh she makes the decision not to resuscitate so we keep baby comfortable and used to they'd
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:57.360]  go it's not a baby but now because of all of the high-powered electro systems and all of the ultrasound
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.080]  3d imaging they go yeah it's a baby so what you're right so some more and more they have all these
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:06.320]  tv shows and movies where they brag yeah we're gonna kill those little suckers we love bullying
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:10.720]  of all these kind of women they have as comics on comedy central they get literally you have
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.440]  a star rating because it's not funny brag about i hate those little babies i like killing them
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:20.000]  ha they fight and they actually babies fight when the scalpel's cutting them up or they're dumping
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.520]  acid on them they they struggle they fight and these people just revel in the open satanism
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:30.400]  just like the man dressed as a demon clown ripping the baby out of a stomach and then they tell us
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:36.800]  call him a woman or will arrest you in multiple jurisdictions this is the insanity they're projecting
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:44.160]  their mental illness their satanism being poured out on us we make the decision she don't want baby
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:51.280]  baby so it baby don't necessitate we keep it comfortable now that's a bioethics board notice
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:57.760]  he says oh we don't want to get the government involved i'm a libertarian now because the government
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:03.680]  would say that was premeditated murder once it leaves the womb under Roe v. Wade but see they're
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:09.520]  expanding with mission creep now oh case for killing granny oh higher ten teachers well damn
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:15.600]  kill grandma i'm gonna get some money they're selling everyone on this new death economy
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:21.360]  that is about collapsing about scavenging about uh being carnivores of our own species
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.480]  about being cannibals instead of expanding an economy based on justice and freedom and
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:34.720]  scales of economy it's a economy of looting of conquest where we now keep baby comfortable
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:41.680]  here it is i can tell you so in this particular example if a mother is in labor i can tell you
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:47.760]  exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:54.080]  the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired and then a
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:59.520]  discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother so and he goes on to say we don't
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:06.400]  want the state involved he means the law of we the people he's and he goes on to say a physician
[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:12.880]  with another one they need to usually be another physician so see now we've gone from kill them
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:17.840]  one before they're out of the womb now kill them when they're out of the womb and don't get the
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:23.760]  state involved with me and another doctor that's the bioethics board is now down to two
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:29.440]  executioners and when the gospel jury heard that uh that that was going on recap that jury
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.080]  for people tell me again you know that was the situation we had a couple of kids who were killed
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:40.560]  by kermit gosnell uh i mean he had jars filled with uh baby parts so you should see the movie
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:45.680]  because it's that's a central part of the movie the movie was done as a courtroom drama they didn't
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:51.760]  revel in uh you know uh gruesome videos or anything but the thing that was key about that
[1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:55.520]  was the fact that people didn't understand that was happening and people didn't understand that
[1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:00.960]  was happening when ralph northern said that they're so out of touch with the american people
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:05.280]  think about what they just did to telsie gabard she said i i believe that abortion ought to be
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:11.440]  safe legal and rare that was a position of the democrat party a few years ago but in 2012 they
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:17.680]  took out the word rare uh they don't want it to be rare anymore they want it to be safe legal and
[1:52:17.680 --> 1:52:22.320]  paid by tax and ubiquitous and she was yeah and she was savaged by the democrats for even saying
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:27.200]  that ought to be rare uh i don't think we're not lovingly approving and then going whoa i love it
[1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:31.520]  that's the thing we're feminist i killed my baby yeah you bet it's a baby and i killed that little
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:36.880]  son of a bitch especially boy babies because we don't need more men that's major feminist publications
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:42.240]  are kill your male baby and and if he's born then take him in for a sex change and chop that penis
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:47.840]  off because we're liberal we're not psychotics or anything yeah we just want to chop those male genitals
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:54.320]  off and as out of touch as as extreme as they are and out of touch with the american people and
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:58.400]  quite frankly if the american people embrace this we don't stand a chance as a country anyway
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:03.440]  but as far out of touch and i they still are out of touch with the mainstream america how do they
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:09.360]  get this done alex is through the judiciary how do we fight this judicial tyranny this is something
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:13.040]  that we can look at it and we can say look uh andrew jackson told the supreme court you made
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:16.720]  your decision let's see you enforce it he understood there was a division of power
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:21.520]  we need to have a president who understands who stands up to it instead of he there's a hearing
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:27.520]  going on and then he says you know i have a right to free speech they go oh you're threatening me and
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:33.200]  they go that's another charge in fox news chris wallis and brett burgo up he just got another
[1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:38.960]  charge against him that president opened his mouth and said he was innocent how you've ever heard of
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:46.480]  such a crime night yeah exactly your mouth shut president the courts rule you yeah and it this is
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:51.680]  also something alex it could be done by governors for example right we've had uh in the past we've
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:56.000]  had texas governors oh i want to see our governor who i think is a good guy overall do more yeah i
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:00.400]  mean we had rick perry send the uh texas rangers down to the border to help protect the border i
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:05.680]  mean why isn't uh governor abed doing that but let's talk about you and i why can people do that's
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:10.320]  right that's right i'm done waiting for trump right we got trump in okay right and if he can't
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:14.720]  haul our bacon hey that's fine he's better than hillary what are we gonna do let's start getting
[1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:19.520]  that mindset these babies are counting on us what are we gonna do because here's the good news major
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:26.160]  polls that even try to skew them upwards of 70 of generation z is now anti-abortion so the
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:32.400]  millennials on average a lot of great ones are demons but something's happening with z and others
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:38.160]  and and and so despite all the imprisonment all the persecution we're winning the fight to save
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:43.040]  these babies intellectually that's why they're pushing trying to move the obergen window into
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:48.160]  open human sacrifice and saying no no no we're gonna kill them after they're born because they know
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:53.840]  we're pushing the window back to sanity that's right when you look at what if you're involved in
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:57.680]  as a juror in one of these situations where they're coming after the first amendment they're coming
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:02.240]  after journalism saying you're not a legitimate journalist we don't recognize you as a journalist
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:05.680]  so we're going to take away your first amendment rights or whatever they're using it to persecute
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.800]  people politically to create a process crime or they're perverting justice like they did in this
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:16.240]  san francisco case what do you do you need to understand the purpose of juries because the
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:22.720]  judge is going to lie to you just like this judge lied to this jury we need jury nullification we
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:28.160]  despite the fact they tried to rig the kermit uh gazelle operation that didn't work because they
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:32.880]  were able to hear about the grizzliness but in the case of san francisco uh a hundred percent
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:39.440]  a a inversion of justice that's right a judge will tell you if you go in there's a jury he'll
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:44.880]  tell you you're not to judge the law you're not to judge how severely these people are going to be
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:50.640]  putting you are to do what i say no you judge the facts and the law it's in the constitution if
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:55.920]  you think somebody violated the law but the law was wrong they were in the right let's say kill
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:02.080]  up you know mockingbirds a great example or or other fictional cases but the location alcohol
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:06.960]  prohibition all the time yeah or you can take the the very seminal yeah the family's gonna lose their
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:12.160]  farm and then they're making moonshine and they're selling that and you don't want to send them to
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:16.000]  prison for 20 years a piece busting rocks because you bought some of that moonshine from another
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:20.640]  moonshiner you think it's hypocritical when you take the moonshine well you nullify that and you
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:25.840]  send them home back to their farm the very first case was the case of william penn and it was
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:29.680]  clearly against the law they were not allowed to have a church meeting if it wasn't the church of
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:34.000]  england and so they arrested william penn the quakers and then stay with us a little bit and
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.600]  then we're going to get our next guest on at about 15 after i'm sure he'll be fine with that i should
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:42.640]  have been telling people it's a pretty hot guest right now he's a pretty well-spoken individual
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:47.280]  nick flint as i don't agree with some of the things he said some of his humor i disagree with but i
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:52.000]  agree with first amendment and so he's going to be on with us as well and we'll get your take on that
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:56.240]  case before we get to him so we come right back they didn't have you finish up on william penn and
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:00.800]  just this whole situation but it's judicial tyranny a lot of folks say well alex you better back off
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:06.480]  if they're suing you and keep jurisdictions and have it rigged listen i'm winning the information
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:12.880]  or thanks to you and at the end of the day i'll still have my voice and we'll still be here on air
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:16.960]  if you financially support us and i'm not going to lay all this out right now but you've seen
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:22.320]  what we've done in the past you see what we've pulled off against the globalist we are going to
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:27.600]  get even stronger and you're going to just wake up one day and there's going to be whole new things
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:32.240]  that you never even knew about that we were behind i won't own them i won't control them
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:39.200]  but the globalist had better fear them i need money now fill the war chest your war chest

[1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:45.200]  that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:53.600]  about a month ago president trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[1:58:53.600 --> 1:59:01.280]  new york city to florida where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited
[1:59:01.280 --> 1:59:08.160]  they said oh he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running
[1:59:08.160 --> 1:59:13.920]  to florida well now we know why the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:18.560]  courts we're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and
[1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:26.000]  harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with and by
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:31.200]  moving his domicile from new york to florida that gets around the new york law they passed
[1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:37.520]  to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private so all those people out there holding
[1:59:37.520 --> 1:59:44.560]  their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep states ass and he's
[1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:52.000]  never gonna resign you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:52.000 --> 2:00:02.480]  so
[2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:14.480]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:20.800]  here all right continuing here i was interrupting you there's just so many angles to this david night
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:28.240]  uh the the judicial tyranny to crush independent pro america pro common sense media uh the attempts
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:33.840]  to arrest all these wonderful whistleblowers and put them in prison uh i mean we forget but uh
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:38.480]  they've tried to put in prison multiple times they've indicted multiple times uh project veritas
[2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:43.440]  uh and i'm not saying oh i'm a victim whining i'm saying we're the tip of the spear
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:51.920]  we're under a massive sustained attack this is very very very real uh and so you cannot
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:58.080]  put your your prayers and your word of mouth and your money behind an organization that is that is
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:04.320]  fearlessly taking the globalist on we just want to be able with your support hit them with full power
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:09.120]  yeah and when we look at this how do we stop this judicial tyranny i mean you know the way the
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:14.000]  government was designed we had a separation of powers within washington we had a separation of
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.400]  powers between washington and the states because that was exactly what the antifederalists was
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:23.840]  concerned about they said look this is going to become consolidated it's going to become hierarchical
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:27.920]  uh the the concern that i have is that the judiciary is going to be at the top and they're
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:31.520]  going to be you know setting everything and that's actually what has happened oh yeah my
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:36.480]  partisanly now they they're they're engaged in an arrogant takeover yeah they know they are it's
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:41.440]  very conscious yes that's right and the problem that we have is that even though president trump is
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:47.680]  appointing judges he's only appointed about a quarter of them and that's good but how do you
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:51.200]  how do you know that these judges aren't going to turn because we see that over and over again
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:57.440]  when they appoint liberal judges they're reliably statist and yet when we get a conservative so many
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:03.200]  times uh half the time or more they become some of the worst judges because they are
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:09.440]  uh government bureaucrats at the uh at the core of what they are so why how do we uh control this
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:15.440]  alec they're selecting i mean they're selecting from people that are already proven little monsters
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:20.400]  that's right what we have to do is we have to understand that we have power just like the
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:24.160]  president has a power to say no just like a governor has the power to say another check and
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.600]  balance on judicial judicial tyranny is the grand jury the investigative grand jury and the jury
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:33.920]  and what you're saying is they've drummed that out of this juries are supposed to checkmate out of
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:38.720]  control judges if you don't understand what your rights are before you go to court the judge is
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:43.920]  going to lie to you just like this judge in san francisco he told the jury he said you're not here
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:49.600]  to judge innocence or guilt i'm telling you they're guilty you're here to set the the penalty here
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:54.000]  and in many cases the judge will say you're not here to judge the law or how it's going to be applied
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:58.640]  or whatever you're just going to be the fact finder here that's not what juries are for now
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:03.360]  don't tell them this when you go into court you tell you know and don't even tell it to your
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:08.480]  fellow fellow jurors when you're doing deliberation you tell them that you're concerned you don't
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.680]  believe this evidence or whatever that's the key to take back that power just as we see these
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:18.160]  executives and other people bowing down before the supreme court or others and saying we will do
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:22.960]  whatever you say we are doing that at the jury level because we're following everything they
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:26.240]  tell us to do i want to talk about this when we come back and then get nick pointez on at
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:29.840]  15 after we had we did an hour and a half of them yesterday it was pretty powerful and
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:33.120]  he's he's been under a lot of attack for things he said regardless of what he said
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:38.480]  michelle malkin shouldn't be fired from her job as a conservative media person because she said he
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:41.680]  has free speech so we get david's take on that next segment but i'm going to give this something
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:46.640]  really important when we come back and i'm not going to say this is a stunt i'm not going to say
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:51.520]  this to act cool it's actually uh you know embarrassing that i did this some when i was a
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:57.760]  teenager uh but uh last time i did i was about 14 but but you know the game playing chicken
[2:03:57.760 --> 2:04:02.320]  when you put cigarettes down between your arms it's a real dirtball biker thing uh no never
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:06.800]  let the cigarette burn you yeah well i i mean i won some big bets with like you know convicts
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:10.960]  it's like 25 year old you know thugs and stuff that thought they could do it and then it went to
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.520]  lighters uh you know like it's you like in the stupid movie where uh one of the lethal weapons
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:18.720]  the guy supposedly tufts and put a lighter on his arm i could take a blow towards his arms
[2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:22.800]  if they're gonna go into pain well uh yeah but i'm thinking about you're gonna be here well i'm
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:26.800]  thinking about doing is a stunt with a blow torch not in a self-harming thing just to show people
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.560]  what will is just one thing to talk about it yeah i'm gonna take a blow torch tomorrow i think next
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:35.200]  week on air show people what will is i'll do 60 seconds okay i'm a blow torch i'm gonna burn a
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:39.920]  hole in my about an inch deep my arm the bone because i want to show people what will is and
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:44.960]  i'm gonna explain about will on the other side right here because if you won't do that folks
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:48.480]  you'll never stand up for the unborn children imagine what they go through well they're right
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:50.800]  back but but i'm gonna explain the blow torch analogy when we come back
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:00.880]  i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:06.800]  really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists
[2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:12.880]  were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they
[2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:18.400]  were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:26.720]  off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:32.000]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed but the globalists really feared
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:38.720]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:44.880]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:50.160]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:06:12.080]  more imperative and more vital than ever big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:20.880]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:31.120]  i'm not into pain and i don't like to dish out pain but i was thinking about g gordon leddie who
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:37.040]  ate a rat in prison and reportedly he did do it that would be harder than the putting the lighter
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:40.480]  to his arm for a minute and burning himself in front of people to show him how tough he was
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:44.400]  but he ended up kind of running the federal prison just for doing that but we had some of
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:48.800]  those stunts when i was in high school i did have some trashy friends who had trashy older
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:52.320]  brothers that were you know ex convicts and stuff kind of got away from those guys i was
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:55.760]  about 15 i didn't hang out with them a lot but they just called chicken where you put a cigar
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:59.680]  cigarette for your arms and the next it goes to lighters and things like that bedding yeah it's
[2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:03.360]  kind of like russian or that stuff it's really stupid and of course i couldn't really do that
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:08.400]  today they tell jones is self-harming if the left wants to go and you know they have stuff where
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:12.640]  they get shot with guns and stuff seen as artwork or cut their arms and legs off they're called
[2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:17.040]  nuggets and they're kept in diapers and in little boxes mexico has legalized as there's
[2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:20.800]  whole communities of quote gay men that chop their arms and legs off you've heard of dumping
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:25.840]  drano in your own eyes and then being being uh trans abled this is all the mental illness but
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:30.560]  i was thinking because i'm not into self-harming i was just being honest about a story i never told
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:36.640]  hell i got some scars i can show you that imagine a message to trump and of course i won't be able
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:39.760]  to do this now because they'll have the messages out to block it make sure it doesn't go viral but
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:43.920]  if i did it unannounced it would go viral kind of like the joe rogan podcast this year that
[2:07:43.920 --> 2:07:48.560]  it's the biggest podcast he's ever done the biggest in history over 50 million views total now
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:51.920]  i talked to joe just a while back it was no it's the biggest one i ever did he set it on air but
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:56.080]  that's why i can't come back on because something is the biggest but if i sat there with a blow torch
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:01.520]  and an unsettling torch and turned it on and it had a doctor here and said this is all scientific
[2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:06.720]  i'm not self-harming i'm doing this is a medical experiment i said trump here's my message to you
[2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:12.640]  it's easier to put this blow torch to my arm and it starts cooking and bubbling and burning
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:19.360]  than it is to sit here and watch you put up with the censorship and set up on this show
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:23.920]  and watch the justice department let everybody engage in all this criminal activity and bullying
[2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:30.000]  in american people because i was thinking of this last night if i had to pick up a hot plate
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  if it was a fellow one of my kids and i had to hold a hot hot red hot deal i could do it for a
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:38.720]  while if i had to i could force myself to hold it and go past the pain and just cut the pain off
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:43.040]  and ignore it it's a mind trick uh because i've done similar things before and i'm not trying
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:46.880]  to act tough i've done it and i'll probably prove it if i if i check legally and i can do it i'm
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:50.240]  gonna do it uh because i don't want my ex-wife using that in court or something to take the kids
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:56.880]  away because it's a scientific demonstration okay uh but that's what it's like i like trump i like
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:01.600]  the fact he's fighting hillary but it's like i'm sitting here with an incidentally torched to my
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:06.960]  ass and i'm i'm not going to do this folks i was just joking all that was theater that was a fictional
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:13.840]  discussion there it was a hypothetical um so so so so that's where this society's gone that's where
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:20.400]  this society's going we're letting the deep state do all this persecution uh seeing babies kept alive
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:24.640]  and their organs being harvesting seeing pedophiles all over the news saying we're going to have access
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:31.680]  to your children uh we are uh grooming them and we are taking over civilization that's like sitting
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:36.880]  in a hot burning plate or being put you know in a cartoon in one of those bubbling cauldrons
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:42.160]  with pygmies dancing around cooking us it's very hard to sit here and take it so as much as i'm glad
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:47.440]  trump got in and he got us out of the tpp and did some other good things more and more it seems like
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:53.280]  the swamps winning and the inaction of the head of the justice department you know saying oh we've
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:57.680]  never seen the deep state wage war on a president or the executive they're sabotaging america it's
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:02.960]  criminal well then it's criminal if you don't do something and so that's why i tell the uh you
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:07.760]  know allegory of the blowtorch is i have no desire to put a blowtorch to my arm and i have no desire
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.640]  to sit here and keep taking this i know we have to to beat the globalist but why won't the executive
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:17.200]  branch take action well and that's the thing we have to understand just like the people you know
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:23.760]  the people who refuse to convict william penn uh with him when he obviously broke the law that said
[2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:28.800]  that you can't have a church other than our official church when they let him free the judge
[2:10:28.800 --> 2:10:33.200]  threw them in jail and they stayed in jail until they said well show us the law that we broke and
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:37.680]  so they established habeas corpus they also established jury nullification we need to understand
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:42.160]  first of all that there are transcending principles that we got to stand for that's what
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:47.920]  those jurors understood secondly just like the founders of this country uh they have to understand
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.080]  that it is worth it whatever the price we pay and so we know that we're going to be punished
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:57.280]  if we oppose power if we speak truth to power julian assange they just came back and said well
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:03.120]  we just dropped the charges in sweden i've seen this over and over again from cases that i reported
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:10.000]  cases where you've had people railroaded by kangaroo courts uh you had trumped up charges against
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:15.600]  dross olbrich he ran a website they wanted to shut it down because it was a a commerce that was
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:21.520]  out of their control silk road so they said well he's got murder for hire they pulled up those charges
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:27.440]  but they never actually took him to trial it's more process crap yeah they dropped those charges
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:33.360]  alex at the judge when he uh convicted him for running the website gave him three consecutive
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:38.560]  life sentences and cited the fact you did murder for hire they never found him guilty that they
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:43.280]  never even tried him for that and as soon as they put that judgment on him that judge just
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:47.440]  let that go we see that over and over again so people let's be clear there's no crime but you're
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:51.600]  guilty of the conspiracy to commit crimes that's right which didn't exist i saw this in the dividend
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:56.160]  case the judge gave him 50 something years in jail they were all innocent hadn't pulled triggers
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:02.880]  that the court admitted that they were found not guilty on the weapons charges but they were found
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:10.880]  guilty of using weapons in the in the conspiracy to commit murder and the appeals court just basically
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:14.640]  let that happen i mean think about it well they did to shafer cox too they came up with all the
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.120]  crime and said well you did this and then there's a conspiracy charge they eventually dropped the
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:23.200]  core allegations but they kept the conspiracy charge and put them in jail for that so we see
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:27.200]  this type of thing happening over and over again we have to understand these principles you know
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:32.480]  the thing we're talking about with William Penn that's not ancient history that was human nature
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:38.400]  and that's why we have the constitution people were very well aware of how power could be abused
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:42.640]  and now that is happening again but we don't understand because we don't remember history
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:47.200]  because we have our kids being indoctrinated by the school system we don't understand what's at
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.320]  stake and we got people who are too comfortable to stand up to this beautifully said and again i go
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:58.400]  back to the acetylene torch uh parable which i've never done that with acetylene torch but i i i did
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.360]  when i was like 14 hanging around some bad guys uh you know his brothers were older motorcycle
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:07.600]  gang people was like oh yeah you know i'd sit there and did it my dad was like what the hell have
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:10.960]  you done don't ever do that again but a few times i did it and beat them let the whole cigarette
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:17.520]  burned down in your arm or whatever and that's what this is like sitting here taking this for
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:22.640]  supporting trump and supporting america and i'm willing to do it but that's the paradox of why
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:29.600]  people are so angry that's right at trump and at bar yeah we know and the more crimes they commit
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.640]  and the more kangaroo events and the more we personally get persecuted i don't feel sorry for
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:39.760]  myself i want to fight i want to see some action i'm willing to take the heat man but i want the
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:45.920]  heat delivered back and why do we have a double legal system why do we have hillary komie says
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:49.760]  she committed multiple felonies but we're not going to do anything instead we lock up christian
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:55.440]  saucier a sailor on a submarine who takes a picture of his bunk he goes to jail for over a year let's
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:00.160]  go further on a 40-something-year-old submarine that was found in a trash heap something's going on
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:05.200]  there and then they throw the book at him yeah exactly now president trump pardoned him to clear
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:09.760]  his record but he'd already served the time but how do we have people like hillary clinton who
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:14.960]  violated national security the religion of the state all of our liberties and the constitution
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:21.600]  have to be sacrificed on the altar of national security but hillary clinton can't be even looked at
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:27.520]  even that's because she's part of that ruling guild in the 60s a whole class got in of communist
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:33.680]  who the cia and british intelligence put in and the clintons are both mi6 and cia they were brought
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:38.080]  into the roth child roundtable groups is all admitted now she was in time-life books in high
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:42.080]  school we have a copy a listener sent to us is somewhere here i've shown it like 10 times on

[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:59.120]  a question was once posed to thomas jefferson
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:08.640]  what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:17.040]  what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:25.280]  is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture in society
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:32.160]  that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:39.680]  saint people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[2:18:39.680 --> 2:18:45.200]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:52.000]  oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.160]  dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them the globalists know that i will never willingly
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:05.280]  give up i've said it many times i will never give in i will never give up but i could give out
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:11.120]  and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:18.720]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most americans have already been silenced
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:24.800]  in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that
[2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:32.080]  most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:38.320]  about news wars dot com in fours dot com and ban dot video and that people are hungry for the truth
[2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:43.440]  now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the band truth they don't want you to have
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:49.520]  is at info wars dot com port slash show and band on video so take heart folks they've had to censor
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:54.320]  everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:20:06.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:44.320]  hi
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:59.320]  All right folks, Nick Fuentes joins us. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Coming up, Paul Joseph
[2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:06.320]  Watson is going to be hosting the fourth hour today as well, NicholasJFuentes.com.
[2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:10.820]  Okay, the reason I wanted to get this fellow back on, he was on a few weeks ago, he was
[2:21:10.820 --> 2:21:15.820]  on the war room for an hour and a half or almost two hours yesterday, is that regardless
[2:21:15.820 --> 2:21:22.360]  of what you think about this guy, he has a First Amendment and Turning Point USA and
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:31.560]  all these other Republican organizations have been coming out and trying to censor who can
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:38.160]  come and ask questions at their event. So Fuentes got mad about this a few months ago and he
[2:21:38.160 --> 2:21:41.920]  started going to these events. I'm not going to play all the clips here and they would
[2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:45.800]  have the police, they would have security waiting on them. I have a couple other articles
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:53.400]  here where other Republican groups are now calling the police on other people that ask
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:22:02.880]  questions who aren't even involved with Fuentes. So the exact behavior that we have seen out
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:10.080]  of the Democratic Party and out of these anti-free speech zone colleges, these anti-colleges,
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:15.000]  is supposed to be the place of open discussion. We've seen a total conversion the last ten
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  years of these being abodes of no speech except for the left and Maoist. Well, they really
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:29.880]  jumped the Megalodon shark here recently. Two days ago, the major conservative organization
[2:22:29.880 --> 2:22:35.280]  headed up by Michelle Malkin is one of their main spokesperson. They fired her because
[2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:41.360]  she gave a speech and the big debate is should the America First Group and Nick Fuentes or
[2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:46.120]  anybody else be allowed to ask critical questions of Charlie Kirk or any other neocon, never
[2:22:46.120 --> 2:22:54.480]  Trump or a derivative organization? And the answer is no. So they said that Michelle Malkin
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:22:59.360]  is married to a Jewish man and who is pro-Israel is a Nazi. That's all over the news. She's
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:05.360]  now a Nazi because she supports Nick Fuentes, who I guess they've got one clip of somebody
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.360]  asking him a question on a YouTube live chat and he reads out where they are making jokes
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:14.760]  about Cookie Monster and the fact that the gas ovens or whatever couldn't burn that many
[2:23:14.760 --> 2:23:18.720]  people or whatever. And the point is, is that whether you agree with that or disagree with
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:22.320]  that or think that's somebody's sick humor, I don't like it. But I guess he was reading
[2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:25.920]  off the chat. That isn't the issue here. They always change the subject and go, well,
[2:23:25.920 --> 2:23:30.920]  if somebody's offended, it's hate speech and now it goes away. Well, there goes the entire
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:34.800]  First Amendment. So this giant controversy has exploded. It's all over the news. It was
[2:23:34.800 --> 2:23:40.800]  one of the top stories on Drudge yesterday, Fuentes rising. And so I thought we should
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:44.960]  talk about this because, you know, I've been de-platformed and they've done it using a
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:49.160]  bunch of lies. And then once that president's set, they expand on to others and they've
[2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:54.040]  said the news that I'm an unalloyed racist. That's Tom Brokaw saying that, you know,
[2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:57.420]  they've said that I'm an anti-Semite. Now they don't have me making jokes about the
[2:23:57.420 --> 2:24:01.600]  Holocaust and Cookie Monster, which I think is very distasteful. I don't agree with
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:07.080]  Fuentes has his reasons for that. It doesn't matter. I'm now being demonized for even giving
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:13.560]  him this platform to respond. Well, you know, everybody tries to keep me from having platforms
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:19.640]  as well. And I'm sick of that. I'm tired of being accused of stuff. And then I can't
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:26.640]  anywhere on mainline, you know, internet or in those publications or TV shows respond.
[2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:29.280]  Thank God I happen to have my own platform with millions of readers and viewers every
[2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:33.840]  day. Thanks to you, the listeners. And that's why info wars is the model of what they hate.
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:39.440]  But enough about that. It's my real pet peeve. There's new footage of the group that Michelle
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:44.200]  Malcolm got fired from calling the police on people that ask about it. That's on infowars.com.
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:50.440]  I mean, this is really blowing up in a bad way for Turning Point USA, which if they would
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.880]  have just let Fuentes have their question, it would have been interesting argument.
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:59.480]  I mean, you know, I disagree with some of the stuff point test says he's on will debate
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.960]  it. That's interesting. I want I beg all these leftist. I mean, we call every leftist that
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:07.880]  Tucker Carlson's able to get on. And I asked Tucker, how do you do it? He goes, well, we
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:10.880]  have really good producers and we bag them basically. And then we explain, Hey, it'll
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:14.680]  be a bigger platform for you, blah, blah, blah. More and more. They won't go on. I want
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:20.760]  people on a disagree with Nick Fuentes. Thanks for joining us. Recap. We'll get to it more
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.320]  in the next segment. Recap the saga up until now for folks that aren't aware of it.
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:29.800]  Sure. Well, thanks for having me to sort of give my side of the story. So yeah, I think
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:34.160]  you sort of eloquently put it at the beginning of this segment that we've been going to these
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:39.160]  different Turning Point events and other conservative Inc. type events. Charlie Kurt,
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:43.560]  Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, Matt Walsh, these kinds of characters. And I've been sending
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:48.640]  followers of mine or followers of mine inspired by my show are attending these events and
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:53.280]  they line up in the Q&A and they ask questions about legal immigration. They ask about foreign
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.400]  aid. They ask some of the tough questions from a right wing perspective about how Turning
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:01.720]  Point and these other college organizations are not really conservative or not really
[2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:06.200]  fulfilling the America first mandate from the 2016 election. And so we've been doing
[2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:11.040]  this for about three to four weeks. And as you said, the response from conservative Inc.
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:16.240]  from Kirk and all these other characters is to call the people asking the questions,
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:23.480]  racists, bigots, homophobes, all that. Turning Point USA participated in the doxing of me,
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:27.840]  the ZOA, the Zionist Organization of America demanded that I be the platform from the whole
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:33.520]  Internet for my inquiry, for this coordinated inquiry into Turning Point USA. And so it
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:37.560]  started out as something very innocent and started out with legitimate grievances by
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:41.720]  college students, young Trump supporters, you know, asking how Charlie Kirk is really
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:46.560]  conservative. And as you said, now it is sort of snowballed into a much larger question
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:51.800]  about this free speech deficit that's happening on college campuses, particularly conservative
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:56.600]  college campus groups that, you know, they brand themselves and they've rose to prominence
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:02.320]  talking about free speech and anti safe space, anti trigger warning kind of thing. And now
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:06.600]  it looks like, as you said, they're calling the police on people for asking these questions.
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:10.880]  They had the police block me from attending an event. Caitlyn Bennett got blocked by the
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:15.320]  police yesterday at a Michael Knowles event. So it's a pretty tragic thing that's happening
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:19.560]  with the conservative movement, but I think it's totally backfiring for these conservative
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:24.360]  organizations, conservative Inc. organization. And by the way, we have that footage. Caitlyn
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:30.080]  Bennett is a Christian. Caitlyn Bennett, I believe is pro-Israel. It's never even come
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:37.280]  up here. But exactly. I mean, even my own reporter now can't get into events because
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:43.120]  they see her as the enemy. And that's what we're witnessing is the attempt to call the
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:49.640]  entire mass of conservative Catholics, conservative Protestants, people that say, no, we don't
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.680]  want drag queen story time with five year olds. They're calling people Nazis and that
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:58.440]  is going to blow up in their face. Because it's one thing for MSNBC to do it. But when
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:03.000]  when when Gorka the gay whale and all these people start doing this, they're going to
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:06.680]  have a big problem. Exactly. Well, and you know, it's very disturbing
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:10.880]  when somebody like Charlie Kirk, you know, he takes money from Scientologists. I don't
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:13.800]  know if you're aware of that. You might be interested in that. He takes money for his
[2:28:13.800 --> 2:28:18.440]  organization from Scientologists. It's very disturbing when somebody like that purports
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:23.840]  to be a Christian purports to be a Trump supporter purports to be a conservative. And these questions,
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:27.680]  like you said, from reporters, even people that happen to be pro-Israel or they might
[2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:32.520]  be more mainline type conservatives or have more libertarian leanings, they have honest
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:36.760]  questions, you know, again, from the base of the country. And those people are smeared
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:41.840]  slandered called Nazis. Benny Johnson, who works for Charlie Kirk called a Catholic
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:47.800]  supporter of mine, a Westboro Baptist church kid, because he asked a question about how,
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:56.000]  you know, Charlie Kirk supporting gay marriage. If you're trying to quit drinking or doing
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:01.400]  too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:07.000]  you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:13.520]  ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:18.000]  me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do

[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:04.160]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:10.720]  for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with Super
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:15.120]  Blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free. The adult or
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:20.080]  the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:25.640]  love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:32.640]  also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt, silver
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:36.200]  in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis. This is all proven. You can make
[2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:41.480]  claims with this, but I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:47.240]  out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip
[2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:52.760]  away the enamel. So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation N4store.com. That's
[2:30:52.760 --> 2:31:00.240]  why we're still on air. Thanks to you. A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What
[2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:08.960]  is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:16.720]  their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit. The
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:24.280]  answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:30.160]  culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's no
[2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:36.760]  devil or the God, but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:42.320]  how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like. They just don't
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:48.400]  want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's
[2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:53.280]  the U.S. of banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and
[2:31:53.280 --> 2:31:59.520]  it's time to reject them. There's a famous quote by Marine Corps general in the Korean
[2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:06.760]  War when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:12.280]  More than 50 to one, some estimates have it. But the point is they were outnumbered and
[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:17.360]  the general was told, general, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in
[2:32:17.360 --> 2:32:24.760]  all directions. Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached. And it really is epic.
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:29.960]  It really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support. But
[2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:36.440]  it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's
[2:32:36.440 --> 2:32:40.840]  not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes
[2:32:40.840 --> 2:32:47.240]  to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against
[2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:58.120]  dangerous vaccines. Because by Info Wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist.
[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:14.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin, Texas,
[2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:25.000]  broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Nick Foyntes
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:32.040]  is our guest. I'm Alex Jones. Now I had seen a year ago, some of his videos and I was named
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:38.360]  a few months ago and he was, you know, complaining that why do we have all these never Trumpers
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:44.240]  and neocons and others now being the voice of Trump while they don't get censored. But
[2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:48.480]  all these other nationalists and conservatives and patriots like Info Wars are being taken
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:56.040]  off. And then he starts going to their events and asking questions. And they begin having
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:33:59.240]  the police there. They're throwing them out. Now they're throwing other people out. And
[2:33:59.240 --> 2:34:05.040]  so Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, he's getting booed out of events. He's
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:09.600]  getting booed off the street. And Don Jr. is, which I'm not happy that happened, but it
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:17.720]  shows the real anger and the feeling of betrayal by libertarians on so many fronts at Trump
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:22.640]  and by Christian conservatives, be they Catholic, be they Protestant, be a lot of Mormons,
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:26.600]  you name it. I mean, just people across the board that are more conservative are saying,
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:33.600]  look, we love Trump, but a lot of this evil stuff is just getting worse. And we're getting
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:38.120]  persecuted for Trump. And then we never see him going on the offense against people that
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:43.480]  are clearly committing crime. Sure, it makes the Democrats look bad. But well, now you
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:48.840]  notice this Republican Supreme Court just voted. And I was talking to top DC lawyers
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:53.720]  today. And I'll just leave it at that one in person. And they just said, no, it's a
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:58.080]  sea change. And it marks that they intend to bankrupt the gun industry and that the establishment,
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:01.600]  including Republican leadership, once the gun's gone, the fact that they just overrode
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:05.880]  that law. So this is a very serious time. And I'm glad Trump's in there. My goodness,
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:10.760]  way better than Hillary. But if Hillary was trying all of this, we would be up in arms.
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:14.480]  If she was trying all this censorship, they wouldn't have gotten away with it. And she
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:20.120]  was going to try it. The fact that Trump's in there, and he means well, still is allowing
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:25.920]  them to energize their base. And then Trump doesn't resist them in defending his base.
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.560]  And it's emboldened them to really engage in this crusaded persecution. You ever hear
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:35.160]  Trump call the left bullies? You ever hear them say it's wrong? They attack his supporters?
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:39.880]  You ever hear him? No, he talks about what's wrong happening to him. And I'm not trying
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:46.880]  to attack Trump here. I'm saying what Trump needs to do. And it's info wars along with
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:51.240]  just a few other platforms. You can say drudge definitely as much as info wars, maybe more.
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:56.720]  But it's our audience that is a good half of his supporters at his rallies. And they're
[2:35:56.720 --> 2:36:01.680]  upset because they see what's happening. And so going back to Nick Fuentes, Nick, I'm
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:06.520]  not going to sit here and couch this in 100 different platitudes to people that are going
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.640]  to say Alex Jones supports white supremacist. A, I don't think you're a white supremacist.
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:14.360]  B, if you were one and people are saying you don't have a right to go to a university
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:18.120]  and stand in a line and ask a question, I mean, you could be a NAMBLA member. And I'm
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:23.600]  not saying you are. I'm not implying. And I'm saying you could be a convicted arsonist
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:27.960]  who's gotten out of prison for arson. And if you wanted to go try to speak in a, you
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:35.120]  know, a public forum, that's your right. I mean, this idea that, that Michelle Malkin
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:39.280]  is fired from her conservative position because she said in the speech and I went and found
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:41.880]  it and pulled it up. I forgot to give it to the crew. We just pull that up. Michelle
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:46.280]  Malkin defends Nick Fuentes and says, you are a leader in the new right and you have
[2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:50.920]  a right to speak. Well, that's a fact. So if we're stating two plus two equals four,
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:54.640]  they fired her and I guess every few hours there's new aftermath. Tell us about what's
[2:36:54.640 --> 2:37:00.720]  been unfolding. Right. So she gave a speech last week at UCLA, which you've shown and
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:05.160]  she said something very mild, you know, as you said, it's completely factual. You know,
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:10.080]  she said that I'm a rising leader in the new right. And she said that I am the mouthpiece
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:15.120]  or a somebody who's voicing the concerns, legitimate grievances of young Trump supporters
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:20.320]  and Christians. And as a result of that passing remark in her general support of what we've
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.320]  been trying to do, as you said, she's been called a white supremacist, a Holocaust denier,
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:30.400]  a Nazi, a white nationalist. And it's so interesting. Michelle Malkin is somebody who's been on
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:35.560]  the scene for a long time. She's well respected. She's the real deal when it comes to America
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:40.120]  First Christianity, conservatism and all the rest. She's been around 25 years. She's been
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:44.920]  around as long as I have. Exactly. Exactly. She's been with America First from the beginning,
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:49.080]  right? And it's so interesting to see how all these conservatives turn on a dime. The
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:53.320]  moment that she gives a little bit of cover to somebody who's not approved, somebody who's
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:57.960]  not a part of the Beltway system, not a part of the establishment, suddenly everybody turns
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:38:03.040]  on a dime and they call her the worst names, Nazi, Holocaust denier. I'm sure these people
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:06.360]  know her personally. These people know she doesn't support that. These people know she's
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:10.880]  not a white supremacist, but they want her to disavow me. They want her to, you know,
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:16.360]  do this very sort of symbolic, genuine flection towards conservative bank and say, yes, I submit
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:20.040]  and I acknowledge that you're in control and you get to decide who's in the system and
[2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:23.800]  who's outside the system, you know, who's approved and who isn't. And so I think that's
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:27.960]  what it's really about is it's about control over the conversation, the contents of the
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.680]  conversation and who gets to participate in it. So I think that, you know, they are exposing
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:37.200]  themselves as maybe worse than the left. They are left of the left when it comes to this.
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:42.280]  The SPLC, the ADL, they are not even as hardcore on people like me or Michelle Malkin as people
[2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:46.920]  like David French and the national view are being this week. So I think it's absolutely
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:53.600]  disgusting what they're doing to her. Now, let me raise this here because I'm not a cult
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:39:04.520]  member. I supported Trump day one. I thought people in pop culture were pretty annoying.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:11.640]  I don't like casinos. I thought the apprentice was pretty, pretty silly. But then I got to
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:14.520]  know a lot of people that have been on the apprentice like Jesse James and he said, no,
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.520]  Trump's a patriot knows about the new world order. He doesn't like it. You know, I say
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:20.840]  at his house a lot, they're good buddies. And I used to live next door to Jesse James
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:23.080]  and I'm good friends with him, which here about Jesse James, the news is not true. He's
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:27.040]  a big Christian and not a devil worshiper, not a Nazi, any of that stuff you've heard.
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:33.480]  No, that's true either. But then he said, watch, he's going to run. And I'm like, oh,
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:40.920]  yeah, right. And then he did run and then he I supported him early on and he did win.
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:46.760]  My issue with people like Shapiro and others is they want you to forget about all the things
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:51.040]  he said about Trump and his supporters. And now he wants to be the consummate, Trump supporter.
[2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:55.160]  And then he wants to wall off and block everybody that was an original supporter and act like
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:40:00.360]  we don't have a seat at the table. That's just despicable. And it's very arrogant.
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:03.640]  That's exactly right. That's exactly what's happening. They're completely co-opting the
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:08.000]  Trump administration because when it mattered, when it counted, when it was actually difficult
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.480]  to back Trump, you know, as you said, the people that supported him from the beginning
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:17.520]  and I was supporting him, you know, in March or April 2016, Ben Shapiro was saying that
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:21.440]  he would never vote for Donald Trump employees. Ben Shapiro said they would vote for people
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:25.360]  that would deport Trump supporters. You know, a lot of these high profile neocons would
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:29.640]  say things like immigrants are actually more American than these, you know, white working
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:34.120]  class Trump supporters. And you're right. You know, now that it's 2019 and the tides
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:38.480]  have turned and Donald Trump is the most popular Republican president in history. Now they
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.080]  want to say that, oh, they were Trump supporters all along. They want to, they want to make
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:46.520]  it about themselves. They've completely, and I think to some degree of success, co-opted
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:50.200]  everything that Donald Trump did in 2016. And I think that's why you're seeing some
[2:40:50.200 --> 2:40:55.280]  of the priorities in the administration shift from Donald Trump during the campaign. You
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:58.320]  know, I see a lot of it very dangerous. I want to talk about that next segment and get
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:02.720]  into Caitlin Bennett, uh, being confronted by these very grips today and the article
[2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:06.440]  in FullWars.com. And poor Caitlin is nothing but a sweetheart. She doesn't deserve this
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:10.840]  from these neocon organizations that are so scared they want to push us out of the campaign
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:14.800]  way ahead of it. So I'll be at the DNC, I'll be at the RNC more than ever now because they're
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:18.600]  trying this type of crap. But let's be fair here, Nick, and people can change their mind.
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:21.400]  Or maybe you can tell us what happened with this clip. I believe this clip is from back
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:25.520]  during Trump's run. Here's what you had to say about Trump.
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:30.080]  And having people of by and for the people they were intended to represent. Now, having
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:35.840]  said that, Donald Trump has served his function. His time is over. It's time for serious candidates.
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:41.080]  Let the adults talk, Donald. We don't need the exclamatory phrases, the borderline racist
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:46.440]  remarks. Now we need real candidates. Now, is that you at like 18 years old, you're 21
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:49.480]  now? Because people say things that are wrong. I see things that are wrong all the time.
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:54.840]  Is that you trying to be a baby Shapiro? That was me when I was 17 years old. That was in
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:42:01.560]  high school. That was November 2015. And I very quickly came around to support Donald
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:07.240]  Trump before the primaries even began. Primaries began on February 1, 2016. So a couple of
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:11.360]  months later, I would say that I should be given a pass. You know, I was in high school.
[2:42:11.360 --> 2:42:15.760]  I was young, naive. I was a libertarian. And there were a lot of people who didn't support
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:19.120]  Trump right out of the gate. You know, I think at that time, his support was maybe around
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:23.840]  something like 15 or 20% of the polls. And I think he proved himself to be a viable and
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:28.960]  legitimate candidate. As you said, you know, he was a, you know, TV star casino sort of
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:33.120]  a guy. And a lot of people right out of the gates said, Oh, is this even a serious run
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:36.920]  for president? You know, if you notice in that clip, I didn't make any substantive claims
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:40.880]  about what he says or his platform or anything like that. I said, Well, it just doesn't seem
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:45.680]  like you were 17. I just thought we'd get that clip out there and get your take on it.
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:50.680]  You didn't work hard to keep from him getting elected. In fact, you did work for it. The
[2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:56.640]  globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never
[2:42:56.640 --> 2:43:04.000]  give in. I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:09.880]  to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like
[2:43:09.880 --> 2:43:15.880]  this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace, that
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:21.800]  most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:27.840]  feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:33.840]  newswords.com, infowords.com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth
[2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:38.000]  now more than ever. And then if you tell people, Hey, the banned truth they don't want you
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:44.200]  to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned on video. So take heart, folks.
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:48.120]  They've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:54.880]  can't beat us fair and square. Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said, we're
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:59.280]  going to confiscate all your semiautomatic rifles. And he got all the other Democrats
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:04.920]  on the stage, nine others to agree and said that he was a hero. Think about that. Now
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:09.320]  those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control. Their blue cities
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:16.000]  are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:21.680]  levels of violent crime. They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Court's come out
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:27.120]  and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:31.560]  their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country's under such incredible attack.
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:37.160]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:41.040]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:45.480]  going to help in the confiscation of guns. So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal
[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:54.960]  aliens. Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws. I spend a lot of time reminding the
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:45:00.680]  info wars of family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:05.040]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:09.120]  keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:15.480]  as modern ball reveres. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:19.720]  these products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:24.240]  third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:29.400]  all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:36.640]  else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:43.720]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:49.440]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better. So visit infowarstore.com

[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:05.480]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go?
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:13.280]  What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:20.520]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:26.600]  modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:33.320]  no devil or the God. But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:38.880]  how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like. They just don't
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:44.960]  want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:49.840]  the U.S. of banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:47:17.520]  it's time to reject them. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:25.120]  All Joseph Watson is coming up in the next hour. He'll take over. I'm going to do that
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:31.240]  first little segment. Nick Foyntes is our guest. The attempt to intimidate Michelle
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:37.680]  Malkin and get her fired from her job because she's a Nazi now because she supports free
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:44.080]  speech in America is very, very dangerous. I had a big run in with Michelle Malkin. There
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:51.360]  was a video of Marines throwing a baby puppy, a baby dog off of a cliff and I support the
[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:55.240]  military. I support the Marines even when they're sent in on illegal wars. I'm a big
[2:47:55.240 --> 2:48:00.520]  supporter of the military. I support the VA. I pushed hard for that. But I covered it and
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:07.840]  she said I put a fake video out with an electronic dog. And so I ran into her in Denver during
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:18.120]  the DNC in 2008 because that was 2007 then. And I got in her face and her big bodyguard
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:24.600]  ran his elbow into me. I elbowed that guy in the stomach and he just started crying.
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:29.080]  I was like, dude, just because you're 6'7 or something doesn't mean I won't climb up
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:34.680]  on top. The point is, is that I liked Michelle Malkin. She'd been on the show before that.
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:39.560]  She said I was a liar and a conspiracy theorist and I got in her face and her guy hit me with
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:45.000]  his elbow. So I elbowed him back in the elbow and they basically ran for the hills. But
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:52.120]  I'm not bragging. That's just a famous story. And she put out the disinfo story that I was
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:58.160]  attacking her. She had attacked me. She had gotten in my face. But I don't think she should
[2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:02.120]  be fired. I think she should have her speech and she sure is held on a Nazi. She's very
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:06.800]  pro-Israel. And, you know, I'll tell you, I used to be neutral on Israel, but everybody
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:11.680]  tried to make me be anti-Israel, so I'm pro-Israel. I mean, you look at the piece of place like
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:17.680]  Saudi Arabia won't take one refugee, supposed refugee, or Palestinian, but Israel's supposed
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:21.480]  to. If Israel disappeared, you'd have the Islamists killing each other forever over
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:25.480]  and I'm sick of it. I will not choose the side of radical Islam over Israel. And you've
[2:49:25.480 --> 2:49:29.200]  got most of the leftist Jews supporting the Islamic invasion and the rest of it. So this
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:32.880]  idea that the Jews are this big model thing drives me crazy, but I don't even want to
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:37.280]  get into the debate because I'm tired of it. I want to promote big 10 ideas of Americana
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:42.840]  and freedom. And what Turning Point USA and YAF and all these groups are doing is not
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:46.480]  doing that. So going back to Foyntest, let's get this out in the open. I've seen your Cookie
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:51.560]  Monster deal where you're reading what somebody has said to you in a super chat, people that
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:55.720]  don't know on YouTube and you're talking to them and the fans pay three bucks and that's
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:49:59.400]  how you fund yourself. And then you read their question and then you're talking about something
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:02.840]  about ovens and Cookie Monster and making a joke or something about the Holocaust. I don't
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:06.800]  think that's funny, but you shouldn't be the platform and you shouldn't be silenced over
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:11.920]  that. So let's just get this out in the open. What is your issue on Israel, the Jews, the
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:16.800]  whole nine yards? Sure. Well, yeah, like you said, the clip that's floating around, I talk
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:21.680]  about the Holocaust and, you know, in that case, it's obviously very context dependent.
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:25.840]  It's clearly a joke. It's clearly tongue in cheek and laughing throughout the video.
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:30.440]  And they always cut off the last five seconds where I say in the video, it's all ironic.
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:34.480]  It's all a joke. And that's really sort of the tone of generations each humor. It's very
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:40.640]  ironic. It's all supposed to be just as politically incorrect as possible. Exactly. Right. It's
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:45.400]  meant to shock. It's meant to be outrageous. But my deal on Israel and Jews in general
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:50.680]  is, well, in the case of Israel, I sort of have like you say a neutral position. I understand
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:56.200]  you're pro-Israel. I'm basically neutral. I see sort of this idea of Islam versus Israel
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:00.480]  is maybe a false choice. I choose America first. That's the name of my show. You know,
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:04.200]  so I don't necessarily have a problem with Israel. I don't hate Israel. I don't, you
[2:51:04.200 --> 2:51:07.920]  know, think about Israel every waking hour of my day. I just wish you would stop sending
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:11.280]  them money. I wish they would stop spying on us. You know, I wish that we could have
[2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:15.400]  a more amical or reciprocal relationship. And that's really the long and short of it.
[2:51:15.400 --> 2:51:21.280]  Well, let me just say this. I have been mercilessly persecuted by the Anti-Defamation League who
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.760]  now says the okay sign is evil. My son is a senior in high school. One of his friends
[2:51:26.760 --> 2:51:33.520]  was taken to the principal for making the okay sign. That's a cult. The ADL is dangerous.
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:40.440]  And it's corrupt leftist Jews projecting Nazism onto America. So I get the backlash, but that's
[2:51:40.440 --> 2:51:47.480]  not Jews in general. Just because a group of leftist Jews are using persecution of Jews
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:51.760]  as a reason to go around and persecute people doesn't mean all Jews are bad. So let me ask
[2:51:51.760 --> 2:51:56.440]  you this question. I mean, are there good Jewish people in the world, Nick Fuentes?
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:52:00.800]  Of course, of course. And I know a lot of them, Paul Godfrey, Darren Beatty, you know,
[2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:04.680]  some of my best friends are Jewish. And I don't think the claim is ever that every Jewish
[2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:09.120]  person is up to no good or they're, you know, involved in some conspiracy. But I think like
[2:52:09.120 --> 2:52:14.360]  you say, there are some nefarious actors, Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, the ADL,
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:17.920]  the SPLC. And, you know, they're problematic and we can call them out. And I think that's
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:19.240]  really where it starts and ends.
[2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:27.400]  Well, absolutely. This is what I've said. The ADL came out of the Jewish mafia getting
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:33.600]  in trouble and a Jewish man kidnapping and raping and killing a little girl. And they
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:37.080]  and then they tried to come out and set up an organization, you know, you know, saying
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:41.000]  that you basically can't prosecute people for that. And then using the fact that America
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:45.040]  is so open to say that Jews can then commit crimes. And I don't think Jews should get
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:49.840]  out of jail free cards. And I totally agree with that. I'm just simply saying that there
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:53.560]  are a lot of great people in every group and every organization like Catholics. Some of
[2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:57.520]  the best people I know growing up are Catholic people. I've seen protesting in abortion clinics.
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:53:01.320]  90% of them are Catholic. I've got a lot of friends that would wake up at 3am of my
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:05.880]  pipes burst who are Catholic, who are good people, salt the earth, you know, my wife's
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:10.640]  Catholic. So so I understand their family or salt the earth people. You could you could
[2:53:10.640 --> 2:53:13.280]  give them a million dollars and come back 100 years later and it all be waiting for
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:18.240]  you. So I get that. But the Pope wants world government. The Pope has a bunch of pedophiles
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:22.480]  as deputy pope just got convicted. That guy's not a pope. So I don't blame the pope's criminal
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:28.520]  activities on Catholics. Sure. Well, and I think there's certainly an interesting analogy
[2:53:28.520 --> 2:53:32.000]  there. I think where I would push back a little bit is the fact that, you know, people can
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:36.520]  criticize the Pope all day long. I know where television and politicians can do this and
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:40.880]  you know, basically face no repercussions. I would say the Catholics don't really traditional
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:45.120]  Catholics don't really wield a lot of institutional power in the same way that other groups do.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:48.280]  And I'm not trying to be coy there. I'm just trying to be honest that, you know, I will
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:52.480]  be the first person to call out globalist influence from all kinds of institutions.
[2:53:52.480 --> 2:53:56.640]  Certainly, you know, I'm not a big fan of this pope in particular. I'm a Catholic.
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:00.280]  We have to adhere to a certain doctrine, but I'm not a fan of his politics and the deep
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:05.080]  state is, you know, problematic. But I think the problem becomes this double standard where,
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:09.040]  you know, we can criticize all these different facets, but, you know, one seems to be somewhat
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:14.040]  off limits or there seems to be, you know, a taboo or a sacred cow there. And I've always
[2:54:14.040 --> 2:54:16.520]  just said that I'll criticize every every globalist.
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:20.800]  Let me say this. I think the fact that there has been a taboo and a sacred cow has blown
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  up in the left's face using Nazism and blaming people for Nazism that aren't it's really
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:30.000]  hurt those organizations, exposing, you know, real groups and the fact that they're banning
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:36.680]  the bro fist and everything else shows a desire for power and control by the left. And look,
[2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:40.800]  you're on Twitter, you're on YouTube, you're on all these platforms. And I got to tell
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:46.120]  you, I'm not comparing you to David Duke. So is he? Why do you think I've been taken
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:50.280]  off everything, but you haven't? And I'm not putting that as a litmus test. I know Gorka,
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:52.280]  the gay whale, once you take it down.
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:58.120]  Well, I think that's a good question. I frankly don't know. I really find it puzzling. And
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:00.880]  you know, I don't want to make the case for me being deplatformed, but I'll say that,
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:03.960]  you know, maybe it's simply that I'm not on the radar yet. You know, I think the reason
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:08.720]  they deplatformed you is because you really are a threat to the system in the sense that
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:13.640]  you have a completely independent media operation that in terms of production and in terms of
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:18.240]  scope in terms of reaches on par with any major network. And I think they fear somebody
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:22.120]  that is legitimately independent, that has so much influence. And so I think that's why
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.560]  they came for you. You know, we got to realize it up until four or five weeks ago. I was
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:32.160]  reaching maybe, you know, 15, 20, 25,000 people per show. If I was lucky on a good night,
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:35.480]  it's only the last four weeks that I've blown up a little bit. So, you know, I could chalk
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:39.680]  it up to me, maybe just not being on the radar. Perhaps my last name has something to do with
[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:43.840]  it. You know, maybe Jack Dorsey finds Nick Fuentes on Twitter and they say, Oh, you know,
[2:55:43.840 --> 2:55:47.520]  he's one of these, uh, MAGA Hispanics, you know, one of these Latinos for Trump.
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:49.520]  So Fuentes is Spanish?
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:51.680]  Uh, yes. Yes, it is.
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:56.560]  Listen, let's do five more minutes on the other side. Uh, you are a very smart guy and that's
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:01.200]  clear. Most of these people just regurgitate talking points over and over again. And that
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:07.040]  is why they fear M4s. The model of this listener-supported multimedia, uh, was the biggest political
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:11.560]  show in world history up until the election. And then they, they had the secret ban and
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:16.600]  it expanded from there. But we were literally some days without even looking at everything,
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:21.720]  including 20, 30, 40 million views outside of the main platform. Uh, we're talking some
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:27.120]  days, 7 million people clicking on the audio streams. Uh, and so, yeah, uh, in the wars,
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:31.760]  they saw it. It was the biggest thing ever. We had super bowl level audiences, uh, every
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:35.720]  couple of days. And that's why we're going to come right back with a few final questions
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:39.720]  and play this, uh, situation with other conservative grips, uh, targeting free speech and now
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:43.520]  going after our own Caitlin Bennett. I guess next they'll say she's a Nazi because she
[2:56:43.520 --> 2:56:47.280]  supports free speech. That's coming up with Nick Pointes and Paul Watson. This is just
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:51.840]  a few minutes out. Please don't forget if we get money, we can do a bunch of other stuff.
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:56.480]  I got a bunch of things, subterranean being built, being set up, being prepared, not just
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:59.920]  a redesign of M4 wars, not just all these other sites out there that, you know, we helped
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:04.160]  build, but that aren't ours. There's a big project, a couple of big projects I've got
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:07.960]  going on. Uh, the enemies got my phones tapped. They all know what the projects are and they're
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:11.800]  really pissed and want to hurry up, get a shutdown. I need a bunch of money and I need
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:17.400]  a quick, I'm on a mission for God, as the blues brothers say, and ladies and gentlemen,
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:22.800]  infowarstore.com, get your DNA force plus amazing, get your X2, get the new whitening
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:28.440]  toothpaste, uh, with the silver saw solution, uh, in it and so much more infowarstore.com
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:31.760]  or triple A two, five, three, three, one, three, whatever you do, your word of mouth
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:36.160]  is king. So tell folks, however you're listening and keep spreading the word. Hour four with
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:44.880]  Nick Fuentes, Paul Watson and more straight about a month ago, President Trump announced
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:50.200]  that he was going to move his domicile from New York city to Florida where he's always
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:56.600]  said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited. They said, Oh, he's about
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:58:03.320]  to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida. Well, now we
[2:58:03.320 --> 2:58:08.000]  know why the president did that. He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts were going
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:12.760]  to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:19.720]  business partner he's got. They want to terrorize people that he's worked with. And by moving
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:24.720]  his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to
[2:58:24.720 --> 2:58:30.880]  get his tax returns that are supposed to be private. So all those people out there holding
[2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:36.680]  their breath for the president to resign. In his words, we're kicking the deep state's
[2:58:36.680 --> 2:58:43.080]  ass and he's never going to resign.
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:51.880]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:57.080]  will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:59:06.600]  limit to which other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil. It
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:13.160]  is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't
[2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:19.320]  exist or that there is no free will. There's no devil or the God. But those very same people
[2:59:19.320 --> 2:59:26.360]  have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and
[2:59:26.360 --> 2:59:31.320]  what our houses can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:37.880]  over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's the U.S. of banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:44.560]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:59:44.560 --> 2:59:59.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:04.440]  You know, when I say this is going to blow up in the neocons and all the candy-assist
[3:00:04.440 --> 3:00:11.160]  faces at Turning Point USA, firing Michelle Malek and saying she's a Nazi, literally,
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:17.160]  and all the rest of this crap, I can't state how bad it is. And once they start secret
[3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:22.160]  policing and checking IDs and having big lists of people that they're going to persecute,
[3:00:22.160 --> 3:00:25.600]  it's going to go just downhill from there. Whoever advised these morons to do this are
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:31.000]  idiots. I want people to come to my events and to disagree with me. It's super entertaining
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  and fun, but they're leftist. They just came in to take over the movement. That's clear.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:44.280]  That's the exact same playbook. And if they're going to try to tar the entire liberty movement
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:51.160]  to put Trump in power as Nazis, because Fuentes has said a few off-color things and clearly
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:56.760]  he's better on his feet than, you know, somebody like Ben Shapiro. It just really scares them.
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:00.600]  Well, believe me, like I told Vice when Trump won, I'm just the latest wave. A bunch of
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:07.200]  more waves are coming and Generation Z is not buying any of it. And so, folks, I'm not
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:13.000]  against Trump. It's a paradox, though. We love Trump, but we can't be Trump cult members.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:18.480]  We have to be liberty lovers, Americana, Renaissance lovers, freedom lovers, Christians, and realize
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:24.640]  that we don't hang our hat on Trump. We hang our hat on real values we stand for. Nick,
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:26.760]  any other comments on that?
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:30.560]  That's exactly right. You know, Trump got elected because he was in favor of America
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:34.840]  first. He was in favor of a wall and all the rest. And, you know, insofar as he's pursuing
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:39.000]  that, we support him. And when he falls short, then I think you're right. We have to hold
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:42.560]  him accountable and hold his feet to the fire. And, you know, that's our job with any politician.
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:45.600]  So I think that's the right mentality.
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  Let's get into Caitlin Bennett before you leave us the articles on InfoWars.com. YAF
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:56.040]  members, sick police on conservative activists are trying to ask Knowles a question. Let's
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:01:57.480]  go ahead and roll that clip.
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:01.640]  Hi. I wanted to ask you a question. I think it was you.
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:05.320]  We're not allowed to talk. We're not allowed to talk on behalf of YAF.
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:09.640]  But you were, you were the one telling, no, that's Caitlin Bennett. Don't.
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:11.200]  No, it was a misunderstanding. I promise.
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:12.560]  Can you explain that?
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:15.960]  It was a misunderstanding. I was just telling her that that was who you were.
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:17.360]  Then why were you doing the like, no.
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:19.360]  I'm sorry. We're not allowed to talk. I'm sorry.
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:21.360]  Why aren't you allowed to talk to me if you don't want me to ask questions?
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:22.360]  Because we don't represent.
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:23.360]  Yes, you do.
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:24.360]  We just don't represent.
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  Yes, you do.
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:27.920]  And why did you give that no symbol like that?
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:32.360]  I can't remember doing that, but if I did, that was honestly, I promise it was not anything
[3:02:32.360 --> 3:02:36.200]  about you. I was just, she didn't recognize you or know you. So I wanted to let her know
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:37.200]  that that was you.
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:38.200]  Come on guys.
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:39.200]  You were wondering about this.
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:40.200]  Guys, come on.
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:41.200]  I really promise.
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:42.200]  Come on.
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:43.200]  Be honest with me.
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:44.200]  I'm sorry. I'm putting an end to this.
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:45.200]  Are you?
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:46.200]  The police officers right there.
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:47.200]  This is the public campus.
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:48.200]  Now they call the police.
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:53.400]  Now we'll keep rolling the video, but these are more of these people that were that Bennett
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:58.520]  learned were actually trying to get her deplatformed. And so I guess they see her as legitimate
[3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:03.000]  and as real and not controlled because, you know, turning point USA tried to get Caitlin
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:04.560]  Bennett and others to work for them.
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:08.400]  And when they wouldn't, they put out fake memes that she pooped her pants and stuff
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:09.400]  like that.
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:14.080]  And so there's a lot of real nastiness going on and she didn't want to come out and expose
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:18.040]  them. But I guess without even my direction, she started to expose these other similar
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:19.040]  groups.
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:20.040]  Now they call the cops on her.
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:23.600]  I mean, that's the so-called conservatives just can't wait to call the police because
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:24.600]  she tried to talk to them.
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:25.600]  They want to give speeches.
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:29.600]  I want to talk about her, but don't want to talk to her, Nick, that this is not going
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:30.600]  to go well.
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:32.080]  No, not at all.
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:36.120]  And you know what's so telling about this is that they invite leftists to ask questions.
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:40.040]  They're so polite to the leftists who show up, you know, people that support abortion
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:42.480]  and socialism and all these other horrible things.
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:46.200]  But somebody like Caitlin Bennett or people, you know, who have rosaries in their hands
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:49.680]  wearing trump hats, they literally call the police on them to get them removed.
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:53.920]  And I think that exposes exactly what's going on, which is that they want to have a controlled
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:59.360]  conversation between the controlled globalist left and the controlled globalist right.
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:03.320]  And anybody, as you said, that is a free thinker, anybody like Caitlin or yourself or me or
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:07.960]  anybody that's not on board with this controlled conversation between two sides of the same
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:12.480]  globalist coin, well, they have to shut that down and have to brand those people as racists
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:16.520]  and Nazis and make sure that nobody associates with them and nobody can, you know, try and
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:18.920]  rehabilitate their image or anything like that.
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:19.920]  That's exactly what this is about.
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:22.680]  And it's totally backfiring because people see it for what it is.
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:26.720]  It's a very bad look to have police pulling people for asking questions at a still call.
[3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:31.080]  And that comes up on the video and just how, sorry, how wimpy and dumb these women are
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:32.560]  compared to Caitlin Bennett.
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:37.000]  That's who wants to lead us is all these little chicken neck weirdos and Gorka the gay whale
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.480]  and everything else is just amazing.
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:42.600]  I'm not saying Gorka is literally gay, he just has a little pocket watch and is a dandy
[3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:45.600]  and polished shoes and like chicks' butts, swish, swish.
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:47.320]  I mean, he looked good in the dress.
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:48.320]  Nick Fuentes, thank you.
[3:04:48.320 --> 3:04:50.680]  We appreciate you.
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:55.080]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:04:59.840]  of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:01.800]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:06.520]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[3:05:06.520 --> 3:05:10.840]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed that they were really
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:17.640]  setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:23.440]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be
[3:05:23.440 --> 3:05:24.440]  opposed.
[3:05:24.440 --> 3:05:30.440]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:36.480]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:41.320]  they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing
[3:05:41.320 --> 3:05:42.320]  to succeed.
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:46.560]  And that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:06:16.360]  ever.
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:20.600]  All right, well the fourth hour of the show and we're going to be talking about a whole
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:24.040]  host of issues in this hour.
[3:06:24.040 --> 3:06:29.040]  We're not going to be talking about the impeachment hearings because as polls already show, and
[3:06:29.040 --> 3:06:33.320]  as Trump's approval numbers show, I looked at Trump's approval numbers before and during
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:39.560]  these impeachment proceedings were taking place, basically haven't changed whatsoever.
[3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:41.240]  Everybody's already bored of it.
[3:06:41.240 --> 3:06:42.240]  Nobody's watching it.
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:47.800]  I've been telling the New York Times that the sin of communicating with a foreign leader
[3:06:47.800 --> 3:06:52.640]  as president of the United States, God forbid, obviously these impeachment hearings are just
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:58.480]  part of the ongoing coup against President Donald Trump to keep this fog of corruption
[3:06:58.480 --> 3:07:04.040]  hanging over his head as we go into 2020 and Americans are already completely bored of
[3:07:04.040 --> 3:07:06.200]  the impeachment hearings headline.
[3:07:06.200 --> 3:07:12.360]  On Summit.News Americans are already bored of the impeachment hearings and this is a
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:13.360]  New York Times article.
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:19.120]  They went out and interviewed a bunch of voters and basically nobody cares.
[3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:20.120]  Nobody's watching it.
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:24.120]  Even if anyone does care, they say, I'm going to wait until it finishes before I even check
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:26.040]  into it.
[3:07:26.040 --> 3:07:31.160]  An article entitled, No One Believes Anything, Voters Worn Out by a Fog of Political News.
[3:07:31.160 --> 3:07:35.040]  The New York Times talked to Americans about how they viewed the spectacle and they didn't
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:37.280]  come across as very enthusiastic.
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:43.480]  It says in Upstate New York, Travis Trudell got an alert on his phone Wednesday morning
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:46.360]  telling him that the impeachment hearings had started.
[3:07:46.360 --> 3:07:49.320]  He turned on Disney Plus instead.
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:07:53.760]  That's another way, by the way, that Apple and these other companies try and manipulate
[3:07:53.760 --> 3:07:56.040]  people, drive them towards certain narratives.
[3:07:56.040 --> 3:08:01.400]  They flash up a breaking news story on your phone and you don't really care about it.
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:04.480]  You haven't even opted into that but they do it anyway.
[3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:07.840]  But this individual in New York got an alert on his phone basically telling him to watch
[3:08:07.840 --> 3:08:09.680]  the impeachment hearings.
[3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:15.440]  He decided to watch Disney's new streaming service instead, not interested.
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:20.840]  Resident of Wisconsin, Jare Corrigan, said she had, quote, never considered watching
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:27.280]  the hearings, never even considered it, despite a wall of mainstream media attention, despite
[3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:31.920]  Apple telling people to watch it, she never even considered watching it.
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:38.280]  Meanwhile, in Idaho, computer programmer Russell Memory, quite the appropriate name, said he
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:42.840]  would, quote, catch up in a few weeks when the hearings were over.
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:46.080]  So he hasn't got any interest in watching it.
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:50.160]  He said the media's relentless anti-Trump narrative has created a kind of orange man
[3:08:50.160 --> 3:08:52.400]  bad fatigue amongst voters.
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:57.800]  Again, everybody's lost in this miasma of not trusting the media, being distracted by
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:00.000]  all these different news issues.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:01.560]  Everyone's got a different set of facts.
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:04.040]  No one can agree on any set of facts.
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:10.560]  So Americans across the board, across the partisan divide, are simply turning off.
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:11.640]  He said it's harder now.
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:13.680]  They want to grab you with those headlines.
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:14.680]  Trump did this.
[3:09:14.680 --> 3:09:15.680]  Trump did that.
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:16.680]  You have to go in and really research it.
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:19.640]  And I don't think a lot of people do that.
[3:09:19.640 --> 3:09:23.960]  The responses indicate that Americans are aware of the overwhelmingly likely outcome that
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:25.760]  Trump will not be impeached.
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:29.240]  Of course, the Senate is not going to vote for it, and that the hearings are just another
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:36.320]  attempt by Democrats to keep a cloud hovering over the president as we get closer to 2020.
[3:09:36.320 --> 3:09:37.920]  Nobody's watching the impeachment hearings.
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:39.320]  Nobody really cares.
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:46.160]  Everyone realizes it's a partisan witch, and it's basically trying to decry demonize Trump
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:50.040]  simply for talking to foreign leaders what they've done from the very beginning.
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:53.360]  There's an article out of WAMU.
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:54.360]  This is very interesting.
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:57.760]  I just wrote an article on this about 20 minutes ago.
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:03.200]  When Democrats are so politically intolerant, they even refuse to date other Democrats.
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:04.800]  This is how bad it's got.
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:09.880]  Of course, we had Bill Maher on his show last week, coming out and saying that the partisan
[3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:16.720]  bickering in America is now so bad that it's breaking down divides of Americans to such
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:22.120]  a degree that there could be civil war if that rhetoric is not toned down.
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:27.160]  He said, quote, home is where you learn that the three magic words in any relationship
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:29.600]  aren't I love you, they'll let it go.
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:35.560]  We're going to have to learn to live with each other or else there will be blood.
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:40.640]  And for leftists, for Democrats, they can't seem to let anything go, even to the point
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:44.480]  where they refuse to form romantic bonds with anyone who doesn't support their chosen
[3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:46.560]  presidential candidate.
[3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:49.960]  So now it's not just about hating on Trump supporters.
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:54.560]  Of course, we've had stories down the years, the past couple of years, about husbands and
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:01.720]  wives, mainly from the female side, breaking up with their partners, with their spouses,
[3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:04.360]  because of their support for President Donald Trump.
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:05.360]  That was stage one.
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:10.680]  Now it's so bad that they refuse to even go on dates with other Democrats.
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:15.760]  The article is entitled, Dating a Democrat, How 2020's presidential election has altered
[3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:22.560]  romance in D.C., and we learned that some Dems are insisting in their dating profile
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:28.360]  bios that there would be partner share, basically, their every political view.
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:33.400]  So they talked to a bunch of people who'd used dating apps and websites in recent months
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:36.640]  in Washington, D.C., and this is what they found out.
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:42.720]  29-year-old Elizabeth Warren supporter, and there seems to be a definite split between
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:48.400]  a definite level of intolerance exhibited by Elizabeth Warren supporters, Sam Rick
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:54.840]  told WAMU that although she might occasionally go on a date with a Bernie Sanders supporter,
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:59.400]  nine times out of 10, it turns into a very big argument.
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:03.640]  So the Elizabeth Warren supporters can't even get on with the Bernie Sanders supporters
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:07.520]  anymore to the point of not having a day end up in a giant row.
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:11.120]  That's how bad the partisan divide is.
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:14.560]  She said, I've been on dates whereby by the end of the night, it's completely ruined.
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:19.640]  I know where it's going to go, best to just avoid it.
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:25.800]  And this is similar to the social credit scoring system in China whereby people who hold certain
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:32.160]  political opinions, maybe people who've transgressed across the road on a red light, for example,
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:35.680]  aren't even being allowed to have accounts on dating websites.
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:37.160]  So maybe that's the next step.
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:42.760]  In fact, I think there was a story a few months ago about a dating website just for conservatives
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:45.080]  or just for Trump supporters.
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:50.760]  That basically got shut down amidst a wave of demonization and memes.
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:53.800]  Now Democrats don't even want to date other Democrats.
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:12:55.720]  That's how bad it's got.
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:13:02.360]  She also said this Elizabeth Warren supporter in DC, if she finds out a potential date supports
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:07.880]  Joe Biden, it's, quote, an immediate swipe left.
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:12.720]  So they won't even swipe right on fellow Democrats anymore.
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:16.920]  Another woman called Hannah revealed that a guy pretty much broke up with me to go to
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:24.320]  work for the Beto O'Rourke campaign because she didn't support Beto.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:29.560]  Probably good to have learned that information well in advance if somebody is that picky
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:34.240]  that they will dump you to go to work for a failing presidential candidate who barely
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:39.120]  got beyond what 1% of the vote before quitting the race.
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:45.280]  Another lady called Paige revealed that a man she was on a date with, she would, quote,
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:51.200]  stand up and walk out because he said he was, God forbid, a, quote, moderate.
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:55.840]  Another Elizabeth Warren supporter or a woman called Serena revealed that she was more wary
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:00.920]  of dates who supported Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg and that this counted as, quote,
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:03.080]  a point against them.
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:08.120]  Imagine if they found out their date was a Trump supporter, all hell would break loose.
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:14.120]  So it's now got to the point where Democrats are so angered by everything.
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:18.560]  I think there was a recent study which proved that Democrats are basically angered by everything
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  now.
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:25.440]  The Trump derangement syndrome has reached such heights that they're so angry so much
[3:14:25.440 --> 3:14:31.600]  of the time that even if somebody diverges from them slightly on any policy, and in fact
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:35.640]  there was another example in this article of somebody who had a slightly different opinion
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:44.400]  on Medicaid and they just up to left the restaurant, now they refuse to even date other Democrats.
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:49.400]  Meanwhile, South Dakota spends nearly half a million dollars on anti-meth ad campaign
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:52.480]  with tagline, meth, where on it?
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:54.600]  Weird flex, but okay.
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:58.040]  And this is not a satirical article, this is not out of the onion.
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:03.240]  They even featured a video of the governor, Christy Noam, telling the camera, quote, I'm
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:08.120]  on meth, before she explains that on it means on the case of meth.
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:13.760]  They literally paid an advertising company nearly five hundred thousand dollars to come
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:19.480]  up with this tagline, taxpayer money, which compares to one million, which was set aside
[3:15:19.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  for actual meth treatment.
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:26.320]  So they spent almost half the amount coming up with this ridiculous tagline, meth, I'm
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:28.600]  on it, being completely lampooned.
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:31.240]  And obviously that campaign is going to completely fail.
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:36.760]  We're going to be back in the next segment with news about Prince Andrew, also going
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:43.080]  to talk about demographics as it relates to the upcoming election in the United Kingdom.
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:44.880]  Summit.
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:46.640]  Cool.
[3:15:46.640 --> 3:15:49.720]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:53.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:55.160]  I sued the IRS and won.
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:15:58.120]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:01.440]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:03.680]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:05.000]  I can help you too.
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:10.200]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:18.080]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:23.440]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:24.440]  the world.
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:27.480]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:27.480 --> 3:16:33.480]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:37.280]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:37.280 --> 3:16:38.280]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:39.840]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:46.400]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:48.440]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:51.480]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:16:56.800 --> 3:16:57.800]  or a foreign hacker?

[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:56.080]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[3:17:56.080 --> 3:18:00.880]  New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:08.160]  And the left got so excited, they said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of
[3:18:08.160 --> 3:18:11.600]  facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:14.120]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:18.360]  He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his
[3:18:18.360 --> 3:18:24.200]  tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[3:18:24.200 --> 3:18:28.320]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:32.360]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:37.840]  they've passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[3:18:37.840 --> 3:18:43.280]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:49.200]  words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:55.000]  M4store.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:57.120]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:02.560]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:07.160]  and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five of the colloidal silver and iodine
[3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:10.720]  in fluoride-free, the adult or the children's.
[3:19:10.720 --> 3:19:14.440]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:15.440]  People love it.
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:20.800]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above-sea coral calcium that also cleans
[3:19:20.800 --> 3:19:23.480]  but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:28.680]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:29.680]  ginsivitis.
[3:19:29.680 --> 3:19:30.680]  This is all proven.
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:31.680]  You can make claims with this.
[3:19:31.680 --> 3:19:37.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:43.040]  viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[3:19:43.040 --> 3:19:44.360]  So we're really proud of it.
[3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:47.120]  It funds the operation in FullWareStore.com.
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:52.040]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you.
[3:19:52.040 --> 3:20:16.840]  We're live, and the fallout from the Prince Andrew interview on the BBC continues in case
[3:20:16.840 --> 3:20:22.280]  you didn't see it, basically it was an hour-long denial charges the allegations against him
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:28.080]  that he basically was supplied with underage sex-trafficked girls by Jeffrey Epstein's
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:29.080]  network.
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:35.240]  Throughout the interview, he denied every charge while blinking 10 times in 10 seconds
[3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:39.960]  in one instance when he was asked directly whether he slept with one of these girls when
[3:20:39.960 --> 3:20:48.520]  she was a minor underage, but apparently, what's more shocking than him allegedly having
[3:20:48.520 --> 3:20:53.680]  had sex with an underage girl that had been sex-trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein's network
[3:20:53.680 --> 3:21:00.480]  is the claim that he may have said the N-word several years ago during a private conversation.
[3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:04.600]  That's more shocking, apparently, according to many respondents to this article today,
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:06.320]  which is out the telegraph.
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:12.120]  Prince Andrew made racist comment about Arabs ex-home secretary says, the Duke has been
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:16.720]  dragged into a fresh racism row after the former Home Secretary Jackie Smith said she
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:20.520]  was left slackjoyed by a comment he allegedly made about Arabs.
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:25.040]  A Monday former top policy head on technology today, the Cameron Rowan Silver claimed Prince
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:31.240]  Andrew used the phrase N-word in the woodpile during a meeting at Buckingham Palace seven
[3:21:31.240 --> 3:21:32.240]  years ago.
[3:21:32.240 --> 3:21:36.880]  Again, they're not going to be able to prove that it's just one claim that is now being
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:42.480]  treated as more shocking than the actual allegation that he engaged in sex with an underage minor
[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:46.400]  sex trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:50.840]  Mrs Smith, who now hosts podcasts during recording said, I met him, Prince Andrew, several times
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:55.320]  including once at a state banquet, where after dinner, I and my husband and another Labour
[3:21:55.320 --> 3:21:59.040]  Cabinet minister had a drink with him, and I have to say the conversation left a slack
[3:21:59.040 --> 3:22:02.360]  joy with things he felt it was appropriate to say.
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:07.720]  Well, if you've read the things that Prince Philip has said down the years, the apple
[3:22:07.720 --> 3:22:12.200]  doesn't fall very far from the tree, so it's no big surprise.
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:19.520]  But the bigger fallout is that five big names have now cut ties with Prince Andrew.
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:24.400]  Standard Chartered and others have pulled backing for the royals main charity following
[3:22:24.400 --> 3:22:30.520]  his car crash interview, and now four different universities are considering ditching him.
[3:22:30.520 --> 3:22:35.040]  So of course, one of his big defences during this car crash interview, which basically
[3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:39.080]  every PR person has said was a complete disaster and should have never have done it.
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:43.880]  In fact, I think his PR aide quit two weeks beforehand and said he shouldn't have done
[3:22:43.880 --> 3:22:44.880]  it.
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:46.160]  He did it anyway.
[3:22:46.160 --> 3:22:51.520]  He tries to come out with this defense that he works with charities that aid children.
[3:22:51.520 --> 3:22:58.500]  We always see that, of course, he claims he was a pizza express emphasis on the word pizza
[3:22:58.500 --> 3:23:03.600]  during the night that he allegedly danced with and then later had sex with this underage
[3:23:03.600 --> 3:23:04.600]  minor.
[3:23:04.600 --> 3:23:09.520]  Of course, we had the big story out yesterday, which was linked up on the Drudge report about
[3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:14.040]  how he claimed during the interview, Prince Andrew, that her claim that he was sweating
[3:23:14.040 --> 3:23:18.480]  profusely when he was dancing with her in this nightclub could not have been true because
[3:23:18.480 --> 3:23:22.400]  he suffered from a medical condition that prevented him from sweating.
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:27.480]  Unfortunately, for the Duke of York, people then immediately unearthed photos from the
[3:23:27.480 --> 3:23:32.800]  same time during the same years, where he was seen indeed sweating profusely.
[3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:38.160]  Well, now advertising week Europe, which has supported the pitch at Palace Project, which
[3:23:38.160 --> 3:23:43.120]  is Prince Andrew's project, who was hailed as an official supporter by the Prince, is
[3:23:43.120 --> 3:23:47.080]  the latest company to pull its backing for the beleaguered Duke.
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:50.680]  Others will not be inviting Andrew or his team to its four-day summit in London, one
[3:23:50.680 --> 3:23:55.520]  of the world's largest gatherings of advertising execs and experts being held in the capital
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:23:57.240]  next March.
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:04.400]  So he's basically now being kind of de-platformed by all these different organizations.
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:08.680]  Now out of the BBC, new Jeffrey Epstein accuser calls on Prince Andrew to talk.
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:10.560]  Of course, he's probably not going to do that.
[3:24:10.560 --> 3:24:12.600]  He said during the interview that he maybe would.
[3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:15.520]  If he took legal advice, it's obviously not going to happen.
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:17.720]  He doesn't want to impugn himself any further.
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:21.840]  But a woman has come forward to accuse the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein of
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:26.360]  sexually abusing her as a 15-year-old and urged Prince Andrew to share information on
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:31.240]  his former friend, the accuser known as Jane Doe 15, told reporters she has suffered a vicious
[3:24:31.240 --> 3:24:33.360]  prolonged sexual assault.
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:38.120]  Now she's calling on Prince Andrew to speak out against it.
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:43.600]  That is not going to happen, given the car crash nature of his BBC interview.
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:50.320]  Meanwhile, the Express reports, Prince Andrew interviewed Duke's Pizza Express claim questioned
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:53.040]  by security expert.
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:57.400]  Security expert Tom, who called into James O'Brien's LBC show to share why Prince Andrew
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:01.840]  might be able to demonstrate if his Pizza Express story was true or not.
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:08.520]  So he basically makes the point that the royal family has this security detail where it's
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:13.560]  recorded, where they are at all times, and that will be in the history, that will be
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:15.120]  in the log books.
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:21.400]  So they'll be able to claim whether he did visit that Pizza Express in Woking, England
[3:25:21.400 --> 3:25:26.760]  on the night that this alleged sexual liaison happened.
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:30.800]  The security expert speculated Prince Andrew is one of the principal members of the royal
[3:25:30.800 --> 3:25:31.800]  family.
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:35.800]  He's got close protection records which go back, close protection records for the royal
[3:25:35.800 --> 3:25:40.680]  family or precise down to which building they are in, because they'll have 24-hour protection
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:42.320]  for where he is at all times.
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:47.400]  If you wanted to be able to demonstrate where he was that night, then he'll be able to.
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:48.880]  So they've actually got the records.
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:54.200]  It remains to be seen if they're going to be dug out, I would venture probably not.
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:26:00.000]  Meanwhile, sticking with the UK, where we've got an election coming up next month on December
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:07.200]  12, the third election within space of four years, 320 bleed control kits to be given
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:09.800]  to bars in London.
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:14.400]  The knife crime epidemic, the violent crime epidemic continues to skyrocket.
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:18.840]  Meanwhile, police are being tasked with arresting mothers in their own kitchens for saying that
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:20.120]  men are men.
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:24.480]  Meanwhile, police resources are being diverted to all manner of ludicrous things.
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:27.080]  Meanwhile, police are saying that they're not going to be able to attend burglaries
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:30.120]  and other low-level crimes.
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:36.480]  Knife crime in the city of London, which by the way is like a one square mile area right
[3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:39.880]  in the center of the financial district, that's not the whole city of London.
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:45.120]  It's a small area, which is very touristy, very business-like.
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:48.600]  It's noted as one of the safest areas in London.
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:55.160]  But in that area of London alone, knife crime jumped 43% over the last year, and during
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:59.360]  the same time, England, as a whole, saw a record high of 43,000 knife crimes across
[3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:00.360]  the country.
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:06.440]  Well, now they're giving out bleed control kits to bars, pubs, nightclubs in the city
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:09.720]  of London in that one square mile zone.
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:15.440]  The kits will be handed out by city of London police at a cost of £25,000.
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:20.440]  Authorities said they were proud to launch the initiative, with David Law's chief superintendent
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:24.560]  at the city of London police telling Sky News the decision was a no-brainer.
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:28.400]  He said this is a really, really simple piece of kit, which can make a big difference, particularly
[3:27:28.400 --> 3:27:30.360]  with the most catastrophic bleeds.
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:34.880]  If you don't get help in the first few minutes, the person will almost certainly die.
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:43.680]  Notice that these bleed control kits are not really a big necessity in cities like Budapest
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:46.920]  and Warsaw, where I just visited last week.
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:50.360]  I wonder why that is.
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:54.800]  Is it related to the fact that we have a growing migrant population in London, people coming
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:28:00.800]  from places, especially in North Africa, where their gang warfare, their turf warfare, is
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:05.880]  significantly more violent than what we've been used to in the UK in recent years?
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:11.080]  And our own homegrown violent gangs are having to step up their levels of violence just to
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:15.960]  compete with these new gang leaders that are coming in via the migrant wave.
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:19.480]  Again, we've got massive violent crime soaring.
[3:28:19.480 --> 3:28:25.560]  We've got police departments putting out tweets, where they literally go and collect spoons
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:30.560]  and spanners and tools and brag about it on Twitter as if they're keeping everybody safe.
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.960]  Meanwhile, hundreds of these bleak pits are having to be handed out to bars in the night.
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:44.520]  But one tiny, well-to-do area of London alone, just to cope with this soaring 43% rise in
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  night crime.
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:47.520]  Don't go away.
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:48.520]  We'll be back.
[3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:53.360]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:57.520]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:02.400]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:06.040]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:10.560]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:29:10.560 --> 3:29:11.560]  across America.
[3:29:11.560 --> 3:29:15.400]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:19.120]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:20.120]  healthier I feel.
[3:29:20.120 --> 3:29:22.760]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:22.760 --> 3:29:27.920]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:30.400]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:38.640]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, or order
[3:29:38.640 --> 3:29:50.920]  online, hbextract.com, heart and body extract, 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[3:29:50.920 --> 3:29:54.560]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[3:29:54.560 --> 3:30:01.640]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[3:30:01.640 --> 3:30:03.280]  How far will they go?
[3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:04.280]  What's their limit?
[3:30:04.280 --> 3:30:11.080]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:16.560]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[3:30:16.560 --> 3:30:23.280]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist, or that there's
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:27.880]  no free will, there's no devil, or the God, but those very same people have all these
[3:30:27.880 --> 3:30:34.880]  rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:35.880]  can be like.
[3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:40.200]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[3:30:40.200 --> 3:30:45.760]  Oxford's banned clapping, university's the U.S. have banned 21 guns to loot for veterans.
[3:30:45.760 --> 3:30:49.560]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[3:30:49.560 --> 3:30:55.520]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up, I've said it many times, I will never
[3:30:55.520 --> 3:30:57.320]  give in.
[3:30:57.320 --> 3:31:00.880]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[3:31:00.880 --> 3:31:06.240]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[3:31:06.240 --> 3:31:12.120]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been
[3:31:12.120 --> 3:31:18.120]  silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[3:31:18.120 --> 3:31:25.120]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[3:31:25.120 --> 3:31:31.400]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and banned.video and that people
[3:31:31.400 --> 3:31:35.840]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever and that if you tell people, hey, the banned
[3:31:35.840 --> 3:31:41.640]  truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned.video.
[3:31:41.640 --> 3:31:45.720]  So take heart folks, they've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because
[3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:50.320]  the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[3:31:50.320 --> 3:31:55.520]  Ato Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[3:31:55.520 --> 3:32:00.960]  rifles and he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said
[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:02.840]  that he was a hero.
[3:32:02.840 --> 3:32:03.840]  Think about that.
[3:32:03.840 --> 3:32:07.600]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:14.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:16.600]  and incredible levels of violent crime.
[3:32:16.600 --> 3:32:19.120]  They know what they're doing.
[3:32:19.120 --> 3:32:24.240]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:27.040]  for what criminals do using their firearms.
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:30.600]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country's under such incredible attack.
[3:32:30.600 --> 3:32:36.200]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[3:32:36.200 --> 3:32:40.040]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:42.080]  going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:47.080]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens, well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional
[3:32:47.080 --> 3:32:53.000]  laws.
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:33:02.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:09.880]  Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom, you're listening to
[3:33:09.880 --> 3:33:11.880]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:11.880 --> 3:33:18.040]  We're live and we're going to get back into some more news from Europe.

[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:56.600]  Now over in Europe, I just returned from Hungary and now Viktor Orbán has come out with another
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:34:58.760]  great speech on the future of Europe.
[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:03.120]  He says Western Europe is finished, Central Europe is the future.
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:10.080]  This was a speech in memory of the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, which saw the
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:11.240]  end of communist rule.
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:15.560]  Of course, he said, quote, 30 years ago, we thought that Europe was our future, but today
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:20.520]  we think we are Europe's future and we are ready for this mission.
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:24.040]  He warned that globalists in Western Europe are currently in the process of wiping out
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:28.960]  European society based on nation-states and Christian culture and that Central European
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:30.560]  countries are standing up to this.
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:35.120]  God forbid they stand up for basic Christian heritage in their own countries and refuse
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:40.320]  to import millions of people who don't really stand for those values.
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:44.960]  He said we want to live as free nations, not as provinces or subordinates to empire.
[3:35:44.960 --> 3:35:48.360]  He said we are Central European Democrats, therefore we must defend the sovereignty of
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:54.160]  nation-states because if we abandon it, it will mean the end of democracy.
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:35:58.920]  Of course, Orbán is currently conducting an interesting program in Hungary, trying
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:07.440]  to rebuild their population by offering 30,600 euros to Hungarian citizens, married couples
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:10.080]  who have three or more children.
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:13.080]  The question is, would some people try to abuse that loan?
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:17.040]  Yes, they would, but not with the provisions included.
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:21.920]  Because when a married couple receives the 30,000 euros as a loan from the government,
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:26.640]  upon getting married, that's when they can apply for it, in fact, I spoke to a couple
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:32.840]  who did exactly that in Hungary and they were big fans of this, you have to repay the loan
[3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:37.920]  until you have the three children at which point the loan is completely forgiven.
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:44.000]  So that is the incentive for them to have the kids and that prevents it from being abused.
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:48.200]  And since Orbán really took power in Hungary, just look at the impact in terms of pro-family
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:50.400]  policies in that country.
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:57.560]  We've got the stats here in this article, abortion in Hungary from 2010 to 2017 dropped
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:03.160]  from 40,000 abortions to 28,000 abortions, that's huge.
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:12.440]  Divorces fell from 23,000 to 18,000 and marriages increased by a whopping 42% across Hungary.
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:19.520]  So those pro-family policies are having a real bite, a real impact in that country.
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:25.160]  Unlike in Sweden, which has gone the opposite way, finally, the media is now admitting that
[3:37:25.160 --> 3:37:32.000]  the wave of grenade attacks, explosions, knife crime, shootings, burglaries, robbings is
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  through the roof basically and completely unprecedented.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:37.560]  The past three years, they denied it was a problem.
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:41.800]  Well, now left-wing journalist on Sweden's migrant suburbs says, quote, everyone knew
[3:37:41.800 --> 3:37:46.680]  it would end in disaster, but they all pushed it anyway because they were busy importing
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:48.400]  a whole new voting block.
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:55.240]  A left-wing journalist in Sweden, who vehemently supported mass immigration, has changed a tune.
[3:37:55.240 --> 3:37:59.520]  By the way, remember, we had the article where all the left-wing politicians and activists
[3:37:59.520 --> 3:38:05.480]  in Sweden who had pushed mass immigration weren't living in the areas of Sweden where
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:09.280]  mass immigration was taking place, that complete hypocrites, they don't want to be anywhere
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:13.800]  near it, the consequences are borne by the local populations there.
[3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:18.680]  Well, now this left-wing Swedish journalist, Afton Bladett's Lena Mellon, acknowledges
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:22.160]  that Sweden's attempt to integrate huge numbers of migrants from Africa and the Middle East
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:23.160]  has failed.
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:29.560]  This is the same thing that Trump was attacked for back in 2017 with his famous last night
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:32.160]  in Sweden, quote.
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:36.600]  She said all parties, with the possible exception of the left party and the Sweden Democrats,
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:41.040]  who of course is the right-wing populist party, who hardly affected the reality on this point
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:42.920]  should be ashamed.
[3:38:42.920 --> 3:38:47.240]  She says politicians have largely neglected the development in some of our suburbs despite
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:49.600]  the fact that everyone knew it would end in disaster.
[3:38:49.600 --> 3:38:55.720]  And of course, she's now being attacked because she supported that very policy.
[3:38:55.720 --> 3:39:00.400]  Ted Ekeroth tweeted, incredible, Lena Mellon of all journalists, one of the foremost advocates
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:05.000]  for mass immigration and multiculturalism, one of the worst Sweden Democrat haters,
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:08.960]  claims that one has known for years that it would go to hell.
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:15.040]  And of course, the Sweden Democrats are now the most popular party in Sweden.
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:17.360]  We'd hoped that they'd do well in the election.
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:20.600]  They got around, I think, 17.5% of the vote.
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:25.320]  The recent polls show that they are, in fact, the most popular party, unfortunately, that's
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:26.840]  happened right after the election.
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:32.400]  It may be too little, too late for Sweden, given that the authorities in Swedish cities
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:37.680]  like Malmo are responding to this explosion of gang violence, which is mainly migrant
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:44.520]  or migrant gang violence, by in one case, inviting local gang leaders for pizza just
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:45.840]  for a friendly chat.
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:47.800]  I mean, they didn't arrest any of them.
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:49.480]  They didn't prosecute any of them.
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:52.960]  They didn't try to get them to rat out any of their criminal enterprise.
[3:39:52.960 --> 3:39:55.520]  They just had a nice friendly chat over pizza.
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:39:57.480]  That's what they're funding in Sweden.
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:02.960]  They're also funding $175,000 to drag Queen Storytime events where men dressed as women
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:05.240]  read and perform to children.
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:11.160]  Now the money from inheritance, which has got nobody to pass on to when Swedes die, they've
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:14.920]  got no family member to pass on their inheritance.
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:20.600]  The government took that money and is using it to fund drag Queen Storytime as part of
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:23.200]  their new progressive utopia.
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:28.880]  Meanwhile, ISIS leader accused of killing women and children arrived in Europe as a
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:29.880]  refugee.
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:34.800]  This guy was caught in Budapest, Hungary, alleged ISIS leader who is accused of beheading
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:39.680]  an imam and killing women and children was given refugee status after he entered Europe
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:41.480]  as being revealed.
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:46.640]  We've had the articles before where literally the Paris massacre terrorists bragged about
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:51.520]  how they were able to infiltrate jihadists into Europe as part of this migrant wave.
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:57.600]  20-year-old F Hassan joined ISIS in 2014 after deserting the Syrian army.
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:02.000]  He then recruited other jihadists to go door to door and kill dozens of people near the
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.760]  city of Homs in Syria in 2015.
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:09.800]  Those victims included six women and a child who were all knifed or gunned down.
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:15.080]  They then rounded up the other residents in that area and forced them to gather at the
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:20.960]  town's main square where they witnessed Hassan and other militants carry out the brutal beheading
[3:41:20.960 --> 3:41:24.400]  of the local imam.
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:32.040]  And then afterwards he was kindly invited to enter Europe as an asylum-seeking refugee
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:34.280]  before being caught in Hungary.
[3:41:34.280 --> 3:41:39.000]  Mr. Hassan had obtained refugee status in Greece before being apprehended in December
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:43.400]  at Budapest Farage List International Airport where he and a female companion were found
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:45.240]  to have forged personal IDs.
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:51.640]  Again, we had the article which I linked to in this article from back in 2015 where ISIS
[3:41:51.640 --> 3:41:57.200]  in their own manifesto, in their own propaganda bragged about how they had exploited the refugee
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:01.360]  program to send jihadist sleeper cells to Europe since 2012.
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:05.720]  Of course, we had massive attacks in France in the years following that and in other countries
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:11.120]  with the goal of creating Muslim no-go zones in western cities, which again have caused
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:15.760]  huge problems in terms of rape, in terms of violent crime, and can be used as a base
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:17.720]  from which to launch further attacks.
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:22.440]  Now even left-wing Swedes are admitting that that's what happened.
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:27.040]  And this assertion was repeated a year later when an ISIS commander said, quote, we have
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:29.960]  sent many operatives to Europe with the refugees.
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:34.640]  Some of our brothers have fulfilled their mission, but others are still waiting to be
[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:42.200]  activated, this has been going on since 2012, and we've seen the consequences, hashtag refugees
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  welcome.
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:49.640]  We'll be back, summit.news, don't go away.
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:54.120]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:58.800]  those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:00.760]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:05.520]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:10.200]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform that they were really setting the
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:18.600]  precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.560]  on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:29.440]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:35.480]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced, because
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:39.640]  they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're
[3:43:39.640 --> 3:43:44.560]  pushing to succeed, and that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:47.560]  and more vital than ever.
[3:43:47.560 --> 3:43:58.840]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson, what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[3:43:58.840 --> 3:44:01.360]  will take humanity to?
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:02.360]  How far will they go?
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:03.360]  What's their limit?
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:10.160]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:15.560]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:22.360]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist, or that there's
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:26.960]  no free will, there's no devil, or the God, but those very same people have all these
[3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:33.960]  rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:34.960]  can be like.
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:39.280]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[3:44:39.280 --> 3:44:44.840]  Oxford's banned clapping, universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:49.360]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:55.120]  Infowarstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:58.680]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them, I want to thank the listeners
[3:44:58.680 --> 3:45:05.240]  for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with Super
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:09.640]  Blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free, the adult or
[3:45:09.640 --> 3:45:10.640]  the children's.
[3:45:10.640 --> 3:45:15.360]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers, people love it.
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:20.960]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:27.440]  but also re-mineralizes the teeth, then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it
[3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:31.120]  to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis, this is all proven, you can make claims with
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:37.160]  this, but I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria,
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:43.200]  the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[3:45:43.200 --> 3:45:47.400]  So we're really proud of it, it funds the operation, infowarstore.com and that's why
[3:45:47.400 --> 3:45:50.320]  we're still on air, thanks to you.
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:56.840]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:03.480]  had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines, more than 50 to 1 some estimates
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:09.560]  have it, but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, general we're completely
[3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:14.120]  surrounded, he said good, we can attack in all directions.
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:20.120]  Well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic, it really is biblical
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:25.040]  and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support, but it's going to become
[3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:31.800]  more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just Americans
[3:46:31.800 --> 3:46:36.160]  but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:41.960]  of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous
[3:46:41.960 --> 3:46:52.520]  vaccines, because by info wars having its own platform, that check makes the globalist.
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:47:16.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  who has obtained to America with the New York Times and other mainstream left wing publications
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:26.920]  admitting that it is swinging entire elections now in America, they can say that it's a good
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:31.440]  thing, that's perfect fine, if you say it might be a negative thing if you support conservative
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:36.720]  candidates then you're a horrible racist white supremacist, over in Europe we have this story
[3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:42.040]  out of Breitbart, Pew, Europe hosting at least 3.9 million illegal immigrants, that seems
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:46.960]  like a very low number to me, according to Pew somewhere between 3.9 and 4.8 million
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:51.960]  illegal immigrants are residing in Europe, I think we have 1 million alone in the UK,
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:57.520]  so that number seems very low, and then we have this situation, we've got a general election
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:03.080]  coming up in the new UK next month, it's out of political light, holy vote, mosque surge
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:11.240]  voting as Muslims predicted to swing 31 seats across Britain, generally speaking they vote
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:15.680]  for left wing parties, not that the conservative party is right wing in any way anymore, but
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:19.480]  mosques across Britain are taking part in the UK's biggest ever national Muslim voter
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:24.680]  registration day on Friday 22nd of November, encouraging worshipers to get out and vote
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:29.920]  as it's revealed that Muslim voters could swing 31 seats in the general election, this
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:34.480]  is the Muslim Council of Britain, which represents British Muslims claiming that votes by Muslims
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:41.320]  could affect 31 constituencies and swing the result, and this is not just in London from
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:46.200]  reading the list, actually it's in a lot of northern areas and other areas of the UK,
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:52.640]  so once again proving mass immigration is about importing huge voting blocks of people
[3:48:52.640 --> 3:48:58.000]  who typically vote for left wing parties, and that's why the left pushes it at every
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:04.760]  available opportunity, meanwhile in America, land of the free home of the brave, New Hampshire
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:11.320]  town removes Christmas from its Christmas ceremony after two people complain about being offended,
[3:49:11.320 --> 3:49:16.680]  this is the cave culture in evidence once again, because we had Chick-fil-A basically
[3:49:16.680 --> 3:49:23.360]  cave yesterday, now a town in New Hampshire Durham announced it was removing several
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:28.040]  Christmasy elements from its annual holiday celebration, because two people complained
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:34.960]  about being offended, yes, two people, so the town's Christmas ceremony was called the
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:41.320]  annual tree lighting ceremony, that was horrifically offensive, that had to go, so it will undergo
[3:49:41.320 --> 3:49:47.600]  changes in an effort to remove religious overtones, it wasn't even that religious to begin with,
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:53.560]  the event will be renamed Frostfest, while the formal tree lighting ceremony itself will
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:58.440]  be abolished, we can't have that because two people were offended, and Santa will not arrive
[3:49:58.440 --> 3:50:03.520]  in a town fire truck as he has in the past, God knows why that would offend anybody, but
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:08.560]  apparently it does offend two people, Christmas wreaths that were placed on lamp posts on
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:14.280]  Main Street will also be absent, we can't have anyone being triggered by those hateful
[3:50:14.280 --> 3:50:20.520]  Christmas wreaths, according to Councillor Sally Tobias, the changes were made after
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:25.960]  one person said that he had always had a problem with the Christmas tree, Tobias said there
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:30.080]  were a couple of people that did express some concerns about how they felt being included,
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:34.880]  again, two people were offended, so in other words, because two weak-minded idiots complained
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:40.520]  about being offended, the town voted to take Christmas out of its Christmas celebrations
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:46.440]  and doubtedly angering the vast majority of residents who, of course, were not asked about
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:53.000]  any of this, the decision was just made because two people complained, Rabbi Barrel Slovakie
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:57.960]  said to stop cultures and faiths from practicing publicly would be very un-American, I think
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:02.160]  that's the beauty of our country, he was refused when he asked the town to display menorah
[3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:07.800]  during the eight days of panica last year, that's hateful, and it must be abolished so
[3:51:07.800 --> 3:51:14.400]  because two people complained, now Durham, New Hampshire's Christmas celebration basically
[3:51:14.400 --> 3:51:21.280]  no longer includes Christmas, meanwhile in Hong Kong, Polytechnic University protesters
[3:51:21.280 --> 3:51:27.160]  still inside a standoff continues, up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded
[3:51:27.160 --> 3:51:31.160]  inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police as the standoff continues for a
[3:51:31.160 --> 3:51:36.520]  third day, they're basically having to escape through sewers to try and get out, if they're
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:43.040]  adults, I think over the age of 18 they immediately get arrested, disappeared to God knows where,
[3:51:43.040 --> 3:51:47.160]  if they're minors they get sent home, police have revealed that on Monday alone at the
[3:51:47.160 --> 3:51:55.840]  campus they used 1,458 tear gas canisters, 1,391 rubber bullets, this is in a university,
[3:51:55.840 --> 3:52:03.760]  325 bean backgrounds, 265 sponge bullets, again these people are protesting not just
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:09.880]  for their political freedom as Beijing increasingly imposes its authoritarian dictatorship on
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:15.640]  Hong Kong, they're protesting against the smart cities, against the social credit score,
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:22.000]  and what most people don't know is that they're protesting against mass migration, that's
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:26.400]  a narrative that you will not see in the mainstream media when it comes to Hong Kong, because
[3:52:26.400 --> 3:52:31.000]  of course I went there a couple of months ago, talked to a lot of the protesters, and
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:36.920]  they said we have major problems with our culture being subsumed by migrants from China,
[3:52:36.920 --> 3:52:40.720]  from the mainland, because they bring in their culture, they don't assimilate, they don't
[3:52:40.720 --> 3:52:46.680]  integrate, and they immediately get welfare, citizenship and benefits, they don't even
[3:52:46.680 --> 3:52:50.520]  have to go through a process of living there for a certain amount of time, and they've
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:56.440]  got massive problems with Chinese people imposing their culture, which is quite different from
[3:52:56.440 --> 3:53:04.480]  the more westernized culture in Hong Kong, so now literally barricaded inside a university,
[3:53:04.480 --> 3:53:10.280]  we've heard rumors again of Beijing sending in troops, we know they had a big rotation
[3:53:10.280 --> 3:53:15.600]  which wasn't a rotation at all, it was actually to get more troops into the area of Hong Kong,
[3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:20.560]  and the crackdown, the rumor of a potential crackdown continues to grow, we're gonna leave
[3:53:20.560 --> 3:53:25.000]  it there though, we got a big ad for DNA force now, support info wars by getting the specials
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:29.760]  at info wars store.com, war room is coming up, but here's a special message about DNA
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:30.760]  force.
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:35.760]  During the last segment, I was gonna come in and do a plug, and I was gonna cut an ad
[3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:40.960]  out of it to post on the website, and I didn't really direct the crew that I'd want a close
[3:53:40.960 --> 3:53:45.200]  shot when I did that, because we had a wide shot, we'll go to a wide shot right now please,
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:53.840]  and so I thought, you know, I'll just apologize to Savannah Hernandez for being rude to her,
[3:53:53.840 --> 3:53:56.480]  and doing that, because I didn't tell her I was gonna do that, that way, and it's my
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:53:59.840]  fault, so I shouldn't get grumpy, and this is footage of what just happened during the
[3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:00.840]  break, here it is.
[3:54:00.840 --> 3:54:05.080]  Look, I'm telling you man, the stress is getting to Savannah, she's really worried about the
[3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:07.560]  president, she's worried about all the things that are happening, we've got to be cool,
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:13.200]  she's producing all these shows, and I'm telling you, last time I got a little bit, you know,
[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:17.400]  I warned you not to talk back to her, she gets mad, well, anyways, I'm just gonna apologize
[3:54:17.400 --> 3:54:22.960]  to her, there she is, oh no, hi Savannah, I'm stopping me to people, now.
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:33.840]  I have literally been racking my brain, thinking about how do we fund ourselves into the future,
[3:54:33.840 --> 3:54:43.840]  and how do we ensure that we can expand, not just stay the same size in 2020, and really
[3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:47.520]  give the globalists a run for their money like we did last time, and it really hit me
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:53.760]  about two weeks ago, DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10, and so many other things that
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:54:58.080]  are designed to clean out your cells, like nothing else can do, and actually grow more
[3:54:58.080 --> 3:55:02.840]  mitochondria in the cells, the engines that drive them, that make the telomeres last longer,
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:08.960]  so I said, I'm gonna cut new ads about it, I've done that in years, and I went and re-researched
[3:55:08.960 --> 3:55:17.200]  PQQ, CoQ10, and the other ingredients, and I was like, my gosh, I've forgotten how incredible
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:22.320]  the type of CoQ10 we have in major studies has been known to regrow heart tissue that
[3:55:22.320 --> 3:55:29.320]  died, normally an architect doesn't come back, doesn't operate, it's known to CoQ10 to again
[3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:32.640]  make the telomeres last longer, they don't make them grow, it makes them last longer,
[3:55:32.640 --> 3:55:41.560]  which is the same thing, it's a different way, so if you get your CoQ10 and other high-quality
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:48.800]  products from m4store.com, the CoQ10, the PQQ, with the astragalus root and the other
[3:55:48.800 --> 3:55:52.840]  ingredients that supercharge it, it'll find their operation, and it's something you should

[3:56:48.400 --> 3:57:18.240]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:57:18.240 --> 3:57:36.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
