[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:24.880]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the
[00:24.880 --> 00:29.680]  Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Thursday and we have a lot of news
[00:29.680 --> 00:34.400]  Alex Jones is going to be calling us in the next segment he's got a report that he has filed
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.840]  about the arrest of Cliven Bundy of course Cliven Bundy announced last night that he was going to
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.200]  be heading to Oregon there was a live broadcast we're going to have an update on what's going on
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.840]  that situation last four people who were there in that refuge the went out broadcast last night
[00:49.840 --> 00:55.680]  that they were being surrounded by the FBI they also called Franklin Graham he is also on his way
[00:55.680 --> 01:02.480]  I'd presumably they won't arrest Franklin Graham they arrested Cliven Bundy on conspiracy charges
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.840]  and they say that it relates to what happened in Nevada because clearly when you look at the message
[01:07.840 --> 01:13.440]  that went out last night he said it's time for all we the people Americans Patriots militia we need
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.200]  to go and we need to be louder than they are he didn't go with arms he's not calling for violent
[01:19.200 --> 01:23.840]  revolution he's not conspiring to overthrow the government he's exercising just as the others
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.760]  were his first amendment rights we have a right to peacefully assemble we have a right to petition
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.480]  our government for redress of grievances you know that's the right to complain about your
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.000]  government the right to complain to your government a lot of people are very upset because these guys
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.640]  showed up with weapons you know well we have a second amendment that covers that as well
[01:44.640 --> 01:48.480]  you have a right to keep and bear arms they didn't violate the second amendment which
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.880]  protects that there's a state law that doesn't conflict with that either of course we said
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.280]  from the beginning that this is what this is about that they wanted to get the Bundy family
[01:57.280 --> 02:03.680]  as an act of revenge for what happened in Nevada I think it's very clear that you have to do this
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.960]  neighborhood by neighborhood that neighborhood woke up when they saw the excessive use of force when
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.000]  they saw the BLM come in and rope off a little remote area in the middle of the desert and say
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.960]  first amendment area it was outrageous the violence the predation the the the negating of our first
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.840]  amendment rights that angered the community they stood together and helped him to take his cattle
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.920]  back and if they're saying that that was a conspiracy Clive and Bundy clearly said I'm not
[02:31.920 --> 02:38.000]  telling anybody what to do I'm telling you what I'm doing I was there we've got it on tape so
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.760]  that's something where we need to stand together we need to understand what's going on but we need
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.240]  to understand that it has to be done community by community it has to be done in a way that people
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.160]  clearly understand that this is a defensive operation not an offensive operation they went
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.600]  into Oregon they didn't know that the people there the territory they were easily portrayed by the
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.040]  leftist media as being dangerous aggressive yahoos and there were some dangerous aggressive yahoos
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.080]  there we said from the very beginning that there are fed provocateurs that were pushing them to
[03:08.080 --> 03:13.840]  do things that made absolutely no sense from a strategic standpoint from a tactical standpoint
[03:13.840 --> 03:19.680]  when they wanted to go talk to people at a meeting with 400 people they wanted to talk about what could
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.960]  be done in terms of managing the public lands better by doing it at a local level they were
[03:24.960 --> 03:29.280]  going to have a peaceful meeting clearly the community of 400 people were not afraid of
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.520]  these people going to speak to them that's when they arrested the the group that was going there
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.320]  that's when they shot lavoi finicum so alex jones is going to be talking to us about that
[03:38.320 --> 03:44.240]  we also have news about the global financial meltdown continuing we have another day of
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.960]  massive stocks it's not really news anymore we don't cover this on a daily basis every day
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.600]  there's hundreds of points being lost one market or the other is going down several percent
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.800]  it was the asian markets the last couple of days have been plummeting we now have
[03:58.800 --> 04:04.640]  dollar and global stocks are falling evidently because of everybody is saying it's because
[04:04.640 --> 04:08.720]  of jenny ellen's comment yesterday that she made in one of the houses of congress she's
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.400]  speaking again today you know the fed created this economic bubble and the fed is now waving
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.800]  their pen around and scaring the stock markets everybody is fleeing to gold it's a massive
[04:21.680 --> 04:26.320]  move towards gold there's a lot of articles up at the top of drudge report as a matter of fact
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.320]  it is the lead story on the drudge report gold rush as stocks and bonds plunge and then of course
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.880]  there's a very interesting article we'll take a look at from the telegraph say the world can't
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.520]  afford another financial crisis it could destroy capitalism as we know it well capitalism as they
[04:41.520 --> 04:46.880]  define it is crony corruption maybe that wouldn't be a bad thing but of course it will be spawned
[04:46.880 --> 04:57.840]  by the bernie sanders socialists in a very evil way stay with us we'll be right back
[04:58.640 --> 05:06.000]  this is joe bays with info wars dot com anti-beyonce rally plan for next week at nfl headquarters
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.120]  controversy continues to swirl around beyonce's super bowl halftime show performance the pop
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.800]  superstar is being accused of using her performance to attack police officers beyonce and her dance
[05:16.800 --> 05:22.000]  was wearing leather and black berets which was apparently a nod to the black panthers movement
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.680]  one dance formation seemed to acknowledge malcolm x and other dancers had fists in the air which was
[05:27.680 --> 05:34.800]  reminiscent of the black power salutes of the 1960s and 1970s representative peter king of new
[05:34.800 --> 05:40.720]  york told cbs2 that the nfl should have canceled her appearance i found the entire show objectionable
[05:40.720 --> 05:46.080]  despite the criticism beyonce has seen her sheriff supporters for her performance black lives matter
[05:46.080 --> 05:51.120]  activist melena abdulla praised her for being like artists who are willing to raise social

[08:11.280 --> 08:21.440]  it is february 11th 2016 on this worldwide live thursday transmission i am filing reports from
[08:21.440 --> 08:25.920]  the road coming up here in just a few minutes today but night will be hosting live in studio
[08:25.920 --> 08:32.560]  now at the bottom of the hour i'm filing a report on the deteriorating situation out in
[08:32.560 --> 08:39.280]  oregon uh with cliven bundy traveling there to protest for his son's release being arrested
[08:39.280 --> 08:44.880]  in portland last night flying in and armored vehicles the ones they swore wouldn't be used
[08:44.880 --> 08:52.000]  against the american people have now surrounded the federal wildlife refuge and the people inside
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.520]  say that they may finally give up today and of course the feds with total relish will then
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.440]  charge them with a bunch of crimes but allow the president to sign executive orders to basically
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.080]  bring in all the illegal aliens he wants and violate federal law and break every other law
[09:08.080 --> 09:14.000]  you can imagine that's okay when the big banks openly launder hundreds of billions of drug
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.320]  money every year it's okay when the un runs giant sex slavery rings including as young as
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.440]  four-year-old children that's okay the feds aren't doing anything about that uh but you get some
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.960]  people in cowboy hats uh running around protesting all the land grabs that are going on oh my gosh
[09:30.960 --> 09:36.960]  it's the end of the world so i'm going to break that down but here's the deal the so-called federal
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.120]  government is run by foreign banks on record that's what the new world order is all about
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.520]  and they are trying to make if you quote federal lands that if some states are 90 percent of the
[09:47.520 --> 09:53.680]  land like nevada off limits they're blocking people with their four-wheelers they're blocking
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.120]  people trying to fish they're kicking farmers and ranchers off that have used the land before it was
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.520]  even a territory or a state so that's what's going on and under property rights for all the
[10:05.520 --> 10:12.080]  liberal trendies who hate capitalism but love their iPhones when you have grazing rights and you have
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.360]  a loyal title that is the strongest type of right you can have when it's been exercised
[10:17.360 --> 10:24.240]  over generations that's why they have to grandfather uh in people that already owned or used the land
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.200]  before and david not is making a great point just two days ago they call them nail houses
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.680]  in china there's thousands of them we're in the middle of a shopping center or the middle of a
[10:33.680 --> 10:42.160]  government complex or the middle of a road they'll just be a house in 10 acres because after mal took
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.320]  over they couldn't produce any food when they took all the land so they let the public all have
[10:46.320 --> 10:50.880]  about 10 acres and most of the country's produce ended up being produced almost a little 10-acre
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.440]  plots he was copying what lenin did as well soviet union couldn't feed itself in its early days
[10:57.440 --> 11:03.280]  because they collectivized everything and so they began to allow some of their satellites that they
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.480]  controlled like ukraine other areas especially in the time of Stalin to then have their own little
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.280]  small plots of land so i guess capitalism does again feed even the communist bellies but i digress
[11:15.280 --> 11:18.960]  the feds are out of control they're starting fights everywhere they're power grabbing they're
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.920]  groping our generals at the airport and the borders open it's all a big joke okay we know that we've
[11:23.920 --> 11:32.880]  ascertained that but the bigger issue is globalism uses the same tactics around the world to take
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.720]  over a country and when it enters the final phases of a total foreign takeover they will try to start
[11:38.720 --> 11:45.520]  a domestic civil war in a country ahead of really restricting speech and really arresting your
[11:45.520 --> 11:51.520]  political opposition which is professors and writers and scientists and media people but first
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.600]  they want to set the precedent rounding up people that are seen as disreputable just like hitler did
[11:58.480 --> 12:04.240]  with the jews and others that they demonized and so that's why they want to infiltrate and
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.120]  manipulate the patriot media and the patriot militia to have us sound violent to have us sound
[12:11.120 --> 12:18.800]  unhinged so that they can then affect the battle space and try to sell the idea of a war against
[12:18.800 --> 12:25.680]  the american people the good news is it's not going to fly the dog doesn't hunt uh look you know the
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.960]  boat doesn't float congress has a nine percent approval rating they had a gallop poll last month
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.160]  where americans think the government's the most dangerous thing to them in the world and that's
[12:36.160 --> 12:42.400]  true because it's illegitimate it's run by these special interests who are playing god now coming
[12:42.400 --> 12:50.400]  up david night has a guest coming on the broadcast to break down the fact that major city councils
[12:50.400 --> 12:59.760]  across the country and state legislatures are trying to ban the words founding fathers being
[12:59.760 --> 13:07.680]  used at fourth of july or being used in government speech they're saying do not talk about the founders
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.080]  in speeches do not talk about the founders when you're giving a speech do not use it that's just
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.280]  like when they said in seattle ban brown bags they might hurt somebody's feelings and you're like
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.680]  that's ridiculous it's meant to be ridiculous these are thought police and they've already banned
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.800]  protesting radical muslims in europe they have a permanent emergency now in france
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.800]  people say that's crazy they bring in foreigners let them attack and then if you speak out against
[13:36.800 --> 13:43.200]  it you get arrested yes yes that's what they're trying to set up in this country as well and so
[13:44.080 --> 13:47.920]  we have to understand these are true authoritarians
[13:47.920 --> 13:56.240]  that we are dealing with these are these are true oppressors of the people and
[13:57.360 --> 14:03.920]  you work for the federal government i mean give me a break who could deny that it's
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.240]  lawless at the top who could deny it's doing more and more things that aren't the constitution
[14:08.240 --> 14:15.040]  who can deny that it's involved in many policies that persecute the people who can deny that when
[14:15.040 --> 14:23.520]  you go to a national park now imperious arrogant uh rangers will just come over and hand pack you
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.600]  to let you know that they're the boss same thing when you're in dc uh just endless uniformed groups
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.360]  federal state and local getting in your face treating you like you're bad training you that
[14:35.360 --> 14:42.560]  you basically have no dignity or no rights this is all being done by design and then when the police
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.560]  and security services now the word third world country act like goons the globalists are going
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.840]  to come in on the next phase which you're already seeing the preparatory stages of and start a major
[14:53.840 --> 15:00.800]  socialist slash communist style revolt against those departments then the feds will come in
[15:01.520 --> 15:10.080]  as the saviors saying adopt the un truth and reconciliation model of the quote strong cities
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.400]  initiative let us monitor you let us run you this is already happening in america and we
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.480]  won't come after you we won't indict you we won't swat team rage you we won't sue you like they are
[15:22.480 --> 15:29.120]  sure of our pie up and they're investigating people like governor abbot uh and and our attorney general
[15:29.120 --> 15:37.840]  they've indicted there's already a war going on and we need to have people like the governor texas
[15:37.840 --> 15:44.080]  this be able to stand strong with the people behind them openly speaking out against the
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.960]  tyranny that we're seeing because the fact that they're bringing in all this open attack on free
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.920]  speech the the the fact that they're telling us on tv that our kids belong to the government
[15:54.720 --> 16:02.560]  only shows how desperate they are to speed up their revolution of authoritarianism and just
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.960]  make us basically cave in and submit and be so overwhelmed we just give up that's not happening
[16:08.960 --> 16:14.560]  the opposite is happening people are waking up in droves they're realizing what's going on the feds
[16:15.600 --> 16:21.520]  are waking up big time believe me it's amazing the police are awake the military is awake
[16:21.520 --> 16:29.120]  i don't know one special forces operator i don't know one special forces operator and i know a lot
[16:29.120 --> 16:36.320]  of them i know currently serving i know folks navy seals green berets delta force whole nine yards
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.560]  you know people that have just done amazing stuff beyond anything you've ever seen a movie super
[16:40.560 --> 16:47.840]  smart men and they are as awake as i am or more okay so that's got a concern the globalist folks
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.400]  so what do they want to do they want to kick off a civil war they want us to act like a bunch of
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.000]  idiots and a bunch of morons and we can't let that happen but we've also got to realize and i'm
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.600]  going to say this again later because it's so important we can't be maneuvered into a physical
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.480]  fight and i don't want to hear all these guys that go shut up when you know time for talks over
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.480]  it's those guys that never actually do anything have you gotten politically involved have you run
[17:14.480 --> 17:18.720]  for office have you done a radio show have you done videos have you gotten involved have you
[17:18.720 --> 17:23.760]  sued an agency that's out of control have you have you supported good people in government
[17:23.760 --> 17:29.600]  to hold them up as leaders and promote them have you gone out and created community organizations
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.520]  no you haven't but millions and millions of other great patriots in this country and worldwide
[17:37.520 --> 17:43.440]  have and you're the reason we have a very very good shot at stopping this and not letting them
[17:43.440 --> 17:49.360]  start a sorrow style civil war like we've seen in ukraine so i just keep hammering that and hammering
[17:49.360 --> 17:56.080]  that and hammering that it is a tragedy that someone was killed out there mr. levoy but it
[17:56.080 --> 18:01.680]  will be a bigger tragedy if this kicks off in his a larger event well again i'm gonna say it let's
[18:01.680 --> 18:08.400]  not be maneuvered into fighting with each other the info war is now you will never physically fight
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.960]  in the future if you won't fight in the information war today and that's what the globalist are
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.720]  scared of because 99 percent of us stand to lose under this new world order it's treasonous it's
[18:20.720 --> 18:26.960]  illegitimate it's foreign it's breaking all of our laws nakedly in our face it's time to get that
[18:26.960 --> 18:32.240]  message out and have the states come together with the people and with good members of congress to

[18:37.040 --> 18:42.800]  they're invincible they're now in the looting process knowing they may go down and may be defeated
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.880]  and may be set back doesn't mean they'll be completely defeated but they know they're about
[18:46.880 --> 18:50.800]  to be set back in europe and in the united states and other areas that's why they dissolved the
[18:50.800 --> 18:54.960]  borders it's why they're panicking it's why they're trying to bring us into globalism now
[18:54.960 --> 19:02.000]  is because there is such a huge awakening taking place they are desperate people they are desperate
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  so we need to hold our heads high stand up for free speech and promote free speech and go to
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.040]  these city councils and these public schools and let them know that there will be free speech and

[25:57.920 --> 26:03.680]  it for one more day you can find that at info wars life.com there was an article that caught my
[26:03.680 --> 26:11.360]  attention today as i was looking at what's going on in Oregon HSBC has just been sued in texas court
[26:11.360 --> 26:17.440]  for acts of terror yes the london bank hong kong shanghai bank and of course remember they got
[26:17.440 --> 26:24.640]  started about a hundred years ago with the the opium trade out of hong kong shanghai
[26:24.640 --> 26:30.000]  us families us the families of us citizens who are brutally murdered by mexican drug cartels
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.280]  are suing HSBC they're accusing the bank of allowing crime lords to launder billions of
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.120]  dollars and shatter lives in the process this is from rt through Reuters they said the legal
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.560]  complaint says HSBC's material support of mexican drug gangs led to the destruction of multiple
[26:46.560 --> 26:52.880]  lives including those of the plaintiffs and of course we have reported they found HSBC liable
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.280]  for money laundering they gave them a slap on the wrist which was two billion dollars in penalties
[26:57.280 --> 27:05.360]  back in 2012 we've talked to a whistleblower who pointed out that this kind of activity had been
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.480]  flagged before it continued to go on yeah what do we hear we hear about y'all kyda we hear about
[27:10.480 --> 27:16.000]  these guys who are protesting in oregon and again i think that the way they went about it was
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.880]  foolish they should have stuck to their area they should have they had the backing and the
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.240]  understanding of their community where they were known but they didn't break any laws
[27:26.240 --> 27:31.520]  they're being charged with conspiracy that's the favorite thing of the fbi you know when
[27:31.520 --> 27:37.440]  i look at what the fbi what the blm did in nevada cordoning off that area and saying this is a
[27:37.440 --> 27:42.720]  free speech zone that was really an affront it was a visual thing people could get around but you
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.960]  have to understand and look at what the fbi is doing when they arrest these people when they
[27:46.960 --> 27:52.640]  make it into uh uh when they actually kill lavoi finicum now they've arrested uh cliven bundy for
[27:52.640 --> 27:59.040]  flying up there can't we address and redress grievances to our government can't we complain
[27:59.040 --> 28:05.440]  to their face can't we carry weapons openly they didn't violate any state laws and certainly it's
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.240]  supported by the second amendment without getting attacked by the fbi remember the only people who
[28:10.240 --> 28:15.680]  have done violence here have been the fbi there was no violence done these people who were arrested
[28:15.680 --> 28:20.880]  lavoi finicum who was shot they were on their way to a meeting with 400 people to talk about
[28:20.880 --> 28:27.520]  natural resources issues in that area and when we look at the other terrorists we see hsbc laundering
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.360]  money remember el chapo the guy that we heard so much about when he broke out of the prison his
[28:33.360 --> 28:41.040]  he was head of the sinaloa cartel that sinaloa cartel had its own private window at hsbc to
[28:41.040 --> 28:46.960]  launder money so these people are working with the mexican drug gangs are working with international
[28:46.960 --> 28:53.520]  gangs they're working with terrorists to foment violence this is the banks this is the government
[28:53.520 --> 28:58.240]  and the government gives them a pass because they're too big to jail that's what we really
[28:58.240 --> 29:03.040]  need to be concerned about those are the people who are the real terrorists and let me tell you
[29:03.040 --> 29:07.840]  as we look at these stories that are at the top of drudge about the markets that are collapsing now
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.960]  people are stampeding out of the global stock markets concerned about the comments that the
[29:12.960 --> 29:20.560]  uh chair of the federal reserve jenny yellen is saying remember that it was uh ben bernanke who said
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.080]  yeah we caused the depression sorry about that sorry about that we in other words the fed he
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.360]  said it as he was chairman of the fed we won't do that again oh really really uh when we look at
[29:31.360 --> 29:36.480]  this i don't have a lot of confidence that they won't do it again so we're going to be right back
[29:36.480 --> 29:45.280]  with alex jones he has more comments about what is going on in oregon we'll be right back
[29:47.840 --> 29:54.560]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.800 --> 30:04.000]  leftist media labels trump supporters racist sexist zombies after new hamster win vitriolic

[30:34.000 --> 30:39.600]  had previously relegated news stories about him to the entertainment section last month the huffington
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.640]  post took the unprecedented step of adding a note to the bottom of every article about trump
[30:44.640 --> 30:50.480]  which described him as a liar a racist and a xenophobe however not to be outdone the new york
[30:50.480 --> 30:56.080]  daily news reacted to trumps win by portraying the business mogul as a clown you can find more

[33:06.080 --> 33:14.560]  alex jones show alex jones here with a breakdown on the latest developments in origan with the
[33:14.560 --> 33:22.640]  ongoing standoff and the entire land rights situation this is very very important and i
[33:22.640 --> 33:26.560]  know that everything we talk about here on the broadcast is important but this is particularly
[33:26.560 --> 33:36.080]  important because it's got so many different angles to it uh first off there's four people
[33:36.080 --> 33:42.400]  still inside and they're saying that they're negotiating to come out today because the
[33:42.400 --> 33:48.400]  fbi has moved armored vehicles in wraps in surrounding it within about 50 yards and
[33:48.400 --> 33:53.840]  has snipers trained on the building reportedly and so they're now you know realizing that
[33:53.840 --> 34:03.760]  things are escalating that coincides with the patriarch of the bundy clan being arrested
[34:03.760 --> 34:15.600]  the 74 year old rancher uh being being arrested uh flying into origan last night uh now going over
[34:15.600 --> 34:22.880]  the different things uh that clavin had talked about his sons after they were in custody said
[34:22.880 --> 34:28.160]  stand down everybody go home he had put the uh sheriff on notice uh basically ordering him to
[34:28.160 --> 34:36.560]  remove the feds and saying that he was coming out there uh to basically lead a new protest of some
[34:36.560 --> 34:44.560]  type so mr bundy had to know that the feds uh see him as more of a leader than his sons
[34:45.520 --> 34:52.160]  and would obviously be planning to arrest him when he arrived so we must take into consideration
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.320]  the fact that he probably knows that this was going to happen and wants to be a symbol uh a
[34:58.320 --> 35:06.320]  land rights symbol and i guess be in jail with his sons let's be clear we sent out david night and
[35:06.320 --> 35:10.880]  josh owens and covered this for over a week when it happened last year we were right there when the
[35:10.880 --> 35:16.240]  feds were threatening to shoot the people if they crossed the line uh there in southern nevada
[35:16.240 --> 35:22.320]  uh it was historic and that's why harry reed said these people are domestic terrorists we're
[35:22.320 --> 35:28.240]  going to get you we're coming after you from that point on the feds had special psychological
[35:28.240 --> 35:39.760]  warfare operators infiltrating kind of the bundy circle uh and basically maneuvering them
[35:39.760 --> 35:48.720]  from the best research we've been able to put together into this new situation and the 40-day
[35:48.720 --> 35:57.120]  standoff in oregon now let's be clear the feds are out of control they're totally lawless the president
[35:57.120 --> 36:01.200]  ignores whatever laws he wants they ship in plain loads of people every day and don't even check
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.320]  their ids that's mainstream news uh the government has been caught shipping in most of narcotics the
[36:06.320 --> 36:11.680]  big banks launder the money uh they put cancer viruses in the vaccines look we know we have an
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.440]  occupied government we know that it's been taken over by foreign interest we know it's signed foreign
[36:17.440 --> 36:23.760]  secret treaties waving our sovereignty the problem is if you look at the george soros globalist attack
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.120]  plan they don't want us to peacefully politically educate people about this and then take the country
[36:29.120 --> 36:34.560]  back through the states and the federal government and a concon of needed constitutional convention
[36:34.560 --> 36:41.520]  they want it to be a physical confrontation and where they can do it on their terms where they want
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.960]  with people that have martyr complexes and i've studied the situation i've studied the
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.520]  militias in this country and what they do is they go out and they find the militias or they find the
[36:51.520 --> 36:56.000]  type of people that mean well but who can be psychologically manipulated into believing
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.080]  they're going to make a last stand like the alamo and then once they have the people in place they
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.800]  can then have other operatives come in or useful idiots and do things like dress up consumer wrestler
[37:08.800 --> 37:16.880]  outfits or you know when the liberal media would send giant boxes of sex toys they would you know
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.160]  hold them up on tv and say how dare you send these to us just everything they did walked right into a
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.760]  trap and not so much the bundies but the other people there then of course you've got the fact
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.520]  that the Hammond said we don't want you here you know we don't want to have to stand off they were
[37:33.520 --> 37:43.120]  clearly set up over control burn this is giving harry reid everything he wants because you had
[37:43.120 --> 37:50.400]  the iconography the image of what happened last year with people with america flags on horseback
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.360]  not aiming their guns at the feds and the feds aiming their guns at the people and they look
[37:55.360 --> 38:02.960]  like fools it looked like an occupying army being run off by by the local villagers the local peasants
[38:02.960 --> 38:11.360]  and so the symbolism was pure americana pure john wane and absolutely scared the living
[38:11.360 --> 38:18.640]  daylights out of the globalists because they want to make resistance to tyranny whether it be physical
[38:18.640 --> 38:27.360]  or whether it be cultural informational they want to make it look like guys hiding out in camo
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.720]  thinking that the government's going to put chips in their brains they want to make it look paranoid
[38:32.720 --> 38:41.440]  and schizophrenic and nuts and and they want to sell that image to brand any resistance to what's
[38:41.440 --> 38:50.240]  coming uh as farcical as as stupid as silly and that's exactly what then a year plus later
[38:51.920 --> 39:02.400]  the bundies walked into in the case of the bundy ranch since the 1870s they had grazing rights on
[39:02.400 --> 39:10.160]  the property and the feds kept raising the rates until more than 50 families total 30 families
[39:10.160 --> 39:16.480]  right in the area were driven out so this is taxation while representation uh this is the
[39:16.480 --> 39:21.120]  power to tax is the power to destroy just like they turn off our power plants just like they
[39:21.120 --> 39:29.440]  set up tariffs and and other systems uh with environmental regulations their internal tariffs
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.240]  so we can't compete with chinese and indian and mexican factors this is all part of the
[39:34.240 --> 39:41.120]  deindustrialization program and getting us off the land it is agenda 21 it is the un treaty it is
[39:41.120 --> 39:48.000]  the plan that's been used in mexico and berma and and and in countries in africa this is an exact
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.200]  program that has been used to drive the native peoples off their lands and the native americans
[39:55.200 --> 40:01.040]  are pointing out hey this is our land you stole to begin with and now you got a bunch of white
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.480]  people in here fighting over who's it is well that's a good point because if you look at the
[40:06.480 --> 40:11.200]  armored vehicles and the blm arming to the teeth and all these agencies getting armed and all these
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.520]  agencies demonizing the liberty movement they're branding it now we're all over the country people
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.880]  that try to stay in rural areas and be self-sufficient whether you be native american white black
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.800]  whatever you are to where you are basically seen as a terrorist and where you are seen as an enemy
[40:26.800 --> 40:31.360]  and where the sheriff's departments admit we have these armored vehicles for the constitutional movement
[40:32.400 --> 40:37.280]  and then they walk the constitutional movement right into their trap in their place and their time
[40:38.480 --> 40:43.680]  so there is a move to push us off the land there is a move to use drones you know against a family
[40:43.680 --> 40:50.080]  in north dakota who kept having cattle come on their property so they rounded a few of them up
[40:50.080 --> 40:53.840]  and then they called it cattle poaching and sent in homeland security with the drone remember that
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.440]  so there is a move to pick a fight with rural communities there is a move to hire imperious
[40:59.440 --> 41:08.320]  arrogant hateful land land management groups to then basically force locals to choose a side
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.200]  whether you're with the feds who themselves are globalist or whether you're quote with the locals
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.960]  and quote the militia and then half the time the so-called militia itself is led or infiltrated
[41:18.960 --> 41:25.920]  by globalist operatives who then be sure that they can lead the militias internally to make them
[41:26.800 --> 41:33.680]  look stupid sound unreasonable and by the way folks i interviewed state knife the top british
[41:33.680 --> 41:44.720]  commando who was inside the ira actually running it okay in fact i've interviewed four of those
[41:44.720 --> 41:51.200]  commandos two of them died within a month of being on my show look up the interviews from
[41:51.200 --> 41:59.520]  eight nine years ago and it has been declassified that since the 70s the ira the iris republican
[41:59.520 --> 42:09.680]  army to make shen fein and more reasonable groups look radical led the ira carrying out bombings
[42:09.680 --> 42:17.360]  against civilian targets there was a real ira that had guns that would fight the british troops
[42:18.640 --> 42:27.360]  but another ira was formed basically and even the ira didn't know that it was british government run
[42:28.560 --> 42:35.280]  all right and they would break the kneecaps and even kill people under them if they wouldn't
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.600]  carry out bombings or if they wouldn't carry out shootings and this is all come on the british
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.960]  papers okay so that same management system is going on here where they want to lead the militia
[42:44.960 --> 42:51.120]  movement when the globalists do horrible things in america kill farmers kill ranchers take property
[42:52.400 --> 42:55.520]  you name it they want to lead
[42:58.320 --> 43:03.920]  these movements to make them look unreasonable now again what the fed run militias do every
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.360]  time i point this out as they go you showed up you're a fed we're not fed you said we're feds
[43:09.360 --> 43:17.760]  i'm not saying you're feds i'm saying the globalist foundation operatives above the feds are infiltrating
[43:17.760 --> 43:22.720]  and leading groups it's been in the news hundreds of times okay i told you how turner was a fed
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.480]  he was attacking me constantly and then it turned out he was a high level fed national
[43:26.480 --> 43:31.680]  security level fbi they still burned him and put him in prison once hackers got into his information
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.160]  so that's another message to you snitches your bosses will hang you out to drive because you
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.400]  know where the bodies are buried and they want to discredit you down the road so that's key to
[43:40.400 --> 43:47.440]  understand and i'm basically just trying to cover all the points of the compass here we had a big
[43:47.440 --> 43:52.400]  victory in that the feds did the right thing and didn't shoot those folks when they came across the
[43:52.400 --> 43:58.080]  line uh at the whole bundy ranch situation that could have been an absolute new wake up
[43:58.080 --> 44:04.720]  disastrous fiasco and it would have been the shot heard around the world the image of people with
[44:04.720 --> 44:11.360]  american flags on the back of horses being shot off by feds in gun outfits that's what the feds
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.720]  didn't pull trigger that day they want to have the civil war start when they wanted to start
[44:16.720 --> 44:20.960]  so the american people are all fighting with each other while the globalists control us
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.120]  and manipulate both sides just like they've done in ukraine just like they've done in syria
[44:25.120 --> 44:30.160]  just like they've done in northern ireland and ireland itself over and over and over and over
[44:30.160 --> 44:37.600]  and over and over and over and over again so that's what this comes down to and you're facing 21st
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.640]  century warfare here the main reason i'm going over all this as well as a lot of the feds don't
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.000]  even know how this works the stuff i'm getting into here has taken decades of deep research
[44:48.000 --> 44:54.320]  decades of interviewing world experts and decades of going through it myself with these people
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.120]  trying to set us up i was reading about cliven bunding six seven days ago before he traveled to
[45:01.120 --> 45:06.480]  organ and got arrested and the press was trying to call him and his daughter got on the phone and
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.160]  said he doesn't talk to anyone but militia that's the first thing the feds get you to do is stop
[45:12.160 --> 45:19.040]  talking to the media only talk to the militia commander only talk to the militia director of
[45:19.040 --> 45:26.320]  communications you know only talk to your bodyguard and this is how they get in and manage everybody
[45:26.320 --> 45:32.560]  with paranoia and then they know where you're going what you're doing what's being planned
[45:33.200 --> 45:38.000]  it's also possible that the four people left inside one or more may actually be an operative
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.600]  and may be leading the group and one of the standoff to go a little bit longer so they
[45:43.600 --> 45:49.600]  could demonstrate why they need the armored vehicles and the rest of it i'm not saying that but
[45:49.600 --> 45:56.560]  historically that's one of the things that we see happen and take place so this whole thing is a
[45:56.560 --> 46:04.080]  giant trap the whole thing is flypaper the whole thing is set up to make land rights activists
[46:04.080 --> 46:12.800]  look stupid and the bundies mean well but they walked right in to a trap but remember even fox
[46:12.800 --> 46:20.880]  news supported the bundies and people like hannity and others because folks are mad about the land
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.920]  being taken in this country people are concerned about what's happening they're aware of the
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.520]  persecution that's taking place and they're really ready for a fight so see if fox news
[46:31.520 --> 46:36.640]  sits there and attacks land rights groups they know they'll lose their audience so first there has
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.560]  to be an internal takeover of the land rights movement and then an internal demonization campaign
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.520]  in the country so they can then kick off the next phase of incrementally persecuting people
[46:50.080 --> 46:56.160]  that try to go out west or that try to go to rural areas and you left alone that way it's
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.000]  also a new market for the defense contractors for their armored vehicles their drones their
[47:00.000 --> 47:06.080]  surveillance out west and turn that into the new economy because they are planning massive
[47:06.080 --> 47:13.280]  massive persecution the answer for all these militias and people is to put on a suit and time
[47:14.720 --> 47:22.080]  to run for office to become local commissioners and then to have community shooting clubs
[47:23.520 --> 47:29.840]  where you invite out the rotary club and everybody else and then you have marksman contest with you
[47:29.840 --> 47:36.240]  know thousand dollar prizes from the local car dealership or the local gun shop and your mainstream
[47:36.240 --> 47:43.920]  by mainstream you take underground liberty based systems and you then put it out mainstream because
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.320]  that's what americana is and you don't do it hiding in the woods you don't do it being led by the feds
[47:50.320 --> 47:57.440]  you don't do it in paranoia you do it out in the shining sunlight in the open we get legislatures
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.520]  elected we get governors elected we get congress people elected and we point out there has been a
[48:03.520 --> 48:11.680]  literal foreign globalist takeover in this country so i'm very very sad for the bundes
[48:12.880 --> 48:20.000]  this whole thing is just just a disaster it has reversed the victory on making land rights
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.800]  activists look good and strong and pure it has reversed that and and you know caused a problem but
[48:27.840 --> 48:33.520]  overall i think god only one person's died and i obviously wish he wouldn't have been killed
[48:35.520 --> 48:42.720]  mr. levoy but this isn't the time or place for a physical fight we're winning the info war 90%
[48:42.720 --> 48:48.560]  of war is informational we have the moral high ground and we have a right to defend ourselves
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.760]  uh but being maneuvered into occupations and things like that is not a good idea of a lone
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.400]  building when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of acres that people have surface
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.400]  rights to grazing rights to being stolen uh by them raising fines and fees designed to kick
[49:04.400 --> 49:12.000]  us off the land that was the moral high ground still incredibly dangerous so that's the basics
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.320]  i'm going to throw the transmission back to david night and the crew there i'm going to be filing
[49:16.320 --> 49:21.440]  some other reports throughout the day and word willing i'll be back in studio live for the full
[49:21.440 --> 49:27.600]  three four hours tomorrow at 11 a.m central standard time i know david night will have
[49:27.600 --> 49:36.240]  some more points to add to this but uh now two sons and the father are in jail uh there in oregon
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.280]  and are facing different conspiracy charges to impede federal officers and the rest of it and
[49:41.280 --> 49:46.560]  again the feds are illegitimate uh but the general public doesn't understand that they've been occupied
[49:46.560 --> 49:52.000]  and taken over they don't understand that it's completely lawless and at the same time the average
[49:52.960 --> 49:58.240]  federal person themselves is not our enemy and is compartmentalized as well and if you
[49:58.240 --> 50:05.440]  won't fight now in the information ward you'll never fight physically in a physical war because
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.560]  if we can do a physical war it means we've lost the info war and it means that the globalists
[50:10.560 --> 50:18.160]  are getting what they want i sincerely pray for peace i do prepare for war and by that information
[50:18.160 --> 50:25.040]  war to try to affect the future battle space so that people know who the sides are that is the
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.160]  most important point folks need to know who the different sides of this situation are they need
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.160]  to understand the globalists have taken over they're trying to play us off against each other
[50:34.160 --> 50:39.840]  because it's the only way they can win understand that and they've got us like little toy soldiers
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.200]  like little boys lined up now to basically fight with each other and kill each other and it's so

[54:21.840 --> 54:27.040]  fiori they are trying to negotiate this out peacefully trying to get these last four people out
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.960]  without being killed but of course as clavin bundy goes in the fbi immediately arrests him as he
[54:32.960 --> 54:38.480]  gets off the plane almost looks like they don't want to resolve this peacefully it looks like
[54:38.480 --> 54:45.440]  they want to uh fuel the fear and paranoia of the people who remain in the reserve so we'll
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.000]  see what happens we're going to uh as i said talk to joe biggs he's been monitoring this

[55:01.360 --> 55:08.240]  it is jumped 3.6 percent today it's on track for his biggest daily rise since december 1st
[55:08.240 --> 55:16.800]  2014 and of course at the same time and because of that uh the tumbling global stocks as well as
[55:16.800 --> 55:22.240]  the falling dollar the dollar hit a 16 month low against the yen on thursday investors were spooked
[55:22.240 --> 55:28.560]  by what janet yellen told congress and of course uh she's panicking the markets talking about
[55:28.560 --> 55:34.320]  interest rates at sweden has cut interest rates deeper into negative territory this is the central
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.520]  bank of sweden has now lowered its key interest rate even further below zero said it is prepared to
[55:39.520 --> 55:45.920]  use its full toolbox of measures that would be all the kanesian tricks which have not really worked
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.880]  so far uh they're going to keep doing the same thing over and over again isn't that definition
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.160]  of insanity here uh swedish policymakers have unleashed unprecedented stimulus over the past
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.400]  year to save the economy from deflation and keep the krona from appreciating so with all of this
[56:02.400 --> 56:10.320]  happening we have other people who are looking at this and saying this could be the uh the end of
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.760]  capitalism as we know it with another financial crash that's the daily telegraph they're looking
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.560]  at it and saying we are too fragile fiscally as well as psychologically that's what the
[56:20.560 --> 56:26.720]  uk telegraph says is another collapse accompanied by a fresh banking bailout by the taxpayers
[56:26.720 --> 56:33.040]  would trigger a cataclysmic uncontrollable backlash look let's understand that if we're
[56:33.040 --> 56:40.160]  going to have another bailout this is not capitalism folks this is just corporate corruption
[56:40.160 --> 56:45.280]  of our government if you get bailed out like that that that is not capitalism capitalism
[56:45.280 --> 56:51.520]  has not failed capitalism has not been tried and let me say something to all the socialists out there
[56:51.520 --> 56:57.600]  all the crony socialists okay let me give you an example of crony socialism right out of the new
[56:57.600 --> 57:03.040]  hampshire election we talked about this multiple times bernie sanders got the same number of delegates
[57:03.040 --> 57:09.360]  as hillary clinton right he got about 150 000 votes he got 15 delegates so that's 10 000 voters
[57:09.360 --> 57:17.280]  get him one delegate hillary clinton on the other hand has a one party aparachic that can do whatever
[57:17.280 --> 57:24.320]  she wants so one of the socialist party aparachics equals 10 000 voters how's that for socialism how's
[57:24.320 --> 57:29.440]  that for crony socialism you know some socialists are more equal than other socialists maybe you need
[57:29.440 --> 57:35.120]  to put down your uh catcher in the rye and start looking at the animal farm now while all this
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.600]  economic collapse is happening around us as people are saying this is the end of capitalism
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.720]  and it may be a rough ride this year the stock market financial markets have been going down

[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.600]  joe biggs is going to be joining us in the next segment with an update on what's going on the
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.240]  organ standoff there have been some new developments there of course as we've been talking about this
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:30.000]  last hour cliven bundy flew in we've had franklin graham fly in a state legislator from nevada
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.280]  michelle fiori flew in they're all trying to negotiate that down without getting anybody killed
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.720]  they arrested cliven bundy so we're going to get an update from joe biggs who's been following that
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.600]  broadcast live there's a broadcast coming out of the refuge from that area he's going to update us
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.360]  in the next segment real quickly at the top of the drudge report now we have a new article that
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.400]  came out of the washington post this came out in the last hour talking about the clinton
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.800]  foundation getting a subpoena from state department investigators they say investigators the state
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.240]  department issued a subpoena to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation last fall seeking
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.880]  documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from the federal government
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.080]  during hillary clinton's term as secretary of state this is from somebody who's familiar with
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:24.560]  the subpoena now the interesting thing about it too is huma abedin her very close personal assistant
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.280]  we'll just leave it at that long time aid as it's put by washington post who for six months in 2012
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  was employed simultaneously get this employed simultaneously by the state department the
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.120]  clinton foundation the clinton's personal office and a private consulting firm with ties to the
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.040]  clinton's i mean she's not double dipping she's not triple dipping she's quadruple dipping huma
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.480]  must be rich you know it's pretty amazing of course her husband remember husband was weiner
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.520]  in new york and of course she also has family ties to the muslim brotherhood this very interesting
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.760]  character huma now they say a foundation representative who spoke on condition of anonymity
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.960]  to discuss discussing ongoing inquiry said the initial document request has been narrowed by
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.000]  investigators the foundation's not the focus of the pro and they say there's no indication that
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.280]  the watchdog is looking at clinton and huma abedin has declined comment yeah i guess nobody is really
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.040]  being investigated by the subpoena it's like they're not looking at anybody they just wanted to get
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.200]  some information i guess to uh to look at because they had nothing better to do even though this is
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.800]  an inspector general who is looking at this now in the amount of time that we've got left i started
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.560]  talking about this in the previous segment this article from the telegraph and i there was just
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:50.240]  so much in this when i looked at it when they talk about uh the fact that this could destroy
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:57.600]  capitalism as we know it let's understand that capitalism as we know it has to be redefined
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.320]  when we talk about uh free trade as they mentioned here they say this could threaten the very
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.560]  survival of free free trade of globalization of the market-based economy let's understand that free
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:15.840]  trade as it's being sold to us is not free trade a 5000 page document called the trans-pacific
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.760]  partnership is not free trade that's managed trade and it's even worse because that document was
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.520]  written by corporate lawyers secretly lobbyists okay wasn't written by our legislators it's not
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:33.040]  going to go through the approval process for a treaty and it's going to turn over the management
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.960]  of our economy because that's what we're talking about here we're not talking about something
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:42.240]  trade no it's managing our economy who's going to get to sell what to who at what prices
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.760]  it's going to turn all of that management over to a foreign international commission
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:54.640]  that we do not control okay so let's not talk about free trade let's not say that free trade
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.120]  has failed let's not say that free markets have failed when you prop up these crony capitalist
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.480]  banks when they pump and dump the real estate market that's not capitalism as i know it that's
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:13.280]  not any definition of capitalism it's certainly not the free market okay and globalization is not
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.920]  capitalist capitalism either okay let's understand that globalization is a move to establish a
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.960]  global governance first by economic unity then by political unity when they create economic crisis
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.520]  let's understand what's behind all of this we have to understand that when they talk about
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:38.320]  it's going to destroy people's faith in the elites it's like yeah i hope so it's about time we wake up
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.440]  understand what's behind this understand that when they talk about free markets when they talk about
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:49.520]  free trade that's nonsense what we need is real freedom we need real liberty we need free markets
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.120]  stay with us we'll be right back for an update on the organ standoff with joe bigs
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.200]  top story on dredge report this morning gold surges to one year high on fears of financial

[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.920]  december 1st 2014 the rise in gold is being triggered by financial instability fears that are
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.120]  fueled by european bank shares slumping to multi-year lows with concerns mounting over banks profitability
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.760]  and a low growth low interest rate environment analyst matthew turner said investors are concerned
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.080]  that central bank's solution is negative interest rates are at least not rising rates and that is
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.360]  gold friendly james butterfill added investors are returning to gold as a core diversifier and

[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:29.440]  right through america change it's going to be a week to a month a year sessions in in in legislation through the state through washington dc but you have to have your voices heard in committees you have to hear your story okay okay so tomorrow when
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.200]  okay so when you get here tomorrow frankly graham we'll turn ourselves in okay so that's what they were saying last night
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.600]  there's a concession there's a concession
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.280]  okay let's let's hold it at that point because it's kind of hard to hear that audio
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.000]  uh and again that's they're putting the audio up on the internet it was a live broadcast captured from
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.520]  phones and uh she is that's the nabata state legislator michelle fiori who is trying to talk
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.480]  some sense into them and and they and she was able to get them to say all right you get here
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.720]  franklin graham gets here and we will turn ourselves in in the morning yes okay so that's
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.240]  what happened so they got into portland late last night it was about a six hour actually a
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.840]  little bit more than that because the snowy conditions uh mountainous terrain which you saw
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.000]  when we went last time uh they didn't get until uh i would say about 9 30 this morning i think it was
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.760]  yeah so i went i began to listen 9 30 our time central yeah and uh they arrived uh she was there
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.480]  with her group of people they got to the uh that fbi compound that i got footage of that set that
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.080]  private airport in burns and uh they met uh franklin graham there and then from there they went
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.480]  inside spoke i think for about 10 minutes they cut the phone conversation off with the occupiers
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.480]  inside there and then uh they had a conversation they loaded up in the vehicles and they began
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.840]  the travel it's about 40 minutes to the refuge now at this point in time she's keeping her cell phone
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.880]  back on this is um michelle fior continuing to talk with gavin sime and the four remaining people
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.600]  and uh they're talking about all right when you guys get here we're going to turn ourselves in
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.000]  our guns have already been locked in the vehicles we do not have any personal guns on us we will come
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.840]  out with our hands up uh one of the guys said he was going to hold an american flag which he did
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:26.640]  i listen as it happened and uh at this point in time three of them are left michelle fior got there
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.840]  franklin graham showed up the fbi brought in a separate vehicle they pushed forward and three
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.160]  came out now david fry is still there he's the guy that has the stand your base guard your base
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.600]  youtube channel that had been uh that had been live streaming for you know since amon bundy
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.920]  and uh clive uh amon bundy and ryan and all these guys were taken and put in the fbi custody so this
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:56.800]  guy is saying that i never agreed to this uh negotiation this uh turning myself in the other
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.440]  three said they that that's something that they wanted to do i have no part of this they said
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.720]  basically he said that he was born a free man and he will die a free man and one of the things he
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.360]  said i think i'm looking at the time clock right now it's about 42 minutes ago he was talking to
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:18.080]  chris an hall on the uh show with gavin and he said i feel suicidal he says i'm gonna stand my ground
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.560]  and she kept saying hey you know don't don't do this everyone else has turned themselves in let's
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.760]  do this let's be peaceful he said no i'm making my stand i'm not going anywhere this is my time
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.160]  this is my stand and at this point in time this is where they're at he's still there inside the
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.880]  campground little area they have like a little tent set up and he's refusing to leave at this point
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.320]  in time what do you know about david fry and you see somebody that came in at the uh later and i know
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.400]  he was the one who was broadcasting as we were there after they had arrested uh the leaders
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.000]  amon bundy ryan bundy lavoi finnecombe was shot uh david fry was the one who was the most vocal at
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.400]  that point in time what do you know about david fry he's from sincenady ohio i believe if i'm
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.360]  not mistaken he's from that area he uh knew the other uh journalist was out there as well
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.840]  uh those two had worked together i believe before and uh so that's what's going on with
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:15.920]  this guy he he doesn't seem to to really want to have this in peacefully he thinks the only way
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:22.880]  is for him to go out and ablaze a glory or to sit there and remain and eventually run out of food
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.640]  and then leave i don't know at this point in time but we need to understand you know when you have a
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.400]  situation like this you're going to have some people who are mentally unstable who will want
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.960]  to attach themselves to a larger movement you're going to have some federal provocateurs who'll
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.400]  come in and try to provoke things and you're going to have some other people who really have and
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.680]  there are legitimate complaints here there's no doubt about what happened to the ham and family
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:50.240]  is an abomination and the judge who presided over their trial initially said that it defended his
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.680]  offended his conscience to send them to jail for the mandatory minimum of five years they were
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.600]  tried and convicted as arsonists as terrorists there was absolutely no way the ham and ranchers
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.520]  were terrorists they had burned a small amount of land as a backfire uh they got a little bit out of
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.120]  control burned 139 acres on a federal land to give you an idea how small that is there were over
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.560]  three and a half million acres that burned that year on federal lands okay because they're not
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:25.520]  managing the lands very well we talked to uh a uh logger in john day talking about how they'd had
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.000]  the largest fire there this last summer that they've had and it was because they leave the dead wood
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.240]  on the ground they don't feel they're so determined that nobody is going to use the land that they
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.120]  will let the forest burn down so they can burn down the economy and get these people out there
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.720]  the only thing companies get closed down too because they're not allowed to go out and do that work
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.120]  exactly take that stuff out we showed all the the uh logging um all the uh lumber mills that had
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.360]  had shut down and uh they're putting everyone out of business the only thing that's being built in
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.440]  that area are federal stations and you know it was interesting joe when i came in this morning
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.640]  i was listening to the radio they had uh npr talking about an i max documentary somebody
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.520]  had done to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the national park system and the guy was saying
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.640]  yeah you know well i'm kind of conflicted about this because we really don't want to promote the
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.720]  national parks too much because people might go there and stress the parks out i mean that's how
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.080]  how they are they don't even want you to go to the parks they brag when we go to yellowstone they
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.400]  say less than one percent of the area is open to the public but they don't even want you on that
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.640]  one percent so they're kind of conflicted well should we talk about the national parks or should
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.080]  we just be silent about it keep it a secret because people might actually go there and when
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.200]  you go to the parks when i go to yellowstone when i go to big ben like i did last week everything
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.920]  that they're talking about is how this is so special and the biggest enemy the biggest predator
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.320]  the biggest problem in the park is man and that's what they have in the exhibit it was funny
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.360]  that when we drove from uh was an Ontario organ out to burns i don't know if you remember me pointing
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.440]  this out there was a national park court called your land it was closed so my lane was closed i
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.360]  didn't even know about it so i didn't even have access to my land oh they want to lock everything
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:14.400]  down i mean they they had a protest out in utah because some local county commissioners were upset
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.440]  about the fact that they were closing down what had been access roads for atvs through the park
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.960]  this is what the people who are in the cities and in the suburbs need to understand these people who
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.440]  are ranchers these people who are miners they have surface rights they have water rights they
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.720]  have mineral rights these are property rights just like your home is and they produce things
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.920]  that you want things like meat people forget about that deal and what's that people forget about
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.240]  yeah or they get water their their their furniture comes from all that that's right when these ranchers
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:50.240]  are affected you at home are affected in the city and they want to take that land away make it private
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.600]  push you into a city it's a 21 park park put you in a driver's car so they can monitor everything
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.520]  you do when you're not paying your taxes when you're not paying your child support lock that car
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.800]  down notify authorities what's going on that is the plan and they're using this situation and burns
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:10.320]  organ right now this is a federal psi op that they are using yes to demonize the quote-unquote
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.360]  patriot movement the liberty movement from these militiamen who are actually trying to make a stand
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.800]  for something that is worthy of taking a stand for what cliven bunny did back in nevada what
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.720]  amon bunnies weren't intentions were like we said we agreed with his intentions but the time and
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:32.160]  place was wrong yeah with this entire thing how it unfolded but they're using this to demonize it
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.920]  they're going all right we got these last four guys they're kind of crazy and they're blasting
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.200]  this stuff all over the place and they've got them contained in that area but look at what they're
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.440]  doing to the local ranchers when they're letting this continue to go on how they did as long as
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.280]  they did to continue to demonize it we've talked to a couple of ranchers they said they got a patchy
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:53.120]  helicopters flying over our ranches that's the kind of martial law intimidation that we see every
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.640]  time anything happens the government is itching for that we cannot give them the excuse stay with us

[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:22.640]  orders of $50 or more now joes we're looking at this there was and this is all coming out of the
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:31.200]  Oregon situation there is a sarcastic Facebook page has been put up called the public lands hunt
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:37.040]  club this is reported on the new american encouraging people to go out and shoot cattle
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.640]  on public lands if the people haven't paid their grazing fees okay and as the new american points
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.920]  out intentionally shooting somebody else's livestock is a crime it's actually felony okay and they say
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:53.040]  doing it to make a political statement and to intimidate the owners might be considered to be
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:57.600]  terrorism okay but of course we're not going to see the FBI go out there and arrest these people
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.640]  okay we will see them don't they go and shoot cattle that's right they did shoot they did at
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.920]  the Bundy ranch exactly exactly they did they shot the prize bull that's a lot of that's a
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.640]  lot of value there in a prize bull as well as several other animals that were out there
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:19.520]  but this to me highlights a key issue and that is the government has been more successful
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.640]  at pitting the left versus the right many people on the right hate the occupy movement they
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.400]  correctly point out these guys damaged private property okay fine but there's other ways to
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.360]  handle this other than some of the police brutality that we saw there's other ways to handle it
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:42.560]  other than the FBI putting out a hit list for occupy leaders with FBI snipers as we saw released
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.160]  it was a document that was leaked out about this happening in houston i don't want to see the
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.240]  government using those kinds of tactics and techniques to shut down protests i think the
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.320]  occupiers many of them have been captured by a lot of kind of more from a socialist standpoint
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.160]  but both the occupiers and the tea party were concerned about this kind of corruption that
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:12.560]  we saw in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse the pump and dump that the banks did they had
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.520]  legitimate concerns and just because they were coming from the left just because they did some
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.200]  damage in some areas is no reason to start plotting to execute them there's also no reason for the
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:30.640]  left to call for the execution of people at the Bundy standoff to be excited about the fact that
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.520]  Levoie Finnegan was killed and i'm seeing plenty of that and it makes me disgusted to see people on
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.560]  the left and on the right who hate each other so much that they're calling for the government to
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:46.000]  act like terrorists to murder their own citizens to shut down free speech to shut down the right
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.080]  to petition your government to talk about your grievances with the government and that was what
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.960]  was happening they were on their way to a meeting of 400 people and they were going to talk about
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:02.320]  the land use issues there they were not the people there were not afraid of them as the media in
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.760]  Oregon like to portray this we need to be able to have that kind of discussion this is very dangerous
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.000]  when the government acts in this egregious way to shut down the free exercise of speech to shut
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.040]  down and demonize people because they happen to be carrying firearms not threatening people with
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.520]  them just carrying them as a threat i mean when black lives matter had their issues with things
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.720]  if anyone disagreed with it they were completely demonized called races yeah called bigots yeah
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:34.640]  and we had to apologize and we had to come out and bow down before it but when you have this group
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:40.800]  go out and make a stand a good stand for something that's legitimate that will affect us all down
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.680]  the road yeah completely demonized shut down and ridicule and make sure that nobody sees the
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:51.040]  underlying issues behind this thank you very much joe biggs will be right back the empires on the run
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.960]  socialist presidential candidate bernie sanders is having breakfast in harlem this morning with
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:11.760]  former coke dealer and fbi informant reverend al sharpden sanders is hoping for an endorsement
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:17.520]  from sharpden and hopes that it will boost his reputation among young black voters who according
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.960]  to recent poll numbers overwhelmingly support hillary clinton this morning's meeting with
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:29.200]  reverend al is at sylvia's restaurant the very same place that barack obama sat down with a preacher
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:36.560]  in 2008 and they've since become very close friends in fact al sharpden has somehow managed to get
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.800]  away with owing four million dollars in back taxes to the irs perhaps because of his cozy
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:49.920]  relationship with the president so how ironic is this bernie sanders a guy who wants to raise
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:56.080]  taxes is having breakfast with a guy who doesn't pay them and you can learn more right now at

[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.600]  a clip that was recorded by emin bundy from jail it was put up last uh it was recorded last saturday
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:48.000]  put up on monday and i want you to hear what he has to say about free speech and civil disobedience
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:56.400]  emin bundy february 6 2016 this is a call to action for any elected representative in
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:05.040]  idaho nevada origan wyoming utah arizona the state of washington and whole ohio you have constituents
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:11.520]  in federal custody please visit and contact them to voice your support for free speech the right
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.680]  to assemble and civil disobedience it is your duty to hold federal agencies at bay protecting
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:24.880]  the people in your state and to those who disagree with my speech or our civil disobedience and may
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:31.600]  dislike our ideas regarding that the land belongs to the people please remember that you do not want
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:37.920]  free speech to be retaliated against by government officials if you do not advocate for government
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:45.040]  to tolerate ideas that it hates then the first amendment and free speech mean nothing arm yourself
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:53.920]  with ideas arm yourselves with education argue and disagree be free thank you that's what you
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.880]  need to understand you need to understand whether or not you agree with them and i'm saying this to
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.640]  the people that are pouring out hatred on social media begging the government to execute people
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.720]  i gotta say to you that is you have to understand just how dangerous that is and how that will come
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.040]  back and reflect on you we talked about what happened to the occupiers as well and i'm saying this to
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.880]  the people on the right as well you have to understand that when you disagree with somebody
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:25.200]  don't call for the government to suspend the constitution to trash the first amendment to
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:31.280]  execute the protesters okay don't call for that it's going to come back on you remember what
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:38.480]  john f kennedy said he said when we make peaceful revolution impossible we make violent revolution
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:45.520]  inevitable we cannot destroy our cherished freedoms because we disagree with somebody
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:51.920]  we cannot allow the rule of law to be taken away by executive order regardless of what you think
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.680]  about these issues for those people who support barack obama's efforts to enact for example gun
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.720]  control or these other aspects of his agenda by executive order understand that someday
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.720]  if you allow this if you create a seizure a dictator to run this country you're going to
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.960]  have somebody that has very different ideas from you become a seizure become a dictator
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:21.520]  you do not want to cross the rubicon okay you do not want to live in a country where we destroy the
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:26.720]  rule of law where we destroy our free speech protections where we destroy the constitution
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.560]  let me give you an example as to because one of the things is very troubling as we were out there
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:39.680]  was to see how the government uses every excuse to create martial law setting up these checkpoints
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:45.680]  and not just having checkpoints but pointing guns at ranchers who are there i played the
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.000]  we've had the report take a look at the report that i had of the rancher who said he's been in
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.040]  third world banana republics he's been concerned about his safety when he went through those
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.200]  checkpoints in those third world countries but even there he never had anybody point a gun in
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:08.480]  his face and threaten him like they did in his own neighborhood going to his own home we can't
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.040]  allow this we've seen this happen in the wake of the boston bombing one guy is at large so they
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.720]  start pulling people out of their houses at gunpoint they're doing the same thing out there
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:22.640]  they've got a patchy helicopters flying over these people's ranches it's absolutely insane the
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:28.560]  government is looking for every excuse to create martial law that's why they have prepositioned
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.680]  these m reps and these other things but now they bring them in uh to a small area like this you've
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.880]  got a a refuge where nobody has done anything committed any violence they're in a refuge in
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.960]  the middle of winter where people go to watch birds okay it's the middle of winter there's
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.840]  nobody there they weren't doing any damage to anything they were protesting they happen to
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.960]  have guns which is protected by the constitution and protected by oregon law they didn't threaten
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:57.200]  anybody people were not concerned about them not afraid of them they were going to meet and speak
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.560]  to 400 people on a public meeting so the government finds it necessary to use over the top violence
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.880]  and kill someone who had his hands up and we can uh many people say well he's reaching for a gun
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.760]  that is not clear from that video if they wanted to make that clear believe me they've got more
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.760]  video than just an overhead aerial drone uh with no sound they could make it clear if they really
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.320]  wanted to that they felt that they were threatened but let's look at some of the other aspects of
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.120]  this think about what it's going to be like to live in a minority report style society there's
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.720]  an interesting art project that was done by a dutch photographer ester hovers uh this was first
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:41.120]  reported by wired magazine she has installed uh can't there's cameras that uh been installed in
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.800]  various u.s cities okay boston chicago washington dc of the atlanta transit system she wanted to
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.800]  make the point of when they do this minority report investigation having uh individuals looking
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.920]  and tagging suspicious activity yeah let's uh you know see something say something and call the
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:03.200]  swat team okay this is something that has been reported before but in her particular case what
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.840]  she did we just took some video and she gave it to uh people to analyze in the uh crime detection
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.120]  they pointed out people who are loitering too long or people who are moving too fast or people
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.320]  who are standing so if you stand too long if you stand on a corner if you move faster than they think
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.800]  maybe you're looking over your shoulder maybe you're going against the flow of foot traffic or
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.000]  you're banding something or there's a cluster of people that suddenly break apart okay all
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.560]  these things in other words is there anything that you that you can't do that doesn't look
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.760]  suspicious to these people that's the bottom line i remember seeing a project about this a couple
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:46.320]  of years ago uh they had some ai intelligence that was trying to flag this minority report style
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.040]  they had a guy who walks up to his car he stops he pauses he looks at it for a second and then he
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:57.120]  bends down and disappears and you don't see him for a while um suspicious notify the police send
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:03.680]  the swat team well what was was he had a flat tire and he was bent down and he was working on his
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.120]  tire but of course we could call the swat team and they could show up and uh get all excited and
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.000]  barney fife mode start yelling and screaming at the guy he panics he gets up he's got a tire
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  iron iron in his hand and they shoot him right that's not that preposterous we've seen young men
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.240]  who have a BB gun and they're just playing uh like uh the the kid in uh christmas story red
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:34.000]  rider right black kid in a park and the police show up and shoot him dead that's 21st century america
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.040]  very different from 1950 america when uh they did that with the red rider BB gun do we really want
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  to live in that kind of society we are allowing them to create a paranoid nightmare society for
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.080]  this and we cannot allow this to happen this project makes a good example of that let me give
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:59.920]  you another example and this is something out of the presidential campaign when we talk about
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.800]  waterboarding okay and this is something that this involves donald trump but all the republicans
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.280]  are doing this unfortunately we don't have a choice they're all trying to be tougher than the next
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:19.440]  guy when it comes to terrorism okay so donald trump says oh i would go way beyond waterboarding
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:25.200]  when he's asked okay and of course his son comes out and says look uh he told a gretta van susten
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.560]  on fox news he said listen uh you see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings right
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.960]  you see our cities getting shut up in california you see paris getting shut up then somebody
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.240]  complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded which quite frankly is no different than what
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:49.280]  happens on college campuses and frat houses every day it's like what what waterboarding is no different
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:56.960]  than what happens in a college frat house i don't think so it's not a keg party and before
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.240]  i get into what waterboarding really is because the new american did a great story talking about
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.840]  what waterboarding really is we need to understand just like this minority report what are we doing
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.200]  to our country what are we allowing them to do to us in the name of fighting terrorism
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.040]  you have to be careful whenever you fight a war and we're supposedly in a war against a tactic
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.440]  you have to be careful when you fight a war that you don't become what you fight our government
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.040]  is becoming the terrorists our government is using the tactic of terrorism against us fear
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  intimidation and violence to achieve a political means you cannot become that you cannot allow
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.200]  them to become the terrorists but let me just say this too he says somebody complains when a
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:47.360]  terrorist gets waterboarded who defines what a terrorist is do you have due process are they
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.160]  going to bring charges to you are you going to have a day in court before they label you a terrorist
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.680]  i don't have a problem with a terrorist being punished but i have a problem and of course
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.240]  fox news is a place where this happens the most just label somebody a terrorist and that gives
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.360]  you carte blanche to do anything you want to to that person who has been labeled a terrorist
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.840]  they label the people of the bundy ranch terrorists they were not terrorists harry reid
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.240]  said they were they were not terrorists they were protesters there were people who had been oppressed
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.480]  by their government a government that had used excessive force against them they took back their
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:30.160]  property they were not terrorists now let me tell you what terrorism is waterboarding is terrorism
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.600]  let me give an example of this this is from the new american many regard waterboarding as a form
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.320]  of water torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.840]  passages of a restrained captive it causes the individual being waterboarded to experience
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.000]  a sensation he's being drowned and in fact that is what is happening if not halted in time the
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.960]  subject will die by drowning and this has happened former cia officer bob bear contends that it
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:06.960]  often extracts worthless confessions we know this stop watching jack bauer on 24 listen to the people
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.000]  who know what they're talking about the people in the cia and the military tells you torture
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.320]  doesn't work this is what he says he says i mean you can't get anyone to confess anything you can
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.640]  get anyone to confess anything if the torture is bad enough writing in another publication national
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.080]  interest remi uh moduit recounted his personal experience here somebody who suffered it his
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:35.680]  personal experience at having been in waterboarded he said waterboarding is often described as
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.400]  simulated drowning or a technique to convince the interrogated that he or she is drowning
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:47.360]  there is no way to simulate the lungs filling with fluid and the victim does not need to be
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.680]  convinced physiologically they are in the process of drowning he went on to explain
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.280]  waterboarding is difficult to understand without firsthand experience yeah eric it's not like
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.560]  your frat parties okay i know you probably had this big tube of booze of beer and you stuck it
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.200]  in your mouth and you thought you were drowning okay it's not like that all right not like that at
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.760]  all let me tell you what it's like he says the tortured person he said this is somebody who
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.000]  actually has done it eric says that this near drowning will happen repeatedly and will eventually
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.080]  culminate with that promised slow and agonizing death you're constantly being reminded by this
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:34.800]  by your tortures not by your enhanced interrogators that's some more cia pentagon double speak this
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:40.640]  is torture folks he says in spite of my frenzied fight to survive i prayed so many times for death
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:51.280]  and deliverance from pain he says you talk a lot you say anything absolutely anything to get the
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:58.560]  torture to stop he says you throw up a lot you talk you scream like a demented person
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:05.120]  whenever you can and then you throw up again this is what our government does this is what they call
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.200]  enhanced interrogation when they shoot up weddings when they execute innocent people in the middle
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:17.200]  east with their drone strikes that's called a disposition matrix they have wonderful phrases
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.280]  for or collateral damage you know we have these nice phrases just call it what it is it's murder
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:30.240]  it's torture it's like something out of the middle ages and at the same time we've got our laws
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:36.400]  being shut down to establish star chamber procedures where you were accused of being a terrorist
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.600]  you're put on a terrorist watch list you're put on a no fly watch list okay you put on all kinds
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.680]  of lists you don't even know you're on the list because this is a secret procedure you're not
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:54.880]  given the rights that we fought for in western civilization a thousand years ago the right to
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:02.400]  know and face your accusers to answer your charges to be publicly charged to have due process
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:10.960]  that is guaranteed in the constitution and when we have a government that swears allegiance to
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:19.200]  the constitution as terms of having its off their office is made understand that constitution the
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.280]  rule of law is like the king that they swear allegiance to these are merely temporary stewards
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:34.000]  the rule of law is over them we established that rule of law collectively we say we're not going
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.480]  to be ruled by dictators by men we're going to be ruled by law these are the principles by which
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.320]  we will be governed if you're going to be in government if you're going to wear a uniform
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.080]  have a gun be able to use force against other people you are going to swear to these principles
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:56.800]  you're going to swear to the bill of rights that says that there are certain things you will not do
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:05.200]  that is the condition of your authority when you lie when you go back on your oath you have no
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:11.520]  authority and we began to live in a kind of medieval dictatorship don't be surprised
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.120]  when we see the government executing people on the streets it isn't because you're black it isn't
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:23.120]  because you're a a redneck farmer that people don't like or you're doing right this is going
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:28.880]  to continue to happen because we no longer value the rule of law we don't understand what juries
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.240]  are for we don't care about our neighbors and we listen to the news when they demonize people
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.360]  and we say yeah I don't like this guy I don't agree with his cause so lock him up or shoot him
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.560]  we heard people say that about alex jones when he went on with appears morgan remember they
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.320]  were joking about it it was huntsman's daughter okay one of the guys who was running for president
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.680]  huntsman's daughter says yeah shoot him in uniform remember that yeah we don't agree with
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.800]  them so just shoot him well you know part of this is going to be the control grid that's
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:10.800]  being established and every day seems like there's another story about automatic self-driving cars
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.840]  and again their robot cars they're going to be controlled by the government okay their software
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:23.040]  cars and they keep calling them self-driving cars and I guess they call them driverless cars as well
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.960]  I guess we can't call them driverless cars anymore because now google and silicon valley has told the
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:35.120]  federal government that they are going to allow these computerized cars to qualify as drivers so
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.120]  now they're no longer driverless now the car itself is the driver it's going to be officially
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.320]  recognized as this the national highway traffic safety association will interpret driver quote
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:50.400]  unquote in the context of google's described motor vehicle designs as referring to the self-driving
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:56.080]  system not to any of the vehicle occupants that's a great way see the feds they go to the feds and
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:02.400]  they say you know what we we have all these safety regulations they're being put on us at the local
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.560]  and the state level so we would like for you just make those go away so let's so one of the ways we
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.200]  could do this is to say well yeah it has a driver the driver is the car the driver is the computer so
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:17.600]  whatever whatever silicon valley and google and these people want they just go to the feds and
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.480]  the feds say yes sir anything else you'd like uh you want something else we'll just put that in
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.640]  there as well and that's the way this thing is going to be greased that's the way it's going to
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.760]  come to pass and it's going to happen to us much more quickly than you think it is i don't think
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.600]  there's going to be any liability issues that are going to stay in the way they want this very badly
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.160]  the car companies want it silicon valley wants so the computer companies want it and the government
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.880]  wants it the most of all because they want to have a complete surveillance grid to tax and
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.760]  track you everywhere you go when you look at this train crash in germany what was the first thing
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.960]  they did they said oh we think a human shut down our computerized system and the german police like
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.000]  that said nope didn't happen yes again they always blame it on the people never on the computer

[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.960]  talking about waterboarding uh he asked senator ted cruise another proponent of waterboarding
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.520]  because all the republicans support waterboarding they all want to be tougher than the next guy
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:01.920]  and let me tell you what the problem is not with the candidates the problem is with the republicans
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:08.160]  who vote for them they're telling you that because they know that you want that they know you want
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:13.680]  terrorists waterboard and you don't know who the terrorists are you don't really care just
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:17.440]  point a guy out if the government says it's a terrorist get tough with them waterboard them
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:24.240]  do whatever you have to you are the ones who are driving this you are the ones who are encouraging
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.480]  this from the government from these candidates and so they're also yeah we'll do the waterboarding
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.400]  for you sure we'll be tougher than the next guy so what he did was he asked ted cruise a question
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:40.800]  about waterboarding he said should the water used in waterboarding be fluoridated there you go
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.600]  that's vermin supreme now he's running not as a republican he's running as a democrat
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.160]  and like a good democrat he has promised a free pony for every american just as you would expect
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:57.680]  a democrat too okay and mandatory tooth brushing laws i don't really i think he's basically stolen
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:02.960]  the campaign of michael bloomberg if bloomberg gets in the race i expect him to do exactly the same
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.760]  thing absolutely the mandatory toothbrush laws you may or may not get your free pony
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:12.720]  from my mayor bloomberg but here's the interesting thing out of new hampshire vermin supreme and
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.600]  again he's a performance artist he looks like a wizard he's got a a boot on his head okay he's
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:25.360]  been doing this for 30 some odd years guess what he got 240 votes he got twice as many votes as
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:32.080]  former virginia governor jim gilmore who is still in the race he hasn't dropped out he got half the
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.320]  votes of vermin supreme and jim gilmore has not dropped out i mean at least carly fiorina
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.520]  dead but uh jim gilmore just keeps going and going and going he's the energizer bunny
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:49.440]  and when you look at hillary clinton let me uh we have the story up on info wars

[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:27.200]  hour we're going to be talking to in the next segment actually coming up we'll be talking to
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:32.880]  brad daikus he is the founder and president of the pacific justice institute and we're going to
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:40.480]  be talking to him about the attempt by the city of san diego to ban the term founding fathers
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:46.240]  and of course after he sent them a letter and it got some exposure in the press everybody
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.680]  was absolutely amazed that here we are just before president's day and the city of san diego
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:56.240]  out of political correctness is going to ban the term founding fathers so we're going to talk to
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:02.000]  him about the victory because they backed down when they people shined the light on that absurdity
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:06.720]  but we're going to just talk about political correctness in general also his institute
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.800]  defends religious liberties and parental rights we're going to talk to him about other issues
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:16.880]  involving that as well now as i was talking about before we went to the break uh hillary clinton's
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:23.200]  emails that were obtained by a freedom of request uh uh action with gawker showed that they were
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:29.040]  blackmailing journalists telling them uh we'll give you access we'll give you advanced transcripts
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:34.800]  so that you can you can get a scoop on other people but we're going to tell you how to describe
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:41.120]  the speech pretty amazing uh i think it's things like that that hillary clinton
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:46.160]  is fighting so hard to cover up with this email scandal but then there's another story that was
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:52.880]  very interesting this is uh from jerome coursey at wnd he says the sound sanders ground game is
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:58.400]  being led by the soros garbage man this is somebody that's worked for george soros is somebody that
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:05.520]  george w bush called the garbage man and they're that has nothing to do with garbage it's just
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.800]  it's just the bushes you got to understand there it's not going to make any sense it's just they're
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:16.560]  in articulate rage uh jeb has the same problem but anyway he hacked bush's 2000 presidential
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.720]  campaign website so w called him the garbage man this guy's name is zack xley what i found was
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.000]  interesting on this is that bernie sanders who's put out there's mr squeaky clean he would never
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.200]  do anything dirty he's hired this labor union organizer and computer hacker to run his ground
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:40.000]  game okay and here's where it also gets even more interesting many within the clinton camp
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.080]  suspect that this guy this hacker zack xley is connected to the international network of computer
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:52.480]  hackers that exposed clinton's private email server in 2013 this is where it all began so now
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:03:00.160]  sanders has hired the guy who who made her private email server public and hacked into it and put
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.240]  this stuff out here and started the whole ball rolling how about that isn't that interesting
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:12.080]  mr uh simon and garfunkel has hired uh this guy here anyway uh looking at some of the other
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:17.360]  things that are coming out of the election campaigns we see that rupert murdoch very angry
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.280]  at chris christie he calls him a suicide bomber he said chris christie suicide bomber he tweeted this
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:28.960]  out he damages the victim while blowing himself up oh i guess he's a terrorist i guess we should
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:33.840]  lock up chris christie because rupert murdoch calls him a suicide bomber terrorist actually
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:39.920]  you know what he did was uh he just blew up fox news's favorite wind-up toy marco rubato
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.760]  and as we look at them heading towards south carolina it's pretty interesting looking at the
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:53.920]  various uh headlines we've got rubio attacking trump trump attacking jeb jeb attacking rubio
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:59.200]  i mean it's like they're circling the guns they're firing at each other it is going to get pretty
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:06.400]  rough in south carolina and south carolina has a very rough heritage when it comes to dirty tricks
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.280]  it's the land of dirty tricks there's an article that was up on the drudge report earlier from
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.840]  politica warning the dirty tricks are about to start they point out that the charleston post and
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:22.480]  courier has set up a whisperer campaign it's a digital tool that begs the public to help to keep
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:28.000]  tabs on the coming blizzard of dirty tricks they know it's going to be happening in south carolina
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  because look here we got things like remember when john mccain just before just before the election
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.160]  they did these push telephone polls telling everybody he had an illegitimate child then
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.800]  they had the bogus mit romney christmas cards with controversial quotes from the book of mormon
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:48.320]  okay you have flyers dropped on people's doorsteps telling them uh to vote on the wrong day that's
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.680]  south carolina that's lindsay graham land that's jeb bush's good buddy lindsay graham that's the
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:58.320]  way they play ball down there it's going to get really nasty a lot of ad hominem attacks coming
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:04.800]  up socialist presidential candidate bernie sanders is having breakfast in harlem this morning with
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:11.600]  former coke dealer and fbi informant reverend al sharpton sanders is hoping for an endorsement
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.360]  from sharpton in hopes that it will boost his reputation among young black voters who according
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.880]  to recent poll numbers overwhelmingly support hillary clinton this morning's meeting with the
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:29.040]  reverend al is at sylvia's restaurant the very same place that barack obama sat down with a preacher
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:36.400]  in 2008 and they've since become very close friends in fact al sharpton has somehow managed to get
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.640]  away with owing four million dollars in back taxes to the irs perhaps because of his cozy
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:50.640]  relationship with the president so how ironic is this bernie sanders a guy who wants to raise taxes
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:56.880]  is having breakfast with a guy who doesn't pay them and you can learn more right now at info wars

[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:36.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and in this segment we're going to be
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:42.720]  joined by brad dakis he's been a he's the founder and president of the pacific
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:48.320]  justice institute he's been the legislative assistant to us senator phil graham a graduate of
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:55.440]  the texas law school here and now he is working to defend religious liberty and parental rights
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:03.920]  so his efforts to stop the banishing of the term founding fathers in san diego just came out the
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:07.520]  last couple of days and they had a victory on this i wanted to talk to him about that
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:11.920]  about the other things that he works on with religious liberties and parental rights and
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:17.360]  let me break down the story for you real quickly uh as before we get him on it was reported by
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.160]  w&d i think they were the first ones to break this a couple of days ago the city of san diego
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:28.400]  had put out a uh a new guidelines for their employees saying that you can't utter the phrase
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:35.280]  founding fathers they had a lot of other things in their bias free language guide they had things
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:43.200]  like uh the common man mankind man made man up those are things that they had in their manual
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.880]  can i say that can i say manual i don't know it's got the word man in it and they said that this
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:53.680]  is their bias free language let me tell you something they've got a bias problem themselves
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:59.040]  they seem to be obsessed with the term man anything that is masculine so let's get the
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:05.360]  comments from uh brad dakis president of the pacific justice institute who fired off a letter
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:10.560]  and we got some results from that uh thank you for joining us mr dakis oh my pleasure alex thanks
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:16.560]  for the opportunity now we had uh alex isn't here i'm david but uh it was interesting when you
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.440]  talked about this you said uh if you can't utter the the phrase founding fathers without losing your
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.080]  job when you work for the government it's a sad day for free speech and of course their timing was
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:32.640]  extremely bad as well coming just a couple of days before president's day yeah this is this is
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:40.240]  terrible timing uh you know here we're about to recognize the founding fathers and uh and for the
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:46.400]  the sacrifice that they put forth so we have our constitutional freedoms and our constitutional rights
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.040]  like the first amendment free speech and at the same time here they they're coming down with this
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:58.160]  this kind of policy to prohibitions of speech including the term founding fathers uh you know
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.120]  of course we at pacific justice do we follow this for what it was we sent a demand letter to the city
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:07.680]  and uh we're glad that they have resented that prohibition on on mentioning the term
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.240]  founding fathers that's good but if you alluded to they there's something that you've got to do
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:16.480]  that right you wouldn't think it's kind of insane that you would have to send them a letter and say
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:20.720]  you know what uh you shouldn't try to ban the term founding fathers but that's the kind of insane
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:25.520]  society that we live in now isn't it oh it is it's absolutely ridiculous you know there's
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.360]  more than 1500 court decisions and the uh and that were the the phrase founding fathers as
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:38.800]  mentioned and uh it's uh it's you know to treat it like it's some kind of uh of a cuss word is uh
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:44.880]  is really you know I don't know how to say it twisted um and and yet this is was being implemented
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:52.640]  this wasn't just a hypothetical idea this was in writing and that the director was given to
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:58.240]  all employees and if they didn't comply they could lose their job that was in their manual
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:03.120]  did they have a different term for the term manual because that I find that offensive it's got the
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:10.400]  term man in it haven't they come up with a gender neutral uh term for manual yeah um that's interesting
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:17.520]  I I see the hypocrisy right there it's very ironic uh yeah I man made man up mankind they
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.560]  can't talk about any of that stuff I mean it's insane yeah yeah and also I think people need to
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.960]  say as far as um you know rationally why it it makes no sense is if they look at the Webster's
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:34.720]  dictionary and how these words are defined they're not defined in the sense of exclusively to
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:41.520]  to one gender or the other they never have been and yet they're trying to read something into a word
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:48.880]  that's not there so it's it's really a sort of a an obsession it's almost a uh
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.720]  something I think that maybe maybe counseling is needed uh oh it quite quite clearly is an
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.640]  obsession and it is a political tool I mean we just saw this last week we had Gloria Steinem
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:07.040]  we had Madeleine Albright come out and do uh what uh and Taylor Fleming writing for Reuters said
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.560]  was vote shaming slut shaming and said that is essentially the same thing saying if you don't
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:18.240]  support Hillary Clinton uh you're not a real feminist you have betrayed uh women and so forth
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:25.280]  and so on and and make all kinds of uh insinuations about people uh supporting Bernie Sanders because
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:30.640]  they wanted to get dates with young boys things like that I mean just shaming them over their
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:37.680]  political choice within the Democrat Party it is a political tactic it is a tool used to control
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.640]  people and we need to understand that I mean it's not an idiotic obsession John Cleese was talking
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.000]  about how you could no longer criticize anybody and it was a shame because that's the essence of
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.480]  comedy comedy is always going to have some kind of implied criticism with people and he said you
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:56.560]  know there there's kind of a psychological condition about it but it's not just a psychological
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:03.840]  condition it is a tool of social control it is a tool of kind of a Marxist tool of social control
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:12.880]  isn't it oh it really is uh if we if government can control the speech of man and women so
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:19.520]  if government can control this uh they control what we think if they can control what we speak
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:25.200]  they can control what we think and and our program uh you know I've read the book 1984
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:31.440]  I never thought we'd become as close as we are today uh to that book and yet that's that kind
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:36.240]  of control is what we see taking place but like you know like the city of San Diego trying to
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:42.000]  implement this outrageous policy and it's pages and pages of control which regard to what can be said
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  and what can't be um I think a policy addressing harassment that's fine where you're deliberately
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:55.360]  saying something to someone to put them down fine but when we get just so uh excessive excessive
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.920]  about this uh this kind of um I don't know how you describe it thinking that uh that individuals
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.560]  can't say words because of a meeting that someone else has that they never intended
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:12.000]  that's that's really a very strict part of our society you know I thought it was uh interesting
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.960]  Mr. Dacus uh when they came back and you wrote them the letter and uh said you know um essentially
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.840]  pointing this out to the mayor and the mayor said oh yes I I really don't support that we're not
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:31.280]  going to do that and then they had a spokesperson uh city spokeswoman Katie Keach said no employee
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.280]  has ever been disciplined for referencing our founding fathers and no one ever will
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:42.480]  but then why would they put out this bias free manual if they didn't intend to do that I mean
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.120]  that's that begs the whole issue they're pretending as if this never happened uh because they got
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.240]  caught on it they got called on it right right it's in black and white you know the prohibition
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.840]  regarding founding fathers it's in black and white on their letterhead um you know they're
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:04.320]  trying to they see some some uh pushback uh I'm glad to push back uh but that's the
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  story why we why we need to be very sensitive to to call it out when we see it uh otherwise
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.960]  this would have been implemented and uh with regard to all the employees working for the
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.880]  city of San Diego um that's very disturbing yeah and it's a very large group of people
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.040]  let's talk about kids now as well because I noticed that one of the things that you do at the
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:29.280]  pacific justice institute you say you defend religious liberties and parental rights you
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.640]  mentioned uh Orwell and we do live in an increasingly Orwellian world there was an
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:39.840]  article by a new American big brother is seeking to get into your child's head literally and they
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:45.040]  point out an article from Education Week where they're advocating the idea that U.S. Department
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:53.760]  of Education and other federal agencies would use emerging technologies to monitor and track
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:59.600]  everything from a child's mindset to their attitudes to their emotions to their cognitive
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.720]  processes all under the pretext of educating them of course they're going to target all these
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:12.000]  emotions processes mindsets map their personality traits and uh keep track of that I mean that
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:18.480]  is about as Orwellian as it gets your comments oh yeah when people first hear that their first
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:24.080]  uh reaction is usually like okay this is just some kind of conspiracy thing it's it's you know
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:31.680]  no it is not a conspiracy thing it's it's right it's laid out uh for uh implementation and uh it's
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:37.760]  uh if some are using it as a part of common core and that whole big picture if you will uh it's
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:44.160]  it's very real uh I know that you know personally I was in court uh just uh about 15 years ago in
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:49.680]  state of California he had four judges to grant injunctions against the state of California to
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:55.360]  protect parents wanted to opt in children out of a new test that would that dealt with the psychology
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.760]  and the psyche of kids and it would be reviewed by everyone I would have the access would be
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:04.320]  accessible to social workers to determine which children they needed to focus on which families
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:10.080]  they needed to hone in on in terms of the the mental well-being of the child it was so
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:15.840]  so dangerous that we got four separate judges to grant injunctions about 15 years ago but now
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:20.960]  we see something even even much greater in terms of of danger being implemented on an
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:26.560]  institutional basis from k through 12 that's very serious you know and that's the interesting thing
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:32.560]  too is that the government wants to dismiss any concerns that we would have about mapping and
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.920]  tracking and manipulating our children psychologically and otherwise they want to dismiss that as
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:42.720]  paranoid and yet it's the government itself that is paranoid it's the government itself that wants
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.720]  to know everything about everyone and to record that I mean the the biggest area of intelligence
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:53.200]  that's growing and James Clapper has been involved with for a long time is geospatial
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:59.520]  intelligence and part of that is to map the human domain we've been talking about this since Operation
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:05.600]  Jane Helm human domain analytics they want to go in and map people's religious beliefs their
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:11.920]  political beliefs look at their activity and keep track of that map that out so they know
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:16.080]  everything that everyone is doing I mean if that's not paranoid and over the top
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:20.800]  nothing is and that's the reality of this I mean they want to say that people who are concerned
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:25.040]  about that that we're the paranoid ones know it's the government that is paranoid it's the
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:33.120]  government that has to know and control everyone exactly and we've seen that being implemented
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:40.400]  through public education you know training teachers on how to to play case religious people
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:48.720]  how to identify students who come from intolerant families hold it right there Mr. Dacus we're

[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:11.280]  spent the last 30 years tracking an obscure threat to america today he says it's about to
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:16.320]  reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion if he's right your way of life is about to change
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:21.440]  very suddenly from where you shop to the doctors you visit to your retirement and the family you
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:27.040]  want to protect now he's made predictions like this before and he was right then too a few years
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:32.800]  ago he warned that housing prices would collapse they did before that he warned that dot-com companies
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:38.080]  would crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:43.760]  to do with the stock market this will affect us all a free video he's released online details
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:49.040]  everything you need to know at dollar downfall dot com now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:54.560]  but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself just go to dollar downfall
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:10.480]  dot com that's dollar downfall dot com
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're talking to brad dacus he is the
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:25.520]  founder and president of the pacific justice institute and he saw that uh san diego the city
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:31.840]  of san diego put out a new manual and i hesitate to use that word because they're trying to purge
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:38.160]  the term man out of everything uh they wanted to purge the term founding fathers so he sent them a
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:44.080]  letter and they backed down you know when you shine daylight on these people they will back down from
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:50.240]  the absurdity but they just keep coming so in this segment i want to ask mr. dacus uh about
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.560]  some of the other cases that he's involved with he defends the religious liberties and parental
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:59.840]  rights with the pacific justice institute mr. dacus tell us about some of the other cases
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:05.520]  that you've been involved in recently here oh sure you bet right now we're a depending
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:12.640]  at church in san francisco that is being sued because the the gentleman who heard one of the
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:18.320]  messages didn't like the the content uh he's also suing because the church registers voters
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:24.720]  and uh he doesn't like that either so he's trying to plan down on churches we have pacific justice
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:30.720]  to have defended lots of churches and synagogues too uh when they're being um threatened uh from
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:34.960]  being able to build somewhere grow somewhere uh we see the number one curtailment of church
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.040]  growth in america today is not lack of members of money but it's actually local government saying
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:43.920]  we don't want you anywhere and that's something that we're really addressing firmly we had a big
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:48.480]  nice circuit victory not too long ago yeah i've seen that uh many times i mean we look at these
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:55.280]  cases of imminent domain for private use in most of these cases that i've noticed they typically
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.360]  go after a church because they feel like they're easy pickings like they i remember a case out in
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:05.280]  california where they had a uh a church and they wanted to take their property uh take them off
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.120]  the property and give it to casco and of course the justification was what we always see with these
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:14.160]  kellovy london type cases saying well casco can generate more tax revenue than the church can
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:18.080]  well quite obviously they can because the church isn't being taxed but nevertheless
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:21.600]  they're you they they become the targets of these imminent domain cases
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.960]  oh exactly and it's it's a real atrocity to uh religious freedom and and equal treatment
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:35.680]  and uh another classic example of violation of the the rights of individuals and a true
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:42.000]  free libertarian society is a law in california and that that is actually going to affect also
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.400]  in illinois and new jersey actually governor new jersey's finance law and what it does is
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:52.960]  it bans anyone under the age of 18 who's struggling with same-sex attraction or gender identity
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:58.720]  dysphoria it prohibits them from getting any kind of counseling that in any way uh does not
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:05.680]  affirm their present uh mind a mental state or or in in condition so and that was chris christy
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:11.200]  supported that yeah chris christy signed that into law and uh the law with the governor of
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.560]  illinois and a governor of course of california where the first to do that uh and so we had
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:23.200]  pacific justice to have a file a lawsuit to defend the rights of uh counselors like you know
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:29.040]  licensed psychologists uh to be able to meet the individual needs of their individual clients who
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:33.520]  who uh wish to have that kind of counseling alignment with their their beliefs from their
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.680]  their faith it's amazing that the government would think that they should interject themselves
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:44.560]  into a medical issue and to a family issue like that especially for a minor right exactly and
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.840]  unfortunately the other states are very tolerant and uh and you know let parents and and families
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:54.000]  and individuals get the kind of counseling that they they feel they need and is warranted based
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:00.480]  on the individual needs of that of that to their client but uh it's just a very heavy handed control
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.360]  that is a very intimidating another area of control we're dealing with uh we're we're we're
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:12.800]  we're litigating uh is dealing with uh boys uh being required to be able to be uh go into girls
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:18.000]  locker rooms and shower with the girls in all public schools junior high schools in california
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:23.600]  uh you know of course they're trying to address to uh gender identities for if a boy feels like
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:27.840]  inside he feels like he's a girl or so okay then he can not just have a separate place to shower
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:34.480]  and change but actually use the locker room and the showers at the same time as the office at
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:41.760]  biological sex only disregarding the privacy rights of these 13 14 year old girls uh and and
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:46.640]  the implications it's very very twisted and once again it's it's the big heavy hand of state
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.520]  government counseling and now it's become a federal issue the obama administration with the
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:56.320]  department of justice the department is just that are saying notice is out to school saying uh you
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:03.840]  have to do this or risk losing federal money so it is a a really great yeah it's not just big brother
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.040]  it is brave new world conditioning as well and and that's really what we understand it is a mixture
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:13.840]  you know it seems like the people on top of the people who push back against something they get
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:18.640]  the big brother treatment they get the constant surveillance they get the intimidation but most
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:23.440]  of the rest of the people are getting this kind of brave new world conditioning and of course it
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:30.160]  focuses on that kind of uh sexualization to keep them subdued right them confused you've got your

[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:20.640]  triggered by financial instability fears that are fueled by european bank shares slumping to multi-year

[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:29.840]  analyst matthew turner said investors are concerned that central bank's solution is negative interest

[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:57.680]  of san diego to shut down the term founding fathers also things like man-made mankind uh
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:04.720]  they didn't go after manuel okay because the manual that they had was a uh bias free manual
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:12.160]  that was what was so amazing their bias was so obvious they they cannot abide any male terms to
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:18.320]  be used anywhere but they want to change founding fathers to founders and so his organization
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:23.760]  sent a letter to them they went public to the press it got a lot of exposure and the city of
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:28.160]  san diego backed down so no we never really meant it we weren't going to do anything to anybody and
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:32.800]  it's like oh yeah that's why you put them the manual out to do that that's one of the things
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:37.120]  that uh donald trump has brought to this campaign and we had an article about that yesterday about
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:43.920]  the uh a campaign aid for the trump campaign said that trump has single-handedly brought back
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:48.080]  freedom of speech well he's done a lot for it we're not there yet that it's going to be a
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.880]  continuous battle but it is great to have somebody essentially say no you know we're not going to play
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:59.760]  that game remember way back i think it was back in uh august there was a um an exchange between
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:05.760]  donald trump and reporter and uh the reporter called him out on the term anchor baby he says uh
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.560]  are you a turn are you aware that the term anchor baby is an offensive term and i guess maybe he
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:14.800]  could have said you mean like uh marco rubio well he didn't say that he said you mean it's not
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:20.320]  politically correct yet everybody uses it said trump you know what you give me a different term
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:26.320]  and the guy came back and he says the american-born child's that's the way he put it of undocumented
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:32.000]  immigrants and trump said that you want me to say that okay i think i'll use the term anchor baby
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:38.720]  that's the way we need to respond to this you want me to use a term founders i can't say founding
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.280]  fathers not i think i'll say founding fathers you're not going to stop me from saying that
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:49.760]  it's uh it's the kind of thing that i i think that has some value in the campaign and of course
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.080]  one other thing i want to say about uh the political landscape here before we go to
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.960]  your calls oh two things two things i've got this article here about jeb bush you know jeb bush
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:04.480]  his big victory was that he finished in fourth place so he's been telling everybody i'm not dead
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:10.240]  i'm not dead yet okay well he may not be dead yet but he may become dead broke if he keeps
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:19.040]  spending money like he did in new hampshire he spent 1100 per vote 1100 per vote in contrast
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:25.440]  donald trump spent 37 per vote in new hampshire you know richard reese was here yesterday our
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:30.320]  reporter who's been on site in iowa new hampshire he's going to south carolina and we're talking
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:37.120]  about retail versus hotel wholesale politics retail versus wholesale politics this is a good
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:43.440]  example okay now what he really meant by that was wholesale politics you're you're addressing people
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.320]  with broadcast media or you're addressing people in massive rallies like donald trump did
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:53.040]  retail politics you're going door to door you're going to this diner you're going to that
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:58.080]  business you're shaking hands that's what people do in iowa and new hampshire but really this is
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:02.880]  retail versus wholesale i mean donald trump got it for wholesale he got it 37 dollars a vote
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:08.800]  and jeb bush spent over a thousand dollars a vote ted cruise got it even cheaper they say
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.280]  18 dollars a vote this is how it kind of broke down it's interesting chris christy spent 887
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:18.160]  dollars per vote yeah he basically spent all of his time all his money in new hampshire he
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:24.320]  couldn't get it through so he's dropped out rubio 513 dollars per voter in new hampshire casick
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:32.080]  272 dollars per voter carly fiorina 156 per voter she dropped out carcin spent just 89
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.760]  dollars per voter so that's interesting the other thing that i thought was interesting
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:41.680]  out of the stack of political stuff here was marco rubio's campaign is now talking a lot
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:47.520]  about a brokered convention that's really where he is putting his hope he says according to his
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:52.720]  campaign manager terry sullivan he said yeah this week's performance in new hampshire was very
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:57.760]  disappointing but we're going to extend the fight for another three weeks or three months or more
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:03.520]  he said we could very easily be looking at may or at the convention i wouldn't be surprised if it's
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:07.920]  may or the convention they continue to say so they're looking for a brokered convention because
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:13.360]  that's where they can really push their advantage with the establishment candidates just like i
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:17.760]  pointed out before you know these people in the democrat party they think they love socialism
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.440]  well here's an example how socialism works straight out of animal farm you know because
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:27.120]  some socialists are more equal than others bernie sanders 150 000 votes he got 15 delegates
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:31.760]  hillary clinton got the same number of delegates as a matter of fact she started
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  back in november with 15 percent of the delegates she needed for the nomination she had over 440
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:44.480]  delegates back in november bernie sanders had 30 she had 62 percent of the super delegates
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:49.360]  he had only one percent so think about that folks all these people who voted for bernie sanders he
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:57.120]  didn't get any super delegates in new hampshire he had to have 10 000 of the unequal animals
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:03.120]  on the animal farm vote for him okay so 10 000 of his socialist voters equals one of the party
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:09.840]  apparatchik how's that for crony socialism you really want socialism you really want everything
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:16.720]  to be decided by government votes that's the way they're going to skew this uh let's go to
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.800]  cash in missouri you want to talk about organ cash go ahead hey dan you know i've heard you talk
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.360]  several times about jury nullification and that's one very powerful thing that we have
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:32.960]  uh but there's there's also one thing i think that's even more powerful but i've been looking
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:38.320]  into and studying a little bit lately and that that's getting um back to common law courts
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.320]  uh getting away from the statutory courts which is just totally fraudulent color of law
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:49.760]  and there's an organization out there that i would really like for you or to you know maybe
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:54.960]  somebody there within your organization to look into it's the national liberty alliance
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:42:02.880]  dot org is the website uh they've been uh uh going for 31 months now they've actually
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:08.640]  been filing core warrento and had these corpus papers in common law court and they're actually
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:14.080]  having victories they're actually have had had some cases where judges once these papers were
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:20.480]  presented to them actually resigned the next day they know how much fraud that there is there
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:25.760]  they know how much if we the people wake up enough that they are done and that's the key
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.720]  you know i mean when you look at this but when a lot of this is a bluff a lot of it
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:35.200]  are lies and you go back to jury nullification and talk about that for a moment when the judges come
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  in and say you don't have the right to look at to judge the law you may not agree with this law
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.720]  but if i show you by the facts of this case that this person did x then you need to find them guilty
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.960]  no matter if you think that the penalty is excessive or whatever that is not the law
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:55.440]  that is not what juries are for now as you're pointing out with these common law courts i think
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:00.720]  if you go in and you do that understand a lot of times the judges are or the you know the police
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:05.520]  force just gonna say yeah we're not gonna listen to that sit down shut up i'm gonna lock you up
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:10.880]  right now sometimes it doesn't work oftentimes it doesn't work they do the same thing with jury
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.720]  nullification i mean we talked to the we had the case of the new jersey weed man this is a guy who
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:22.880]  was a marijuana activist from the west coast he went to chris christie's new jersey they busted
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.600]  him he had he had he's a medical marijuana patient he had a huge amount of marijuana he had like a
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:33.360]  pound of marijuana and so they were going to come after him for very serious crimes for distribution
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:38.000]  he used jury nullification represented himself because a lawyer won't represent you so he said
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.560]  i'm gonna represent myself it's in the state constitution of new jersey that the jurors
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:48.400]  have the right and the duty to judge the law as well as the facts of the case he says i know that
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:53.040]  more than half the people here agree would think that marijuana ought to be legalized so he did
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:58.080]  that the first judge says take that he put up a thing that was clipped out of the new jersey
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:02.320]  constitution the first judge told him put that down i'm gonna throw you in jail for contempt
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:06.640]  to court so he put it down but he got a hung jury he had seven people vote for acquittal but they
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:12.240]  came after him again the second time he got a different judge and that judge let him leave that
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:18.000]  up let him leave up the clause in the new jersey constitution talking about jury nullification he
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.840]  was acquitted 12 to nothing and they couldn't come after him again and so that's the thing i mean
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:27.200]  you could really kind of rolling the dice so there is a huge educational issue that we have to do
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:32.080]  understand that you know there is a lot of bluff there's a lot of illegal activity that's going
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:37.840]  on by the judges but the same guys who will lie to you and who will intimidate you will also lock
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:43.760]  you up without giving you due process so you have to take your your your uh you have to make that
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:49.360]  judgment and it is something that is uh very difficult to judge that's why it really is
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:54.960]  an educational issue thank you so much cash let's go to uh kevin and california kevin
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:45:02.480]  gary yes i hear you go ahead yeah the whole cliven bundy thing i grew up in vegas about an hour
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:07.920]  north of vegas it's we're a little further it's all about the water they're trying vegas is drying
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:15.760]  up so the population's gone from maybe 200 000 it's over 2 million in about 40 years so i think
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:22.320]  you're overreacting about season of his land but it's just vegas is in desperation to find water
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:26.560]  well it's not simply about the water if you think it's about the water then
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.960]  you're missing a lot of things there are mineral rights that are there that they're trying to get
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:35.680]  people out of and it's not just it's not happening just in nevada if it was just happening in nevada
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.400]  yeah i would agree with you maybe it is just the water it's happening in arizona it's happening
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:45.200]  in oregon with the miners okay it's not even just with this this family the hamans i mean that wasn't
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:50.320]  about water they were taking the hamans out taking them shutting down their farm because
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:55.280]  they want to take over their land their land was checkerboarded with the national parks lands and
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.160]  they wanted to get all of their land i've seen this used against people bringing up false marijuana
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:06.960]  charges for a guy in california about 25 years ago taking him out because they wanted his property
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.720]  again it's a kind of imminent domain thing but they thought well we really don't want to pay him
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.800]  any money so why don't we set him up for marijuana charges they put in a swat team surprised him he
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:21.040]  came down the stairway with a gun in his hand they shot and killed him then they took his land
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:24.320]  we see this type of thing happening all the time they're going to take the hamans land because they
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:28.480]  accuse them of being arsonists and terrorists what's going on in nevada what's going on in
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:32.400]  arizona what's going on in most of these places it's part of something called agenda 21 you need
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:35.920]  to look at that you need to understand what's going on with that you need to understand they want
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:40.000]  people everyone off of the land they want to concentrate everyone into the cities there's
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.760]  also another aspect of this that you can see with what john mccain did in arizona what he did there
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:51.120]  was they took a park tonto national park there's something that's being used as a national park
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:56.320]  it has people have mineral resources there they have grazing rights there they have water rights
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:01.440]  there they have a lot of different rights the indians have this it's a sacred area to them
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:06.960]  the apache indians it is also an historical area to them and it's a recreational area all of those
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:13.600]  things and yet john mccain got this turned over to a british corporation who is going to mine it
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.720]  for copper and they're going to mine it in a way that it's going to leave it in a one giant crater
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:24.080]  that is visible from space very easily so you have to understand what they want to do is they
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:29.360]  want to get everyone off the land then these senators these powerful senators like john mccain
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:35.600]  and harry reid can turn this over to the chinese or to the british or whatever they can cut their
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:40.720]  deal with these multinational corporations that's really the end game it's not just as simple as
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:45.600]  saying we need the water they were playing games with the desert tortoise in nevada there used to
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:51.680]  be over 50 ranchers in that area the bundy family it was a last rancher standing there
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:56.080]  they said we got to get your cattle off the land because of the desert tortoise and his
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.680]  tribe and bundy and the rest of the ranchers that we talked to who had been driven off they
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:04.560]  drove off the other 50 some odd ranchers they all said we used to have cattle all over the place
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:08.720]  and we used to have desert tortoise all over the place now you don't see either one and he had
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.280]  some people saying yeah they had a synergistic relationship there with them they uh the desert
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.320]  tortoise could get moisture from the feces of the cattle that were uh they're grazing on the land
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:24.560]  the blm came in said they are an endangered species they took 1200 of these desert tortoise
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:29.280]  took them under their control and then said hey we don't have the budget to feed them so they
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:36.320]  euthanized 1200 of these endangered species that's what we're talking about we're talking about all
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:42.320]  these different issues it's a very big issue and underneath all of that is the issue that under the
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:47.760]  constitution the federal government should not own any of this land all of this land should
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:51.760]  have been turned over to the states for their management for whatever they were going to do
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:56.400]  with it should have been turned over at the time these states and they became states these
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:02.240]  territories became states that's what happened on the east coast but after the civil war we operated
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:08.880]  under a very different set of rules let's go to damien in arizona thank you kevin oh let's go to
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:14.800]  damien yes hi then david um i love your work and i love the passion that you bring to a lot of these
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.840]  issues uh thank you like the waterboarding and i really wish uh what's my re-use when he gets a
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:24.960]  chance to confront uh donald trump or when uh alex gets a chance to talk to donald if he does have
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.920]  an accent you should really define the nuance of what he's really explaining i think donald
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:34.480]  he himself may understand this issue but i don't think his followers when they hear it
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:38.080]  they don't understand the nuance of it i think he's just using the rhetoric to get at them
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:42.320]  i think that's very dangerous i agree i think he's responding to what he's telling the voters
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:46.000]  what the voters want to hear when you go back and you look at some of these issues like you look
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:51.200]  at the trade issue donald trump has been saying the same thing for 30 years he took out a hundred
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:56.800]  thousand dollar page a hundred thousand dollar ad a page in the new york times uh back in 1987
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:02.240]  talking about uh how we're getting screwed with these trade deals and that's what's going to
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:06.800]  happen with the trans-pacific partnership he's the best bet we've got to try to shut that down
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:13.120]  he also uh 25 years ago was talking in a playboy interview he said uh hey you're not going to stop
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:18.240]  the violence of the drug war until you legalize and control it like you did with alcohol prohibition
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:22.560]  okay it was violent when you had alcohol prohibition when you stopped that you got it under control
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:28.240]  you still have a drug issue uh but you can't control it and he hasn't said that why because
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.800]  the g.o.p voters don't want to hear that i think that's what he's doing with the uh torture as well
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:36.480]  i'm let me give you a real quick we got about 20 seconds go ahead i didn't mean to cut you off
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:41.920]  no uh the only the only other thing that i want to bring to light is uh yesterday i came about uh
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:47.440]  pet newton had a facebook post about how uh basically a lot of anti-gunners and gun control
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:52.080]  people happen to be Jewish and i a lot of response even from the gun community has been the one from

[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:24.640]  let's go first to bob and michigan bob yeah yeah david you do a wonderful job i just want to make
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:32.480]  one point i saw the video of what i thought was a provocateur he claimed to be amon bain uh
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:40.320]  bundy's bodyguard he was released the very next day uh after the convoy was stopped yeah i know
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:44.320]  you're talking about i think mark mcconnell or something like that yeah he held only for two
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:48.560]  hours and he gave a an account that conflicted with the testimony of the people in the car
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:56.240]  and i feel that that person should be brought up on charges to start exposing them because they had
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:03.680]  no way out they had the roadblock they had him behind uh he was he helps to institute that i thought
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.240]  it was a travesty yeah a true tragedy and you know when you look at what the uh the police were
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.440]  doing they had a uh an info wars uh dot com you'll find a a video that was done by a retired police
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:18.880]  officer and he he points out that the guys that were shooting cliven uh not cliven but lavoie
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:23.680]  finnecombe the one guy comes out behind the car that is supposedly this dangerous vehicle he's
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:27.520]  standing right behind the car exposing himself to danger if that vehicle was dangerous and then
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:32.160]  the other guy is coming out of the woods and he's shooting at his own people in the crossfire if he
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:38.640]  misses uh lavoie finnecombe absolute chaos and idiocy i mean it was keystone cops at the very
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:44.880]  best but then after you know ignoring this car they go back undercover and then shoot it up as
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:49.200]  if they were bonnie and clad it's absolutely absolutely amazing uh thank you bob let's go
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:57.280]  quickly to uh jim and connecticut jim hey james how you doing doing okay go ahead so good yeah
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:01.280]  i just wanted to say what alice talked about earlier how people need to get involved start
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:06.240]  working for legislation start interviewing people that's what we all really need to do what i like
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:12.560]  to do is i like to call my uh local am radio show it's just there's local um early shows in the
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:18.160]  morning they just talk about nonsense you know geopolitics and i like to get on there and
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:24.000]  you know talk to your audience you know host on the show yeah that's a great way to uh to do it
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.800]  call in radio shows i used to do that as a matter of fact that's how uh lionel got his start and
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:33.680]  talk radio down in florida used to call it so many times he's a regular caller so yeah i would i would
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.800]  listen to it and i would get so upset i would just have to call in to the local talk show uh that's
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:43.600]  that's a very important thing it's it's all on education you know and that's when i look at this
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.840]  whole situation in oregon i feel like and that was what was really dangerous they were going to
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:53.280]  talk to 400 people that's when they had to stop them it's the education that is more dangerous
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:57.440]  than anything else then it cares as long as they're staying up there you know in a in a remote

[03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:07.920]  was the real winner of the democratic primaries last night bernie sanders supporters are super
[03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:12.640]  pumped because he seemed to have a sweeping upset there for hillary clinton with more than 60 percent
[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:18.560]  of the votes there turns out for clinton even when she loses she wins she's going to get two more
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:24.720]  delegates than bernie sanders either way whatever way this plays out sanders his voters are going
[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:32.800]  to be really smiling now but crying later later so who do you think won the democratic primary
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:39.440]  last night uh bernie sanders bernie sanders absolutely right yeah but hillary clinton
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:42.880]  even though she loses she wins she got more delegates than him
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:49.760]  oh i didn't know that i i just i actually most people don't yeah no i didn't know that
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:58.480]  what bernie sanders with 60 percent of the vote right yeah well how did hillary get more delegates
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:05.360]  than him i don't know how does that work not sure yeah does it appear as if the system is rigged
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:13.040]  or i mean can can the establishment ever be taken down oh yeah uh probably not just with
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:19.360]  this system seems like it's just flawed yeah she went in she went into the game with the bases
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:24.800]  loaded with six super delegates so do you think that bernie sanders supporters like should they
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:28.720]  you know continue with this fight this revolution that's going on or do you think that there it
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:35.760]  there is no chance um i mean look at that there's no chance she's just gonna get the delegates
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:40.720]  no matter what what do you think about the fact that even though bernie sanders technically won
[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:45.920]  he lost to hillary clinton based on the establishment choosing the delegate i'm not surprised clinton's
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:50.640]  back by all the big banks man goldman sacks all the all the big guys are back in clinton so
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.280]  she's definitely got a lot of money behind it and even though sanders does have a lot of uh support
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:02:00.400]  apparently a lot of support especially from college students uh his policies aren't exactly the best
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:05.600]  you know you know very socialistic uh and i don't think they're they're exactly the best for america
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.760]  like i said i don't like either one of them i mean i think the establishment is would be more
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:14.880]  likely to support a candidate like hillary clinton right yeah so does it appear as though the game
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:20.720]  might be rigged in her favor when the people clearly are wanting sanders but but somehow she's
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:24.640]  ending up with more delegates i do i do think that's indicative of like a flaw in the establishment
[03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:29.520]  yeah and i think too with this whole delegate system it sort of says to these bernie sanders
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:33.280]  voters you guys should just quit while you're ahead you know because it's not it doesn't matter
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:37.360]  the staff she's still gonna get the delegates i think that's what that says i've also i mean
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:44.000]  based on most of the bernie supporters i've met though um they're a pretty committed bunch to the
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.960]  uh to him and his movement and his so-called uh political revolution so i don't think that
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:54.400]  i don't think that this is going to be enough to deter um bernie supporters entirely
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:58.640]  who are you going for who do you want to see in there i'm not going to vote by party line i'm
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:04.720]  going to vote by who represents what i want in a president and i don't agree with all of the ideals
[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:12.320]  of the the current candidates i know ram paul was my buddy dropped out so yes ram paul we need him
[03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:18.080]  to stay in the senate though so yes unfortunately or go for the supreme court but you hear that trump
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:22.640]  his ideas did influence a lot of the republicans with the support that he got in iowa at least
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:29.360]  so do you think you'll just write in somebody random like i normally do every year uh we'll
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:35.760]  see who's still on the ballot comes super tuesday in the texas primaries and uh i'll see who i'm
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:41.040]  leading then then hillary clinton even though she loses she still wins what do you think that says
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:47.200]  about the establishment um i'm gonna decline a comment on the establishment thank you so you
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:53.440]  think bernie sanders won um i think he showed that he's a serious contender oh it'll it'll be
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:57.600]  it's not november yet it's a little early to be making that call but i think that if he keeps playing
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:04.320]  off of this vibe he will definitely win the nomination well he got more than 60 percent
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:11.040]  of the vote last night right but even when she loses she wins because clinton actually got more delegates
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:16.400]  do you how does that work oh that's that's easy that's that's being in the back of someone's pocket
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:23.200]  so what do you think this says about you know bernie sanders he's coming up this like huge
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.920]  revolution it's finally time to maybe we're witnessing the fall of the establishment
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:32.640]  and then they come in and give her some super delegates so she beats him out politics are
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:35.920]  always nasty anything that can't be explained in numbers is usually happening under the table
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.240]  well there you go definitely not any corruption right i think bernie sanders should work on his
[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:56.640]  coin flipping skills be right back with the fourth hour i'm anthony gucciardi a lot of news to cover
[03:04:56.640 --> 03:05:03.280]  so joe bakes here with info wars dot com now last night tensions were high at the mall here

[03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:14.800]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:08:14.800 --> 03:08:20.960]  the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm anthony gucciardi i'll be your host
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:26.320]  for the rest of the hour we're going to talk to dr edward group about an interesting article
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:31.360]  that has come out lately and decide whether it's real or not or valid or not they caught my eye
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:36.560]  when he brought it up to me specifically from world net daily the headline reads huge natural
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:44.160]  disaster gets little media attention apparently this natural gas leak is pumping out massive
[03:08:44.160 --> 03:08:50.160]  amounts of noxious fumes and even lethal quote lethal levels of radioactive material
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:54.480]  says a natural disaster of unprecedented proportion is unfolding in california but has
[03:08:54.480 --> 03:08:58.960]  received little national attention near los angeles a leaking natural gas well which has
[03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:03.440]  been spewing noxious fumes for months is now according to some emitting lethal levels of
[03:09:03.440 --> 03:09:08.720]  radioactive material the methane is spewing from one of the 115 wells of the company's facility
[03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:14.400]  and santa susana mountains which is used to store gas for distribution to nearly 22 million
[03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:19.520]  customers in the la basin has a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet it's one of the largest
[03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:27.920]  of more than 400 gas fields and apparently it's according to some sources is leaking radioactive
[03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:33.520]  material and some of the sources which i'm not sure if it's been confirmed to say that some people
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:37.600]  are experiencing some bad reactions in the area and having nosebleeds so we're going to investigate
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.440]  that at the bottom of the hour with dr edward group and get his take on it and he's done a
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:47.360]  lot of research on this you know today seems like one of those days when there's just a lot of
[03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:52.080]  chaotic crazy news from cliven bunny getting arrested and all that stuff going on up there to
[03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:58.080]  the stocks plunging to gold going back up and i remember weeks ago looking at the silver prices
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:01.760]  thinking man i need to get some more silver you know i have a decent supply but i was thinking
[03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:07.200]  it's just so low it's just so low i remember when it was 14 $15 and went all the way up to 50
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:12.080]  and everyone was sure it's going to keep going went back down and we see the same thing happen
[03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:16.640]  over and over again it climbs it goes down it climbs it goes down well as we begin to realize
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:22.080]  that we can't trust the mega bankers with our financial stability obviously precious metals
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:27.520]  and other assets that are actually valuable are going to go up it's also in the news beyond the
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:34.160]  shares plunge on global growth and bank fears us yields fall the both sides of the atlantic the
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:39.120]  benchmark S&P index Dow Jones industrial average dumping more than 10 percent for the year
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:46.080]  because some other news with the zika virus so what's interesting to me is there's been a lot
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:51.360]  of freak out about the zika virus and it seems that we still don't really understand what it
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:11:00.880]  actually does columbia 3177 pregnant women with zika yet no microcephaly columbia's president
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:06.400]  Juan or according to this article Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday there's no evidence zika has
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:11.120]  caused any cases of the birth effect known as microcephaly in his country though it has diagnosed
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:17.360]  3177 pregnant women with the virus also announced that a u.s. medical scientific team will arrive
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:21.920]  in columbia to help investigate the mosquito borne virus brazilian officials say they suspect the
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:26.160]  zika is behind a seemingly unusual number of microcephaly cases in which children are born
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:30.160]  with unusually small heads the link is not confirmed but it has helped prompt the world health
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:35.120]  organization to declare an emergency over the virus so if this is true from the New York Times
[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:41.200]  if what the president is saying is true then the zika virus might not even cause or maybe
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:48.080]  in the small percentage of cases who knows have a distinct and large link to microcephaly the birth
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:52.720]  deformation in babies which would change the whole game we cover some more news and we're
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:57.920]  going to go to a special report so we talk about the pope right i feel like when the pope comes
[03:11:57.920 --> 03:12:01.920]  anywhere it turns into pope zone and every radio show is like the pope the pope the pope i love the
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:05.680]  pope i hate the pope the pope just worship of the pope over and over and over again even if you
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:09.840]  don't like him you hear about it all day but there's some surprisingly new interesting
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:18.320]  pope news that i just have to cover okay so he's going to visit juarez mexico and just a few days
[03:12:18.320 --> 03:12:24.480]  before this happened mexican prison riot at least 52 people killed and 12 injured in monterey
[03:12:24.480 --> 03:12:28.880]  arrived at the prison in the mexican city of monterey involving inmates belonging to rival
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:34.800]  drug cartels has left at least 52 dead and 12 injured just days before pope francis francis
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:40.960]  is due to visit another prison in northern mexico think about that for a minute right
[03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:50.400]  52 people killed in a prison riot but wait maybe they need maybe the murderers need a super confessor
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:59.920]  well what's a super confessor you might say the pope has dispatched an elite team of super confessors
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:06.640]  that are priests that forgive grave sins that normally only the pope can forgive
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:14.000]  so this is from the bbc pope francis dispatches 1000 super confessor priests i guess this is
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:21.600]  like the spetsnaz of priesthood pope francis has sent northern 1000 priests on a global mission to
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:28.080]  forgive grave sins that normally only he or a top church official may pardon the missionaries of mercy
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:33.760]  they even have a name the missionaries of mercy nicknamed the super confessors were given the
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:39.920]  special license for the vaticans jubilee year which ends in november grave sins include the
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:45.600]  filing consecrated bread and wine violating confessional secrecy and plotting to kill a pope
[03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:49.840]  pope francis has often said the church needs to be less rigid and judgmental
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:56.560]  he declared a holy year of mercy spread a message and has addressed some of the 700 chosen priests
[03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:04.320]  well what i would like to ask is how does one become a super confessor how does the pope give
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:12.640]  his ability to forgive grave sins that only he can forgive to 1000 spetsnaz priests i would like
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:19.440]  to wonder that personally i would also like to wonder why it seems that you would think that
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:23.360]  you have to go to another human being to forgive your sins but i don't want to get into that i'm
[03:14:23.360 --> 03:14:28.800]  not bashing catholics i understand i appreciate many of the traits but it is it a little absurd
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:34.880]  that he's sending out 1000 spetsnaz priests then i would also ask this though catholic bishops not
[03:14:34.880 --> 03:14:40.800]  obliged to report clerical child abuse vatican says this seems like a grave sin vatican guide says
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:46.000]  not necessarily bishops duty to report suspects to police despite pope francis vows to redress
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:50.400]  catholic church legacy of child abuse so it's not there doesn't you know they don't have to report
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:54.320]  to the police if there's child abuse the catholic church is telling newly appointed bishops that is
[03:14:54.320 --> 03:14:59.760]  not necessarily their duty to report accusations of clerical child abuse and that only victims
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:06.160]  or their family should make the decision to report abuse to police what a document that
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:10.480]  spells out how senior clergy members ought to deal with allegations of abuse which was recently
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:16.000]  released by the vatican emphasized that they must be aware of local's laws bishops only duty was to
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:21.280]  address such allegations internally wow so they're not even supposed to go to the police you better
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:25.520]  just deal with it internally better just turn a blind eye that sounds like a grave sin it sounds
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:31.760]  like to me that some of these bishops not reporting the child abuse and rape to the authorities might
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:39.920]  need to see a super confessor the pope needs to dispatch a super confessor all right we're
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:45.120]  going to go to a special report now by john bound about artificial intelligence that i think you
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:52.720]  have to see american jobs are increasingly rotting from the inside out market watch reports there
[03:15:52.720 --> 03:15:59.360]  are now more than 260 000 robots working in us factories orders and shipments for robots in
[03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:06.080]  north america set new records in 2015 according to industry trade group robotic industries association
[03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:14.560]  a total of 31 464 robots valued at a combined 1.8 billion were ordered from the north american
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:20.560]  companies last year the most popular jobs for these robots were industrial including coding and
[03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:27.200]  dispensing material handling and spot welding blindsided by technological gains and a sick
[03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:32.800]  fascination with artificial intelligence the leftist media spews out reports glorifying
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:38.080]  an unstoppable race towards the demise of the one thing that has kept america humming along
[03:16:38.080 --> 03:16:45.040]  as a global innovator for close to 240 years skilled labor the numbers of apprenticing electricians
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:51.840]  welders machinists etc have been dwindling in the past 10 years forbes reported in 2012 53
[03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:58.000]  percent of skilled trade workers in the us were 45 years and older and 18.6 percent were between
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:05.200]  the ages of 55 and 64 the tampa tribune reports ken simonson chief economist at associated general
[03:17:05.200 --> 03:17:10.560]  contractors of america said the industry is hiring people at quite a strong clip but at the same
[03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:15.760]  time contractors are saying that they can't find the folks with the skills they want they're having
[03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:21.040]  to pull in people from other industries or people that haven't done it before which isn't always
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:26.960]  something you can make do with it's blatantly obvious that a combination of fundamental factors
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:32.880]  are leading to a third world future for the united states of america the millennial generation is
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:38.880]  simply not interested in a vocational education projects will simply not be built in the future
[03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:44.960]  or may take much longer as skilled labor is sparse also the unchecked and unethical destruction of
[03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:51.840]  american working families as american companies like disney have american workers train foreign
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:59.680]  workers on temporary h1b visas to replace them the new york times reported about 250 disney
[03:17:59.680 --> 03:18:04.560]  employees were told in late october that they would be laid off many of their jobs were transferred
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:10.000]  to immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers who were brought in by an
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:14.960]  outsourcing firm based in india over the next three months some disney employees were required
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:21.760]  to train their replacements to do the jobs they had lost one former worker said i just couldn't
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:28.960]  believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks and take over our jobs exactly it was so
[03:18:28.960 --> 03:18:36.000]  humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job i still can't grasp it of course nafta

[03:24:09.920 --> 03:24:14.080]  talking about a number of different things you know i'm reading a headline right now on the screen
[03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:20.560]  anti-beance rally planned outside nfl headquarters over hate speech and it brings me on to this topic
[03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:24.640]  of political correctness and hate speech and before the break i was talking about some of the
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:30.640]  ridiculousness from the high ups in the catholic church not forcing or asking even telling telling
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:35.520]  their bishops not to report any child abuse that they see to the police you know i'm not attacking
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:42.400]  catholic people i'm attacking those policies or those ideas and it's something that most people
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:48.160]  fail to understand unfortunately that it's in the details it's not aligning yourself with one thing
[03:24:48.160 --> 03:24:54.400]  when i say that that idea in catholicism to not report child abuse to the police is bad it's not
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:58.800]  me attacking catholicism and the whole idea of political correctness and hate speech as you know
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:03.920]  i believe it is a form of dominance a form of verbal dominance because it allows people to
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:09.040]  instantly attack you and dominate you if you say something they say that offends me that's hate
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:14.160]  speech or that's whatever that person on the other end even if it's not even if they're not racist
[03:25:14.160 --> 03:25:21.040]  if they're not sexist or whatever they're instantly dominated by the ideology and paul watson has a
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:28.080]  video i want to play for you guys about twitter policing so-called hate speech and what he thinks
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:32.800]  is really going on let's go ahead and play that video twitter has announced the creation of a new
[03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:40.160]  trust and safety council that critics assert will police free speech and censor conservative voices
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:47.040]  and who did they pick to oversee this new advisory board everything is sexist everything is racist
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:51.920]  everything is homophobic that's right it's a neater sarkeesian the feminist who thinks that
[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:59.440]  telling social justice warriors they're liars is a form of harassment harassment is threats of
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:05.920]  violence but it's also the day-to-day grind of you're a liar you suck let me emphasize that point
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:12.480]  twitter is now being advised on its free speech policy by somebody who thinks that criticism
[03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:20.480]  of feminism is a form of hate speech but twitter's a private company it can censor whoever it likes
[03:26:20.480 --> 03:26:26.160]  right and how's that working out for them since it tightened the screws on free speech and started
[03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:33.840]  suspending and banning conservatives the company stock has plunged and top executives are fleeing
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:41.680]  like rats from a sinking ship now twitter's user count is set to decline for the first time ever
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:48.800]  hey twitter turning your entire platform into one giant safe space for perpetually triggered
[03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:57.280]  SJW cult members is not a good business move just ask matel who caved to professionally
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:05.920]  offended morons by creating a fat feminist barbie a decision that resulted in a marketing nightmare
[03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:12.240]  on the other hand protein world who gave the middle finger to funless fat pride feminists
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:17.920]  went on to make millions in profit look at what happened to reddit and 4chan when they
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:24.560]  cracked down on free speech didn't go so well twitter claims that its new ministry of truth
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:31.840]  contains a diversity of voices and that claim is total bullshit not a single one of the
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:38.000]  organizations listed is an unrestricted proponent of free speech groups like the foundation for
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:44.240]  individual rights and the electronic frontier foundation aren't involved there's no diversity
[03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:50.640]  whatsoever most of these groups are dedicated to censorship and smearing their political
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:58.640]  adversaries twitter co-founder jack dorsey thinks that freedom of expression starts with safety
[03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:07.120]  a line that wouldn't look out of place in orwell's 1984 and isn't it an amazing coincidence how
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:13.680]  twitter began this censorship purge immediately after a member of the saudi royal family became
[03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:20.160]  its second biggest shareholder saudi arabia the country that tortures and executes people
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:26.240]  who break blasphemy laws by criticizing the religion of islam twitter also reserves the
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:34.080]  right to ban people who criticize islam characterizing advocacy against someone's religion as hate

[03:30:12.720 --> 03:30:17.680]  december 1st 2014 the rise in gold is being triggered by financial instability fears that
[03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:22.000]  are fueled by european bank shares slumping to multi-year lows with concerns mounting over
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:26.720]  banks profitability and a low growth low interest rate environment analyst matthew turner said
[03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:30.560]  investors are concerned that central bank's solution is negative interest rates are at least
[03:30:30.560 --> 03:30:35.440]  not rising rates and that is gold friendly james butterfield added investors are returning to

[03:32:16.320 --> 03:32:22.800]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for

[03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:01.440]  hours at a time so first of all i want to ask you about this story because you emailed it to me and
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:05.600]  you know a lot more about it than me so world net daily says huge natural disaster gets a little
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:10.160]  media attention says there's a leak near los angeles there's a bunch of different sources
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:14.400]  ene news and all these different sources some of them are smaller they're saying the leak was
[03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:20.400]  discovered uh officially on december 7th i guess it was discovered on october 23rd but on december
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:25.520]  7th a video emerged showing a cloud of methane gas hovering over the upscale community of port
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:32.080]  of ranch and an infrared camera showed the leak is just going crazy what's going on here well uh
[03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:37.920]  there's not a lot of information coming out although we know that people are suffering in
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:43.360]  the area they're suffering with nosebleeds vomiting many other symptoms and i started
[03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:47.600]  looking into it because we were getting some calls which is really devastating you know if you live
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:54.400]  that's that's a heavily populated area los angeles and we know for a fact that there's massive
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:36:00.160]  amounts of methane and radon coming out but there's also naturally occurring uranium
[03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:05.760]  and toxic substances that are in the ground and when you have a volcano like effect
[03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:12.800]  like these infrared photos of this gas coming out that to me would be considered a massive
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:19.200]  potential radiation emergency of course anything that has to do with radiation is hush hush all
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:25.280]  the time because the government's just like fukushima all over the world we now know that
[03:36:25.280 --> 03:36:31.120]  radiation is destroying the ocean the fish are coming down with cancerous tumors but this is
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:38.080]  like right over the city i mean this is with children and we're still trying to verify although
[03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:46.400]  there was a french organization called aipri that came out saying that there are lethal levels of
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:50.640]  naturally occurring radiation coming out of the well and they even went as far as saying that people
[03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:56.560]  will probably die which is a very sad situation unfortunately that's going to be the uranium
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:06.480]  238 and they're saying the levels are so serious that they're accumulating on the soil they're
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:12.320]  accumulating on the roofs they're accumulating people have their windows open so of course that
[03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:17.440]  gets blown into their house so their children their pets there's been reports of pets dying
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:22.160]  and i i just started looking into this actually you know because you hear these things and you're
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:28.480]  saying this can't be going on because you know why is this not being brought to the attention of all
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:33.520]  these people in the california area we know how damaging and how strong radiation can be so
[03:37:34.400 --> 03:37:39.360]  assilling the beginning stages and of course i wanted to let everybody all the listeners know
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:45.520]  in the california area about this there have been people that have been moving out actually
[03:37:46.240 --> 03:37:51.920]  from their homes in the california area and wanted to let people know what they can do i mean
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:58.240]  you know if you if you're stuck in a scenario that you're breathing the air we talk about the toxic
[03:37:58.240 --> 03:38:04.320]  air the toxic water this gets into the water supply for tap water it's so hard to neutralize
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:09.600]  radiation and radiation is one of the things that to me is one of the most damaging to the
[03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:16.400]  genes to the cells can cause death and we know that people's pets are dying around that area and we
[03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:20.800]  know that people are suffering and we know that people and that children are suffering too of
[03:38:20.800 --> 03:38:26.640]  course most of the city officials are saying that it's just due to the high levels of methane
[03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:31.600]  but who wants to even breathe in methane you know like that's better or something oh it's just
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:36.720]  methane and formaldehyde guys i mean that's insane it's so funny also because yesterday
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:42.560]  or whenever i was on the show yeah yesterday we talked about i said is this the next flint and
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:47.520]  we talked about the leaking reactors two out of three nuclear sites in the united states are leaking
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:54.400]  and new york has like 63 000 increased tritium in the water in the ground water supply and i was
[03:38:54.400 --> 03:38:59.520]  saying meanwhile the media is like a spotlight and only focuses on one thing like flint you know
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:03.680]  and it says hey flint is such a crisis there's lead in the water and it is by the way it is
[03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:07.440]  significant crisis it's really really sad and really upsetting but it's almost like
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:13.360]  radiation is something the media doesn't ever touch and if this story is true this is huge news
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:18.640]  because it said that it was actually discovered on october 23rd so that's why there's been so much
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:23.520]  little news going on but the new york thing too i mean do you imagine if these nuke plants are
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:28.960]  leaking into the ground water supply that is a bad sign and all these plants are just kind of just
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:33.440]  like oh it's fine they just get their licenses renewed and stuff and no one seems to be talking
[03:39:33.440 --> 03:39:37.680]  about it even world net daily says this huge natural disaster gets little media attention
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:41.840]  are we isn't it sad that we're one of the only people talking about this this is disturbing to me
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:47.600]  you would think that they would the warning bells would go off and the sirens would go off and
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:54.800]  you know they would be distributing things or at least trying to close the wells i mean it's
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:40:00.400]  getting worse and the thing what people don't understand is okay let's say you have a major
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:06.800]  gas leak this is a major worldwide emergency right here that's going on in in los angeles they've
[03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:12.880]  admitted that it's leaking massive amounts of what they're saying is just methane but look
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:17.440]  you know what all the minerals are in the ground this thing is a mile deep you know half a mile
[03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:22.480]  deep in the ground it's going to come in methane gas is going to come in contact with many other
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:28.320]  things on the way up from the drill holes so it's not just methane gas that you have to worry about
[03:40:29.280 --> 03:40:35.440]  i think they they even said the methane gas was the equivalent of the exhaust of 337
[03:40:35.440 --> 03:40:40.960]  thousand cars or something like that yeah i have it here the methane the sacramento b reported
[03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:47.520]  the facility was releasing 44 000 kilograms of methane per hour or the monthly equivalent of
[03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:53.760]  greenhouse gases released by more than 200 000 cars according to the california air resources board
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:59.200]  and one of the people measurement said this is probably 20 times bigger than anything else we've
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:05.440]  measured that is a big this is from world net daily by the way guys headline huge natural
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:09.760]  disaster gets a little media attention we should definitely continue to cover this and see what's
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:15.040]  really going on and uh says ironically the leak occurs as governor jerry brown works to reduce
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:20.000]  emissions of methane and other short-lived climate pollutants by 40 percent of more by the year 2030
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:23.920]  isn't it funny how they always focus on these little things like these little green initiatives
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:28.640]  when there's like things spewing out toxic matter everywhere they're like well we really
[03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:33.360]  need to work on this coal plant here and there's like just death spewing everywhere and like
[03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:38.640]  lead in the water and stuff it's totally crazy man i mean the whole environment is just polluted
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:43.040]  and they're they're just blaming everything and trying to get those carbon taxes and saying it's all
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:53.040]  you know due to all this now they're even saying that the the zika virus is caused by climate change
[03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:57.120]  i mean how ridiculous is that and they just speaking of the zika virus this is a really
[03:41:57.120 --> 03:42:01.200]  interesting story from columbia that we talked about earlier the article said that there is
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:09.360]  33 3 000 women infected with the zika virus but none of them actually are having microcephaly
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:13.120]  in the children from the no birth effects so they're saying it's actually probably not
[03:42:13.120 --> 03:42:17.840]  related at all so how much misinformation is there out there i mean jeez it's just constantly
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:21.920]  over and over again we're just hearing new things not to mention you know today we're talking on the
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:26.800]  phone earlier the market the stock market you know is crashing because people don't believe in the
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:33.040]  big banks anymore when are people going to realize that it's it's not your mommy and your daddy running
[03:42:33.040 --> 03:42:37.520]  everything you know we're they're not here to help you they're not here to to cater to whatever
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:42.640]  you want and hold you close and keep you safe the banks aren't going to help you well i hope
[03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:48.480]  they realize fairly soon i mean you especially here in houston which is the oil and gas mecca
[03:42:48.480 --> 03:42:54.240]  yeah it's really being affected with the price prices but the way i see it is a change you know
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:59.920]  what i mean it's like we're coming in this revolution that we're part of i mean we all
[03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:05.040]  are part of this revolution all the info wars listeners what we're dealing on a daily basis
[03:43:05.040 --> 03:43:12.800]  bringing the truth out to the masses years from now our kids are going to be saying dad mom you
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:22.000]  were part of that revolution when oil and gas died and new green energy took place when pharmaceuticals
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:27.360]  died and people started going back to the earth and using natural remedies i mean this is going to be
[03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:32.640]  known this is going to what we're doing right now is going down in history we don't realize it but
[03:43:32.640 --> 03:43:37.600]  but it is and we are that revolution that's happening i mean years from now this is going
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:42.720]  to be written in the history books yes we used to actually drill into the earth and take the
[03:43:42.720 --> 03:43:48.320]  earth's resources people are going to look back and say why did we do that as a civilization
[03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:55.440]  why did we allow chemicals you know years ago the water was polluted with all these chemicals and
[03:43:55.440 --> 03:44:01.440]  how did people even live breathing the air and why were we manipulating things and genetically
[03:44:01.440 --> 03:44:07.200]  modifying things and what happened how did that all change and then they're going to say oh well
[03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:13.680]  info wars global healing center all these guys finally came together and you know the children
[03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:18.800]  are going to be you know saying in the history books they're going to be looking back and they're
[03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:23.280]  going to be saying reading about this revolution that we're doing right now but i just want to
[03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:29.360]  warn people because listen if you live out in california and you're having fatigue you know
[03:44:29.360 --> 03:44:33.360]  especially around the los angeles area don't think that there could be something wrong with
[03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:40.480]  what you're doing every day headaches nausea you're starting to see itchy dry skin on your children
[03:44:40.480 --> 03:44:46.640]  you're starting to see your animals freak out or your animals start to get sick sick scalp tenderness
[03:44:47.520 --> 03:44:53.920]  any of these things mood changes your kids are not paying attention in school memory problems
[03:44:53.920 --> 03:45:00.960]  these are all going to be signs that you may be exposed to these gases and you may be exposed
[03:45:00.960 --> 03:45:06.800]  to low levels of radiation and you should do something about it just you know we're here to
[03:45:06.800 --> 03:45:13.840]  warn people and to give people solutions because they are coming to us for the truth they are
[03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:18.880]  coming to us for solutions and if you are in that scenario some of the things that i would
[03:45:18.880 --> 03:45:25.280]  recommend that you do is you know go don't drink the tap water be careful about the food that you're
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:32.000]  eating wash it you know with purified water some of the natural ways that things that i do and
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:38.560]  that i recommend people if you are exposed to these gases and low levels of radiation potassium
[03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:48.160]  is really good calcium magnesium dmso zeolites are really good activated charcoal some of the
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:54.000]  clays that are out there the bentonite clays the pascalite clays those can be taken internally
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:57.600]  and you know it's crazy to think about that someone even have to be in this circumstance
[03:45:57.600 --> 03:46:01.200]  and i'm not sure you know i don't think we have conclusive information yet but it looks like it's
[03:46:01.200 --> 03:46:08.320]  pumping out 200 000 cars worth of methane per hour 44 000 kilograms according to some of these reports
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:13.200]  it is truly wild and you know i wanted to comment also on on the vision of the future that i have
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:17.360]  as well i think was very beautifully said what you just said was really really beautiful but think
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:22.800]  about also you know for example with flint or anywhere we looked at this and i broke it down
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:27.760]  for you guys before there's been articles that have shown the levels in other areas they're bad
[03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:33.520]  too the lead levels are bad the water supply is full of things like antibiotics and pharmaceuticals
[03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:37.680]  i'm not saying that to belabor a point i'm explaining that what happens is you're told
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:41.680]  just drink the tap water you're fine just drink the tap water you're fine and then it's the small
[03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:46.320]  symptoms that people don't really see the lead in the water it makes the children antisocial
[03:46:46.320 --> 03:46:51.680]  it reduces their IQ it reduces their ability to form sentences i mean it really messes these
[03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:56.640]  kids up completely it makes them brain damaged and it's little things right so you're not going
[03:46:56.640 --> 03:47:01.840]  to be sitting there in a seizure and go to the doctor oh you have lead poisoning it's a soft
[03:47:01.840 --> 03:47:06.080]  little hit it's a soft attack on your body it really really is devastating and it's just like
[03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:10.560]  this maybe the methane you maybe you're inhaling methane maybe it's really damaging people but
[03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:16.640]  it's it's so sad because the problem with our system and the establishment system is that they
[03:47:16.640 --> 03:47:21.120]  never correlate these things because it's such a soft attack right it's like maybe it reduces your
[03:47:21.120 --> 03:47:25.520]  life by a couple years if you do something if you drink the tap water or maybe you know it reduces
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:29.360]  your IQ by a little bit if you drink the tap water with the lead in it and stuff and places like
[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:33.600]  flint but it's never going to be something huge and monumental that you can take this is definitely
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:38.640]  it and that's why it's so powerful and so scary and so disturbing but as to your vision of the
[03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:44.080]  future which again i think was very beautiful i think if we look at the age that we're in right
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:50.480]  now for years and say from whoever knows how long till about just a little bit ago we were in the age
[03:47:50.480 --> 03:47:54.240]  of needing information what i mean by that is you talk to the average person on the street
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:47:58.480]  they didn't know anything you're talking about they're like what are you talking about they're
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:02.640]  they're modifying the food their stuff in the tap water they didn't know anything about the
[03:48:02.640 --> 03:48:06.960]  political system the federal reserve what's that the big banks what are you talking about
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:13.200]  and then we had the kind of mainstream hijacking version of that with we are the 99% and a lot of
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:18.160]  the food group movements and stuff like that but ultimately we culminated somewhere in the middle
[03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:21.680]  where i get a lot of people still don't quote unquote know what's going on they're
[03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:26.000]  somewhat low consciousness but the consciousness of this country and the world has greatly expanded
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:33.440]  i believe and now we're in the age of solutions action and just really getting stuff done right
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:37.760]  so now that people start to understand things we can actually make leaps and bounds in our society
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:41.840]  and change the planet and change the world because the fruit of our labor is paying off
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:46.160]  and even if we weren't hitting it right every single time right even if we're kind of kind of
[03:48:46.160 --> 03:48:50.160]  mixing in in and out and we're we're hitting stuff right sometimes and and sometimes not
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:53.600]  getting it totally right the answer is that we're trying we have pure intentions we have
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:57.440]  good heart we're doing the right thing and ultimately we are leading the charge like
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:02.720]  you're saying i mean just over the past few years i can see so many people getting ready for action
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:06.400]  look at the mega banks no one even believes in them anymore look at the stocks plunging
[03:49:06.400 --> 03:49:10.480]  it's not just because of their rigging systems because people are not buying the bs anymore
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:21.440]  no i agree and uh we're we're moving to a great change that's happening and there's a big war
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:26.320]  going on between the negative and the positive i mean i was called a granola the other day and i
[03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:30.800]  didn't even know i didn't even know what that was i had to go look it up online they said we
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:35.680]  don't want anything to do with these granolas and i said what is that all about so i looked it up
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:43.280]  i said granola is someone who cares about the environment a tree hugging type that eats organic
[03:49:43.280 --> 03:49:50.320]  and nutritious food is worried about the the health of their children i mean is environmentally
[03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:56.240]  friendly recycles and i was like well that's that's good i'm glad i'm a it's just like i used to you
[03:49:56.240 --> 03:50:00.000]  know people back in the years ago when you go to whole foods back when people didn't really
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  understand what they needed to do with their diet and their lives it's like what are you only only
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:08.720]  hippies go to whole foods right now everyone like goes to starbucks and whole foods like i'm
[03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:12.240]  gonna hang out whole foods like the cool place to go but it was like you're a hippie if you eat
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:17.520]  organic that's weird remember now it's like all the rage everyone loves it but you remember being
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:21.920]  back at the beginning when people were like what you do this you do that you care about your health
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:26.720]  what's wrong with you it's absurd you're a granola dr group how dare you care about the environment
[03:50:26.720 --> 03:50:32.240]  what you don't want 200 000 cars worth of methane gas to be dumped all over los angeles and killing

[03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:19.520]  gutti already we've got dr eggwood group of global healing center dot com on air with us right now
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:25.600]  and he brought to my attention this article we're about to cover here in one minute this is unbelievable
[03:54:25.600 --> 03:54:29.840]  concerns raised over number of children not engaging with nature now here's here's the part
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:36.560]  here's crazy part more than one in nine children in england have not set foot in a park forest
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:43.920]  beach or any other natural environment for at least 12 months according to a two-year study
[03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:49.120]  funded by the government let's be clear again not step have not set foot in a park forest
[03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:56.400]  beach or any other natural environment no natural environment for a year one in nine children and it
[03:54:56.400 --> 03:55:01.120]  goes on to say children from low income families in black asian and minority ethnic households
[03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:04.640]  are markedly less likely than white children and those from higher income households they're
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:10.880]  frequently visit urban or royal wild places just 50 percent and by the way okay talk about real
[03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:17.920]  racism for a second black asian and minority ethnic they have a name bm e a b a m e i don't
[03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:23.120]  know how asian black and presumably hispanic ethnicities are all lumped into one category
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:28.400]  in study because that makes no sense but anyway so one in nine children in england have not set
[03:55:28.400 --> 03:55:33.760]  foot in any natural environment for a year this is totally absurd totally insane a guardian article
[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:37.440]  doctor group wants to talk about we're gonna talk to him in a second about that get his take on it
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:42.160]  but first uh producer if in the back there daria was telling me something what were you saying
[03:55:42.160 --> 03:55:48.400]  about the word doctor hey yeah so i just realized during the break that the russian word for doctor
[03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:53.920]  comes from a russian word that means liar it's very interesting now now let me give you my take
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:59.520]  on this okay you're going to think i'm going to trash doctors i actually have one of my closest
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:04.000]  friends is a dentist a doctor of dental surgery another is a medical doctor and i have two other
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:08.640]  good friends that are medical doctors that own emergency clinics and run major hospitals
[03:56:08.640 --> 03:56:14.000]  in dalas and other areas again these are people i'm close friends with and obviously doctor group
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:21.440]  so look i think that most doctors are starting to get it and move away from pharmaceutical drugs
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:26.160]  like prednisone which are some of the worst things ever and realize that natural medicine has a role
[03:56:26.160 --> 03:56:30.000]  and i will also say if you're in a car accident you better pray to god that you have a medical
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:34.720]  doctor nearby or some type of surgeon so they have a role but the problem is when they buy into the
[03:56:34.720 --> 03:56:41.200]  establishment lie that everything is cut burn and drug up wouldn't you agree doctor group i mean not
[03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:46.560]  all doctors are bad a lot of them are really really us realizing what's going on no i i totally agree
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:52.000]  even like 15 years ago i was called a quack practically every single day and in the last
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:59.840]  five years it's amazing how many medical doctors have contacted us and read the book and really
[03:56:59.840 --> 03:57:05.840]  want to learn about natural medicine whether or not to just switch completely over especially with
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:13.200]  obama care it is a disaster doctors aren't getting paid the individual demand from the
[03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:18.960]  patients that are coming into the doctor's offices doctors the average time spent with a
[03:57:18.960 --> 03:57:24.160]  patient is less than seven minutes but that statistic is changing because patients are
[03:57:24.160 --> 03:57:30.320]  asking doctors more information so now the amount of time that the patients are requesting from the
[03:57:30.320 --> 03:57:36.160]  doctor has gone up and the doctors are being forced to learn about natural medicine because the
[03:57:36.160 --> 03:57:41.520]  patients are bringing in supplements saying can i take these with your pharmaceuticals and so
[03:57:41.520 --> 03:57:46.960]  the good news is that they are i mean you you're starting to see that even though the am a and the
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:52.000]  insurance carriers are fighting heavily against that well yeah because they're pushing the
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:55.760]  establishment part you know wouldn't it be insane if the listeners and everyone all your haters
[03:57:55.760 --> 03:57:59.360]  and everything knew how many people you've treated remember i was at your office last time we were
[03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:04.800]  talking with our our buddy who's also a doctor treats in your office saying how he does cardiac
[03:58:04.800 --> 03:58:09.840]  surgeons and all these major hospital ward people stuff it's like totally insane if people knew
[03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:14.720]  that all their mds are going to you they might have a change of heart for the haters but i think
[03:58:14.720 --> 03:58:19.440]  most people are getting it we're about to go to the end of the show dr group any final words real
[03:58:19.440 --> 03:58:25.600]  quick well any final words relate back to that article i mean we now it's just sickening and
