[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:27.720]  Thomas Eric Duncan was pronounced dead at 7.51 a.m. this morning at Texas Health
[00:27.720 --> 00:39.120]  Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas he is the first confirmed Ebola death in the
[00:39.120 --> 00:43.880]  United States confirmed that is the Associated Press and of course it's
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.280]  been reported that he knew he had Ebola and fled to the United States seeking
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.600]  treatment and the UN numbers and their different metric computer models show
[00:54.600 --> 01:03.600]  1.4 to 5 plus million that it's believed will end up contracting Ebola and all
[01:03.600 --> 01:06.960]  the other nations are either sealing their borders or putting in serious
[01:06.960 --> 01:14.440]  restrictions and banning flights we are not the United States is now a giant
[01:14.440 --> 01:22.200]  dumpster for the Ebola virus just like we're the dumpster for GMO crops and the
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.960]  dumpster for vaccines and the dumpster for everybody to have kids and then they
[01:25.960 --> 01:29.680]  come here and get paid for and the dumpster for anybody who's sick to come
[01:29.680 --> 01:32.760]  here and get paid for unless you're a citizen black-white Hispanic doesn't
[01:32.760 --> 01:35.960]  matter then you get put on a death panel and or you're a veteran you don't get
[01:35.960 --> 01:39.400]  any health care you get put on a secret death panel because they want to
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.720]  incentivize the third world flooding unskilled Balkanized Tower of Babel
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.400]  Tower of Babel so we can't communicate with each other so that's coming up

[01:59.960 --> 02:04.840]  savage.com I heard about this book a few months ago and I gotta be honest with
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.320]  you I never put out Obama deception to I've made the film three times and then
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.000]  it's always old and I never released it I have this problem for four or five
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.240]  years I just want to make a film so good I never released it this is the
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.160]  subtitle of the Obama deception to that never came out was basically the Obama
[02:24.160 --> 02:31.880]  deception the coming American Civil War and it's not that I'm ripping off
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.920]  savages he's ripping me off we're both smart course I'll be smart now to see
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.240]  this to have common sense this country is cruising towards Civil War the

[03:17.440 --> 03:24.080]  quote from Alex Jones that Michael Savage's new book stopped the coming
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.880]  Civil War may be one of the most important books ever written and the
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.520]  reason I say that is if we don't stop the stage Civil War they're planning
[03:34.520 --> 03:37.480]  you've heard me like a parrot saying this for about six seven years they're
[03:37.480 --> 03:41.760]  clearly gearing up for it Homeland Security is designed to win the globalist
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.760]  takeover against the Republic and they're gonna trigger a false Civil War to do
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.380]  it we expose that and then it's illegitimate not just not the people in
[03:50.380 --> 03:54.600]  Homeland Security on average on average they're actually good people I didn't
[03:54.600 --> 03:57.560]  used to say that till I actually did more research and ran into more of them
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.880]  and found out they're really freaked out because they know how real this is they
[04:01.880 --> 04:05.640]  know the treasonous mission they've been given they signed on when they were
[04:05.640 --> 04:09.560]  really gonna fight al Qaeda or something not spy on pro-life groups and tea
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.360]  parties and churches and prepare for martial law and gun confiscation plus
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.400]  they're not stupid they know the Civil War won't be fun for them I will assure
[04:17.400 --> 04:24.000]  you and it won't be fun for us either so the battle lines are drawn and I'm not
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.520]  I don't have any stock in this book I told Weldon I wanted to carry this book

[08:17.000 --> 08:23.440]  radio talk show host on I have anybody on the broadcast that wants to try to save
[08:23.440 --> 08:27.240]  this country wants to preserve the right of private property the right to
[08:27.240 --> 08:32.640]  practice your religion the right to self-defense the right to be a parent the
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.880]  right to not be a slave but I tell you I agree with about 97% of what Michael
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.040]  Savage talks about and breaks down and I'm always honored to have him on the
[08:43.040 --> 08:47.360]  show I've been on his show a few times he has our reporters on on a routine basis
[08:47.360 --> 08:54.200]  and no one understands what's going on in the world on talk radio other than
[08:54.200 --> 08:59.680]  info wars.com like Michael Savage does he'll be joining us for the full second
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.200]  hour coming up and you know that I've been making Obama deception too for five
[09:04.200 --> 09:09.080]  years and then I just wait and I've done literally more than 50 interviews been
[09:09.080 --> 09:13.480]  all over the country other parts of the world I couldn't make it in about a
[09:13.480 --> 09:16.920]  month now because I've just got all this bombshell material that all ties
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.040]  together but I've been so busy with the TV end of things and covering Ebola and
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.520]  deaths in my family and illnesses in the family that's why I wasn't here
[09:25.520 --> 09:30.440]  yesterday and just all hell breaking loose quite frankly that I've never got
[09:30.440 --> 09:36.640]  it out then always have to restart the film I intend to get with Rob Jacobson
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.840]  some of the other crew and just take what we've got and just put it out because
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.120]  the last working title I don't want to give out the exact title was the
[09:46.120 --> 09:54.720]  Obama deception the second American Civil War basically well what Savage's
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.280]  new book called and since I started reading it I can't put it down stop the
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.520]  coming civil war that's why I'm saying it could be one of the most important
[10:01.520 --> 10:08.120]  books of our time because if America has a stage civil war it will change world
[10:08.120 --> 10:12.920]  history forever and could trigger things that make Nazi Germany look like a tea
[10:12.920 --> 10:19.840]  party a cakewalk and if you're a sociologist an anthropologist a
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.320]  historian if you have wide-ranging historical understanding it is a no
[10:24.320 --> 10:30.120]  brainer what Savage says in this book in fact it is a Geron tea you smoke five
[10:30.120 --> 10:33.600]  packs of cigarettes a day for 25 years you're gonna get infesteem or lung
[10:33.600 --> 10:39.640]  cancer you jump off a thousand foot cliff without a parachute and it has a
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.360]  rocky bottom you're gonna die on the bottom you boil water it's gonna boil
[10:45.360 --> 10:51.240]  you switch your wrist with a hatchet or a knife you're gonna bleed to death what
[10:51.240 --> 10:56.440]  he says in this book and it's not that I'm following Savage or he's following me
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.200]  even though we do follow each other it's that it's common sense folks but if we
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.280]  don't get this common sense out to people the globalists are going to
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.480]  stage a civil war to bring this country down that's their plan it's the only way
[11:08.480 --> 11:11.760]  they can take over and it's what all their preparations are for and what they
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.200]  admit they're getting ready for so we salute Savage for being prolific and I
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.000]  know he probably written 50 something books bunch of number one New York Times
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.240]  sellers he's joining us on the next hour very important issue because all we're
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.880]  worried about Ebola and a lot of other easy you know to cover issues that you
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.520]  are obviously something even mainstream media covers it's the hard issues as
[11:38.520 --> 11:43.440]  scary as Ebola is like this that are complex real-world and so serious that
[11:43.440 --> 11:51.560]  have to be dealt with so we're gonna break down in the second hour the real
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.880]  plan and if a plan is exposed before you launch it if you know about the bank
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.880]  robbers plan a week before they pull off the job you don't know when they're
[12:01.880 --> 12:04.920]  gonna hit the bank exactly but you know they're gonna hit it the next week what
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.680]  can you do you can probably find their hideout before they do it or you can at
[12:08.680 --> 12:14.760]  least be waiting on them on the show up don't say that we didn't have the drop
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.000]  on them or the jump on them okay we do if you pay attention and I'm getting
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.800]  chills right now because this is so epic it's so historical it's so real it's so
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.520]  hardcore so we salute Savage for trying to put a spotlight on this we harp on
[12:29.520 --> 12:36.640]  it every day here and so does Savage and no one is plagiarizing the other we're
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.480]  looking at the same thing coming down the road here and quite frankly it's not
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.440]  rocket science he puts it together in a in an easy to read rocket science for
[12:46.440 --> 12:55.680]  dummy's fashion but it's guaranteed the collectivist socialists and their
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.320]  financial backers that want a monopoly are going to pull this off they're going
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.440]  to go for broke fortune favors the bold they know that well fortune favors the
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.360]  bold on both sides our treasures liberty and freedom and justice and not be
[13:10.360 --> 13:13.880]  enslaved and have indignity we either get involved now ladies and gentlemen
[13:13.880 --> 13:18.960]  we're gonna lose everything that is in the second hour today stop the coming
[13:18.960 --> 13:25.560]  civil war we don't have a weekly report called that because just that's what's
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.280]  being geared up for the entire infrastructure of homeland security was
[13:30.280 --> 13:33.840]  started for al-qaeda but then flipped over to the tea party veterans got owners
[13:33.840 --> 13:40.960]  Christians anti-gen 21 grips private property grips I mean basically if you're
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.480]  a good organization that George Washington would like if you are a
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.360]  moderate to George Washington even a liberal because he was a conservative and
[13:50.360 --> 13:52.880]  in agreement a lot of what Thomas Jefferson had to say those were your
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.880]  true conservative would be George Washington liberal would be Thomas
[13:55.880 --> 14:02.320]  Jefferson I admire both of them great thinkers if you basically are like
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.600]  Thomas Jefferson the so-called liberals hate your guts the most because they are
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.280]  the antithesis of a liberal I'm I'll be honest with you I'm more of a Thomas
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.080]  Jefferson even though I super admire George Washington I'm more of a Thomas
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.360]  Jefferson a classical liberal and I bet when I ask Savage this he'll agree I'll
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.640]  say you're a classical liberal aren't you in the vein of Thomas Jefferson and I
[14:24.640 --> 14:27.760]  bet money he agrees because I've read his books I've listened to him I know
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.200]  what he stands for doesn't mean he had made mistakes or you know said things he
[14:32.200 --> 14:35.240]  probably shouldn't have all of us have but but the end of the day he doesn't
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.520]  want to see the Republic fall so he's going to be joining us now let's get to
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.680]  the really serious news that's currently taking place on the economy on the wars
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.400]  on Ebola obviously is huge this was just announced in that last hour it's on
[14:50.400 --> 14:59.960]  info wars calm and prison planet calm first Ebola patient diagnosed in the
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.440]  US has died AP Dallas the first Ebola patient diagnosed the United States
[15:04.440 --> 15:09.360]  died today this morning at Dallas hospital according to a hospital

[15:14.560 --> 15:18.760]  Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas where he was admitted September 28th and
[15:18.760 --> 15:23.440]  has been kept in isolation according to spokesman Wendell Watson yeah shouldn't
[15:23.440 --> 15:26.960]  have been in a regular hospital should have been in a level for government
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.560]  bio shield weapon lab that's by the way federal law they just ignore it as part
[15:32.560 --> 15:38.600]  of destroying the law Duncan carried the deadly virus with him from Liberia
[15:38.600 --> 15:41.720]  though he showed no signs when he left for the United States that's been proven
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.480]  to be bull love the whitewash here he arrived in Dallas September 20th and
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.680]  fell sick a few days later yeah his condition was downgraded during the
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.240]  weekend from serious to critical others in Dallas are still being monitored as
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.280]  health officials try to contain the virus that has ravaged West Africa with
[15:59.280 --> 16:04.480]  more than 3400 people reported dead they're also are trying to tap down
[16:04.480 --> 16:12.760]  anxiety among residents frightened of contracting Ebola though the disease can
[16:12.760 --> 16:17.960]  be spread only through direct contact with the body fluids of an already sick
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.560]  person well that's not guaranteed to be true health officials identified 10
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.000]  people including seven health workers who had direct contact with Duncan while
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.840]  he was contagious other 38 people have also had to come in contact with him the
[16:29.840 --> 16:35.000]  family is quarantined after days but another 30 plus people are just being
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.720]  monitored now they should be locked up remember I missed her anti lock people
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.040]  up but the only time you can lock people up is when they've been around
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.160]  somebody with something that kills 90 plus percent of people that come in
[16:48.160 --> 16:55.160]  contact with it you get it 90 plus percent of the time you're dead even with
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.400]  all the modern stuff they're saying it's 60 70% upgraded from 50 something
[16:59.400 --> 17:05.800]  percent they were saying would die I mean this guy died and it's a horrible death
[17:05.800 --> 17:08.880]  with blood spewing out of every orifice I'm not gonna go into details you know
[17:08.880 --> 17:16.120]  about it but it's not pretty and I'm right down the road from this with all
[17:16.120 --> 17:19.240]  these Dallas sites and people just pouring into Austin for the big rock
[17:19.240 --> 17:25.080]  concerts they've had two weeks in a row last weekend this weekend ACL hip-hop all
[17:25.080 --> 17:29.680]  of it huge music festival and all these international flights coming in and it's
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.840]  ridiculous they say keep your kids home if they're sick with the cold but then
[17:33.840 --> 17:38.160]  they sent this guy's kids to school at first I mean this is ridiculous and then
[17:38.160 --> 17:41.880]  they said parents were wrong we pulling their kids out of the school oh let me
[17:41.880 --> 17:47.400]  tell you the way kids spread stuff in the school system if I lived in Dallas I
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.880]  had my kids in public school and there was one case with somebody's kids go to
[17:51.880 --> 17:57.280]  school I would take them out of school period in the whole school system they
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.240]  shut down whole cities in Liberia and Sierra Leone other areas trying to stop
[18:01.240 --> 18:07.960]  the spread of it here they go oh just fly in oh just come across the border by
[18:07.960 --> 18:13.040]  the way you know what else is in the news US representative Duncan Hunter said
[18:13.040 --> 18:20.040]  10 ISIS fighters caught by US border patrol that's coming up by the way that
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.040]  means al-Qaeda and here's Bloomberg Kurdish protesters royal turkey other
[18:25.040 --> 18:32.520]  burning stuff down as jihadists fight and the Kurds are in the news Kurds
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.600]  blame Turkey for not stopping ISIS they go on to say that they're really al-Qaeda
[18:36.600 --> 18:40.040]  and that Turkey is funding the group that has been slaughtering them see the
[18:40.040 --> 18:43.800]  Kurds live over there they're being murdered by al-Qaeda calling itself is
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.800]  ISIS isle to confuse people and so their response is riot inside Turkey and
[18:48.800 --> 18:56.880]  burn stuff down and the jihadis are battling them I mean the Kurds haven't
[18:56.880 --> 18:59.160]  attacked anybody in hundreds of years they want to be left alone they're a
[18:59.160 --> 19:06.240]  minority group of Muslims and they know what's going on they don't know who
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.720]  Britney Spears is I'll bet you money but they do know who ISIS is just like the
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.440]  Pentagon does just like the Pentagon's gone to Obama and said stop it and the
[19:14.440 --> 19:19.080]  British Ministry of Defense has gone to Cameron and said stop it and I'm not
[19:19.080 --> 19:21.720]  even lionizing the military but when they do the right thing with the right
[19:21.720 --> 19:26.960]  thing our whole political system what Congressman Jones was on last week I
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.880]  guess Monday and they all know the Saudis are behind 9-11 our government
[19:31.880 --> 19:39.640]  stood down they're saying release it you see this stuff's all real and now Obama
[19:39.640 --> 19:45.560]  has let al-Qaeda into the country and when they attack us Obama will take more
[19:45.560 --> 19:48.880]  of our liberties and grandstand and no one will point out that they let them
[19:48.880 --> 19:53.520]  in or although Rivera will call us racist we're saying the border shouldn't be
[19:53.520 --> 19:57.280]  wide open and that Ebola could come into the US of course it did come in

[24:37.600 --> 24:44.800]  news site is prisonplanet.tv first Ebola patient diagnosed the US has died
[24:44.800 --> 24:53.520]  Thomas Eric Duncan died at 751 a.m. from the virus Ebola Wall Street Journal
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.560]  Spain struggles to address concern over Ebola case just do what our media does
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.360]  and just say it's not bad for him there's no big deal do what the CDC does just
[25:04.360 --> 25:11.640]  come out and say that there is absolutely no problem
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.640]  meanwhile she got it from an Ebola patient they brought into the country
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.320]  again bring people into the country and don't put them on a level four bio
[25:21.320 --> 25:25.040]  weapons lab you are a total criminal bring a man you're a criminal you bring
[25:25.040 --> 25:27.920]  them in and don't put them in a top facility by themselves or with other
[25:27.920 --> 25:33.760]  Ebola patients you are now culpable big time and I told everybody I'm not a
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.840]  rocket scientist but I've had virologist on the default protocol is don't bring
[25:38.840 --> 25:42.760]  them in the country keep them on ships or in country where they have it the
[25:42.760 --> 25:48.680]  default is don't send to 3,000 and then 2,000 more 5,000 US troops into three
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.120]  different African countries that are collapsing just default don't do that
[25:53.120 --> 26:00.640]  default don't not scrub the ambulance and the house day one and default
[26:00.640 --> 26:03.840]  quarantine the whole family everybody came in contact with and quarantine
[26:03.840 --> 26:10.360]  everybody who flew in on the plane with them didn't happen none of it happened
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.400]  because the feds folks when TB is drug resistant and they catch somebody flying
[26:15.400 --> 26:18.920]  they have a database they arrest them at the airport almost every time they have
[26:18.920 --> 26:22.960]  a database they actually do a pretty good job let me explain that to you they
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.600]  want this spreading period like I said a month and a half ago like I said a month
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.400]  ago a week ago and Monday
[26:34.600 --> 26:41.640]  think about it think about it let it sink in I know you know I know I know
[26:41.640 --> 26:46.400]  but that's how evil the people are that have hijacked our government and hijacked
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.880]  his key this is not our government if somebody hijacks a plane and puts on the
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.000]  pilot outfit which a lot of hijackers do because people start following their
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.680]  orders when they put on the captain's outfit that's not the captain folks you
[27:00.680 --> 27:04.080]  don't open the borders up and say everything's free come to America if
[27:04.080 --> 27:09.720]  you're the president you're an enemy of the Republic period that's not rhetoric
[27:09.720 --> 27:16.560]  those words don't even begin to get near the severity I don't have words
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.280]  Shakespeare wouldn't have words to describe the spirit of destruction the
[27:22.280 --> 27:27.960]  spirit of anti-freedom the will to wreck this country and only let select
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.440]  interest operate in it so Spain struggles to address concern over the
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.520]  Bola case oh really European Union asked Spain for more information on how
[27:36.520 --> 27:41.000]  health worker contracted disease well they brought in other health workers out
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.400]  of West Africa that had it and that's how she got it and they're now saying she
[27:45.400 --> 27:53.920]  touched her face documents Spanish woman touched face with a Bola glove let me
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.240]  give you the news flash it's mutated over 300 times used to mutate a couple
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.080]  times a year now it's mutating 300 times in the last year that's CDC zone numbers
[28:02.080 --> 28:07.360]  and it's clearly incubates from not three days but 21 at least and it's
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.480]  clearly spreading faster and most virologists we said this two months ago
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.040]  almost two months ago from the New York Times three weeks ago that they believe
[28:15.040 --> 28:21.000]  it is somewhat I'm gonna say it again weak but airborne weak but airborne and
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.640]  they had the discoverer of a Bola come out yesterday and say they believe it's
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.760]  gonna go airborne now let me tell you what's gonna happen if it goes airborne
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.920]  if they leave the border open or they let it spread they're a hundred percent
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.160]  responsible and I want everybody to know remember who did it and let me tell
[28:40.160 --> 28:43.280]  you what are they planning that they didn't get away with this what are the
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.600]  people running Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.120]  the National Security Council that's what really runs the country the COG
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.720]  that's over Northcom the continuity government board what are they doing
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.160]  they're doing this in front of everyone they're funding al Qaeda in front of
[29:00.160 --> 29:02.960]  everyone they're opening the borders in front of everyone they're turning the
[29:02.960 --> 29:05.880]  power plants off in front of everyone they're doing policies they'll destroy
[29:05.880 --> 29:08.920]  the dollar in front of everyone they're starting wars with Russia for no reason
[29:08.920 --> 29:15.680]  in front of everyone what is going on what is going on what is going on these
[29:15.680 --> 29:22.560]  people are out of control so they've shipped more than 25 people into the
[29:22.560 --> 29:25.920]  US that have a Bola and they've shipped a couple into Spain it's already spread
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.440]  there Connecticut Health Commissioner granted quarantine power AP yeah I see
[29:30.440 --> 29:33.920]  they're gonna use this to lock whoever they want once it spreads let the crisis
[29:33.920 --> 29:38.600]  get out of control Coast Guard sector issues new steps on a Bola virus AP I
[29:38.600 --> 29:41.720]  guarantee you they did that because it's default Obama will probably order a
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.880]  standout I predict that a quiet standout CDC airborne a Bola possible but
[29:46.880 --> 29:52.840]  unlikely we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[33:31.720 --> 33:37.160]  are showing up all over california in other areas saying Ebola with the
[33:37.160 --> 33:42.800]  Obama symbol in the middle of the oh you can see it at drudge report dot com
[33:42.800 --> 33:47.800]  info wars dot com also has an article about it and I tell you great minds think
[33:47.800 --> 33:52.240]  alike I began first about a week and a half ago I'm sure people did this as
[33:52.240 --> 33:59.720]  well because it's obvious calling it obola and so I already had the crew well
[33:59.720 --> 34:03.280]  I'd mentioned it to him last week never got around to it making a t-shirt that
[34:03.280 --> 34:09.760]  said obola on the back and obola on the front with the symbol so the shirts are
[34:09.760 --> 34:13.080]  being made right now we're gonna go ahead and post it on the shopping cart
[34:13.080 --> 34:20.720]  info wars store dot com info wars store dot com we're gonna go ahead and post
[34:20.720 --> 34:24.880]  that it's good to associate Obama and socialism and collectivism and anti
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.800]  guns with disease because tyranny is the most dangerous disease this world's
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.560]  ever seen killed 262 million non-combatants according to University of
[34:34.560 --> 34:45.080]  Hawaii under democide death by government in the 20th century alone and so we are
[34:45.080 --> 34:53.720]  coming out with a limited edition I have told them to make only 3,000 of these in
[34:53.720 --> 35:00.040]  different sizes from small up to xxl 3,000 are being made right now they'll
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.880]  be here in a few weeks so go ahead and pre-order and you'll get it I'm gonna
[35:04.880 --> 35:07.600]  come sit in two three weeks take you a week to ship it you'll get it in a month
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.160]  you'll be the first to have it and I haven't seen anybody else that has this
[35:10.160 --> 35:16.160]  shit and it helps find the operation and denigrate their God because Obama had
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.880]  to be politically destroyed quicker than they wanted him to they always want
[35:19.880 --> 35:24.720]  their political gods destroyed to bring you the new God but they intended this
[35:24.720 --> 35:31.000]  guy to really be messianic and and and to never be fully discredited he fell a
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.960]  lot faster than they intended and that's good because it discredits their
[35:33.960 --> 35:38.840]  whole system and going into the next election cycle we need to fully destroy
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.640]  Barack Obama because we know he's a puppet but the general public doesn't
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.320]  fully get that so you have to absolutely discredit everything associated
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.640]  with him his anti-gun anti-family you didn't build it raising the debt limit
[35:53.640 --> 35:59.080]  doesn't raise the debt all of his fraud must be destroyed we don't want to hurt
[35:59.080 --> 36:02.640]  him physically that would that would save him if somebody tried to kill him
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.360]  or kill him but that's something the globalist might do in my gut that's in
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.880]  the cards definitely or at least in a fake assassination attempt we want to
[36:09.880 --> 36:17.120]  destroy his image because he's not real to begin with a narcissist husk so
[36:17.120 --> 36:20.000]  that's very important if it's not up there right now we have the next hour
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.160]  infowarstore.com or just tell us what size you want or how many when you call

[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  us three dollars from the US cost 12 though the stuff made America is better

[42:31.480 --> 42:33.960]  gotten to enjoy that over the years only make an issue out of it doesn't

[43:06.280 --> 43:10.760]  intimidated by these people we're gonna lose everything don't folks understand
[43:10.760 --> 43:16.720]  that the government has our border wide open effect for you back into Ebola look
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.040]  at this headline the weekly standard general if Ebola reaches Central America
[43:21.040 --> 43:25.760]  there will be mass migration of the US no kidding we have no border and we've
[43:25.760 --> 43:29.320]  advertised of the world there's no border and what happens if Ebola gets down
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.400]  into Central and South America where it's gonna breed like wildfire with all
[43:33.400 --> 43:36.720]  their bat species down there that are known to spread it
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.520]  leave you a newsflash bats don't die from it on average they carry it they
[43:41.520 --> 43:44.000]  now know it's not monkeys it's bats in Africa that's been confirmed for a
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.560]  decade you get on the hiking bike trail in the evening when the bats come out in
[43:48.560 --> 43:51.920]  Austin Texas and they fly around you feel little things wet smells like pee
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.320]  hitting you that's their crap I won't go on the hiking bike trail when the bats
[43:56.320 --> 43:59.640]  come out at night nothing against bats I don't like being crapped on by them and
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.440]  they carry rabies and I'm not a germaphobe folks I'm starting to become
[44:03.440 --> 44:09.080]  one though with all these people I know sick and dying now what happens when the
[44:09.080 --> 44:16.640]  bats get Ebola here with our impaired immune systems and the rest of it you
[44:16.640 --> 44:19.800]  walk under a bridge you smell that smell you hear bats turpent during the day
[44:19.800 --> 44:26.800]  asleep up there imagine if that gets into them there's the New York Times
[44:26.800 --> 44:31.120]  linked to Africa and Ebola found in bats suggest viruses more widespread it's in
[44:31.120 --> 44:37.440]  the bats now that's why it's spreading all over Africa they fly over at night
[44:37.440 --> 44:43.000]  fruit bats are out during the day as well part of the day and they pee and go
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  to the bathroom over you ladies and gentlemen and then you breathe it do you
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.320]  understand it's not technically airborne but it is roaches can carry it on
[44:54.320 --> 44:56.680]  their feet
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.000]  I'm not trying to scare people I want us to get prepared I'm concerned
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.080]  meanwhile you guys representative Duncan Hunter gonna play this clip says ten
[45:08.080 --> 45:12.040]  Isis fighters caught by us board patrol yeah we've met with Isis board patrol and
[45:12.040 --> 45:16.680]  they say they pick up jihadis with the prayer cloths with Inspire al-Qaeda
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.960]  magazine the whole nine yards and they're told oh that's just a sympathizer or a
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.400]  nut give them to us and then they just basically release them or they don't
[45:25.400 --> 45:31.240]  know where they go so see the government is trying at criminal levels to let
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.680]  these people in so they can go shoot up a school blow something up and here's the
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.880]  deal when al-Qaeda under the name Isis or isle goes and shoots up a school I'm
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.000]  not turning my guns in you understand feds and then you're gonna try to march
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.400]  the police off I know and the Civil War starts that's the whole plan I get it
[45:48.400 --> 45:52.600]  and if the American people are dumb enough to go along with this I guess we
[45:52.600 --> 46:01.720]  deserve it I guess we did murder 54 plus million babies since 1974 my dad was
[46:01.720 --> 46:07.920]  going to medical school my mom got pregnant and Roe v. Wade had just passed
[46:07.920 --> 46:13.960]  1973 and abortion was the new hot training thing to do and my mom was
[46:13.960 --> 46:20.800]  working at the Dallas Morning News and people told her oh your career oh you're
[46:20.800 --> 46:26.080]  doing modeling oh just go get an abortion wait till your wait till your
[46:26.080 --> 46:30.640]  husband no my dad just worked two three jobs and my mom worked a job part time
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.800]  when she was pregnant and I'm here I'm not dead but you know what there were
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.080]  discussions about chopping me up
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.480]  so maybe America just has to be judged maybe maybe that's what this all comes
[46:46.480 --> 46:52.680]  down to and it's the madness of the elite toll free number to join us 800 25
[46:52.680 --> 46:59.840]  at 992 31 800 25 at 992 31 on Ebola or on these al-Qaeda fighters crossing the
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.240]  border what happens when they shoot up the school or shoot up a mall I'm not
[47:04.240 --> 47:07.440]  going through metal detectors to go to the mall I'm sick of this you're supposed
[47:07.440 --> 47:11.800]  to control the border not random highway checkpoints and malls and everybody
[47:11.800 --> 47:14.760]  knows that it's like leaving the castle gate open and then having the guards
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.760]  guards some woman in her bed while the front gates open and fifty thousand
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.880]  barbarians run through with battle axes and the guards are busy down at the
[47:22.880 --> 47:31.120]  Millers poking him with a sword while he runs a Miller machine grinding grain I'm
[47:31.120 --> 47:34.160]  pulled over and that's where I'm going what I'm doing cop knows full well I have
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.840]  no criminal record just going through their thing you know milk in the milk
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.280]  cow meanwhile the whole country's going to hell in a handbasket it's all a
[47:42.280 --> 47:46.040]  giant fraud let's go to this clip about 10 al-Qaeda fighters they're calling them
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.320]  ISIS no al-Qaeda al-Qaeda al-Qaeda here it is if you're talking about protecting
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.760]  Americans ISIS is coming across the southern border they are going to be
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.600]  one bombers bombings cities but they are they are going to be bombing American
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.040]  cities coming across from Mexico let me get a question let me ask a question
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.480]  you say that they're coming in the southern border which is you know
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.920]  changes all the dynamics do you have any information or any evidence that they
[48:10.920 --> 48:18.240]  are actually coming in the southern border now yes yes I know that at at
[48:18.240 --> 48:21.200]  least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.880]  Texas there's there's nobody talking about it there's there's because I've
[48:25.880 --> 48:29.640]  asked because I've asked the border patrol Greta and the border patrol they
[48:29.640 --> 48:34.760]  just let ISIS ISIS members as we come across the border no they caught them
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.600]  at the border therefore we know the ISIS is coming across the border and it if
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.360]  they catch five or ten of them you then you know there's going to be dozens more
[48:41.360 --> 48:44.920]  there's an important relation border patrol but that's how you know all you
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.800]  have to do is ask the border patrol that's that's where we're at risk here is
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.880]  from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border because once again
[48:52.880 --> 48:55.480]  they don't have a navy they don't have an air force they don't have nuclear
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.200]  weapons the only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islamists
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.160]  is by having an open southern border chairman Dempsey said the exact same
[49:03.160 --> 49:06.360]  thing he said that's where the major threat is here is having an open so
[49:06.360 --> 49:09.160]  that's what Colonel Shaffer says you guys are going to infiltrate into the
[49:09.160 --> 49:14.560]  U.S. he's the expert on it here's the deal hunter you know the real threat it's
[49:14.560 --> 49:17.640]  that the political class wants to take over and get rid of the Bill of Rights
[49:17.640 --> 49:23.040]  you guys can do whatever you want and arrest whoever you want and the
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.400]  political class in both parties and not just here but other governments the
[49:26.400 --> 49:31.440]  entire NATO alliance has been propping up Al Qaeda and renaming it Coruscant
[49:31.440 --> 49:35.280]  all the rest of it to menace the West so you guys can take our freedoms now
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.680]  again that doesn't mean they completely run them they're winding them up they're
[49:38.680 --> 49:42.960]  giving them fuel they're dumping the black widows in the bed you're all
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.680]  accomplices I'm not saying he hunter is himself accomplished I'm saying the
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.240]  people at the top are accomplices and our own military knows this is coming out
[49:53.240 --> 49:56.480]  our own military brass that's why they've been distancing themselves for
[49:56.480 --> 49:59.680]  about three four years saying we don't want to arm these people no we don't
[49:59.680 --> 50:04.440]  want to give them 15,000 stinger missiles because here's the news flash FBI
[50:04.440 --> 50:10.840]  NSA CIA defense intelligence you better let people do their job and roll up all
[50:10.840 --> 50:14.800]  these cells because when they shoot down aircraft it won't matter what you've
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.880]  done to me the words already out you gave them the stinger missiles you
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.160]  understand we exposed you you're not gonna turn these nuts loose and then not
[50:24.160 --> 50:31.120]  get the blame for it do you understand do you understand that do you get that
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.280]  the Kurds are burning down Turkey right now saying Turkey is behind Al Qaeda and
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.480]  ISIS and they're right and the Kurds don't like being murdered in mass they're
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.400]  tired of it it's gonna be the same thing you understand just like the Kurds no
[50:43.400 --> 50:47.840]  turkeys with Al Qaeda we know and no amount of name-changing will put up the

[56:19.800 --> 56:25.600]  the reporters and my second is that story about Ebola yes it is for you for
[56:25.600 --> 56:32.200]  Ebola the cure for Ebola can be found if you listen to the song take action by
[56:32.200 --> 56:38.760]  Joseph Israel Yahweh will cure all the diseases and vitamin C cures Ebola
[56:38.760 --> 56:45.040]  so Yahweh will will destroy Babylon and we'll gather the Israelite and good I
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.080]  appreciate your call we all screen calls folks can hear and differing
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.320]  interesting views like that it's been proven by Linus Pauling and a Nobel
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.680]  Prize that mega doses of vitamin C will only upset your stomach is only side
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.480]  effect and do amazing things I don't think you can say we'll cure it it's all
[57:01.480 --> 57:05.320]  different different people but yeah anything that boosts your mitochondria
[57:05.320 --> 57:12.640]  boost your DNA vitamin C is known to do that the stuff that's in we'll just go
[57:12.640 --> 57:16.200]  read about DNA force at m4slife.com do you think
[57:16.200 --> 57:22.160]  vitamin C is powerful well this is exponentially more powerful let's go
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.920]  ahead and talk to Dave in Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead yes good
[57:25.920 --> 57:28.880]  afternoon Alex I was wondering if you've heard about the story up here in
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.480]  Pennsylvania that's been ongoing now since September the 12th when a state
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.120]  trooper was killed and ambushed right outside of the state trooper barracks and
[57:37.120 --> 57:40.840]  booming growth pencil yes I am aware of it they are still looking for this
[57:40.840 --> 57:46.080]  character now what I'm wondering is is this a false flag or is this something
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.560]  that is a lone wolf or is it homegrown terrorism it sounds to me like a real
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.040]  psychopath that was into video games and war gaming sounds like a psychopath that
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.920]  they love to taunt the police it fits the MO of a real guy for my research I
[57:58.920 --> 58:02.880]  followed it extensively we've mentioned it some but if you look at the real MO
[58:02.880 --> 58:06.400]  of this guy and the way the media handled it I think he's a psychopath who
[58:06.400 --> 58:10.120]  wants to hunt police well a couple of weeks ago they had a press conference
[58:10.120 --> 58:14.040]  you might find this interesting when the one reporter asked the state trooper
[58:14.040 --> 58:17.840]  that was given the conference if this person had been previously been involved
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.440]  with a psychiatrist or psychiatric medication and the officer doing the
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.160]  press conference says we we cannot answer that we have to decline on any
[58:26.160 --> 58:29.760]  remark yeah I remember seeing in the word is he'd been under psychiatric care
[58:29.760 --> 58:33.840]  which you can then bet he was on it and and again that stuff just takes a
[58:33.840 --> 58:37.560]  violent nut and pushes them over the edge we'll be right back stay with us
[58:37.560 --> 58:43.240]  more calls Michael Savage coming up can we stop the coming civil war stay with

[58:57.240 --> 59:01.000]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.840]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[59:04.840 --> 59:09.240]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there
[59:09.240 --> 59:13.520]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[59:13.520 --> 59:17.280]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[59:17.280 --> 59:20.640]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:20.640 --> 59:24.360]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[59:24.360 --> 59:28.760]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:28.760 --> 59:32.600]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.520]  check on me I want to talk to you about the bullet thing where I think it might
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.560]  be going from what I've been saying we're starting to drop call off that it
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.040]  goes along with a wildlands project Matt I haven't seen it coming anywhere near
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.000]  the of mega cities are planning on building up and I'm just I'm just in
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.120]  there throwing out this little war game plan on there that my plan will start
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.560]  the vaccine in those cities and when they say they reached enough vaccines
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.720]  that's how for us people come nuts in the mega cities to get cured whenever
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.280]  starts busting out for the ball in the country well that's exactly what will
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.040]  happen that's what the Pentagon is saying general if Ebola reaches Central
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.840]  America there will be mass migration to the US wherever this stuff starts
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.240]  breaking out people will race in all different directions bigger than the
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.400]  death toll even if it's a few hundred or a few thousand it's gonna cause super
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.920]  panic and the government's doing everything you do if you wanted to
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:47.720]  spread do you disagree with that statement no I do not I wish somebody
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:53.800]  did that's that's how it's going in the way they're saying it's actually that's
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.800]  why it's going well God bless your brother let's all just pray about it and
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.400]  hopefully it'll mutate into a harmless form or something and hadn't done that in
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.600]  30 plus years but Ed and FEMA region for what what former state are you calling
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:13.480]  from Ed North Carolina all right go ahead I believe that there are six steps to
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.920]  get us back onto the track of Liberty obviously there's a lot more because
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.080]  there's a lot of bull crap that they've been pulling but without these six steps
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.680]  in my mind we will never make it back to the state or the country we were before
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.640]  the first is the most important is government ties the fed what I said
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.400]  earlier is I'm gonna go to Ebola calls right now so if you want to hold till
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.720]  savage is gone I can come back to you it's open phones in the third hour but I
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.640]  said it's Ebola calls guys people need to hear what I'm saying sometimes but it's
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.280]  a free-for-all it's a free-for-all if you want to hold you can John is in
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.600]  California says he is a illegal but agrees with me that's what it says on
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.800]  screen John go ahead are you doing Alex good sir go ahead well I wasn't talking
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.760]  about Ebola I was just basically bringing up the fact that I have been
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.960]  deported and I still do agree with you well I'm not against even the individual
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.880]  immigrants themselves it's how they're being used by the political class is
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.480]  what I'm saying I agree with you I but you know I am you know I am family
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:21.400]  orientated I run two businesses I I agree with what you're saying I mean I mean
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.960]  does that make me a traitor no but we need to make a way to make people that
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.120]  are productive be able to become citizens but the government doesn't want
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.960]  people like you they want people that want a free ride to bankrupt the country
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.080]  that's the plan so how how do how do we deal with that I don't know I wish I
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.360]  had the answer I wish I did too because when you're playing against an
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.000]  adversary that doesn't follow any rules and it's completely evil how do you
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.960]  defeat them you block anything they support you know they may have good
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.120]  reasons for all what they're doing their intent is evil do you see the
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.640]  difference yeah well I think that if you were to maybe you know have a bilingual
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:09.240]  people sure or something to you know absolutely totally agree with you that
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.960]  if I could launch my other projects and get things done that the first thing we
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.440]  do would be have world Spanish service info wars news but then I've got to
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.040]  bet everything those reporters say and do and I've got to deal with it and I've
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:27.440]  got to I mean believe me that is that is in the pipeline well you know I agree
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.640]  with you and I think that there's a lot more Hispanics that do agree with you and
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.480]  I feel that maybe they are being categorized by a lot of other people no
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.960]  I know the media says if you're Hispanic you support getting rid of the family
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.280]  turning your guns in and worshiping world government and that's not what most
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.000]  Hispanics support but but as a political block with the illegals they do over 90
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.200]  percent vote for whatever the Democrats say and then you got Republicans their
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.640]  loyal opposition like Boehner who funds Obama care everything else so between
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.480]  that political combination only a total wake-up can stop it Michael Savage

[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:46.240]  stalin and dr. savage has been exposing this for decade after decade after
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.040]  decade and now it's coming to a head
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.280]  homeland security is fully converting over to go after the american people the
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.160]  gun confiscations already begun in new york california and other areas the
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.400]  persecution is right out of well nazi germany hitler from 33 to about 39
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.840]  ratcheted up political harassment audits
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.040]  uh going after businesses of groups he didn't like
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.400]  we're seeing a cold war against anyone loyal to common sense and freedom now
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.840]  i'm gonna i'm i'm done ranting i want to give
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:25.280]  dr. savage the floor here but he gets it i get it a few others get it
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.880]  joseph era gets it but undoubtedly and i talked to top pentagon brass
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.640]  on air and off air i have top ci sources you hear them here
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.880]  people that are on my show right for the brief congress the military knows obama
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.000]  and others are funding radical islam they know the borders are open they know
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.360]  they're letting obola in they know they're shutting down the power plants
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  they know they're shutting down the businesses and passing taxes to kill the
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.360]  country this is to bankrupt us under cloward and
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.800]  piven but it's beyond that and now they want to start a civil war
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  with obama at its head as the new lincoln
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.200]  now savage has been saying that for eight years
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.400]  they're now making all the preparations to do it his book is so timely
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.160]  it is the talking points of truth it could end up being one of the most
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.240]  important books of the modern era if people get it and get it out to others
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.280]  and if every talk show host covers these points because
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.960]  i've been living this i know this is accurate and it's finally on paper
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.400]  i never got obama deception too out i was too busy
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.120]  its subtitle was the coming second american civil war okay
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.640]  so thank god this got put out but from his
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.640]  gravitas perspective now i'm hyperventilating here sir because if
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.560]  people don't pay attention to this we're not going to save this country
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.480]  and and it's it's it's going to collapse in my view am i wrong am i right
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.800]  you've got the floor well people i want to start from the point of
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.400]  view of the doubters and the skeptics alex i always think about what the
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.560]  people listening to me who don't agree with us
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.640]  think some of them are intelligent obviously and they listen to us because
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.280]  they know we're super intelligent but they don't agree with us
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.880]  they think we're hysterics are alarmist so i would start by addressing those
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.960]  who say come on you're just trying to pedal a book
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.040]  what civil war well first of all obama declared a civil war the day he took
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.240]  office didn't he say he was going to transform america
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.920]  didn't he say he was a transformational president well he's done everything he
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.120]  said he was going to do but not entirely he's done it in six years a very good
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.880]  job for the globalists take a look at every
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.640]  aspect of this government and i don't mean just the government
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.560]  each chapter is interesting i rephrase before i published it to
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.400]  the war on the war on our borders language culture can anyone listening
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.560]  to alex's show right now say that they have not
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.920]  attack the borders our language in our culture how about the war in the u.s
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.920]  military the war on american medicine uh-huh i'll talk about ebola if you
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.400]  like your ebola you can keep your ebola if you're like your
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.720]  edd 68 virus in your child's school you can keep your edd 68
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.240]  it was brought in by the train load from central america this summer
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.200]  what i love most is i did a chapter of the war on civil rights
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.240]  obama poses as the great champion of civil rights
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.680]  oh really tell that to those targeted by the irs
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.920]  tell that to those being snooped on by the nsa what civil rights you mean for
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.800]  the rioters and the and the freeloaders and the grifters
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.840]  seems they have civil rights and the rest of us don't
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.480]  the war in our schools who could argue that our schools are better than they
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.880]  were before he took office the children are dumber than they've
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.000]  ever been we are now below that of i think nika
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.800]  ragua in in in learning i've never seen anything like it
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.120]  when i first moved to california i love the fact that i was a poor grad
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.960]  student that two children god bless him and i knew i could never afford the
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.120]  senate private school university california cal state
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.600]  public schools were at the top of the heap in the country you know where they
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.440]  are now about that of tijuana i wonder how that happened
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.040]  so whatever you look at whatever this person has touched in his radical left
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.200]  his band of not so mary pranksters has been decimated
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.600]  so he has declared a civil war in us alex it's not like oh there's gonna be a
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.280]  civil war there is a civil war but it's the type that you've been
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.920]  talking about for years the clovin the clovin hoof method
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.760]  i mean a clovis pivot method or whatever we've all known the little secret
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.800]  methods that they've used but call it the clovin hoof method
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.880]  you don't have to start a civil war the gun it's far more effective if you do it
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.800]  through brainwashing and you own the press uh and you own the media and there's
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.000]  a government media complex which we know exists
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.760]  all along alex i pray that there would be some godsend that would save us from
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.200]  this psychotic in the white house and his man
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.480]  his band of very very dangerous people you're going to think i'm a little
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.920]  weird here when i say that ebola may be the silver lining
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.120]  maybe that's going to awaken people to the fact that this man is not only
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.640]  incompetent but that his radical open borders agenda
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.040]  is going to kill all of us just maybe this could be a blessing
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.760]  what do you think of that idea i tend to agree with you there's now bumper
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.720]  stickers popping up everywhere we already had a t-shirt
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:11.200]  in the the pipe showing the obama symbol as the o in
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.680]  abola yep and the fact that they totally opened up the borders
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.920]  while they're taking our basic liberties with the nsa spying on the tea party
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.840]  the fact that they have homeland security saying their main threat is the tea party
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.840]  with no violence from the tea party i'm really concerned like you said a few
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.640]  years ago that they could pull a false flag
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.320]  and try to blame on a liberty movement thank you that's the whole book
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.760]  stop the coming civil war i warn the readers
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.640]  that they're going to provoke an insurrection with ajan provocateurs
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.920]  as a pretext for either martial law or seizing weapons
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.640]  or worse than that people say well it's only two more years left of mbs
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.320]  you actually think this guy's going to leave office in two years
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.640]  uh i'm not so sure by the way i used to disagree when people said he would stay
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.440]  but now i see they're going for broke we've never seen
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.520]  anything like this no i've never seen anything like it
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.040]  so you know alex look i'm i am trying to get people
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.400]  to read the book obviously i don't need to buy a new car
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.920]  i don't need to buy a new house i don't need a vacation in bokeh rattan
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.840]  i'm not looking to buy any more bling as you can see i have a lot of it on my
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.640]  hand you don't need to work 15 hours a day
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.280]  no no i i'm 72 years old alex i was a boy scout when i was a young kid who

[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.280]  doorknobs my father called the police at 11 o'clock
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.080]  because i got so into thinking i was a good american
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.120]  i forgot the time and i worked my little heart out
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.720]  every doorknob in queens new york i hung out the vote i thought i was doing
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.760]  some good you know what i'm saying but the fact that matters we're all doing
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.480]  some good and if you look at the headline on
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.840]  drudge party isolates prez for election
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.080]  even his own party recognizes how unpopular he is alex so
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.840]  what's going on are people awakening to him or what if the if you know alex i
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.640]  gotta tell you this in terms of raw numbers
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.240]  yesterday world that daily did an article on the book and it said 30 days to
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.080]  save america as the head and the leader was a good article on the book
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.520]  you know that it was linked on drudge they had 1.2 million hits as of this
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.800]  morning on that one article can you believe that in one day
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.320]  so how is this happening who's reading this facebook
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.400]  it was one of the leading stories yesterday well are they waking up or
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.680]  what was it just a joke to them i don't really know alex
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.200]  well they better wake up because they've got the military the military's never
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.800]  been more awake as you know because they're openly training them
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.080]  that even comes out in fox news not just your show or my show but i was sent the
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.200]  documents originally that quote the founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.840]  today's military uh... you better not be part of the tea
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.600]  party or an evangelical what country did we wake up in
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.960]  where they threatened to court marshal people if they're a christian
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.520]  i mean that is just communist china on steroids
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.880]  michael savage ones of second civil war a new book
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.480]  michael savage conservative radios ones of civil war
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.080]  some of the headlines on some of the smaller blogs conservative radio talk
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.960]  shows michael savage ones of coming civil war
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.360]  but ask yourself why i am not invited on fox news alex are you a guest on fox
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.360]  news no i don't know not not anymore i'm told i'm banned
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.680]  are you banned you're also banned well okay you're a band like i am uh... they
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.720]  ray banned you uh... i wonder what that's about
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.400]  couldn't be related to murdoch supporting hillary could it
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.600]  i know he does supporter and again what's wrong with him
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.960]  i mean there's gonna be no country of hillary gets in
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.400]  well i could answer that i pretty much know what's going on there look their
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.160]  licenses are owned by the federal government the fcc controls licensing
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.320]  you know that there's a big uh... you know is a big uh... tug-of-war going on
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.800]  they're saying you want to stay in business fine
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.120]  you want to buy radio stations in the same city on tv stations and newspapers
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.560]  okay then here's what we need it's a trade-off that's why i fear the government
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.120]  media complex alex in the sixties we were warned by the liberals because i was a
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.920]  kid in carlos and kid i was twenty years old
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.160]  that uh... the interlocking corporate directives were to be avoided that was
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.160]  the liberal credo of the time
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.520]  watch out for the interlocking corporate directives right
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.960]  well now you've got newspapers television us owners
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.000]  newspaper owners radio owners all in one city right
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.480]  how's that for interlocking corporate directives and the same directors sit on
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.960]  the boards of medical uh... device companies pharmaceutical companies
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.800]  universities so you've got a seamless corporate
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.080]  fascism that has emerged in america because of the
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:45.360]  conglomeration of all in one basket that's right but the classic
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.520]  napolean or hitler scenario where they got power over their own country they
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.960]  got power over their own system but they don't have power over the laws of
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.440]  nature and now they're so arrogant out in the
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:59.280]  open congress has a seven percent approval rating the military is
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.880]  awakening to the point of the chairman the joint chiefs goes to
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.320]  the senate arm services committee and admits that we're funding the radical
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.280]  islamicist the military brass i talked to are are are are are totally upset
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.000]  the police i talked to have never been more awake
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.280]  uh... so it's almost like a best of times worst of times
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:21.040]  tale of two cities there is the huge awakening happening
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.720]  but the corrupt crony capitalist that have teamed up with the socialist
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.840]  as their political team to control the population
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.320]  don't care and are just saying maria entoinette let them eat cake i mean she
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.600]  didn't really say that famously before the best deal got stormed
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.880]  but our political elite are saying let them eat cake
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.760]  as obama care bankrupts the country and uh... raises payroll taxes and has
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.080]  death panels all confirmed and then john bainer funds it
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.640]  why is john bainer still the speaker of the house
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.160]  what is wrong with the republican leadership don't they understand the
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.440]  socialist one thing once they get control are going to take everything
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.520]  they've got i don't i can't answer anything about
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.880]  republicans but you know you brought up the military that's a sore point for me
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.960]  because we can disagree on a lot of things but in an age of head cutting
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.560]  and radical islam i think everyone would agree that military
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.680]  national defense are key and yet i in the chapter on the war in the u.s.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.520]  military in my book i actually name the generals that he's purged
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.440]  he purged on the way stalin did except in a little different way remember when
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.960]  stalin sees power became a madman later on
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.040]  and he shot his generals people don't realize he shot he purged the soviet
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.600]  military of some of the greatest generals
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.400]  because he was afraid they would coup against him he killed thousands of
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.000]  officers hundreds of generals well obama's just firing them by threatening
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.400]  to take away their pension now why is he doing it
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.720]  because he recognized as anyone can see any student of history even amateur
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.640]  student history the one element of this government that could have stood up to
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.480]  this left-wing fanatical insane dictatorship was the military
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.240]  so right after Benghazi four generals were dismissed
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.480]  because they were ready to send the aid and defend the embassy
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.760]  save christ evens they were ready to testify to that effect
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.800]  he fired them including a general african-american general with 28 years of
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.000]  loyal service to this country he was dismissed not one word in the media
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.880]  over this alex i have their names ranks and serial
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.080]  numbers and stopped the coming civil war that was the beginning
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.120]  how many majors did we read he was purging eight thousand
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.720]  how many captors did we read he's purging and dismissing from the military
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.280]  thousands so what's left the cannon fodder the followers will follow the
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.560]  the four horse women of the apocalypse surrounding obama
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.720]  or worse yet the muslim sisterhood which seems to be advising him
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:45.440]  right inside the white house it is a twilight zone episode because i would
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.240]  hear you and others talk about the caliphate 10 years ago and just go
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.440]  give me a break right and then eight years ago when obama was running for
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.560]  office and now it's like the twilight zone this brother and his cousin
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.760]  fighting the muslim brotherhood in egypt why would our government want to
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.360]  overthrow our ally in egypt and put al-qaeda light in
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.280]  why would they want to topple Assad and put al-qaeda in
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:09.600]  why what is the master plan geopolitically from your view michael
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.040]  savage with russia and all of it and then i want to tie it into
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.720]  the hot civil war i get from your book and i agree we're in a civil war a
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.880]  culture war and it's heating up but they're pushing this flash point
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:25.840]  and i want to stop that we all want to stop it because nobody wins from a
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.200]  civil war look at syria how many years has been going on how many hundreds of
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.040]  thousand years how many cities are in ruin we don't want a civil war
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.400]  here's the scary part and i hate to use the word because i'm not into childish
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.240]  words one of obama's mentors was abraham lincoln isn't that
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.840]  correct oh yes okay well abraham lincoln was a
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.440]  wonderful man for some but a monster to others
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.800]  people don't even understand what of what lincoln did to us
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.200]  lincoln was not a humanitarian he was an opportunist who further divided a
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.040]  politically polarized country simply because he wanted to dominate the
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.240]  southern states economically he was no saint
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.000]  do you know this very few people know this about lincoln
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.520]  uh and this is very important because obama has said lincoln is one of his
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.240]  mentors under the rights that lincoln granted
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.120]  himself in the 1862 proclamation a stunning overreach of executive power
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.320]  abraham lincoln violated american civil rights with impunity
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:26.000]  he is estimated to have arrested and imprisoned some 20 000 civilians and
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.840]  detain them without trials that was 20 000 in the 18 members of congress
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.080]  yeah but you know that i know that and obama knows that
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.240]  now here's another one alex and it's all in stop the coming civil war
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.920]  lincoln kept southern prisoners of war in internment camps
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.760]  under deplorable conditions he may be on a penny
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:52.080]  on the old lincoln penny but at four delaware more than 2000 confederate
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.400]  soldiers died of scurvy and dysentery in a camp plague by philton vermin
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.560]  confederate prisoners in the union camp at rock island were reduced to eating
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.760]  rats and with their clothing and rags were unable to withstand the winter cold
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.440]  they were tortured by being hung by their thumbs now if that's not the action of
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.880]  a dictator i don't know what is and yet if you mention one word of this
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.480]  right away they say oh so you're in favor of slavery no that's not what i said
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.840]  i didn't say that at all what i said was is lincoln
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.040]  is one of obama's mentors god knows who else is it could be
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.040]  ho Chi Minh or mouth say tongue or feed el castro or you got chavez
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.320]  well we know it's all eliz key and now we have the hillary papers where she's
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.000]  worshiping him well you know people change in time
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.800]  let's hope that hillary uh with all of the money that they've made
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.080]  have become somewhat capitalistic and a little more greedy it's the only thing
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.920]  that could save us but i doubt it because leninists were always rich
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.120]  i mean they're not marxists people get it wrong as oh they're marxists no it's
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.520]  not marxism it's leninism it's much different
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.040]  it you know it's like a cousin as you well know but it's even beyond that i
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.760]  don't know what it is i sometimes think that it's not even marxism or
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.200]  leninism it's pure unadulterated mafia greed
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.560]  that's it it's mafia masquerading with a pseudo
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.040]  intellectual communist pantheon to fool a bunch of poor people into
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.760]  becoming slaves in a giant work camp period it's all about money
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.960]  do you know how much money is being made on these unaccompanied minors from
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.440]  central america we did you see that article
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.640]  that came out showing how much the baptist family services got from the
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.040]  family hundreds of millions and and each little democratic family
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.880]  per group of two illegals gets six to seven thousand a month
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.480]  so it's a giant mafia payoff bingo look at the money the fortunes that will be
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.360]  made on these children now let's go to ebola which is
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.560]  wakening people up because they're scared as i've said before
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.560]  um you know this is my field is is epidemics
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.240]  microbes do not discriminate here's the good news i say to my
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.960]  communist liberal hipster friends with scraggly
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.000]  beards the microbes don't know you're a good
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.520]  liberal who love you know all of the good things of the world
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.280]  they don't know if you're black white asian blah blah blah
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.880]  gay straight all i know is that you're a warm body and a good host
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.760]  and they like to proliferate inside warm bodies that are good hosts
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.960]  so when an epidemic starts to spread it will spread
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.240]  it'll go to liberals it'll go to this one that one
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.240]  they're waking up to that even common sense sometimes permeates the most
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.840]  drug-addled brain and perhaps just perhaps they'll come to
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.400]  understand that my message of borders language and culture
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.160]  was not just some crackpot right wing uh a jargon
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.320]  maybe there's a definition that has meaning why the hell did the nations
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.000]  created borders what an innate why did a nation define itself by borders let's
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.760]  start with the most obvious alex what is a border
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.280]  a border is made to keep certain people out isn't it
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.960]  yeah it's like having a door on your house i mean it's
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.880]  got a cell wall i compare it to every human cell has a cell
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.360]  wall right a membrane yes in a plant cell is surrounded by a
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.960]  thick cell membrane well once the integrity of the membrane is
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.040]  punctured the good's
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.960]  protoplasm oozes out and bad stuff oozes into the cell
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.800]  and the body gets sick and dies that's exactly what a border was created for
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.880]  keep out the bad protect those on this side
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.560]  it's a basic premise of survival that's right dr savage we gotta go to break
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.040]  we're gonna come back and again he's got a phd from the
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.600]  university of california at berkeley an epidemiology
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.040]  nutrition sciences and also in medical anthropology so he knows the history of
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.280]  diseases he has a phd in that folks so we're gonna
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.760]  hear from a real expert historically black plague you name it abola what he
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.280]  thinks is going on with abola and why my big question i want to get
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.800]  his take on this why would the government not stop the
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.680]  flights when everybody else is and be so obvious if there is an epidemic here
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.480]  how they're gonna get away with it we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:57.200]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:03.920]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:07.520]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.600]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.080]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.400]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.640]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.640]  well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.920]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.440]  allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.640]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.240]  order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can

[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:20.400]  it's alex jones
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:23.600]  well i've got to say it there are not a lot of originals
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:30.080]  out there in political talk radio uh the main pack kind of follows
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:36.160]  one mainline republican view but i've got to say trailblazing
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.920]  in the last 20 years are michael savage and alex jones michael savage was
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.920]  a lot bigger than i was before this show uh became a phenomenon it is right now
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.880]  and i quite frankly i was just talking about this during the break i'm not in
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.880]  competition with him he's not in competition with me
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.400]  kind of like he works with world net daily i plugged him every day
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.440]  or drudge or anybody else i just want to have a free country
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.280]  i don't want to see a civil war i've got a ranch in east texas we've had since
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:04.000]  1829 that we got mexican land grant on uh i just want to live in a free country
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.920]  and raise my three children just like michael savage has kids and grandkids
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.840]  i mean there comes a time when you just can't go along with the system
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.360]  now michael and i can clearly say i've never done that but all these other
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.400]  talk show hosts and all these other republicans and
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.120]  and democrats and people and michael was just saying about something like a
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.080]  bola doesn't care what color you are where you're from or
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.160]  what your sexual preference is or or what race you are
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:32.160]  the government's gone insane now their plan is wreck the country like
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.360]  old-fashioned wreckers and go loot the ship but
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.240]  most folks won't know what a wrecker is it's not something that comes and picks
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.440]  your car up when it's parked in the wrong space but but that's the vulture
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.960]  mentality of the political class look at this
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:54.160]  news story right here out of k-i-r-o-t-v cdc not taking extra abola precautions
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.200]  at c-tac airport uh they are flying in dozens of people every
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.320]  few weeks it's over 25 people that have abola
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:06.400]  someone they brought into spain has now spread abola at the hospital
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.160]  and people are getting it the abola patient in dalis died
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.600]  they didn't even quarantine the family for days they didn't clean the ambulance
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.760]  for days they are violating the default positions
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.840]  now that's a civil war against america when france and england and the saudi
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.000]  arabia have banned flights a month and a half ago
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.320]  we don't ban them the cdc comes out and says banning them would make it worse
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.760]  that's like saying you know winning the lottery would make you lose money it's
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.920]  just it's just total asinine two plus two equals five
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.680]  stop the coming civil war my savage truth michael savage the new book available
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.320]  now in bookstores uh and of course on amazon and at world net daily and
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.840]  everywhere else michael savage dot com and i don't have stock in the book folks
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.640]  this is what i've been hammering he hits a lot of
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.400]  angles i don't hit hits a lot of angles we do this is great to give people out
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.760]  there and say hey love your kids now's the time and i want to get
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.680]  specifically into where he sees the civil war going if we don't stop it
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.960]  things we can do to turn this around but dr savage
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.920]  he was starting to get into the epidemiology of this clearly mutated
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.160]  incubating 21 days able to spread longer you've got multiple degrees in
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:26.400]  medical anthropology so the history of diseases and their spread
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.440]  degrees in nutrition sciences degrees in medical botany which is a medical
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.840]  degree uh for people to understand you're a key
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.760]  expert to speak on ebola break down ebola and then expand
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.440]  how you see things unfolding you envisioned it decades ago
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.040]  you've been very accurate with the lay of the land totally open borders
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.960]  open trees and ten ices fighters crossing the border congressman
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.160]  hunter learn from homeland security total stand down i want the big picture
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:00.160]  what you think the criminals at pennsylvania avenue are planning but
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.160]  but first ebola well i called him president
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.720]  obola two weeks ago i thought that cute little phrase might stick
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.720]  i'm glad to see the ebola uh bumper stickers in la with the o in the middle
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.440]  but that that's not going to get us what we want to go
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.360]  this is going to be possibly the lifesaver for america
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:23.440]  there's a clamoring coming up from the people they're screaming what the hell
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.640]  are they doing when i saw that friedkin from
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.320]  cdc speaking saying don't worry we're in control i was screaming
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.000]  i know where friedkin came from i know who put him in
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.600]  here's the part that kills me not one person in the medical establishment
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.680]  speaking out about ebola in the proper manner nor about the ed 68 virus
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.200]  from central america which is now raging through our schools
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.160]  think about this alex you would think that several doctors mph
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.880]  epidemiologists docs would say wait a minute we know where the virus comes
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.960]  from with uh the ed 68 it's endemic in central america
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.160]  we can prove it just look at the dna of the virus
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.440]  no one says a word we're living in the ex-soviet union in the 1950s
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.200]  when there was a government and then there was no medical establishment in
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.480]  fact during the fifties there was a thing called the lysenko affair i don't
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.000]  know if anyone remembers that i do yeah it was
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.560]  false science put out by the government and if anyone said otherwise even though
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.080]  scientists knew it was all both you know what they would dismiss from the
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.360]  universities are put into that they were saying you soak the wheat in the water
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.400]  and it makes it grow better and all this other crazy stuff that killed tens of
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.520]  millions okay we now have a government scientific
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.520]  medical complex whatever the four horse women of the
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.440]  apocalypse say in the white house the little parrots like
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.440]  friedkin and fouchy at the NIH repeat like little parrots
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.800]  we don't have any scientists left in this country
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.320]  their government's like global warming they say no one disagrees that global
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.920]  warming is real pay al gore money even though it's a total fraud on record
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:03.520]  well okay that's one thing we know that's just a scam for money for the for
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.880]  the for the grifters but now the ebola this is no no
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.760]  longer just just greed this is going to kill people
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.600]  why have they not stopped flights as i keep saying and this is the simplest
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.440]  point i can make to the doubting thomas that's out there
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.200]  african dictators and nations around the ebola plague nations don't permit them
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.840]  to travel to their countries ipso facto third world african
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.040]  dictators have more common sense than barack ebola
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.280]  how is that possible why is he not being forced to ban flights
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.520]  how can we keep hearing this crap about it'll cause an insurrection
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.600]  in Liberia what's at its heart well i mean you know psychology i want your
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.720]  take why are they trying to be over the top to
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.840]  break our will to just exercise raw power
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.920]  why is it so naked when it discredits them the optics destroy them
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.240]  they don't care i think that many of them are drug
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.760]  to be frank with you i look at them and i watch them speak i read them
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.920]  i look at their faces and i watch their mouths there's a disconnect from reality
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.560]  do look like mental patients they are mentally ill
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.320]  well i wrote a book in 2005 called liberalism is a mental disorder it
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.080]  wasn't written in jest because many people say well why would they do this i
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.640]  said well take this formula and and plug it in
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.440]  liberalism is a mental disorder it applies alex
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.280]  i think they're crazy they're drug they're on medication they're like
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.640]  on antidepressants and they don't know what the hell they're talking about
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.040]  they're like robots they're robotic let's go back a few weeks
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.560]  remember the uh fence jumper at the white house it got all the way into the
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.520]  white house how they lied to us about that yes
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.680]  what was that alex i'm sure you covered it in detail
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.600]  it was that how is that related to what we're talking about if at all alex
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.560]  what was that what's your take on it i'm sorry i think that there was an attempt
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.080]  by uh elements within this government to send the warning into the white house
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.880]  that's what i'm getting from uh the military and others is they really
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.160]  realize they're bringing the whole country down right now and this
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.440]  there is a major power struggle internally well i don't know if that's
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.520]  the reason or some caller said mike you have it backwards
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.160]  this was a false flag event to permit the white house to demand the bigger
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.680]  security barrier around the white house burning a cordon sanitaire that's two
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.640]  blocks wide so i kept saying wait a minute
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.240]  two years ago an ono on black woman with a baby in the back was at as
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.240]  executed by the secret service and the park police remember that incident
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.680]  yeah she got lost she was driving around she wasn't anywhere near the white
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.560]  house and they whacked her in the car with a few
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.720]  slaughter bullets with a baby in the back
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.600]  not only were they not indicted they were given commendations for their
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.520]  bravery how come she was executed the fence jumper wasn't even attacked by a
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.680]  police dog what's that about it does look staged
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.040]  okay so it's staged one way or the other take your pick right
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.440]  staged to send a message saying hey excuse me
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.800]  or to tell us he needs a bigger cordon sanitaire
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.560]  sort of like let us say urague a paraguay with tanks on the white house
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:13.840]  lawn maybe i made you digress get back into abola
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.920]  and and how serious you think it is and how could they
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.800]  try to get away with this because either way they've ordered to stand down they've
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.880]  ordered to stand down on default medical procedures cdc law policy
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.120]  what's happening okay well your your question
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.240]  implies that they wanted to spread but i don't think that's the reason
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.040]  i believe it goes back to the doxies and the agenda of the radical left which is
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.160]  open borders open borders open borders it's a religion to them alex and as you
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.040]  well know religious fanatics will keep repeating the doxies of their religion
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.880]  no matter what's going on around them so the doxies keep the borders open keep the
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.320]  borders open good for america good for the economy keep the borders open
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.960]  the minute they would close flights or or suspend flights from liberia and other
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.520]  uh play that would reaffirm common sense and then that would be the beginning
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.560]  of the end of their religion that's right then the religion would have to say
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.600]  wait a minute if you're closing that why don't you close the border to mexico
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.200]  see this so they can't afford to reverse any agenda item that's part of their
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.360]  strategy never ever relent not for one second
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.120]  even if people are dying around i agree with you that's why the cdc said
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.240]  we can't close the border the cdc chief should be arrested that
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:34.320]  see he gets me enraged i know who put him in power i know why he was put in power
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:37.680]  it was to prevent quarantine during the aides epidemic
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:41.840]  they put uh friendly people in every public health department across the
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.600]  united states you look around you'll see what i'm talking about
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.680]  and that was to prevent quarantine during the early days of the aides epidemic
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.280]  and they've never ever changed their protocols on any disease
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.240]  and now we see we have Ebola coming in which is far more devastating
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.680]  than AIDS in terms of its it kills quicker okay
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.520]  let's be clear and yet there's no no nothing to be put in place here
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.280]  and obama's speeches that everything's in charge we know what we're doing we got
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:12.560]  medical nonsense but it's this is just the beginning alec they
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.920]  sent three to five thousand troops to africa now why would they knowingly
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.920]  put our men and women at risk and the military brass said it won't even do
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.400]  anything it's just like sponges to go soak up Ebola
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.680]  take a look at the military brass he purged all those in the military you
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.960]  might have stood up to him so now you've got yes men who look like ushers in a
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.200]  movie theater but i mean don't they they do
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.360]  and what i love most is this clown panetta who decimated the military
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.640]  was one of the worst hatchet men in the history of the u.s military
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.400]  the worst man for national security ever now is putting out a book making
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.000]  believe that he's opposing obama in some way
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.760]  and by the way alex this is acute every bookstore has like a thousand copies of
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.520]  his book and 20 of mine my book was cleaned out the first
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.200]  day yesterday his books are still sitting there in stacks
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.960]  and yet everywhere you turn there's panetta on all riley there's panetta
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:11.120]  u.s a today we're savage never heard of him who's he well that's because they
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.400]  don't want real folk heroes or real independent journalists or real
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.600]  independent firebrands to rally the people out of this
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.720]  so they block i mean that's the seal of anybody who's really good
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.560]  is they block them notice pierce morgan was on fox for 10 minutes today
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.000]  thrilling obama under the bus what does that signify that the even the red coat
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  worshiper of obama is now leaving the sinking ship
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.960]  what does it tell you that the idiots at fox would rather have a man who was
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.080]  thrown off television because of poor ratings than someone who
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.720]  can tell the truth about ebola ed 68 the decimation of a military
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.440]  the plans for another civil war to seize our guns
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.800]  what does it tell you it's all the government media complex alex
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.160]  we're both voices in the wilderness here it doesn't mean we're not going to win
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.400]  by the way oh yeah because our audience is that's another thing we talk about fox
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.560]  average show about two and a half million listeners
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.440]  msnbc now average show about 300 000 cnn average show about 300 000 that's joke
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.400]  level i mean one of your big affiliates and like
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.600]  new york city or something's got hundreds of thousands an hour some of
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.000]  our big affiliates have 60 70 000 hour rated shown known
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.200]  you know instant ratings on their radios we know
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.240]  i've got three million a day you got six seven eight million a day
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:27.680]  i get 10 15 million youtube views a week but but still it's like a facade
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.040]  that there's the big mainstream media they've got all the answers
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.360]  they're the big man behind the curtain the wonderful Oz
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.960]  well we understand the powers that be and what's involved here you know we're
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.680]  bucking the system with the salmon swimming upstream
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.560]  to spawn the truth to use a crude analogy and uh let's just hope that when we
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.560]  finally do spawn we don't we don't die in the title
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.920]  exactly i don't be eaten by kodiak now shift yours back to what you just said
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:55.680]  because that's the part of the book i'm getting to
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.520]  the hot war the hot civil war to brand the patriots
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.960]  as the terrorists to get the shooting war going to take the guns
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.480]  get into that i mean i know it's in the book but but break down your real fear
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.520]  of where they may want to take us well i think you just said it alex
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:12.720]  here's the thing how do you stop them is the question
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.960]  what is the point of a person reading a book like stop the coming civil war
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.000]  i keep saying and i you probably disagree with me entirely
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.680]  the election coming up in november is key to the salvation of the nation let me
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.720]  explain i agree with you okay because many people say well
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:30.640]  wait a minute you're saying let the republicans take back the senate and
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:33.280]  what you're gonna have baner now in charge yes
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.160]  let me explain why here's my theory the democrats socialist islamist party
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.960]  which is what i called called democrats now dsi
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.400]  democrats socialist islamist party usa is a closed shop it's a mafia you cannot
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.960]  reach them nobody can reach reed or polosi or it's a cult we have a chance
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.360]  in the republicans because they're weaker
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.120]  see that's my theory the republicans are weaker and more frightful and
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.040]  once they are given the power again by we the people
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.320]  they're gonna have hell to pay if they don't do what we want with regard to
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.640]  borders language and culture sealing the borders rebuilding the military
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.760]  recreating national security getting rid of the devils that were put into every
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.080]  agency in the country and we're gonna lobby them through town hall meetings
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.640]  and we're going to reach them alex because they're reachable they're going
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.880]  to be reachable we're going to make them reachable that's my theory alex
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.800]  well certainly once the democrats aren't in control the justice department
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.160]  they can't be blackmailing or harassing people anymore
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:35.040]  so we can give the libertarian movement the constitutional movement a chance
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.280]  which is why you see democrats and republicans
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:40.960]  at the top organized together against the real tea party
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.280]  not that it's perfect but that it's one of our only shots non-violently
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.360]  that's right it's the only shot we have non-violently that's correct
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.560]  that's all we've got is this not this election in november
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.840]  so in world at daily headline the article 30 days to save america i was
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.920]  quite impressed because they actually broke it down
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.800]  that is what i'm saying it stopped the coming coming civil war
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.240]  so if people talk to someone in their family you know in every family there's
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.840]  a liberal and a conservative and a libertarian right
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.680]  get that one person in the family to swing their vote over to the r side
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.160]  explain why and just talk about ebola just talk about national security
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.840]  talk about the purging of the generals but here's a shocking fact
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.680]  that is on page i think you know you're not going to believe me
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.480]  do you know how many people have been killed who were ready to testify in
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:33.600]  Benghazi how many 15 wow 15 i i don't know how i dug
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.800]  this one up i'm almost afraid to read it on the air i'm
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.160]  you know this marxist uh lennonist culture that we're talking about
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.480]  it's on page 71 can i read you the paragraph
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.720]  on january 2014 the u.s senate select committee on intelligence released his
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:51.600]  bipartisan report on the Benghazi terrorist attacks
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.720]  it contained information so shocking i can't believe it hasn't been the focus
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.640]  of an investigation the report said that as many as 15 people
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.480]  supporting the investigation or otherwise helpful to the united
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.360]  states have been killed in Benghazi since the september 11th
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.360]  2011 attacks reference number 30 15 people who helped us in
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:15.120]  Benghazi have been killed since then so how could that be are we not to
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.880]  believe that their identities were not leaked into the hands of jihadists
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.840]  overseas because they helped us could it not be that the purging of our own
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:28.160]  seasoned military commanders may go well beyond what happened in Benghazi
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.880]  now i believe that there's still a contingent in the u.s military that
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:34.640]  wants to see president obama ousted you believe that too don't you
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:39.680]  yes well he's continuing his purge of the u.s military

[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.920]  yes i have a question for the military uh uh do
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.560]  do any of the leaders in the military understand what he's done to this country
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.400]  do they understand what hegel bagel has done to the military
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.440]  do they understand that there's no real war against isis
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.440]  how many times have we seen that clown who looks like an usher come out from
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:35.040]  the defense department to tell us that
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:39.280]  today we destroyed two trucks so let's say cost us 35 million dollars
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.800]  and and these incredible pilots to blow up two toyota trucks with three
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:46.400]  rag heads in it why are they not blowing up any of the m1a
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.920]  sherman sorry the sorry the averams tanks that were stolen from the iraqi
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.200]  military when those cowards in the iraqi military threw down their weapons
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.440]  and abandoned their bases they took our averams tanks remember isis
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.880]  did have you yet seen one averams tank blown up
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:07.120]  no why because this entire war against isis is a sham
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.800]  it's a pretext for invading syria taking down our sod
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.800]  and leading to the whole sale slaughter of christians and other alawites
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.240]  in syria we're about to see another holocaust occur
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.720]  why is this allowed to go on how can the west permit this
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.720]  because there is no west anymore there is no west the leadership has been
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:32.080]  compromised taken over i'm actually begging those in the
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.760]  military who know what's going on to speak out
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.920]  long before they're retired and suddenly grow a pair of uh you know what
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.680]  i love all these retired generals who were sudden
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.160]  what do you say regular guests on fox and cnn telling us all of the bad things
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:51.520]  that happened when they were generals the trick is to speak out why you are a
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.840]  general not after you're you know retired this is it we have no time left
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:59.520]  we're not surviving two more years of ebola it's impossible
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.320]  and i say that from a statistical point of view
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.520]  look at what he's done in these six years now follow the arcade years
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.480]  it's metastasizing it's geometrically progressing he's accelerating
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.240]  it is it's not going to be just two more years of this mild socialist
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:21.200]  uh lennon is you know slow movement it's going to escalate a ratchet up he wants
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.600]  it he wants an insurrection he wants a pretext
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.200]  he wants his crystal not he wants to take the guns
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.600]  he wants to arrest people he wants to detain people for their own safety
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.840]  he wants to do all the things that we've feared at our worst
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:41.680]  and i'm terrified that he might use ebola as a pretext
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.880]  rather than being impeached for this for for bringing it in letting it come in
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:51.280]  he's likely use it to gain even more power that's my worst fear uh alex
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.800]  that's why i wrote stop the coming civil war he's been signing executive orders
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:59.440]  for open martial law uh can he get away with it though
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:02.960]  they let a bowl of spread and then use that to grab power
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.520]  sure he can who's gonna stop him john bainer the new york times
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:10.800]  that's what i'm worried about it is the yes men attitude that's allowing this
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.200]  evil to take over i don't know i think the west
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:19.280]  is paralyzed drug i think it's just drug to death
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.120]  i look around i see drugs everywhere i see i look at the congress they look

[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.440]  phones up on any topic any issue will be interspersing breaking news another
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:37.520]  economic news i haven't gotten to and some second amendment news in this hour
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:42.160]  toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.200]  the phones are loaded but when you hear a caller hang up that's your chance to get
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:48.640]  in and on the air now i'd said earlier i was just
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.600]  taking calls on obola a lot of these callers have been holding to talk about
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.320]  that we'll get to those now you can talk about anything you want
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:00.320]  but oliver ed john joseph and so many others were going to go to all of you
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:04.000]  now i told ed to get on hold because he called in not about obola when i said
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.480]  it was only obola calls but about uh getting liberty back on track
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:11.120]  so i'm going to go back to him now to make his point and we'll go to oliver
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.080]  john joseph and others go ahead ed
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:18.560]  hi thank you for holding me i uh didn't talk about obola because i don't get
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:23.200]  the watch it's okay brother you're on air it's awesome you're on air go ahead
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.520]  all right uh on obola i believe wholeheartedly that it is a false flag
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:33.600]  because they keep leaving all their most absolute basic protocols
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.560]  you know wide wide open you know let's just let them in here
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.320]  and uh yeah it's just it's not going to be good
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:45.760]  all right but i do believe that they're they're uh
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:50.000]  they've got it with uh what's the word uh a higher survivability rate if you
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.280]  look at africa it would appear based off the number they got it and died
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.720]  you know that it's actually better than a 90 percent
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.720]  uh uh survivability that's fine and but back to your point about getting
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.560]  uh liberty back on track go ahead what were your four points uh first
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:10.160]  federalize the government uh federalize the fed
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.080]  actually federalize it yep we need to privatize the board of education because
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.040]  i believe that education is most basic without education we can't see
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:22.160]  through the current i get privatizing it the problem is the globalists are
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.960]  already waiting to privatize it themselves as the answer to what they
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.880]  did to education but go ahead oh that's just not good
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.320]  okay and then obviously we have to abolish the ndaa
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:37.120]  and obama care yes obama care is meant to kill our economy that's why it's all in
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.880]  the news today that our economy is an absolute shambles that was the plan
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.800]  good to hear from you oliver in texas you're on the air

[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.840]  was not a good place to be and um you do great work

[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.640]  so i'm close to the winner it is you know yes i'm right next door to it but
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:26.800]  i'm close and any other politician or president
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:32.320]  would take this as an opportunity with all the money that they have
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.240]  which is not their money it's our money but they would
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.480]  they would bankroll everything to make them look good
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.520]  he's doing exactly the opposite and letting us whole party turn against him
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.000]  yeah what's behind that he has a job bring down the country
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.680]  exactly it's like you know he has a 19 percent or 11 percent approval rate
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.240]  it's like you could boost it to 50 percent immediately
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:05.840]  immediately what do you think's behind it what do you think's behind it
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.440]  it's kind of scary because there is no sense behind it
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.360]  exactly he wanted to spread because a normal
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:18.640]  and i hate politicians as much as you do probably
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.000]  uh a normal politician would take this opportunity
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  to make himself look good but he's not doing that
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.160]  he's doing the exact opposite all he has to do
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:35.600]  is do crazy stuff exactly and that tells you they are out of control
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:38.480]  and it shows they got something even bigger planned that's so horrible this
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:41.760]  won't even matter they are they're an enemy trying to
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.720]  bring the country down i just keep explaining that because they

[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:24.960]  kissing a woman is sexual assault that was in the news today that the
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:28.240]  famous photo of the sailor kissing the nurse getting off the ship
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:33.200]  after victory against japan they're now saying that's rape
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.680]  now they teach on the colleges sex period by a male is rape men are inherently
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.920]  evil
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:45.200]  no humans have been inherently predators ladies and gentlemen
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:48.240]  and women can be predators as well but sex between a man and a woman is a
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.440]  beautiful thing when it's concerning and i know that sounds like a conspiracy
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.280]  theory but you're right two plus two equals five and
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:02.400]  rachel madow she uh she she sets all the parameters she says it's bad so it is
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.000]  we're not in a cult or anything here where we're a man kissing a woman's evil
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.760]  we're a man taking a woman who wants it is evil
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.400]  i mean let me tell you that's what women are looking for there's all these guys
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.520]  raised by the liberal trendiness system and maybe they got a girlfriend that
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.920]  keeps them like a pet that that pats them on the head like their pet cat or dog
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.440]  but they always get rid of them let me tell you men what women want
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.720]  they want a confident smart informed involved man
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.440]  even if they don't know it who will conquer them
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:36.560]  that's what women want they want to be conquered
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.080]  not in a bad way truth is when you conquer them they conquer you
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.280]  the species isn't complete without the man and the woman i absolutely love
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.600]  women want them to succeed i'm not in competition with women
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:50.720]  i know what women want though even if this culture hasn't taught women what
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:56.640]  they want so they're at historic all-time unsatisfied unhappy
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.240]  especially by the time they hit 45 they chase that whole

[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:13.280]  i never gave it to one of the writers we go in there it's from sunday
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.280]  or maybe saturday when i had it sent to my email from one of my friends that had
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:22.400]  it yoga studios all over austin
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:26.480]  aren't allowed they tell people don't dress like
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:30.560]  indian stuff and we probably can't sell indian stuff in our gift shops
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:34.720]  and we can't have india parties
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.320]  that's like saying if somebody's into karate and they want to wear a you know
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:43.200]  karate outfit you're anti-japanese it's that mentally ill where i heard the
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.520]  two guys a few years ago at martin springs
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:49.760]  three guys but they go let's go get chinese food
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.600]  two were hispanic one was white and one of the hispanic ones goes man don't say
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.960]  that it's racist and they weren't joking oh the words words are racist
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:05.200]  talking is racist see you eat the school lunch the government says
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:08.640]  you follow what they do you you only say what they say whatever the new
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.240]  propaganda is then you're safe
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:17.120]  but you don't dress like a geisha girl or a cowboy or an indian or an eskimo
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.240]  because at this one yoga studio when they mentioned the email
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:25.440]  someone came to the party last year at halloween dressed as an eskimo
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.320]  and people thought that was racist really i mean i dressed like a pirate i
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.240]  dressed like uh you know i could dress like kim jong-un it's not against

[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.480]  demonized and put into guilt and do what they say
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.640]  never put that article on screen about victory over japan man kissing woman

[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:40.560]  he was a racist see this is all about the real
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:45.200]  collectivism the real discrimination the globalist taking over our society

[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:33.840]  but the reason that i'm calling you today alex is that you know i was
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:39.200]  listening to uh the george maury coast to coast uh this was monday night
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:44.080]  another great guy uh excuse me another great guy oh yes well
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:50.240]  i think i'm on his show next week exactly but but anyway he had uh he had
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:55.920]  uh he had quoted uh let me see i wrote it down here uh israeli source
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:59.600]  that said that this guy duncan from uh you know from texas had died
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:02.480]  yeah that is really sourced might have been right they probably covered it up
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:05.760]  i told my reporters not to go with that even though it was a real israeli
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:10.720]  newspaper we killed that story yesterday morning
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.840]  and then sure enough they say he died today you know what i bet he died
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.800]  yesterday i bet they are covering up we exactly right and uh well you know what
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:21.680]  you know mr maury you know he couldn't uh you know he couldn't confirm it or
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.080]  anything like that but uh you know i found it and i found it strange that uh
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:30.080]  you know that yesterday i don't know if it was his brother or somebody
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.760]  uh you know they said that he had a high fever but he was on dialysis and
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:36.560]  everything like that everything seemed to be okay
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:39.920]  but you know what i don't trust these people you know and
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:43.680]  uh you know uh we don't even know the bowl is really spreading it could be a
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:46.960]  stimulant but we know it's in we know it's in africa
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.960]  why would they bring people in who have it to spread it in hospitals it's now
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:54.080]  spread in spain out of somebody they brought in the country
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.360]  exactly what i said a month and a half ago what happened and the national media
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.920]  said i was what a fearmonger because when you say two plus two equals four
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.480]  you are a fearmonger when you say raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt

[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.360]  uh you know except for the winter that's why people get so sick during the
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:13.680]  winter but i hear you and god bless you and i
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:17.520]  appreciate your call that's why they want us poor
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:20.720]  that's why they want us under their control that's why they want obama
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:23.840]  care to shut down the economy well they want the troops on these secret
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:27.520]  death panels they want us poor domesticate under their control
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.360]  that's why we're trying to promote free market and wealth
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:36.080]  but our political engines being blown allen in new hampshire you're on the
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:39.520]  air uh yeah i was actually initially calling
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.440]  to report on the uh Ebola patient dying in in texas uh we are continually
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:48.960]  being lied to uh and they contradict their story
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:54.080]  they produce confusion and it just keeps going and going and going
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:59.680]  uh it's obviously a sigh up in my view but what is the larger goal
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:03.440]  right well how do we how do we change this uh the
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.680]  they grow and leap some bounds and we only make moves in
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:12.400]  inches and centimeters it doesn't seem that anything that we the people do
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.560]  has an effect on the establishment and i just i'm
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:19.840]  i feel lost sometimes
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.520]  i'm sorry my audio is cutting out what'd you say i said i said they grow and
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:30.320]  leaps and bounds on a daily basis and uh our progress as the people
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:34.800]  uh you know we we we stymie them here and there but
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.120]  we don't seem to make any progress towards the american culture of freedom
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:43.040]  that's because it's very hard to beat the the fog of war and the globalist right
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:45.920]  about this all the time where they create so much confusion such a dumb
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.120]  down society that then they can win because
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:52.240]  they control the government and we're all in shambles
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:55.600]  and that's what they've done but but once people are aware of that
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.120]  and know that the central government is totally run by psychopathic control
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.400]  freaks literal might as well be aliens here to kill us
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:05.600]  i mean they're that bad i mean they're not technically but
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.440]  demons from hell possessing people whatever you want to call it
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:13.440]  it's cognitive dissonance why did dozens of women get in the car with Ted
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:16.160]  Bundy because he wore nice little gray suits
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:19.920]  and little brown loafers and he had a nice clean cut haircut and he drove a
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:23.360]  yellow Volkswagen and he would talk to him a little soft
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:29.040]  npr voice kind of like senator harry reid and he'd say hi you
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:32.320]  want to go get a coke or something see a movie
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:35.920]  want to have fun and then decoys a non-threatening guy
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:39.360]  i'm going to get in the car with him and then he'd reach over and put handcuffs
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:41.520]  on him punch him in the nose put a gun to their head
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:44.560]  and say keep quiet you're going to be safe now they had knocked their heads of the
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:47.200]  window fought and bidding they had thrown him out
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:50.800]  he did that with a couple women the ones that fought live the others got taken
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:53.840]  to basements tied down and tortured for months
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:57.520]  he loved torturing and sucking their soul out and that's what the globalists do
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:00.800]  okay they're going to suck our soul and they've got us they've almost got us
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:05.840]  came down with homeland security now and the and the real fun can start
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:10.640]  and that's what it's all about just trendy little short beard and curly
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:16.080]  hair and a sweater oh hi oh i'm non-threatening
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.840]  don't like the men that are big and open and have loud voices
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:23.840]  you know like me the trending the the obama yeah
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.440]  i'm gonna take real good care of you i appreciate your call alan
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:30.960]  rick in canada you're on the air
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.800]  is this the wildly popular conspiracy theorist alex jones
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.680]  i guess i mean i think two plus two equals four and that's the definition
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.520]  of conspiracy theory yeah i have my own views that you're and i have a memory
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:48.800]  and i am i am bad yes in that case i've got the right guy
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:54.480]  alex from a third observer uh being up here in canada i've been
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:57.600]  listening to your show now for about six months
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:04.160]  um quite impressed with it and it just seems to me that basically america
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:11.760]  like almost like the entire country is run like a corporation
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:15.680]  and that the people are being literally managed
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:21.200]  yes but but but managed towards a destructive end as a human resource
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:25.280]  i think you know basically your your guess was right
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:30.320]  once marshal law is declared and like it'll probably take close to a year and
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:33.680]  a half for it to get to the point where it is
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:37.680]  and all like it'll just be a soft marshal law we're already in a civil war
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:41.200]  we have pundits and and all their minions in the counties and cities and
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:44.240]  states and public schools and colleges saying
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.600]  don't dress up like a cowboy or a native indian
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:51.520]  native american in an event don't dress as a geisha girl don't
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:56.480]  don't have october fest don't kiss girls i mean they're a bunch of crazy
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:01.040]  control freaks and we follow their orders so no wonder we're in so much
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:06.160]  trouble exactly and i mean but honestly i don't
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:10.960]  know what yous can do really um well the little
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:15.280]  the brainwashing we are we're under is globally standardized
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:18.640]  okay it's globally standardized so whatever we're under
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:21.600]  you've got your own version there i mean hell they don't let preachers read out
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:23.920]  of the bible stuff they say is you know hurtful
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:27.840]  in canada they arrest preachers up there if you uh i don't agree with this
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:30.480]  because hitler did kill a bunch of people and did target jews but
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:33.360]  if you go up to canada and disagree with how people got killed in the holocaust
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:36.560]  when real historians disagree all over the map there's a lot of millions of
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:41.040]  people the point is you can debate it they arrest you and then deport you to
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.000]  germany where they put you in jail i mean that's not freedom
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.840]  and the next it's oh you can't deny global warming see people say oh well
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:53.120]  well ban defending hitler but don't ban saying global warming isn't real you
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:56.880]  can't have both what was your point about michael savage brother
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:01.360]  i think he's absolutely right that um you know i i don't think obama is going
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:04.640]  to leave office once marshal law is declared
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:11.120]  that's you know that's the blueprint to um but basically make the north american
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.200]  union and they just keep right on progressing but they're
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.640]  that's right that's right we can't have a border because it's gone
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:22.720]  except for citizens it's a internal checkpoint on record
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:26.160]  for currency and capital controls and to not let us get out
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:30.480]  it's not there anymore god bless you same thing for your canadian border
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:33.280]  george norie god blessing he's want me to come to canada when he does big shows
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:36.240]  up in toronto that sell out to thousands and other stuff and i'm gonna go to
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:38.640]  some of his shows and hang out because i want to go to some of his good friend
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:40.560]  of mine but i don't think when i try to go up to
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:44.480]  canada one of his shows they'll let me in and canada is a beautiful country but
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:48.480]  man i mean you thought hitler had landed whenever i go up there i mean
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.480]  they arrest me they throw me in a jail cell they scream at me for 16 hours
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:56.480]  um it's not fun and meanwhile i'm sitting there looking
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:59.840]  out the jail cell it's just illegals just pour through and i'm in canada
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.160]  i mean just you know it's a joke uh dean in north carolina dean you're on the
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.880]  air hi i think we should uh establish the first
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:12.000]  great wall of the u.s you know like china had a great wall put it right down
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.120]  there at the mexican border because that i think would help stem the tide of
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:19.840]  illegals first of all and stop the scare of uh south america trying to come up
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:22.880]  through that border too well if they didn't give illegals free
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:26.320]  welfare and and then they would all end and then the
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:29.600]  top of illegals we'd have are the ones we want
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:34.320]  yeah i mean i mean you incentivize have babies free get everything free
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.800]  uh then you incentivize the the the worst dregs of anywhere in the world to
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.680]  come here uh despite all the freebies so many of
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:44.400]  these people are hardworking and and want their own business
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:47.840]  that they won't take the welfare so there are a lot of good people
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:52.400]  uh from the immigrant pools that are fleeing the hell of latin america
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:55.280]  so that's why this is a sad thing is there's actually a lot of great people
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:57.840]  coming up here the problem is the democratic party
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:01.440]  and the republicans they want your handicapped you want to come have five
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:04.640]  kids you never had a job in your life you weigh 500
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.880]  pounds and weigh and wear sixx underwear literally we
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:12.480]  want you that's just incredible isn't it i just
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:17.120]  want to say one last point that i am upset because you know i'm only in my
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:20.320]  early 20s what have i done to deserve any of this and now
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:25.040]  because of the decadent ways of those uh those younger generations of the ones
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.680]  who fought in world war one and world war two and such
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.280]  have let the government take control to the point where
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:34.880]  you know now my daughter is in danger well they call it the greatest
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.920]  generation of my grandfathers and grandmothers are and we're wonderful
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:41.440]  people one i'm still alive though she's had a really rough couple weeks let me
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:48.320]  tell you um it it just um
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.920]  in a lot of ways they were better than us and more moral because i've looked at it
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:55.200]  but in other ways they were gullible because they kind of the greatest
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.840]  generation were the ones that forgot what their parents and grandparents
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:00.480]  taught them that you don't trust the government you don't keep your money in
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.400]  a bank and you don't go into debt and you and you only work with
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:07.520]  people that absolutely are trusted i mean in the

[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:22.480]  you're not going to work anymore in the town and then the next step is you're
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:25.840]  going to fall down and hit your head
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:30.400]  and i was reading history books and stuff about my ancestors that are all over

[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.840]  hey um i live in rhod island small state
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:08.000]  and uh just recently as i think was yesterday
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:14.560]  um four towns in our little state were threatened
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:20.080]  uh the schools where that is and um there was letters sent through schools
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:24.000]  saying that the children were left outside that they would either
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.320]  be kidnapped or beheaded and a lot of people saying that
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:33.360]  this is a isis threat and i just was wondering if you had heard anything on
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:36.000]  your end no i haven't heard of it it sounds like a prank
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.920]  uh but uh isis is a real terror group being funded by our criminal government
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:43.280]  on record publicly uh and they are letting them come into the
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:45.280]  country and i don't think they would put the
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:48.880]  threat out first they the way they operate is they're just going to do it
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:51.920]  and they have said over there they're going to come over here and kill us and
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:54.880]  our government's greece and the skids forum as michael savage said
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:59.200]  it's totally fake the war on terror is fake uh
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:02.080]  the controlled right always spends it and says that i'm saying there's no
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.040]  radical islamists that's not what i'm saying i'm saying just what i said the
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:10.240]  government's funding and i'm protecting them anything else sir no that's it
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:14.800]  god bless you i appreciate your call joseph in michigan you're on the year
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.440]  yeah hey can you hear me alex yes i can i had a couple of things here on the
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.600]  Ebola that doctor that caught the uh virus from a c-section
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:27.360]  yes so i happened to work in the operating room for over 20 years and
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:30.720]  dad is just totally absurd and somebody needs to uh
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:34.240]  pay the piper on this one because as soon as they come into pre-op it's who
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:38.480]  they get in that hospital they're already checking vital so for that to get to
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:42.880]  the operating room to do a c-section uh whoever's doing the anesthesia would
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:46.800]  have a grasp on that as well i mean it's just totally disregard another thing on
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:50.240]  the bank dodgy hearing i don't know how you feel about trade gaudy but i've
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:54.000]  been watching some of the hearings on c-span the way he's really getting into
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.960]  hillary clinton and how the cover-up is with all the underlings just totally
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:03.040]  not giving any names and they've been threatened they even offered to put them
[02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:06.080]  in the witness protection program there's a whole bunch of deaths looks like
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.080]  15 people that could blow the whistle and ended up dying
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:15.280]  it's just it's just totally unbelievable and what i like to see happen is uh

[03:00:56.320 --> 03:00:59.200]  not like ms nbc and nbc that got over a
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:02.800]  million dollars and bailout and stimulus money that then pay rachel

[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:40.720]  uh... to the greeks when they wouldn't turn in their swords

[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:47.840]  america info or store dot com are made in 1776 dot com
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:51.280]  but since i mentioned this earlier i want to get to it
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:55.120]  i had this idea kind of last week and then i saw stories all over the news
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:01:58.960]  today one up at info wars dot com about bumper stickers popping up
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:03.760]  that say ebola but then in the o
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:07.680]  it is the obama symbol so we now have a t-shirt that on the
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:14.000]  back says obola info wars dot com and on the front says
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:17.840]  ebola so we're the first to get these out ladies and
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:21.440]  gentlemen and i have announced a limited run
[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:24.800]  we have them in production right now take a few weeks to get them in
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:27.760]  and then we'll ship them out and that's it so when they're sold out
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  they're sold out we're doing three thousand of the blood spattered version
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:35.440]  and a little less of the one that doesn't have the fake blood splatter version
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:38.960]  but it's a great way to desecrate the political correct gods
[03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:43.200]  it's a great way to say we'll we'll equate big government
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:48.160]  and tyranny with disease in fact we're going to add to that shopping cart
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:51.600]  page if you go to the front page of info wars dot com
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:55.920]  a graphic that curt nemo uh put together today
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:00.880]  and in that graphic that you can see again at info wars
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:07.440]  dot com you can see that it breaks down in
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:12.400]  fact let me just go to info wars dot com and i can do that to the home page
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:20.000]  it says obola front page anti-gun anti-sovereignty anti-liberty
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.520]  tyranny is a disease that's why we're putting this out
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:26.880]  because they say oh you can't criticize our lord and savior is jamie fox
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:30.400]  called him barack hussain and obama well we are going to do it even though
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:34.480]  he's a puppet it doesn't matter it's about getting in the face of the system
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:38.720]  remember back when we started promoting the obama socialist joker image
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:42.320]  when they tried to ban it in la we put on our own version
[03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:45.280]  and then all over the country people put it up they were trying to arrest them
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:48.720]  so more people put up and then they then they backed off
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:53.440]  there is such a political correct intimidation to where now they say you
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:57.200]  can't be a geisha girl uh on halloween or a cowboy
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:02.480]  that everyone is just groveling and going along with whatever they say
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:05.280]  well we're not going to be part of this anymore
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:09.280]  we must be politically incorrect folks because they're making the circle of
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:13.120]  what is kosher and acceptable smaller and smaller and smaller
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:16.400]  i predict these will sell out in a week or quicker the new
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:23.680]  obama obola t-shirts it says obola on the back with the obama symbol as the
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:29.040]  video and then ebola on the front we have the blood spattered fake blood
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:32.640]  spattered it's not real blood folks obviously uh
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:35.840]  two plus two equals four we have that available and then we have the one that's
