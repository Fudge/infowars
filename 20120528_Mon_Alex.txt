[03:00.740 --> 03:05.060]  military formed to fight British tyranny and to fight for liberty but since then
[03:05.060 --> 03:08.420]  it's been taken over by the globalist our military men and women are used as
[03:08.420 --> 03:12.180]  absolute cannon fodder their death benefits are stolen their uses guinea
[03:12.180 --> 03:15.900]  pigs for chemical biological radiological testing vaccines all of
[03:15.900 --> 03:22.620]  it the proof is in this system will use its enforcers and on this Memorial Day
[03:22.620 --> 03:26.540]  we should remember that it was declassified two years ago that for
[03:26.540 --> 03:30.540]  more than 12 years they've been taking people's death benefits at death and not
[03:30.540 --> 03:34.940]  giving it to their widowers and widowers widows and widowers I mean this is
[03:34.940 --> 03:38.500]  amazing and all the big insurance companies are involved in it the
[03:38.500 --> 03:43.500]  criminals running the federal government allow it it makes the zucker scam
[03:43.500 --> 03:47.860]  you know being zuckered by Facebook pale in significance it makes the MF
[03:47.860 --> 03:53.260]  global heifed by John Corzine look like Charles play as these crooks get away
[03:53.260 --> 03:57.900]  with bloody murder things are only going to get worse and worse and worse and
[03:57.900 --> 04:03.300]  worse and now is the time to be awake now is the time to be involved now is the
[04:03.300 --> 04:07.940]  time to take action and realize that if we don't stand up it's just going to get
[04:07.940 --> 04:12.260]  worse but our hopes and prayers go out to all the military and their families
[04:12.260 --> 04:16.220]  that these evil globalist wars can end and that will treat our veterans better
[04:16.220 --> 04:19.260]  so God bless all of our veterans and those that have supported them and their
[04:19.260 --> 04:24.300]  families on this Memorial Day very very important remember the millions of dead
[04:24.300 --> 04:29.980]  in the United States in our 235 years and please pray for us as well as we
[04:29.980 --> 04:33.660]  prepare to engage the Bilderberg group a mainstream media is now covering this
[04:33.660 --> 04:37.420]  which means that before they never wanted to have any riot police or start
[04:37.420 --> 04:39.900]  stuff because they didn't want to bring attention to it but now because it's
[04:39.900 --> 04:43.940]  been forced out in the open we don't know what's going to happen so we'll
[04:43.940 --> 04:46.900]  continue to report on that all right Dr. Joel Wallach coming up and then the

[08:57.100 --> 09:03.140]  on about why are people so unhealthy why are people eating about the same
[09:03.140 --> 09:07.180]  calories they were eating 50 years ago or so the studies are out there but
[09:07.180 --> 09:12.020]  getting even fatter what's in the food is it you know the GMO the fact that the
[09:12.020 --> 09:16.060]  soils are played out all of that instead they're saying they're gonna ban
[09:16.060 --> 09:19.100]  people having a piece of pie in school and parents can't pack their school
[09:19.100 --> 09:23.780]  lunches from Illinois to Massachusetts and they're banning running at recess in
[09:23.780 --> 09:27.500]  all this and people don't have immune systems anymore and cancer and
[09:27.500 --> 09:31.900]  children's up over 10,000 percent 3,000 percent on average in adults diabetes
[09:31.900 --> 09:35.100]  top two several thousand percentage points some numbers are 3,000 percent
[09:35.100 --> 09:40.300]  increase breast cancer highest in the world neurological disorders autism from

[09:45.940 --> 09:50.380]  what one in five or six I mean this is getting crazy the numbers are
[09:50.380 --> 09:56.580]  mind-blowing what's happening and it's amazing that I had him set up a week's
[09:56.580 --> 10:02.620]  ago for today Dr. Joel Wallach when exactly one of the things I wanted to
[10:02.620 --> 10:06.820]  get into is big in the news today obesity fight must shift from personal
[10:06.820 --> 10:11.420]  blame US panel says Reuters the government must make the decisions they
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.500]  say and tax foods they say aren't good and block people from access to them
[10:16.500 --> 10:23.140]  start controlling fat they just say at stake is bad when it's not bad it's the
[10:23.140 --> 10:26.540]  trans fats and the artificial fats and there's an example right there from all
[10:26.540 --> 10:29.820]  the medical doctors and others we've had on this is a no-brainer
[10:29.820 --> 10:34.100]  nutritionist I mean we have everybody for mainline medical doctors brain
[10:34.100 --> 10:41.100]  surgeons endocrinologists veterinarians naturopaths Nobel Prize winners they're
[10:41.100 --> 10:45.260]  all saying the same thing they're not worried about the GMO or they're not
[10:45.260 --> 10:48.300]  worried about all the additives they're not worried about the aspartame they're
[10:48.300 --> 10:51.180]  not worried about the MSG they're not telling you to be worried about the
[10:51.180 --> 10:55.540]  excitotoxins they're not worried about all these other things or that most the
[10:55.540 --> 11:01.020]  soils have been played out and have bio accumulated toxic fertilizer put on it
[11:01.020 --> 11:04.980]  filled with heavy metals I mean half the corn syrup products wash and post
[11:04.980 --> 11:10.540]  reports have high levels of mercury and lead wash and post just type in melamines
[11:10.540 --> 11:13.660]  in the milk and China they execute people for that here it's in the baby
[11:13.660 --> 11:17.900]  formula which is half corn syrup on average they say it's fine no no no our
[11:17.900 --> 11:24.660]  children are fried diabetes is happening because they're on formula Mike Adams
[11:24.660 --> 11:27.860]  is there with the leading brand it was 50 something percent corn syrup another
[11:27.860 --> 11:31.500]  20 something percent other sugars babies aren't supposed to be I mean no
[11:31.500 --> 11:35.380]  wonder we've got all these mall Martians and the public looks like they've been
[11:35.380 --> 11:40.660]  hit by an ugly beam or something myself included I mean folks I've gone back and
[11:40.660 --> 11:44.140]  watch old footage I shot in the 80s with my parents of the video camera people
[11:44.140 --> 11:48.700]  didn't look like this we're eating really trashy stuff but it didn't have all
[11:48.700 --> 11:52.780]  this new garbage so the experts with us about 15 minutes the next hour that it's
[11:52.780 --> 11:57.660]  calls and all those other stories I said we'd cover but now they're coming here
[11:57.660 --> 12:03.360]  it is right here in the news Massachusetts and others move to ban bake
[12:03.360 --> 12:07.900]  sales all over the country they're banning parents being able to pack the
[12:07.900 --> 12:12.700]  school lunch for their children total control but kind of find that article I
[12:12.700 --> 12:17.580]  read it in the first hour here here it is so the Boston Herald states junk food
[12:17.580 --> 12:20.980]  ban could take a bite out of school fundraisers and they're calling junk
[12:20.980 --> 12:29.260]  food now the fake environmentalist love this meat cheese dr. Wallach never
[12:29.260 --> 12:32.620]  wants to chew his horn but I'm gonna make him in the first part of the segment
[12:32.620 --> 12:37.980]  do it because he really is probably the most famous zoological veterinarian and
[12:37.980 --> 12:40.500]  I've worked for a small animal vet and a large animal that's not a little bit
[12:40.500 --> 12:47.700]  about it he has his work is in the Smithsonian dr. Wallach has sued the
[12:47.700 --> 12:51.620]  FDA over and over and over again in one when almost no one else can even win
[12:51.620 --> 12:56.380]  once he is super aggressive by the way he's not even part of young Jevity he
[12:56.380 --> 13:00.220]  doesn't even part of the company because he wants to be separated from from his
[13:00.220 --> 13:06.380]  findings and research and Aaron Dykes as you know I was already promoting and
[13:06.380 --> 13:09.620]  believed in it but wasn't following it religiously Aaron Dykes has lost 91
[13:09.620 --> 13:14.260]  pounds and it is even advertised the polymers beyond Tangier mean young
[13:14.260 --> 13:21.100]  Jevity osteo FX all things Wallach recommends in the Alex back Aaron
[13:21.100 --> 13:26.500]  Aaron followed this and lost 91 pounds and now he's gonna go into muscle game
[13:26.500 --> 13:31.020]  it's incredible he looks are you seeing we're gonna do it before I've lost 42
[13:31.020 --> 13:34.340]  pounds anyways info wars team.com to find out but I'm not gonna go off into a
[13:34.340 --> 13:37.860]  plug about this to find out about the products that Wallach and others have
[13:37.860 --> 13:42.420]  developed that he recommends it's this is such a powerful revolution against the
[13:42.420 --> 13:46.540]  globalist to get the minerals and vitamins and trace elements they say
[13:46.540 --> 13:49.700]  you don't need and the globalists are fighting to block you getting but first
[13:49.700 --> 13:54.420]  Dr. Wallach for about six seven minutes tell us about your awakening your
[13:54.420 --> 13:58.660]  discoveries what you found and the fact the system premeditatedly doesn't want
[13:58.660 --> 14:02.860]  us to know this because they love breast cancer up by several thousand percentage
[14:02.860 --> 14:07.140]  points the US leading the world because it's always about the cure never the
[14:07.140 --> 14:11.540]  cause let's have all these runs for the cure not runs for the cause they don't
[14:11.540 --> 14:16.540]  want people to know this what have you discovered in your decades of research
[14:16.540 --> 14:21.380]  and all the things you've done but first off tell us who you are for those that
[14:21.380 --> 14:25.780]  don't know and and why you discovered this information well thank you Alex
[14:25.780 --> 14:29.300]  first of all thank you so much for your hospitality you're one of my heroes and
[14:29.300 --> 14:33.740]  just really great to be with you today and to answer your question the thing
[14:33.740 --> 14:37.340]  it makes me different is that I do have a degree in agriculture from the University
[14:37.340 --> 14:41.940]  of Missouri and my major is in animal husbandry and nutrition in the animal
[14:41.940 --> 14:45.100]  industry we don't have health insurance we just had to learn to solve the
[14:45.100 --> 14:48.820]  problems which is a good thing in the human industry health industry we have
[14:48.820 --> 14:52.740]  insurance in the medical system learn to game the system to get the insurance
[14:52.740 --> 14:56.220]  it's very seductive they go after the money rather than taking care of the
[14:56.220 --> 15:02.900]  patient then I went on to veterinary school actually in my second year of
[15:02.900 --> 15:07.580]  ag school applied farm was surprised to get actually accepted into veterinary
[15:07.580 --> 15:11.660]  school by the time I graduated ag school I was only a second year of veterinary
[15:11.660 --> 15:15.460]  student but I was also a graduate student so I began to take pathology courses
[15:15.460 --> 15:21.380]  and found and discovered and wrote up the first case of a mass die-off in
[15:21.380 --> 15:26.500]  America from pollution in 1962 is written up in international journals from
[15:26.500 --> 15:32.860]  Denmark and Danish and English and Act of Pathologica and that was a awakening
[15:32.860 --> 15:36.580]  for me certainly I wasn't aware of pollution until this mass die-off
[15:36.580 --> 15:40.300]  occurred then graduated veterinary school went to Africa for a couple years
[15:40.300 --> 15:43.980]  worked with Marlon Perkins from the old New Chivoma Hall Wild Kingdom days on a
[15:43.980 --> 15:48.780]  white rhino conservation project caught over 200 white rhino with the drug
[15:48.780 --> 15:53.940]  darts and sent them back to the States and if you go to a wild animal park or a
[15:53.940 --> 15:56.740]  zoo and you see white rhino it's either one that I caught or offspring of the
[15:56.740 --> 16:00.060]  one I caught so I'm very proud of that project I remember seeing that on
[16:00.060 --> 16:06.020]  television as a child yep those quite a bit on TV and of course you can actually
[16:06.020 --> 16:10.500]  see all this old film we've kept in the archives they actually have pictures of
[16:10.500 --> 16:14.260]  me doing this so anybody who wants to challenge that we have the film of it
[16:14.260 --> 16:22.020]  and then because of my background finding that first case of a mass die-off
[16:22.020 --> 16:27.500]  and pollution Perkins in the mid-60s when I was in Africa actually got a
[16:27.500 --> 16:31.580]  grant from the National Institutes of Health to study pollution in zoo animals
[16:31.580 --> 16:35.700]  that he made a very good observation going back to the old Welsh coal miner
[16:35.700 --> 16:39.180]  days you know Alex when they took the canary down in the mine and if methane
[16:39.180 --> 16:42.340]  gas or carbon monoxide would leak into the mine the canary would drop off the
[16:42.340 --> 16:46.260]  perch and die and the men could get out before they suffocated or blew up well
[16:46.260 --> 16:52.140]  Perkins reason quite clark correctly that here we have in a big zoo three four
[16:52.140 --> 16:55.500]  five six hundred species of animals and they're bound to be some of them that
[16:55.500 --> 16:59.300]  were more sensitive to pollution others and give us a warning that doom was
[16:59.300 --> 17:03.780]  ahead and so because I had written that first paper on a mass die-off from
[17:03.780 --> 17:07.380]  pollution he called me back from Africa to be the pathologist on that project
[17:07.380 --> 17:10.940]  and to make a long story short there's a combined department from Washington
[17:10.940 --> 17:16.420]  University in St. Louis the St. Louis zoo in the Shaw's Botanical Gardens and it
[17:16.420 --> 17:20.180]  was my job to do the autopsies not only in zoo animals but also human beings that
[17:20.180 --> 17:24.660]  died of natural causes in the close close proximity to the zoos this
[17:24.660 --> 17:27.740]  included all the major zoos in the United States including the National Zoo
[17:27.740 --> 17:33.620]  and New York Zoo and Los Angeles and Miami and so on well again to make a
[17:33.620 --> 17:38.100]  long story short over that period of some 12 years that over 20,000 autopsies
[17:38.100 --> 17:44.420]  some 17,000 of some change in over 450 species of zoo animals and 3000 humans
[17:44.420 --> 17:48.580]  millions of chemistries millions of slides with special stains and the book
[17:48.580 --> 17:52.300]  that came out that's a 1200 page book and it's in the Smithsonian Institute as
[17:52.300 --> 17:58.300]  a national treasure it only cost 12 25 million dollars at that time there's a
[17:58.300 --> 18:02.180]  lot of money for a 25 year old kid to be spending because you had a pretty big
[18:02.180 --> 18:05.660]  team under you to be able to get all that done oh yeah I had they actually
[18:05.660 --> 18:10.140]  worked 24 hours a day I had a team of people who were chemists and the people
[18:10.140 --> 18:16.140]  who made the slides for me and I think I probably had seven people working for me
[18:16.140 --> 18:20.860]  and again as a young man that was quite a project today would cost billions of
[18:20.860 --> 18:24.740]  dollars to redo the study and I don't think they'll ever do it again which is
[18:24.740 --> 18:29.300]  a tragedy right tell folks what you discovered from the study okay what I
[18:29.300 --> 18:33.100]  just studied discovered Alex the bottom line was that every animal and every
[18:33.100 --> 18:37.300]  human being who dies of natural causes dies of a nutritional deficiency
[18:37.300 --> 18:42.540]  disease and that was profound and of course that didn't make a dent because
[18:42.540 --> 18:45.700]  people say what do you mean everybody dies of nutritional deficiencies I mean
[18:45.700 --> 18:49.140]  this is America we had the best food in the world and that is totally incorrect
[18:49.140 --> 18:53.100]  the earth is not flat and the Sun does not rotate around the earth and we have
[18:53.100 --> 18:59.060]  the worst food in the world well it's incredible information and but but now
[18:59.060 --> 19:03.440]  since you did those studies there's all these others about feeding rats super
[19:03.440 --> 19:08.140]  high nutrient dense food and they live twice as long they're doing it with
[19:08.140 --> 19:12.460]  insects so the system has duplicated your research I mean that's well known
[19:12.460 --> 19:18.500]  now that's super high a nutrient dense food and restricted diets does make
[19:18.500 --> 19:21.620]  mammals live a lot longer oh absolutely we've tripled the lifespan
[19:21.620 --> 19:26.100]  for instance of dogs six years ago an old dog was eight years old today 25 we've
[19:26.100 --> 19:30.220]  eliminated 900 different diseases and all birth defects and dogs have still
[19:30.220 --> 19:34.460]  plagued people simply with nutrition we didn't do any genetically engineered
[19:34.460 --> 19:39.260]  programs we didn't do wonder drugs or organ transplants it's all done with
[19:39.260 --> 19:42.460]  vitamins and minerals and this is where we came up with the programs that
[19:42.460 --> 19:47.580]  young jivity does amazing and it's all at info wars team.com we're gonna come
[19:47.580 --> 19:54.580]  back and get into your defeat of the EPA the FDA over and over and over and over
[19:54.580 --> 19:58.620]  and over again and the fact that they're trying to keep this information from the
[19:58.620 --> 20:03.220]  public stay with us. I'd seen the young jivity products worked for many others
[20:03.220 --> 20:06.660]  and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results
[20:06.660 --> 20:11.780]  but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and
[20:11.780 --> 20:16.540]  lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I better follow my
[20:16.540 --> 20:19.780]  own advice I started taking the young jivity products and it's been
[20:19.780 --> 20:26.060]  incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave us an
[20:26.060 --> 20:30.140]  incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of the
[20:30.140 --> 20:34.540]  vitamins all of the minerals and the other key essential trace elements
[20:34.540 --> 20:38.420]  we're not gonna be healthy folks is hidden hype I only bring to my listeners

[24:14.140 --> 24:17.980]  well we worked hard getting him on the radio he is a busy guy criss-crossing
[24:17.980 --> 24:25.340]  the globe written many best-selling books dr. Joel Wallach is our guest for
[24:25.340 --> 24:28.780]  the rest of the hour we'll open the phones up later for our guests as well
[24:28.780 --> 24:33.460]  and I've got to say if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv he's joining us be a
[24:33.460 --> 24:39.180]  video Skype doc it is shocking when people learn how old you are tell people
[24:39.180 --> 24:46.500]  how old you are see next month they'll be 73 and have been to a doctor in 64
[24:46.500 --> 24:52.020]  years never been sick and certainly never been on a prescription drug so it's
[24:52.020 --> 24:55.260]  a testimony to doing the right things you can be healthy and if everybody were
[24:55.260 --> 25:01.260]  like me the medical system would certainly have to shape up no I've seen
[25:01.260 --> 25:04.020]  you on stage speak I've never had a chance to meet you in person I know
[25:04.020 --> 25:07.620]  you're gonna come to Austin soon I've been twisting your arm on stage and in
[25:07.620 --> 25:14.300]  person you could pass for 55 I would guess 60 I would guess you're 60 you
[25:14.300 --> 25:19.900]  you do not look 73 well thank you yes most people think I'm in my 50s and I
[25:19.900 --> 25:23.980]  can certainly outwork most 18 year olds physically on the farm that's still true
[25:23.980 --> 25:28.460]  and it's very exciting to be kind of an example if you do all the correct stuff
[25:28.460 --> 25:31.900]  avoid the bad things you supplement within 90 essential nutrients I'm really
[25:31.900 --> 25:35.940]  proud of you for going that direction you're certainly looking great and seeing
[25:35.940 --> 25:40.060]  the benefit and I appreciate you sharing that with the world by the way I want to
[25:40.060 --> 25:45.220]  get into you defeating the FDA and their their their criminal activities many
[25:45.220 --> 25:52.260]  times but why did somebody like Aaron Dykes lose 91 pounds on things that
[25:52.260 --> 25:57.380]  don't even advertise themselves as weight loss well basically Alex the
[25:57.380 --> 26:01.860]  reason for weight gain and obesity is not what the doctors say it has nothing
[26:01.860 --> 26:06.260]  to do with eating too much it has nothing to do with lack of exercise or too
[26:06.260 --> 26:11.580]  much screen time that theory doesn't fit the truth if their theory was correct
[26:11.580 --> 26:15.900]  with everybody exercising and avoiding fat eating more whole grains we should
[26:15.900 --> 26:19.780]  be number 200 in the world with an obesity right now we're number one
[26:19.780 --> 26:24.620]  following their instructions eating more whole grains exercising more weight
[26:24.620 --> 26:29.660]  gain and obesity is due to a simple mineral deficiency you take the minerals
[26:29.660 --> 26:35.300]  regardless of the source you take the minerals and you lose the weight and we
[26:35.300 --> 26:38.500]  found this to be true for the last 35 years and my wife and I actually wrote a
[26:38.500 --> 26:45.900]  book called hell's kitchen which you can get from info wars team calm and that
[26:45.900 --> 26:50.860]  book is just a great little book and it goes into the history of weight gain and
[26:50.860 --> 26:54.420]  the reason why the medical system of the government has pushed us in the wrong
[26:54.420 --> 26:59.060]  direction obesity is a physician-caused disease it has nothing to do with
[26:59.060 --> 27:03.260]  eating too much has nothing to do with lack of exercise it is a simple mineral
[27:03.260 --> 27:06.260]  deficiency and that's why you're seeing the great results you are from just
[27:06.260 --> 27:10.980]  taking the 90 cents of nutrients what about this report about obesity fight
[27:10.980 --> 27:14.780]  my shift from personal blame US panel says or the government's gonna say
[27:14.780 --> 27:20.460]  what's bad but they're saying having a steak is bad they're saying eating some
[27:20.460 --> 27:24.860]  pasta is bad meanwhile the GMO and all the toxins they're saying those are just
[27:24.860 --> 27:30.660]  fine but I've seen the studies that the toxins in GMO are totally linked to all
[27:30.660 --> 27:35.100]  sorts of weird obesity and health problems and rodents well you're exactly
[27:35.100 --> 27:40.180]  right there's two forces attacking us number one or all the bad things GMOs
[27:40.180 --> 27:45.420]  the chemicals the environment and then the other thing is you're looking at not
[27:45.420 --> 27:49.940]  enough nutrients a particularly mineral nutrients and these two forces the other
[27:49.940 --> 27:54.060]  have caught Americans in the crossfire if you will and that's why we're the
[27:54.060 --> 27:58.260]  number one obese nation in the world has nothing to do with not enough
[27:58.260 --> 28:06.020]  exercise has nothing to do with too much food and again it's the chemicals on
[28:06.020 --> 28:12.260]  one hand taking us out of the reality of nutrition and the lack of nutrition
[28:12.260 --> 28:18.460]  mineral nutrition in particular now if I may say one thing we have so many
[28:18.460 --> 28:22.300]  examples literally thousands and thousands of examples of people who
[28:22.300 --> 28:27.340]  tried everything to lose weight including surgery and so forth and what's
[28:27.340 --> 28:32.100]  happened is we've been able to help people lose 400 pounds 200 pounds 100
[28:32.100 --> 28:36.100]  pounds as you have with your staff member and it's simply by giving them
[28:36.100 --> 28:39.100]  mineral supplements it doesn't matter if they take our rebound in the 90th
[28:39.100 --> 28:43.660]  century nutrients or if they take pollen bursts and our nutrients it
[28:43.660 --> 28:48.580]  doesn't matter if they take the ASAP and our nutrients as long as they're taking
[28:48.580 --> 28:52.180]  the minerals they will lose weight and of course it doesn't take long you're on
[28:52.180 --> 28:56.100]  two meals a day you're just not really hungry and you have to watch it you have
[28:56.100 --> 29:02.540]  to be able to eat to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need to be
[29:02.540 --> 29:06.900]  healthy and so if you supplement properly that will happen and of course
[29:06.900 --> 29:09.860]  that nobody knows more about weight gain and weight loss than veterinarians
[29:09.860 --> 29:13.140]  because this is what we do and feed lots for livestock and so I just transferred
[29:13.140 --> 29:18.860]  that information from livestock to human beings been doing this again for 35
[29:18.860 --> 29:23.460]  years and again just so happy that you've taken this on and brought it to the
[29:23.460 --> 29:26.900]  public you're just really great for that the people perish for lack of knowledge
[29:26.900 --> 29:31.020]  and the knowledge is at info wars team comm of people want to learn more there
[29:31.020 --> 29:34.260]  but when we come back in that short segment I forgot to get into your
[29:34.260 --> 29:38.500]  defeat over and over again of the FDA one of the few people that actually
[29:38.500 --> 29:43.380]  defeated them we'll find out how you did that and get into the the illness
[29:43.380 --> 29:47.900]  epidemics all these diseases why is that happening and what is the system
[29:47.900 --> 29:52.580]  suppressing from the people stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:52.580 --> 29:58.660]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:28.060 --> 33:39.100]  All I've ever wanted, all I've ever needed is liberty, and when I, a decade ago, heard
[33:39.100 --> 33:44.340]  Dr. Wallach on the radio, it totally clicked, but I never followed through on it.
[33:44.340 --> 33:50.700]  And then watching crew in the office get into it, and all have dramatic effects, I said
[33:50.700 --> 33:56.500]  I better get with the program, and I've lost 42 pounds, I haven't weighed in a while, it's
[33:56.500 --> 34:01.780]  probably a little bit more, I've got a lot more to lose, I was like, probably 70 pounds.
[34:01.780 --> 34:06.340]  I mean, in my prime, when I used to jog with weights every day, I don't know, I weighed
[34:06.340 --> 34:13.220]  about 180, I got up to 265, okay, so I've got a ways to go.
[34:13.220 --> 34:17.140]  And every time I stopped losing weight, because I've never been somebody taking essential
[34:17.140 --> 34:23.480]  fatty acids, taking vitamins, taking the osteo, FX, taking the tangy tangerine, taking the
[34:23.480 --> 34:26.500]  polymers, I've just never done it in my life.
[34:26.500 --> 34:32.300]  And every time I stop, suddenly I start, you know, not losing weight anymore, and not
[34:32.300 --> 34:33.300]  having as much energy.
[34:33.300 --> 34:36.620]  And I mean, I always do at least one of them a day, but it is, it's like three or four
[34:36.620 --> 34:41.340]  things to take a day, because even if you're going to Whole Foods or whatever, they're
[34:41.340 --> 34:46.900]  growing most of it organically, but it's technically not really completely organic, because they're
[34:46.900 --> 34:50.460]  using some of the chemical fertilizers and things, and the soils are played out.
[34:50.460 --> 34:54.020]  But I'm telling you, this is revolutionary.
[34:54.020 --> 34:58.180]  We haven't even done a promo yet, and I'm going to do it with Aaron Dykes, showing him
[34:58.180 --> 35:04.460]  a year ago, 90 plus pounds, yeah, there's Aaron just six months ago, he'd already lost
[35:04.460 --> 35:07.580]  a lot of weight, there he is last week.
[35:07.580 --> 35:12.140]  So Aaron had already lost like 40 pounds in that comparison, that we just put on screen,
[35:12.140 --> 35:16.540]  in fact, put that back up, Aaron on the nightly nose, only doing it eight, nine months, that
[35:16.540 --> 35:22.700]  is six months ago, so he'd already lost half the weight there, and then here he is just
[35:22.700 --> 35:27.740]  last week, unbelievable.
[35:27.740 --> 35:31.860]  And I'm telling you, Aaron is quite the ladies man, I'm going to stop right there.
[35:31.860 --> 35:37.060]  The point is, this is a devastating weapon against the globalist, and yeah, I'm promoting
[35:37.060 --> 35:42.540]  it, but the point is, that's how we fund this independent media operation, is infowordsteam.com,
[35:42.540 --> 35:49.100]  where when you sign up, you can get distributor wholesale pricing, you can also, again, sign
[35:49.100 --> 35:53.460]  up your friends and family and get them discounts, but the point is, just try Beyond Tangentangerine,
[35:53.460 --> 36:00.220]  try Polymers, try the Healthy Start Alex Pack that's got the Essential Fatty Acids,
[36:00.220 --> 36:03.900]  the Tangentangerine, and the Osteo FX Plus, I'm going to stop plugging.
[36:03.900 --> 36:06.340]  I got Wallach home and I didn't even plug, and I said, Wallach, I don't want to do much
[36:06.340 --> 36:10.940]  of plugging, and then I started doing it, because wild horses can't drag me away here.
[36:10.940 --> 36:16.420]  This stuff really does work, and it turns out the globalists knew this.
[36:16.420 --> 36:20.700]  When I worked for Jesse Edkins, large animal vet, he would tell them that when the winter
[36:20.700 --> 36:24.660]  came, put them on a certain mineral mix, so they wouldn't lose weight or freeze to death
[36:24.660 --> 36:26.660]  outside when it got cold, the cows.
[36:26.660 --> 36:31.420]  I mean, that's, especially with large animal vets, that's what it was all about.
[36:31.420 --> 36:32.780]  And the system knows this.
[36:32.780 --> 36:38.700]  Doc Wallach, talk about how much they know and why they only want to treat the illnesses
[36:38.700 --> 36:40.940]  that they basically cause by not telling people.
[36:40.940 --> 36:46.060]  I mean, they've got to know that the average baby formula out there is over half corn syrup
[36:46.060 --> 36:47.860]  and another 20% of the sugars.
[36:47.860 --> 36:50.220]  You're talking 70% plus sugar.
[36:50.220 --> 36:53.020]  No wonder these kids are getting diabetes when they're five years old.
[36:53.020 --> 36:54.860]  I mean, the system knows what they're doing.
[36:54.860 --> 36:59.460]  Why are they doing this, Doc, and then tell us about your defeat of the Food and Drug Administration
[36:59.460 --> 37:00.460]  over and over again.
[37:00.460 --> 37:01.460]  Okay.
[37:01.460 --> 37:02.460]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[37:02.460 --> 37:04.620]  And that's one of my favorite subjects as kids.
[37:04.620 --> 37:11.100]  And just last month in April, the Food Chemistry Journal, a very well-respected journal supported
[37:11.100 --> 37:17.300]  by the USDA, came out and said that the kids' foods that we have respected over the years,
[37:17.300 --> 37:22.180]  things like Gerbers and Similac and Femil and these types of things, that we trusted
[37:22.180 --> 37:26.300]  have less than 20% of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that kids need, less than 20%.
[37:26.300 --> 37:31.660]  It was big headlines, Food Chemistry Journal in April, just last month, 20%.
[37:31.660 --> 37:34.100]  We feed our dogs and our rats better than we feed our kids.
[37:34.100 --> 37:39.020]  And this is why we have diabetes, this is why we have autism and ADD, then you throw
[37:39.020 --> 37:42.180]  into the mix all the chemicals and the environment.
[37:42.180 --> 37:47.220]  We have a mess here because the kids aren't even getting as much nutrition as a dog.
[37:47.220 --> 37:48.420]  And that is a crime.
[37:48.420 --> 37:49.420]  It's not a shame.
[37:49.420 --> 37:50.420]  It's not terrible.
[37:50.420 --> 37:53.060]  It's absolute triple-A felony.
[37:53.060 --> 37:59.340]  And all the pediatricians who know this should be put in jail, absolutely put in jail because
[37:59.340 --> 38:06.940]  we've known this in animals for 75, in some cases, 100 years and it's very simple to give
[38:06.940 --> 38:07.940]  all these nutrients.
[38:07.940 --> 38:15.980]  And of course, all the kids who belong to the Info Wars team and the Alex group, they're
[38:15.980 --> 38:19.980]  gaining benefit here because they're getting the 90th century nutrients before they're
[38:19.980 --> 38:24.100]  conceived all through the pregnancy they're developed in from the moment they're born.
[38:24.100 --> 38:28.620]  And we will eliminate 900 different diseases in this little army we're starting here that
[38:28.620 --> 38:32.820]  still play everybody else who had been falsely taught that you can eat well.
[38:32.820 --> 38:36.900]  And even organic foods, Alex, that just means that there's no chemicals on it, which is
[38:36.900 --> 38:40.980]  very good because it reduces the chemical load, reduces your risk of cancer, but doesn't
[38:40.980 --> 38:44.500]  give you any nutrition, no guarantee of nutrition.
[38:44.500 --> 38:48.380]  Plants only need three minerals to be healthy and make good seeds for the next generation.
[38:48.380 --> 38:49.380]  We need 60.
[38:49.380 --> 38:54.180]  And so you can eat a pretty good slice of organically-grown multigrain bread baked by the pastor's wife
[38:54.180 --> 38:58.300]  on Sunday in the church in your 57 mineral shark and luscious supplement.
[38:58.300 --> 39:01.980]  That's what we learned in the livestock industry, because we don't have insurance.
[39:01.980 --> 39:05.500]  Medical doctors have learned how to game the system using insurance.
[39:05.500 --> 39:10.740]  They feel that if they charge you $3,000 for procedure that really only costs 50, that
[39:10.740 --> 39:13.460]  they're not hurting the patient because insurance pays.
[39:13.460 --> 39:20.700]  And they've financially broken America with this over costing of health care.
[39:20.700 --> 39:24.340]  And this is one of the reasons why I went after the FDA.
[39:24.340 --> 39:30.580]  They used to say things like, you can get the omega-3s you need by eating foods rich
[39:30.580 --> 39:35.300]  in omega-3s and reduce your risk of stroke and coronary thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
[39:35.300 --> 39:36.900]  and deep vein thrombosis.
[39:36.900 --> 39:41.700]  You could not say until I sued them that you can supplement with omega-3 essential fatty
[39:41.700 --> 39:46.860]  acids and reduce thrombotic stroke, coronary thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein
[39:46.860 --> 39:49.020]  thrombosis by supplementation.
[39:49.020 --> 39:51.780]  That was against the law to say that they would shut you down and put you in jail.
[39:51.780 --> 39:55.500]  So I went to court, sued them in federal court, and actually won.
[39:55.500 --> 40:00.540]  And the one that I love is, and you'll really appreciate this, was on antioxidants, antioxidants
[40:00.540 --> 40:04.740]  being able to reduce your risk of inflammation, your arteries, and plugging your arteries,
[40:04.740 --> 40:06.580]  reduce risk of cancer.
[40:06.580 --> 40:10.660]  And I prevailed in federal court on that, and they appealed.
[40:10.660 --> 40:15.740]  And I prevailed again in the appellate court, and they appealed again, and they signed off
[40:15.740 --> 40:20.020]  on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I felt, gosh, that felt too easy.
[40:20.020 --> 40:21.020]  There's something up.
[40:21.020 --> 40:24.620]  And I'm sure enough, six months later, they had a sister agency in the Department of Health
[40:24.620 --> 40:29.580]  and Human Services sue them, not both of us, but sue them to unravel the agreement.
[40:29.580 --> 40:34.700]  And I had to go to the federal judge and ask to be a co-defendant with the FDA.
[40:34.700 --> 40:36.940]  So we've been suing them into the ground for 10 years.
[40:36.940 --> 40:39.100]  Why suddenly do you want to be a co-defendant with the FDA?
[40:39.100 --> 40:42.980]  And they said, well, with all due respect, Your Honor, I don't believe that they will
[40:42.980 --> 40:44.900]  defend the agreement vigorously.
[40:44.900 --> 40:46.660]  And I have to be there to do that.
[40:46.660 --> 40:51.260]  So he made me a co-defendant with the FDA, and they immediately dropped the lawsuit because
[40:51.260 --> 40:54.660]  they knew we'd prevail again, and they didn't want the precedent in the Supreme Court.
[40:54.660 --> 40:55.940]  Yeah, they do that a lot.
[40:55.940 --> 41:01.660]  They create these fake trials where one party loses on purpose to create bad precedent.
[41:01.660 --> 41:05.580]  But again, expanding on this, you've been talking about this for 30-plus years, but
[41:05.580 --> 41:13.180]  now all the cutting-edge science says, super-nutrient, dense, trace elements, you need this.
[41:13.180 --> 41:18.140]  And I noticed even most of the other big vitamin companies, they don't promote all these trace
[41:18.140 --> 41:19.140]  elements.
[41:19.140 --> 41:24.620]  Tell people, for example, why something like Beyond Tangy Tangerine at InfowarsTeam.com,
[41:24.620 --> 41:28.140]  why that is so important and has such a dramatic effect.
[41:28.140 --> 41:30.540]  Well, that one was 10 years in the making.
[41:30.540 --> 41:35.980]  It actually is the same technology as coffee crystals where it instantizes in room-temperature
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.820]  water, which is really a great product, has 115 super-juices in it.
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.620]  Now, there's a lot of super-juices on the market.
[41:41.620 --> 41:47.140]  We love them, things like mangosteen, goji, aciberi, noni, pomegranate juice.
[41:47.140 --> 41:51.740]  They all increase your antioxidant, auric points, and protect you from chemicals in
[41:51.740 --> 41:54.980]  the environment to reduce your risk of cancer and heart disease.
[41:54.980 --> 42:01.140]  So we put 115, 115 super-juices in this one product, Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[42:01.140 --> 42:07.060]  It has 130 nutrients, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and there's nothing like it in
[42:07.060 --> 42:08.060]  the market.
[42:08.060 --> 42:13.980]  So this comes down to an average-sized person of $3 a day, which is less than a cup of exotic
[42:13.980 --> 42:17.020]  coffee, less than a third of the cost of a cup of exotic coffee.
[42:17.020 --> 42:18.900]  So we're very proud of that product.
[42:18.900 --> 42:20.260]  It makes life simple.
[42:20.260 --> 42:25.540]  You can take that and you throw in the Omega-3s, you throw in your trace minerals, and you
[42:25.540 --> 42:28.220]  have the perfect 90 essential nutrients.
[42:28.220 --> 42:33.300]  And this in the animal industry has eliminated 900 different diseases, still plague people.
[42:33.300 --> 42:38.020]  And we're seeing so many people come to us and say, gosh, I was on the foot amputation
[42:38.020 --> 42:42.740]  list, and now I can jump off of four-foot stages because I've been able to cancel the
[42:42.740 --> 42:43.740]  amputation of my feet.
[42:43.740 --> 42:49.620]  I've been able to wean myself off of medication that I've been on for 25 years with Diabetes.
[42:49.620 --> 42:55.020]  I actually have one guy, Alex, who owns a big medical laboratory.
[42:55.020 --> 42:58.820]  And he services 7,000 hospitals a day.
[42:58.820 --> 43:04.260]  He knows everybody when it comes to Diabetes, and his Diabetes was out of control.
[43:04.260 --> 43:09.220]  And following the medical system, we put him on our little program with the Alex pack,
[43:09.220 --> 43:13.340]  and then throwing in the secret sauce I call it, the sweeties, with the Alex pack.
[43:13.340 --> 43:16.700]  And within one year's time, actually it was much sooner than that, but within one year's
[43:16.700 --> 43:23.940]  time he admitted that we had cut his blood sugar by two-thirds, and now without medication,
[43:23.940 --> 43:28.300]  his blood sugar is down to like 60, 62, 65.
[43:28.300 --> 43:33.260]  His A1C hemoglobin is below five, and he couldn't get it even near that with medication
[43:33.260 --> 43:34.260]  for years.
[43:34.260 --> 43:37.540]  Dr. Wallach, explain at the metabolic level what's happening.
[43:37.540 --> 43:41.940]  Why is Type 2 Diabetes and other types exploding off the charts?
[43:41.940 --> 43:45.620]  Again, multi-thousand percent increases in the last few decades.
[43:45.620 --> 43:49.940]  They say it's set to double again in the next decade.
[43:49.940 --> 43:50.940]  What is happening?
[43:50.940 --> 43:52.620]  And of course, the system knows what they're doing.
[43:52.620 --> 43:56.660]  I mean, I see them, they say, drink Diet Coke when you have Diabetes, then I have medical
[43:56.660 --> 44:00.780]  doctors on, and they say that aspartame totally accelerates it.
[44:00.780 --> 44:03.500]  So this is so cold-blooded.
[44:03.500 --> 44:04.500]  You're exactly right.
[44:04.500 --> 44:08.660]  Well, first of all, we've known for 60 years, Alex, that Type 2 Diabetes is a simple mineral
[44:08.660 --> 44:10.020]  deficiency.
[44:10.020 --> 44:14.220]  We learned this in the animal industry, and it was actually, the research was done by
[44:14.220 --> 44:21.180]  one of the heads of the US Department of Agriculture, a guy by the name of Mertz, Walter Mertz,
[44:21.180 --> 44:27.020]  and he discovered unimpeachably that Type 2 Diabetes is a simple mineral deficiency disease.
[44:27.020 --> 44:31.060]  They throw in the transphadiases, which he spoke about earlier, and I was so happy to
[44:31.060 --> 44:36.220]  hear you say that, the transphadiases heterocyclic, it means terrible chemicals caused by improper
[44:36.220 --> 44:39.740]  processing of food and overcooking of food.
[44:39.740 --> 44:43.300]  And this injures the cell walls and makes them unresponsive to insulin.
[44:43.300 --> 44:47.580]  Well, by getting people off the bad stuff, we call it the fried foods and the processed
[44:47.580 --> 44:52.820]  meats with nitrates and nitrites, and getting them on the Alex pack and the secret sauce,
[44:52.820 --> 44:57.580]  which is the sweeties, appropriate for body weight, usually within anywhere from 12 hours
[44:57.580 --> 45:02.540]  to two weeks, they're being able to wean off their medication because suddenly now their
[45:02.540 --> 45:07.460]  cell walls are sensitive to insulin, and they're able to use minimal amounts of insulin, which
[45:07.460 --> 45:08.460]  they make themselves.
[45:08.460 --> 45:10.860]  The Type 2 Diabetics make tons of insulin.
[45:10.860 --> 45:14.820]  It's not an insulin problem when you have Type 2 diabetes, it's a mineral deficiency
[45:14.820 --> 45:19.300]  and a lack of sensitization of the cell walls to insulin.
[45:19.300 --> 45:23.100]  And the system knows that, but they don't want to tell people.
[45:23.100 --> 45:26.060]  Let's move on to the next subject, cancer.
[45:26.060 --> 45:28.340]  Pediatric cancer, you can look this up.
[45:28.340 --> 45:30.980]  Cancers that didn't exist are now incredibly common in children.
[45:30.980 --> 45:35.780]  It's an epidemic, 10,000 plus percentage increase on average.
[45:35.780 --> 45:39.140]  Adults, multi-thousand increases, breast cancer.
[45:39.140 --> 45:42.940]  Again, it's always find the cure, not the cause.
[45:42.940 --> 45:49.660]  And I liken it to, if I walked outside and got shot, and suddenly thousands of people
[45:49.660 --> 45:52.740]  today were being shot in the town where I live, and they went, we've got to find a way
[45:52.740 --> 45:58.060]  to cure bullet wounds, no, let's find out why thousands of people today are being shot
[45:58.060 --> 45:59.660]  and stop whoever's shooting them.
[45:59.660 --> 46:03.020]  Or if I was to run out in front of a truck and get run over, let's figure out how to
[46:03.020 --> 46:06.980]  regenerate bones magically, no, don't walk out in front of a truck.
[46:06.980 --> 46:10.260]  Why don't they ever want to discuss why all this is increasing?
[46:10.260 --> 46:14.180]  They never want to talk about neurological disorders off the charts.
[46:14.180 --> 46:17.340]  Every disease, bone and joint, everything.
[46:17.340 --> 46:18.540]  What's happening with cancer?
[46:18.540 --> 46:19.860]  What's happening with all of it?
[46:19.860 --> 46:26.300]  Well, there's a great series of billboards on the highways in Cook County around Chicago.
[46:26.300 --> 46:30.100]  It says, hot dogs cause butt cancer.
[46:30.100 --> 46:35.260]  And this is because of the trans fatty acids in there, plus the nitrates and nitrites.
[46:35.260 --> 46:37.340]  And this message is for kids, as you point out.
[46:37.340 --> 46:40.220]  For kids, cancer is just going crazy.
[46:40.220 --> 46:42.540]  Colon cancer, for instance, used to be an adult disease.
[46:42.540 --> 46:47.180]  Now you're finding colon cancer in young adults in their 20s because they've been eating
[46:47.180 --> 46:51.580]  processed meats with nitrates and nitrites in them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[46:51.580 --> 46:54.500]  And either from fast food places, these things are cooked at home.
[46:54.500 --> 46:59.220]  We're talking about things like deli slices, sandwich meats, sausage, ham, bacon, bologna,
[46:59.220 --> 47:05.340]  salami, pastrami, pepperoni, jerky, spam, all these things that they put even on pizza.
[47:05.340 --> 47:11.780]  These meats with nitrates and nitrites in them increase the risk of colon cancer, as
[47:11.780 --> 47:14.060]  you point out, thousands of percent.
[47:14.060 --> 47:17.340]  Just by burning your meat, if you cook your meat well done, which the medical system tells
[47:17.340 --> 47:22.580]  you to do, it increases the risk of breast cancer by 462 percent, according to the University
[47:22.580 --> 47:24.100]  of South Carolina.
[47:24.100 --> 47:28.660]  And so if you just give a processed meats with nitrates and nitrites, each year meat
[47:28.660 --> 47:32.500]  cooked medium or medium rare, you supplement with the 90th century nutrients and get your
[47:32.500 --> 47:38.420]  antioxidant points, auric points, above 50,000 for kids and above 100,000 a day for adults.
[47:38.420 --> 47:40.500]  You'll reduce your risk of cancer to just about zero.
[47:40.500 --> 47:45.060]  And that sounds pretty bold, Alex, but we've known this from the animal studies for years
[47:45.060 --> 47:49.060]  and years and years, and I find it amazing that doctors say, well, you can't trust animal
[47:49.060 --> 47:53.740]  studies because it's not in humans, and yet they trust animal studies for drugs, and that's
[47:53.740 --> 47:58.780]  why we have such trouble with drugs killing so many people.
[47:58.780 --> 48:05.780]  Drugs are, I don't know, they probably kill 100 times more people each day than street
[48:05.780 --> 48:10.560]  drugs, and it should be a war on drugs in hospitals and doctor's office, not a war on
[48:10.560 --> 48:12.860]  drugs in the street.
[48:12.860 --> 48:16.140]  And you can back up all those numbers.
[48:16.140 --> 48:17.140]  Yes, sir.
[48:17.140 --> 48:22.220]  Folks, all I can say is go to infowarsteam.com today, purchase the products there, sign
[48:22.220 --> 48:26.180]  up, become a distributor, and it also supports the infowar at the same time.
[48:26.180 --> 48:32.980]  We've got the lowest prices there on the Ungevity Products at infowarsteam.com or 877-551-1301.
[48:32.980 --> 48:37.500]  If you want to call folks that have joined our team and become members of our operation
[48:37.500 --> 48:43.540]  here to educate people, 877-551-1301, they can tell you how to become a distributor for
[48:43.540 --> 48:49.820]  it because I promote what I believe in, and I believe in private property, the family,
[48:49.820 --> 48:55.580]  the Second Amendment, national sovereignty, and I know that the elites are all obsessed.
[48:55.580 --> 48:59.420]  Doc Wallach, I've been reading articles even in the LA Times and in other papers where
[48:59.420 --> 49:03.700]  the elites know everything you know.
[49:03.700 --> 49:10.540]  They're obsessed with trace elements and raw minerals, the type of stuff that you've developed,
[49:10.540 --> 49:11.980]  and not these synthetic ones.
[49:11.980 --> 49:13.940]  They are obsessed with purified water.
[49:13.940 --> 49:18.020]  They don't eat GMO at the Monsanto Laboratory.
[49:18.020 --> 49:20.820]  The London Independent and AP reported more than a decade ago.
[49:20.820 --> 49:21.820]  I heard this like a month ago.
[49:21.820 --> 49:25.300]  I went and looked it up, and it was something I didn't know over a decade old, and there
[49:25.300 --> 49:30.380]  were some new articles where at all the Monsanto facilities, their scientists refused to have
[49:30.380 --> 49:37.140]  GMO served in the cafeteria on these research reservations.
[49:37.140 --> 49:38.420]  The Queen of England is obsessed.
[49:38.420 --> 49:43.020]  The Chinese elite who are shoveling GMO and all this at their people, they are obsessed.
[49:43.020 --> 49:47.940]  It turns out they have secret government gardens for their food.
[49:47.940 --> 49:50.460]  This is mainstream news, though.
[49:50.460 --> 49:56.260]  Why do you think the controllers know this and enjoy shoveling this at the population?
[49:56.260 --> 50:01.940]  Well, Alex, there's no doubt the research shows very clearly that chemicals in our
[50:01.940 --> 50:07.940]  diet and GMOs and all these various things you've mentioned do have a terrible impact
[50:07.940 --> 50:13.500]  upon the human physiology, and that supplementing with all 90 essential nutrients like you find
[50:13.500 --> 50:15.980]  in the Alex pack do protect you.
[50:15.980 --> 50:20.780]  Well, this is extremely well known in the human health industry.
[50:20.780 --> 50:26.020]  It's certainly known at the high government levels, and these people, what should I say,
[50:26.020 --> 50:31.620]  they're certainly in it for themselves, and I think it's a form of enslavement.
[50:31.620 --> 50:36.940]  This is very seductive, and even a Senate committee came out and said that the medical
[50:36.940 --> 50:39.580]  system has learned how to game the insurance system.
[50:39.580 --> 50:43.620]  They'll bill for eight different agencies for one procedure they did.
[50:43.620 --> 50:46.420]  Even then, I would go to jail for insurance fraud if we did that.
[50:46.420 --> 50:50.620]  The doctors get a walk because they spend more money on pack committees than any other
[50:50.620 --> 50:56.140]  group of individuals, and so the elected officials love the medical system because of the money
[50:56.140 --> 51:00.340]  that flows to the pack committees from the medical system in the pharmaceutical industry.
[51:00.340 --> 51:04.580]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods

[54:05.260 --> 54:09.940]  These stories were telling, Aaron losing 91 pounds, it was like 87 pounds a month ago
[54:09.940 --> 54:14.780]  when he was on, I've lost over 40 pounds, Ted Anderson was going to have knee surgery,
[54:14.780 --> 54:20.340]  he hobbled around when he came to visit me, an old sports injury, he went on the essential
[54:20.340 --> 54:27.820]  fatty acids and the osteo FX plus, and all of that, and his knee feels great.
[54:27.820 --> 54:31.260]  You hit the nail on the head, and I have one too, and actually this happens hundreds
[54:31.260 --> 54:35.660]  of times a year, maybe even a month, I just don't know about it all, but one case out
[54:35.660 --> 54:39.540]  of Charlotte, North Carolina, to make a long story short, a six-year two-year-old guy was
[54:39.540 --> 54:45.780]  diagnosed by five neurological clinics as having terminal Alzheimer's disease, his sister
[54:45.780 --> 54:49.540]  was told to put him in a hospice, the end was near, she didn't want to believe it, she
[54:49.540 --> 54:54.180]  took him to the medical school in Greensboro, insisted that the head of the department of
[54:54.180 --> 54:59.060]  neurology, their exam, and he did, said the same thing, terminal Alzheimer's disease,
[54:59.060 --> 55:03.260]  and in one week on the Alex pack, and getting off all the bad stuff, and eating 12 eggs
[55:03.260 --> 55:08.340]  a day to rebuild the myelin in the brain, in one week's time, according to the doctors
[55:08.340 --> 55:12.980]  there, he's perfectly 100% normal, this guy's back to work, he does not have Alzheimer's
[55:12.980 --> 55:16.020]  disease anymore, and I don't think it was Alzheimer's disease, I think it was actually
[55:16.020 --> 55:20.780]  a disease called Korsakov's syndrome, which is curable in one to two weeks, Alzheimer's
[55:20.780 --> 55:25.220]  disease is preventable by 80% according to Johns Hopkins, and by the way I got to interrupt
[55:25.220 --> 55:28.900]  you, when you were on like a year and a half ago, and we're saying all this, I was like
[55:28.900 --> 55:32.660]  come on Wallach, I know this stuff's good, but I don't believe this, now I've seen it
[55:32.660 --> 55:37.580]  happen over and over again, my entire family rave reviews, my dad who's a dentist was
[55:37.580 --> 55:42.500]  like yeah, I'll write till he got on it, but I now go to events in Dallas and then
[55:42.500 --> 55:46.660]  one in Florida, and I've done a lot of events over the years, it's never about health, people
[55:46.660 --> 55:49.820]  come up and say my wife was going to be in a wheelchair, she went on this and it came
[55:49.820 --> 55:54.340]  back, or my mom had Alzheimer's and it's reversed it, I mean this is what's incredible,
[55:54.340 --> 56:00.500]  is this is really real, and the system knows this, and there's such pieces of trash that
[56:00.500 --> 56:04.340]  they will not tell people because they want to suck money out of them, I mean that is
[56:04.340 --> 56:09.100]  incredible doc, I want to go to calls, but what's your take on that, I mean I have people
[56:09.100 --> 56:14.060]  now calling me in droves saying wow, this really does work.
[56:14.060 --> 56:18.300]  You're exactly right Alex, and it's a form of slavery, and in fact in the back of one
[56:18.300 --> 56:22.740]  of my books I said that it's called Black Gene Lies, where all the diseases of black
[56:22.740 --> 56:27.460]  people are thought to be genetic, or at least promoted to be genetic by the medical community,
[56:27.460 --> 56:32.180]  and of course I said no, these are simple nutritional deficiencies, it was actually
[56:32.180 --> 56:36.540]  the publication of that book was subsidized by a pastor in Atlanta, Georgia, Creflo Dollar
[56:36.540 --> 56:42.460]  paid for that book to be published called Black Gene Lies, and this is beginning to
[56:42.460 --> 56:46.660]  go through the black community, and they're reversing within days and weeks and months
[56:46.660 --> 56:50.100]  all these diseases that are thought to be genetic in the black community, and you're
[56:50.100 --> 56:54.500]  going to see an uprising here, and in that book on the back cover I said the black community
[56:54.500 --> 57:00.980]  has exchanged the chains of slavery to slavery from people in white coats and sethoscopes
[57:00.980 --> 57:06.660]  because of this genetic belief, and they have enslaved us because they have diseases that
[57:06.660 --> 57:10.380]  are simple nutritional deficiencies, they say are genetic, one of which I was actually
[57:10.380 --> 57:17.540]  fired from Emory University in Atlanta back in 1978, I discovered the first non-human
[57:17.540 --> 57:21.740]  case of cystic fibrosis, learned how to reproduce it, learned the cause prevention and cure
[57:21.740 --> 57:26.220]  of cystic fibrosis in 1978, and they fired me because they thought I was sniffing glue,
[57:26.220 --> 57:32.380]  well I actually received an international award in 2011 for that work 35 years ago,
[57:32.380 --> 57:38.100]  and we now, and no Jerry Lewis was not on the telethon this last year, and the reason
[57:38.100 --> 57:42.460]  was we gave him the data, we've been working on mustardistry, we believe we have found
[57:42.460 --> 57:46.020]  the cause prevention and cure of mustardistry, we gave it to Jerry, we thought since they're
[57:46.020 --> 57:51.460]  Jerry's kids he should be the one to make the announcement, and the mustardistry foundation
[57:51.460 --> 57:54.780]  fired Jerry Lewis because he brought him our data.
[57:54.780 --> 57:58.020]  I didn't know that, that's breaking, I want to come back because I was just in Abbey for
[57:58.020 --> 58:05.420]  the hour but we've run out of time, I want to talk to Matt, Craig, William, CJ and Kevin,
[58:05.420 --> 58:09.780]  they all want to talk to you, and again we don't screen calls, I have no idea what they're
[58:09.780 --> 58:15.060]  calling in about but that should be interesting, if you can do it, I see people standing behind
[58:15.060 --> 58:17.900]  you there, I guess you may have to go somewhere, we'll find out if Dr. Wallach can stay with
[58:17.900 --> 58:24.740]  us, but undoubtedly people have mineral and vitamin deficiencies, and a lot of the vitamin
[58:24.740 --> 58:28.020]  deficiencies, they buy us synthetic, go right through you, you need it in the powdered form
[58:28.020 --> 58:33.740]  and the different formulations from the Injevity at infowarseteam.com, this stuff is miraculous
[58:33.740 --> 58:43.580]  and we all need to be healthy, this is a revolution against tyranny, infowarseteam.com.
[58:43.580 --> 58:50.820]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.820 --> 58:55.500]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[58:55.500 --> 58:59.820]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[58:59.820 --> 59:04.140]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:04.140 --> 59:09.220]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[59:09.220 --> 59:11.180]  grid technology is coming.
[59:11.180 --> 59:15.500]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[59:15.500 --> 59:19.520]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[59:19.520 --> 59:22.980]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[59:22.980 --> 59:26.700]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[59:26.700 --> 59:31.420]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:31.420 --> 59:35.220]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[59:35.220 --> 59:36.620]  one of my old sponsors.
[59:36.620 --> 59:42.540]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[59:42.540 --> 59:46.940]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call
[59:46.940 --> 59:53.940]  1-877-327-0365.
[59:53.940 --> 01:00:05.940]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.780]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:20.300]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.300]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:29.140]  Man, we have got a show that I'm so excited about, and I had announced a few days ago
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.500]  that Lord Moncton was going to be here in studio, but then I got so busy this morning
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:41.420]  I forgot, and then there's Lord Moncton walking around in the office, really interesting person
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.140]  and has quite a presence in person.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.420]  So he's here, and he's with us in studio in the second hour.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.260]  But I thought about, why don't we just get him in here a half hour early, so we have
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.340]  an hour and a half with him.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.900]  I think that's really important to do, but he's back there checking email and doing
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]  news research.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.580]  So we're going to have him with us, and then Max Kaiser in the third hour, he's been here
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:06.740]  in the United States last few weeks, normally over in France, obviously it's going to be
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.420]  a great day to have him on because of the Facebook pump and dump, but also the meltdown
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:16.180]  taking place in Europe that we've all predicted here with precision.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.660]  So that is coming up today.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.900]  Last week, Aaron comes to me, he goes, I'm doing the nightly news tonight, I've done
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:28.700]  research, the CIA's behind it, they're going to pump and dump 100 billion and sucker the
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.860]  Facebook people that know nothing about the stock market, because the big analysts groups
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.220]  are saying there's nothing there but advertising.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:40.660]  There aren't products like Google and others have or even Microsoft or look at Apple, products
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.100]  galore and innovative, even though they're made at Foxconn by slaves and they have suicide
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.100]  nets.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:54.140]  The point is, is that it's not based in tangibles, way overvalued, and another claiming, problem
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.020]  in early trading would cause this, they probably did that on purpose, so they could always
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:03.060]  say that was the problem, and it's massively down, huge pump and dump, we're going to have
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.220]  Max Kaiser on about that, in fact, Max was coming on about the Euro meltdown, but we
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.780]  email Max so he knows, he'll be up on the pump and dump, I don't even know that's his
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:15.020]  opinion, it's a pump and dump, but it is a pump and dump, so he's a former stockbroker
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.980]  with George Soros's son and people, so he can certainly give us the inside scoop on
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.620]  all of those things that are taking place.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:35.220]  Obviously, there is massive news at infowars.com, we are going to be, I'm a little bit flummoxed
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.660]  because all of a sudden I go, what is this, a bunch of people in the studio, like one
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.100]  minute before I go live, or two minutes before I go live, and I run out there and it's Lord
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.660]  Montan and Associates, and I was admonished for not curtsying properly, actually that's
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:52.260]  a joke, he did make a joke about that though, and kind of got me off track, but in a good
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.340]  way, we're launching the new social network today, and I'll tell you about that on the
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.980]  other side, and we've been beta testing it quietly, the people that are members of infowars
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:09.060]  insider, that are members of the free email, you can sign up on the side of infowars.com
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.900]  to that, and it's already, I don't know, like 10,000 people or something on it, without
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.860]  us even promoting it, we just sent it out to some email folks, that are members and
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.300]  some prisonpointer.tv subscribers, and it's in beta, and it's where you can post your
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.260]  photos, your videos, what you're into, what you like, groups you can join, whether you
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:30.380]  want to meet people to go hunting, or training for defense, or looking for people to go out
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:36.780]  for a date, we have a liberty lovers section there, because last time we had a little social
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.100]  network that got like 30 something thousand members and crashed, it was just a little
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.260]  plug in, and I ran into so many people on the street that met each other and have children
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.140]  from it, and they're like, I'm like wow, with a tinker toy social network, that we just
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:53.860]  did an alert that crashed after about six months and couldn't be revived, because it
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.660]  wasn't built to handle that, did that, wow, this is going to be great, so it's a free
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:05.660]  for all, just no porn, no calls for violence, no hacking stuff, because it'll try to use
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.900]  that to shut the site down, but we have our DMCA file, so it's third party stuff, we get
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.020]  contacted for violations and stuff, it's not our fault, we just take it down, we've hired
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.580]  a couple moderators to be able to handle that, so it's been a big investment here, and so
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.540]  thank you for supporting us, thank you for supporting the sponsors, buying the great
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:28.860]  pro pure water filters at infowars.com, and getting discounts, buying the books, the videos,

[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.220]  right now, my point is, is that this book's basically out of print, very hard to get,
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:48.060]  we have a discounted at infowars.com, a free citizen rule book, and it's the book The Globalist
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:53.220]  do not want you to read, Harold Quigley, a beautiful hardcover, available at infowars.com,

[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.500]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver, and deliver the solution directly
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.660]  into the bloodstream, by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:19.900]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:25.540]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:32.420]  solutions, and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.840]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:41.460]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver, with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:04.780]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks, adding poison to your water, and laughing
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.500]  as you get sick and die?
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.620]  Start purifying your water, with ProPure, my friends, I've done a lot of research, and

[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.180]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:42.460]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.780]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there, it's what my family uses.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:51.420]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code

[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.580]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:09.340]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle, did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.500]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.940]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:18.100]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.260]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.260]  seeds.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:28.580]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.420]  food for you and your family.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.660]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.260]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.500]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:48.300]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.460]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:57.300]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:04.300]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:35.260]  Facebook users, dumb bleepers, he says, these people trust me, ha ha ha ha, they're so stupid.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:42.580]  Just like that movie, Face in the Crowd, that's exactly what the system thinks of the population.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:48.940]  And I hate con artists, I hate people that prey on good innocent people and think it's
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.540]  cool and think it's funny.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:56.140]  And I told you last week, actually Aaron Dykes came to me like last Monday, we said, you
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:00.300]  brought a cover of this, it's CIA, all these people are involved, well you remember he
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.940]  came on Aaron and talked about it, and I brought up the fact that I ran into the president
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:09.020]  of Facebook, the guy that started Napster at a party with Billy Corrigan of Smashing
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.620]  Pumpkins and Aaron's like, you're kidding, is this the photo?
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.580]  And I go, yeah, that's Parker, he goes, you didn't know he's Bilderberg, and I'm like,
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.580]  no.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:21.460]  I just saw him run around for like three hours in a crazed fashion, no kidding, at a party,
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:26.700]  like he was souped up on something, but I looked in his eyes, he looked like he was
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:31.220]  on drugs, the point is, and then Aaron's like, no, that's exactly what they say he acts
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.820]  like, that's what the movie about him says he's like.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:39.340]  But my point is, is that Aaron said they're gonna pump and dump, and people don't know
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:44.940]  what a pump and dump is, you hype up a stock, get all of the people that aren't savvy involved
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:49.700]  in it, you dump it behind the scenes.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.740]  And then leave everybody holding the bag.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:58.100]  And obviously it wasn't worth $100 billion at its initial offering.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:02.620]  Obviously all these little Facebookians ran in to get involved in it, and it is just plunging
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.260]  right now, plunging, plunging, plunging.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:11.400]  And the media is acting like it's funny and it's cute, just like Corzine stealing billions
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.460]  and refusing to give it back and being caught lying to Congress and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.780]  This is a group of trucks, people say, well, why are you on Facebook then?
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:24.820]  Well, listeners created more than 50 Facebook accounts, one guy had more than 20, he gave
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:29.620]  them to us, one of them has like 300,000 likes, another has 200,000 likes, people following
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:37.740]  it, and we've used it as a beach head to inject our videos, our articles, our information.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:46.020]  Our article last week about him being a scammer is up on our Facebook, so that's like saying,
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.940]  why are you on a battlefield when the enemy is on the battlefield?
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:55.340]  I mean, that's moronic, that's where the war is taking place, that's where the fight
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.660]  is happening.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:01.820]  And so we're on Twitter at Real Alex Jones, that's a total state department, CIA front,
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:05.140]  just look it up, I told you that before it was in the news, now it's in the news, Google
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.060]  was founded by CIA, I told you that seven, eight years ago with witnesses and experts,
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.300]  gave you the names, it's now commonplace knowledge.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.780]  I'm not bragging, if you better listen to what we say here, because about 99% of the
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.460]  time it's stunningly accurate, sometimes I'll listen to rebroadcast and just get something
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.380]  totally wrong, because when you're talking for three hours every day, your mind gets
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.900]  stuff twisted around the axle, that happens to everybody, but we try to tell the truth,
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:34.340]  we try to be accurate, we try to get it right, we try to give you piercing in-depth analysis
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.940]  with facts.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:42.700]  The system tries to dumb it all down as a feedback loop to dumb down society.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:48.380]  So a full hour with Max Keiser coming up, Lord Moncton in studio for an hour and a half
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:53.140]  coming up in about 20 minutes, you do not want to miss that.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:59.740]  All of that said, we meant to launch the social network a year ago, got busy with other commitments
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.980]  with the nightly news, getting that launched, all of the things we're doing, hiring reporters,
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:10.180]  leaving up the staff, trying to get the sponsors to be able to pay for everything, we've successfully
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.620]  gotten up to that level, thanks to your support.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:18.420]  Certainly not to mine, the sales guys are always, you're not plugging the sponsors,
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.540]  they've paid for this, you've got to get this done, even though I love the sponsors, I
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.820]  just get so busy covering the news, but the point is, is that we're building this media
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.260]  operation in the face of the globalist, they might shut us down tomorrow, it might be in
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.820]  10 years, we might beat them.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:40.460]  Today is the rest of our lives, we can change our destinies, today if we take action.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.820]  Your destiny, your fate is in your hands.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:48.240]  We are not pathetic little spectators that can be defeated, but it's interesting that
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:55.380]  all of the problems we've had, all the preparation, because it's got a lot of nice features, but
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:05.060]  also elegant and simple in ways, our new social network, PlanetInfoWars.com, it is very beefy
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:12.180]  so that it can handle millions of people using it, as we scale it up.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:19.500]  So we are officially launching it here today, in the midst of the big CIA globalist, Silicon
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.260]  Valley mafia, Bilderberg group, literally there's like four Bilderberg group guys in
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:30.260]  Facebook, we are launching this, not as a challenge to it, it's obviously not going
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:35.960]  to get 200 million people on it, if it gets a million, I'll be absolutely happy.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.900]  It's that it's a place for those of us that love liberty to organize and get together.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:45.540]  Talk show host, other websites, I was on Mancow show this morning, invited him to come set
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:50.620]  up the Mancow army there, it doesn't matter who it is, it's there for you to build your
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:55.620]  own group, your own site, your own area, and to point at your own websites, your radio
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.180]  shows, your TV shows, whatever you're doing, or folks that create fan sites for people they
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.820]  think are doing a good job, it's there to meet people to go mountain climbing or go
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:09.060]  hiking, it's there to meet people who are into guns or into manufacturing, or there
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.900]  are people that want to promote businesses, it's there for people that want to meet and
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:20.300]  go target shooting for your military reenactment, Militia, whatever the case is, it's all there
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.300]  there.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:27.940]  But again, no porn, you put people with bikinis on your website, that's fine with me, nothing
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:34.540]  wrong with God's creations, but I don't want porn, I don't want calls to violence, we're
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:40.740]  not going to have stalking on there, we're not going to have people defaming little
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:47.620]  guys, you want to attack big people, that's your site, we're going to have a pretty light
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:58.060]  hand to this when it comes to, I don't know the word you'd use, it's not censored but
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:05.060]  it's protect the site, and I'm training the people on basically it being pretty wild west,
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:09.860]  but we're going to follow all the laws and everything, and it's under DMCA, so people
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:16.100]  make claims on the material and then it'll be taken down, but plus we don't host anything
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:21.100]  on the site, your photos, everything are linked in, your videos are linked in, so we're not
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.260]  going to have a lot of issues with that, the point is I'm kind of getting into technical
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:29.820]  matters that don't matter, we are launching it, please help us get it out to everybody,
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.860]  please email your email, please Twitter it, please Facebook it, I wonder if we've even
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:40.380]  sent out on the real Alex Jones Twitter, like I'm going to go to our Twitter, twitter.com
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.300]  forward slash real Alex Jones, and I'm going to see if we've even twittered this out, because
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:52.580]  we're so busy just getting this stuff built that the question is, have we even, yes we've
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:58.420]  twittered it out, Planet Info Wars, rallying point for the resistance, yes, yes good, I
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.500]  usually do the twittering but I forget sometimes and I'd say about half the Twitter's are
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.740]  monitored a little bit more, but the tweets that are sent out, you see like an article
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:11.780]  from Prison Planet, it's Watson, and yes Watson has sent it out, Planet Info Wars, rallying
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:16.860]  point for the resistance, connect, create, organize with powerful new social networking
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.980]  hub, and this is a place, you know, if you go on Facebook, the big sites they leave alone
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:26.100]  but it's been documented, you go on Facebook and you say, the queen is a pig, I hate her,
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.700]  you know, do you believe, whether somebody agrees with that or doesn't agree with that,
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:33.460]  it's your free speech, Facebook takes it down, you go on there and say, George Bush is a
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:38.100]  piece of filth for launching these wars or Obama is a piece of garbage for carbon taxes,
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:43.340]  they take your site down, YouTube is censoring more, Google is censoring people that have
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.780]  blogs with them for very mild stuff, I mean this is happening, there's also a video posted
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.180]  on our Twitter I notice, a three and a half minute video where I break down the site as
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:59.700]  well, so I just want to encourage everybody, in fact we come back from break, I'll play
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:06.100]  that video, to go to planetinfowars.com and organize, you've got a group in your town
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:14.260]  fighting fluoride, go in there and say, you know, the name of your town, you know, Cornville,
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:19.460]  Missouri, let's get fluoride out of our water, create a group, network and as more people
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.460]  get in there, you're going to find others that are doing it in your area, we should
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:28.780]  create a local media area, things that we found that work, we should create a micro
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:34.100]  FM, people that have one watt, you know, transmitters that cover a half mile of their neighborhood,
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.340]  people put those up, it doesn't interfere with the AM and FM, if you do it on an area
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.980]  that's open and then put up signs around your neighborhood, you know, restream shows, do
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.300]  your own show, play music, whatever and then people start tuning into that, we should have
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.420]  an area about access TV, my experience is some tips, those of you that have done that,
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.500]  how folks can do it, do it, turn it loose, do a micro FM area, do an access TV area,
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:02.300]  do a local newspaper area, if you've already done it, teach people how to do a local newspaper,
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:06.460]  you can just print up on a computer and hand out to your neighbors and maybe put a sponsor
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.020]  on it or something, you know, a couple hundred bucks a week to put one out just in the neighborhood,
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.700]  that's how big things start, you've got to take that first action, turn it loose, create
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.500]  the groups, create the areas, write articles on the site, then people can vote them up to
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.500]  the front page, we're going to start having our moderators go over articles that look
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.340]  powerful, have an area at the bottom of Info Wars, we're going to start having some boxes
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.300]  down there so I can point to the bottom, which is actually one of the best areas on the website
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:38.180]  for people to go find stuff, we're going to have a box that has a feed of what people
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:45.420]  are saying at PlanetInfoWars.com, we're going to be adding more and more to PlanetInfoWars.com,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.980]  so check out PlanetInfoWars.com, that's where they got me on two screens, pumpkin head on
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:58.740]  two screens, help us, help us, wonder how Lord Moncan feels when he met me out there
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:06.220]  in person finally and he's in the presence of Hillbilly Royalty, Alex Jones, Royal Hillbilly,
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:15.060]  ha ha ha ha, anyways back to what I was saying, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time, now
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:23.500]  is the time, now is the time, PlanetInfoWars.com, when we've hired one of the moderators, she's
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:27.540]  going to be introducing you to her soon, she's going to be doing twice a week at least and
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:32.020]  we plan to start having it every day, it'll be like a live feed down the road where she
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:40.140]  sits there at a table and takes your calls and then comments, almost like that show they
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:45.620]  have Washington Journal on C-SPAN, where you sit there and talk about what's going on,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.660]  PlanetInfoWars.com is going to have twice a week news that's just on PlanetInfoWars.com
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.860]  about the site, about what people are doing, this is about empowering you, this is about
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:20:01.020]  turning the power of the people loose, it's PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:05.220]  I'd seen the Ungevity products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them, started
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:09.900]  using them, had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every day,
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:15.300]  what Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds, when I saw those results
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:19.980]  I said I'd better follow my own advice, started taking the Ungevity products and it's been
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:27.300]  incredible, 37 pounds in two months, our bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.940]  but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:36.540]  and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy, folks this
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.860]  is hidden hype, I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:46.900]  believe in and the amazing supplements available at infowarsteam.com have certainly delivered

[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:11.020]  I want you to know some very important information, in 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.300]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.780]  obtain this world-class healer, now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:25.220]  the world to keep people healthy, now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:04.100]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:09.180]  I designed our top-selling holster, the Super Tuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.420]  poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:17.780]  The Super Tuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:20.940]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:29.020]  Visit us at CrossbreedHolsters.com Don't forget, CrossbreedHolsters.com
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.500]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.900]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:34.900]  gold IRAs?
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:39.300]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.980]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.460]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:50.300]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237, don't get left behind by
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:55.300]  rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:59.300]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:11.260]  The decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room with
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.260]  the Pentagon.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.860]  When they realize there is no possibility of recalling the Wing, there will be only
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.620]  one course of action over, total commitment.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.500]  Mandry, do you recall what Clemens once said about war?
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.380]  No, I didn't think I knew what that was about.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.980]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:37.940]  When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.900]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:50.820]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.020]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:25:13.700]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:19.140]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up, Greece is now publicly saying they're probably
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.980]  going to exit the Euro.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.980]  We've got that news.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.980]  Max Kaiser coming up.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:27.700]  Lord Monk to the in-studio for an hour and a half coming up after this break.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:33.140]  We have also got this great image that popped up on the Internet.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.940]  Drone hunting permit.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:38.660]  Hunting methods allowed all.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:43.460]  No expiration, no bag limit, emergency issue, American citizens only.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:49.020]  If you want to see it, it's at the bottom right-hand corner of infowars.com right now.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.660]  And you can also link through there and see the video that we're about to play here in
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:59.860]  a moment that breaks down some of the features and things at planetinfowars.com.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:04.540]  By the way, national polls come out routinely.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.380]  Over 70% of Americans are now pro-second amendment.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.020]  It was 50-50 back in the 70s under the brainwashing.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:15.180]  It was over 70% were pro-abortion in the 80s.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.740]  There's a new Gallup poll out.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.940]  And this is with even mainline adults.
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.980]  It's even higher with young people.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.660]  Only 41% now support abortion.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.260]  So the numbers have more than reversed.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.940]  And it's over 75% with people under the age of 20.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:38.340]  And the last poll I saw, this one is on a wide spectrum of adults.
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:39.780]  So be sure and check that out.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.620]  Pro-choice Americans at record low.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.620]  It's not a choice.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.620]  It's killing a child.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:47.180]  I know a lot of you get really offended about this, but it's eugenics.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.780]  You've been sold how great this is.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:52.100]  It's an anti-human program.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]  And I'm sorry.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100]  That's where it came from.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.100]  Look it up.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.820]  You can debate whether it's the right or not in your world view.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.860]  But let's just be honest about where this came from.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.540]  Now they're saying kill grandma.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.540]  Bill Gates is.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:04.540]  Look it up.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.540]  You don't believe me.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:06.980]  Just say Bill Gates endorses death panels.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.780]  Look up Planned Parenthood and eugenics.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:13.860]  Look up how they say kill people up to age three now, these top professors.
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:15.620]  This is real.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.380]  This is happening.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.620]  This is going on.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:23.420]  But the point is more and more, despite all the globalist propaganda, people are waking
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.420]  up.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:29.220]  We're going to go to the audio for radio listeners in the video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers of
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:33.620]  the promo rollout of planetinfoowars.com.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:38.940]  So again, if you want to see that presentation, it is available at infoowars.com.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.220]  And it goes through some of the features.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:46.980]  And it pretty much announces and launches the website and tells you why we have it.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:53.060]  So that is up at planetinfoowars.com if you want to see that video and hear that audio
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.660]  where I rally the troops to take action against the globalist.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.900]  But again, Lord Moncton is coming up in the next segment.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:04.180]  And we're going to get into authoritarianism.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.500]  Its main push is under the rubric of environmentalism.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:15.860]  Not real environmental issues, but carbon taxes, globalism, carbon dioxide is evil.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.580]  Carbon dioxide is bad.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.060]  Carbon dioxide has got to be stopped.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.780]  Carbon dioxide is evil.
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:23.060]  We've got to have home inspections.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.580]  We've got to have green police.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.380]  We've got to have spy satellites and drones watching the farmers.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.580]  You can't build a barn.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.860]  Hay is a toxic pollutant.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.340]  Shut down the coal plants.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.740]  It's post-industrial.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.900]  It's war being waged against this country.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:47.220]  Do you remember the announcements that were made about how the coastlines were going to
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:52.420]  be by the year 2010 underwater and polar bears can't swim?
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:57.420]  My son went to a home school private school, Christian school, two days a week.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.420]  Nice people there.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.980]  But because they're accredited, it had Michelle Obama loves you.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.660]  She tells you what food to eat, your little pamphlets.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:09.860]  And polar bears can't swim, help save the polar bears, you know, do a class project
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860]  on that.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.900]  I mean, polar bears are the greatest land swimming animal.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.100]  They've been recorded swimming up to 300 miles.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:19.740]  They hunt on the ice floes, but they play this ignorance game and show people ice floes
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.740]  and say, look at them.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.740]  They're going to die.
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.740]  The baby's on the ice floe.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:27.660]  They're hunting whales and seals on them, okay?
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.020]  They go out and get on the ice packs in the flows and then later get back off and go back
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020]  to the mainland.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:37.220]  Maybe they go out and hunt, but they sit there and do that.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.460]  And meanwhile, this is distracting from all the real issues.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.820]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.820]  Stay with us.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:43.820]  Big broadcast lined up.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.380]  Board mounted straight ahead.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.380]  PlanetInFallWars.com.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.540]  Please help us get it out to everybody.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.820]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.300]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:30:01.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.660]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.660]  Direct.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:09.540]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best edible food on the planet.

[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.660]  we can all control, your greatest dependency, food.

[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.460]  in half.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.220]  You just can't afford to ignore this.

[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.340]  Don't let this offer pass you by.

[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.060]  For the best, for less guarantee.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:07.940]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.100]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:21.700]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:28.780]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:34.860]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:39.860]  Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:46.660]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.220]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.380]  ride all day with confidence.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.300]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.420]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:04.580]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.100]  you get sick and die?
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.300]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:12.980]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun,
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:17.460]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:20.980]  Its filters are silver and pregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:25.140]  There's no priming required, it's NSF42 certified.
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:30.180]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.700]  require electricity.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.620]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.020]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:42.420]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.780]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there, it's what my family uses.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.460]  ProPure.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code WATER
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:55.500]  at checkout, you get an additional 10% off and infowars.com.

[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:25.060]  I only invite all of you out there to be in on the ground level, it's waiting for you
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.380]  to breathe power into it.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:35.300]  PlanetInfoWars.com, all who love liberty are welcome, all that serve tyranny will be defeated.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:40.900]  It's now out in the open, world government is here, it's in our face, a corporate fascist
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:46.740]  system, surveilling us, Google, Facebook, Twitter, all promote the New World Order, they attend
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:47.740]  Bilderberg.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:52.820]  They've turned the internet into a giant illegal spying operation with Google admitting that
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:58.860]  they're basically an NSA CIA front, but despite all of that, their little propaganda stunts
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:05.940]  like Coney 2012 have been blowing up in their face because we have people power.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:12.180]  PlanetInfoWars.com is about people coming together, forming activist organizations, getting
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:17.460]  involved politically, hunting and fishing, gardening, dating, whatever the case is, this
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:25.460]  is a place for people who love freedom and that's why I have created PlanetInfoWars.com
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:31.940]  as a vehicle for you to meet and to talk and to write and to post information.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:37.260]  This is your tool, your website and I want to invite all the other alternative media
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:43.460]  to come in to PlanetInfoWars.com and to synergistically meet and turn loose your potential.
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:47.700]  For more than six years I've talked on the air about creating a social network but I
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:53.060]  was so busy with my radio show, the documentaries, all of it that I never did it properly.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:57.540]  We launched a small little plug-in social network, it got more than 40,000 members in
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:02.540]  just a few months and basically crashed and then I never revisited the subject until the
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:09.460]  last year and I went out to a public event, a UFC fight Joe Rogan invited me to it in Austin
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:15.340]  and two different couples came up to me and said, man we wish you'd set up a social network
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.940]  again, where did it go and I said oh it was just some little free program, it couldn't
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:25.380]  handle all the traffic and in both cases at that same evening they said we met four different
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:30.820]  people, two couples on your little plug-in site at infowars.com and we now have children
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:35.940]  and since then it's happened a couple other times so I realized a social network is important
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.820]  so people who love freedom can get together. That's what Liberty Lovers is going to be
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:47.020]  all about, a section we've created at planetinfowars.com. Whether you live in a small town or a big
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:53.540]  city, you can reach out to people in your area so that we can win the future away from
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.900]  Obama and Mitt Romney and all these globalists that try to give us all these fake choices
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.620]  and I give you this pledge, we are not going to spy on you and surveil you and sell your
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:11.140]  data to the New World Order. Planetinfowars.com is free. Planetinfowars.com is powered by
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:14.700]  you. We're going to have our articles up there, we'll have video feeds and stuff up
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:20.020]  there but this is all about you getting together and organizing the resistance against the
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:25.020]  New World Order. Ron Paul's been great but he himself has said this is simply a focal
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:31.300]  point for people that are already awake. Well this is Ron Paul 2.0, this is Alex Jones
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:38.460]  3.0, this is humanity 4.0, the power of infinity, this is about taking action, this is about
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:44.660]  turning humanity loose. Connect with people who are awake and know what we're facing.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:52.180]  Be active, organize, take action, go viral, create, contribute, resist because resistance
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:37:02.340]  is victory. You are victory and the rally point is planetinfowars.com.
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:09.380]  And we are back on this 23rd day. It is a Wednesday. Thank you for joining us. Now for
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:13.540]  the next hour and 25 minutes or so, Lord Christopher Monk is going to be in studio with us, we're
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:17.300]  going to have him in just a moment but here's some of the new headlines out. There's a new
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:22.980]  term out there, I know it's not Charlie Sheen saying winning, this is losing. The new term
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:28.820]  is not suckered or scammed, it's suckered. After the founder and the guy that called his
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:35.660]  users dumb efforts, well he is in a lot of trouble obviously as the pump and dump gets
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:40.260]  exposed. We told you last week at all the hallmarks of a pump and dump, if you don't
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:44.060]  know what a pump and dump is, they get a bunch of suckers who aren't savvy in the stock market,
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:50.300]  casino in there, sell it for a lot more than it's worth and why should those doing it care
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.940]  because they're just going to profit either way and be able to sell it off and that's
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:38:01.100]  what's already happening. Morgan Stanley is under review for it, NASDAQ would have pulled
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:07.620]  stock, again they're calling it suckered, Massachusetts the state is subpoenaing, investors
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:13.300]  are suing, insiders got greedy, they knew the jig was up, the site was already starting
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:20.140]  to decline, having problems, even Zuckerberg so sold. Now ladies and gentlemen, if he didn't
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:26.260]  go to jail, remember Martha Stewart, she sold almost nothing in her stock, it was routinely
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:31.100]  doing it, didn't do anything wrong, I reviewed it, had a lot of experts on, she went to prison
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:35.380]  because the big corrupt people on Wall Street, the insider cronies, most of them like Goldman
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:40.380]  Sachs funding the global warming movement, they're above the law, MF Global Head, Corzine,
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:44.780]  millions disappear, wires it to London, lies and says he didn't, comes out in Congress
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:49.260]  he did, Chicago Mercantile Exchange head comes out and says no, he was in the meetings,
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:56.780]  he did order it, doesn't get in trouble. If Zuckerberg does not get in trouble, ladies
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:05.500]  and gentlemen, this is incredible, the fact that he sold the day it went public, that
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:11.020]  is insider trading up one side and down the other, what an arrogant person, even if he
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.540]  thinks his users are dumb efforts as he said for trusting him, why would he say that in
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.420]  an interview, these people are arrogant, I've been at parties with the president of Facebook
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:25.780]  a few months ago, when the head of smashing pumpkins took me to a big party, South by
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:29.700]  Southwest, Al Gord been in town but he wasn't at the meeting at the party and some of these
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.500]  guys are running around, the point is they are very arrogant, I was taken back by how
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:40.500]  arrogant and on power trips they are and pride to go before a fall and this is incredible,
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:46.860]  if Martha Stewart went to prison then Zuckerberg has got to go, he's got to go, he's got to
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.500]  go, I mean most of the experts were saying this stock was going to tank but he was up
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:58.340]  there hyping saying it was a good, first release of the stock, it was great, this looks like
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:05.260]  and has all the earmarks of text book, text book insider trading but again they like to
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:09.180]  burn somebody like Martha Stewart, the average person thinks she's rich when she's nothing
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.700]  compared to these billionaire scammers and meanwhile the billionaire scammers are always
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.620]  pushing in Wall Street for higher taxes because they get that money through banker bailouts,
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:22.140]  they're the ones right across the line pushing carbon taxes, it was Ken Lay of Enron came
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:26.980]  up with that, then they blame capitalism for what they've done and say bring in socialism
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:32.140]  to fix it when they've impoverished the country via their environmentalist dictatorship,
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.140]  it's amazing.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:38.700]  So we're going to be breaking that down today, also the very same banksters that set up the
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:43.180]  Euro to consolidate power are now posing as the savers as they imploded, Greece is mulling
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:46.920]  Euro exit, all Goldman Sachs run, most of the debt's not theirs, it's owed by the big
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.340]  mega banks and derivatives, Eurozone nations told to prep for Greek departure, told you
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:59.180]  that was coming last year, in Europe time for big B only there's no plan and no time,
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:03.180]  markets swamp ahead of the key EU summit, I'll be confronting Bill the Bilderberg group
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:08.140]  next week live from Chantilly, Virginia, be sure to join us each day for that, I'll be
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:10.980]  hosting from the road.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:15.780]  We've got Lord Christopher Mock in here with us and he was just coming on for an hour but
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.980]  he got here early, which is great and so we're going to have him a little bit in this shower
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:25.540]  but since he's here, I'm going to spring something on him, but I know he's written and talked
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.500]  about this and advised Margaret Thatcher on a lot of issues, he can speak on any of this
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.740]  because he's part of the UK Independence Party, one of its founders and its head as well about
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:38.900]  what's happening with the Euro, how it fits into this larger tyranny, how it's driving
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:43.820]  the move towards global governance and then we'll segue in the next hour into the big
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:49.900]  view of where we are on the chessboard now with the forces of authoritarianism, the age
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:54.880]  old reinventing themselves under the rubric of savers of the earth, vanquishing evil carbon
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.340]  dioxide that plants respirate from and then put forth oxygen in the carbon life cycle
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.500]  on this planet.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.340]  While ignoring all the real environmental problems, we're going to cover the entire
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:10.700]  waterfront with a strategic speech and breakdown in my questions coming up in the next hour
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:15.620]  but now with Lord Mock in here in studio, I want to get a briefing from him because
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:21.900]  he's over in England, he's been on this with members of the European Parliament which is
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:27.380]  of course just ceremonial but still able to use it as a bully pulpit in a Nigel Farage
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:32.420]  who has survived the suspicious plane crash to bring us this information, he's been in
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:38.740]  there excoriating these criminals, they are criminals, all of this, he can give us the
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:43.700]  crow's nest view from inside what's happening and what this means to the rest of the world
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.100]  because if the Euro falls before they're ready to leverage it into their new world
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:52.980]  order, this could damage this whole new world order much worse than the Copenhagen documents,
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.260]  I mean, again, we have this idea that they're invincible and we can't defeat them, that's
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:01.660]  not true, history shows that when the good take the field, the dragons' cannon will
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:02.660]  be slayed.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:07.380]  Now, Lord Christopher Monkton is the chief policy advisor to the Science and Public Policy
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:10.740]  Institute, special advisor to the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who was
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:14.700]  anti-new world order and spoke out against Bilderberg, Monkton is a widely recognized
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:21.100]  expert on climate sensitivity and he of course is given key lectures at Cambridge University,
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:25.460]  he heads up the biggest website exposing scientifically their fraud, he's been proven
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:32.140]  right at a ridiculous level almost to psychic in how he guesses their next move and exposes
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:36.940]  them and he joins us here today, Lord Monkton, great to have you.
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:41.380]  Well, Alex, it's a real joy to be here and meet you in studio for the first time.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:46.380]  I tell you, it is great to have you here in person and I notice you have your crucifix
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.180]  around your neck to ward off Al Gore.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:53.180]  I'm going to tell you why I'm wearing this, this is my David Cameron crucifix, now David
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:57.780]  Cameron is the allegedly conservative but in fact, I think it's fair to say, largely
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:03.660]  socialist Prime Minister of the UK and he has applied to our new European masters because
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:07.860]  as Britain, Britain's parliament has no more power to take decisions for itself, even
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:13.540]  on little things, it has applied to Europe, to these bureaucrats who now govern us, who
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:19.460]  are not elected by anyone, he's asked them for the right to ban the wearing of crucifixes
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:24.340]  in public in Britain and you can imagine that the churches don't like this.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.420]  Wait a minute, I saw that and didn't even make an issue out of it, that's how conditioned
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:28.420]  I've gotten.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.220]  Hold on, you just said banning wearing crucifix.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.780]  I mean, this is beyond 1984.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:38.340]  Oh, it's way beyond 1984 and extraordinary thing was that apart from a little bit in
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:44.100]  the newspapers at the time, it all went very quiet thereafter, quietly now, his lawyers
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:51.140]  are in there, applying to the European dictatorship for the right to ban the wearing of crucifixes.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:56.540]  Now, you can wear a turban, you can wear a hijab, you can wear a kefir but you can't
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.540]  wear a crucifix.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:03.340]  I'm going to start wearing one, the only jewelry that I'm attracted to is a small silver crucifix
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.340]  and I'm going to get one.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.260]  I'm going to tell you the story of this one because I was at a climate change meeting
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:13.260]  in San Diego and I was giving a speech there, 500 people turned up from all over the San
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:17.740]  Diego, this is California, even there, there are people sensible enough to know that this
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.540]  global warming rubbish isn't all it's cracked up to be.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:24.300]  On the way in, I was shaking people by the hand as they came in and one of them was wearing
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:30.180]  this very fine crucifix and I congratulated him on wearing it and being proud to do so
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.700]  and I said, I told him a story about David Cameron applying to our European bosses to
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:40.460]  have this band in Britain and I said I was going to go straight back to the UK, get myself
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:45.380]  a crucifix and put it on round my neck and wear it everywhere, however embarrassing that
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:50.220]  might be for those I was doing business with or whatever because it's necessary that we
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:53.100]  should not allow this sort of stamping out of religion.
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.540]  But I liked it when I saw it.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:59.420]  It's very nice and anyway, so he very kindly at the end of the meeting, he said that was
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:04.100]  a great speech and he said I think you should have this crucifix because you're going to
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:09.340]  wear it, it'll do some good and you'll spread the message better that way than I ever can
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:13.620]  and he was really kind, he put it round my neck and it's been there ever since.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:16.180]  That's it, I'm getting a little silver one, I like the little silver one.
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:17.180]  That's it, yeah.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:21.380]  I know both my daughters, I gave them both a crucifix but I mean you could make the
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:25.300]  joke here but it's not a joke, I mean we know these people are psychic vampires, they hate
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:30.100]  freedom, they want to suck it out of society, they are parasites but maybe they are vampires,
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:31.100]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:38.380]  Well I think what has happened is that the governing class has become dangerously arrogant
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.220]  and dangerously remote from the ordinary people.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.060]  Now in Europe this is particularly severe because we are no longer a democracy.
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:51.300]  We are governed by an oligarchy, we're governed by about 30 commissars.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:56.820]  That's the official German name for the commissioners of the European Union who have dug us into
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:01.780]  the enormous financial mess which I think we should now move on to.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:06.940]  And what is happening here is that the governing class of the world thought it could get away
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:12.500]  with a treaty at Copenhagen which would have created an all-powerful world government
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.500]  unelected by anyone.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:20.900]  No mention in the 186 pages of that treaty draft of election, democracy, ballot or vote.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.340]  They were going to try that on.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:29.420]  They tried to set up the Euro not as a currency but as an instrument of grim socialistic political
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:30.420]  centralisation.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:36.900]  And what is happening is that on the climate project and on the Euro project they have
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.500]  failed.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:43.940]  These people who are arrogant enough to think that they know better than we the people do.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.580]  They are failing.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:49.780]  They've failed catastrophically with the global warming scare.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:55.580]  We now know that they oversold that one and indeed it's now official.
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:01.740]  Because in 2008, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:09.060]  cheerleaders for the global warming movement, said that, all right, there'd be no warming
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:13.500]  for 10 years at that time but that was too short a period but if the lack of warming
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:20.460]  continued for another five years then that would prove the models wrong.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.300]  And we've had no more warming in that following five years.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:26.660]  There's now been 15 years, perhaps even 20 on some.
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:31.180]  I saw the German government last week came out and said that global warming has stopped
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:33.780]  but they're trying to clear victory in a bizarre way.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:37.500]  Yes, I mean they're trying to pretend that this is because they built a few windmills.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.340]  Well, that's not going to make any difference.
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:44.580]  The fact is the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted to atmosphere is rising and rising
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:49.620]  at an ever more rapid rate as places like China industrialize and they're not going
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.220]  to just do this with windmills.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.460]  How far is that going to get?
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:57.500]  Well, thank God, thank God because from all the scientists I've had on, if carbon dioxide
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:01.700]  has been 10, 20, 30 times higher, they admit this is one of the lowest levels of carbon
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.860]  dioxide in planetary history.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.460]  I think we should have factories producing more of it.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:10.580]  Well, that's what power stations are, of course, and China knows that if it's going
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:15.540]  to compete economically with the West, because it's still, the per capita income in China
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:19.980]  is tiny because they're running this ghastly, communized, centralized economy where once
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:24.980]  again the governing class thinks it knows best and the people struggle under this.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.700]  They've, of course, they've gone for these windmills, which are a sort of fashion statement
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:33.420]  really, but three quarters of the windmills in China aren't actually turning.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.300]  They're just there to make it look as though China is doing something about this.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:40.660]  What you want to know, if you want to know what China is doing, you go to the annual
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:46.660]  statistical communique of the People's Republic of China, issued from Peking once a year,
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:50.060]  and they tell you then what they're going to do, and the great thing about a dictatorship
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.540]  is that when they publish a communique, say, we're going to do this, this, and this over
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.460]  the next five, 10, 15 years, then that is what they're going to do.
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:02.300]  And they have said they're going to build one or two new coal-fired power stations every
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.660]  week from now for the foreseeable future.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:06.180]  And we can't have any here.
[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:07.940]  No, no, no, they're here.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:08.940]  They're shutting them down.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  There are more than 150 projects for new coal-fired power stations on hold here in the United
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:19.940]  States at the moment, because while you have got the Manchurian candidate in the White
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:23.540]  House, he's not going to allow any of these things to be built.
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:27.740]  And so what is happening is that industries, one by one, are having to move...
[01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:32.820]  20 billion of our taxpayer money paid to move General Motors to China, and now China said
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:36.780]  they bought up our biggest movie theater company, and they're buying up media, and they said
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:38.500]  to influence our media.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:41.700]  This is sedition and treason by our criminal government.
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.220]  It's been hijacked by globalists.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:44.900]  Lord Christopher Monkton is our guest.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:46.580]  We'll give you his website when we come back.
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:49.820]  Be sure and write it down and check it out and get it out to everybody.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:54.380]  We are facing total tyranny, just like our ancestors have over and over again.
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.540]  We're going to get his take on the collapse of the EU straight ahead and then a whole
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:02.260]  hour on the environmental tyrants.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:06.860]  Attention mindless criminals, thugs and thieves, go ahead, break a leg.
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:11.140]  American homeowners are fed up with your door kick-hands enforced entries.

[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:22.620]  a lock shield, and hinge shields.

[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.100]  doors.

[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:36.820]  Even if you have an alarm system, back it up with the door sentinel.

[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:04.780]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:05.780]  Box.
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:08.740]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:13.540]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.900]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:23.420]  Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:28.500]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:33.620]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:34.620]  normal cell.
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:38.460]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.540]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:52:57.820 --> 01:52:58.820]  Protect your immune system.

[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:00.820]  Don't answer it.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:06.020]  How can I stop these annoying collection calls?
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:11.100]  Imagine being free from your debt without settling and with no payment plans, no negotiating
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.720]  or filing bankruptcy, and no attorneys.
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:18.220]  What if you could eliminate the risk from all your unsecured debt in about 90 days and
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:19.580]  keep all your money?

[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:25.820]  If you are watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see Lord Monkton's website on screen
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.820]  and scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:33.500]  You can also see the Daily Mail, it's also on the BBC, Minister in Legal Battle to stop
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:37.100]  Christians being able to wear a cross at work.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:42.060]  We'll show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers via document cam a shot of that.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.940]  There it is.
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:48.060]  Governments legal fight against the right to wear a cross at work brings accusations
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.820]  it's sidelining Christianity.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:55.020]  And then here's another article, Minister's in Legal Battle just to stop wearing a period.
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:57.160]  So that's how it always is.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.660]  Take your cross down, take your Christmas tree down, which is Germanic, it's not really
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:05.020]  Christian, but we're going to put up menorahs, we're going to put up Muslim stuff, Buddhist
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:10.340]  stuff, and I'm not offended by any of that, but why are our crosses so bad?
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.300]  And again, it's about we're going to tell you what we're going to do.
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:20.380]  And there is outrage at move towards banning Christian crosses from workplace.
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:26.780]  And remember what happened when Poland tried to ban crucifixes in school classrooms?
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.660]  That's what the Soviets tried that, that was the final straw.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:36.300]  That was what triggered finally the breaking free of Poland from the communist bloc.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:38.100]  That was just one thing too far.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:43.820]  And sometimes it is these apparently little things that indicate to the ordinary people
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:48.540]  that their government simply doesn't care about them at all.
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:50.900]  I think the TSA is a breaking point.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:51.900]  Absolutely.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.900]  Yeah.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.580]  And that wakes people up.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:58.500]  And you're beginning to see this now because the Catholic Church, the bishops unfortunately
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.460]  in England and Wales are way to the left.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.900]  And they tend to go along with all this sort of stuff.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:10.620]  They've gone along, for instance, with they've had to close down all their Catholic adoption
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.300]  agencies in Britain because the government came along, the socialist government, Tony
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:20.380]  Blair and said, you can't operate an adoption agency unless you will send children for adoption
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.380]  to homosexual couples.
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:25.500]  And they said, but homosexuality is against our religion.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.740]  People who come to a Catholic adoption agency do not expect to find...
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:34.020]  Well, they're now saying that here and they're saying you're going to pay for abortions and
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.860]  you're going to hire non-Christians.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:42.140]  And here you have proper bishops, Cardinal Dolan and all the bishops here.
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:48.180]  And some 20 Catholic organizations have got together pursuing the pants of the Obama administration
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:55.580]  and they're saying, don't you tread any further on our religious freedom, which is guaranteed
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:57:00.140]  under the First Amendment of the...
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:03.820]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.940]  Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:11.180]  I have it here, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and the free exercise of religion,
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:12.180]  surely.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:13.180]  Show us that evil document.
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:14.180]  Here we are.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:17.980]  This is your founding fathers' intention for your country.
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:19.500]  This is your birthright.
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.020]  This is your constitution.
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:23.300]  I wear it close to my heart.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:27.540]  I bring it out where somebody else might bring out a weapon because it is a weapon.
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.540]  It is.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:29.540]  This is a weapon of freedom.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.540]  And it's based off the Magna Carta.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:31.540]  Absolutely.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:36.500]  It goes right back to Magna Carta and the rights that you have under this constitution, you
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.060]  must not lose them.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.060]  We have lost them.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:42.180]  You know, we no longer have the right of habeas corpus.
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:47.180]  We no longer have the right to not to be imprisoned without trial.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.140]  That has been taken away from us.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.140]  That was...
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.140]  Obama has the NDAA.
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:52.140]  He says he'll do that now.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.140]  That was guaranteed.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:58.420]  Even before Magna Carta, in Magna... Magna Carta, it's there over and over again.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:01.180]  Nemo imprisonato, rather dog-latin.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.340]  Nobody shall be imprisoned except by a due process of law.
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:09.220]  Now, in Britain, the secret police, and we have a secret police, now, it was founded
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:11.780]  by the Labour government in 1998.
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:15.620]  They were first called the National Crime Squad, then the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:18.300]  Now they're about to be called just the crime agency.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.820]  These people totally out of control, utterly unrestrained.
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:23.660]  Yeah, it starts with terror, and next it's everything.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:24.660]  That's right.
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.020]  They, then, you know, they have...
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:28.780]  They've raided members of parliament.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:29.860]  They're spying on them.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:31.220]  I'm going to give you a story.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:32.220]  Stay there.
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:34.940]  We're back in one minute, short segment coming up, then long segment.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:38.540]  Get into the tyranny of the Euro, taking over England, and then we'll get into the
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.420]  global warming, people.

[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:11.020]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:27.700]  Lord Christopher Monkton is our guest for the rest of the hour, then Max Kaiser with
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.700]  big breaking news.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:34.500]  Lord Monkton, we're going to shift gears into the globalist battle plan, how we defeat
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.500]  them.
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.620]  But for those that don't know, this is a global standardized model.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:39.980]  They're trying to do the same stuff.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:41.060]  First, it's terror.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.820]  They say they'll disappear you.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:43.820]  We have a bill of rights.
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.340]  They're just ignoring it with the NDAA.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:48.820]  But for those that don't know, first, they start this national anti-terror group.
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:52.220]  Now they admit it's for everybody that can just disappear you.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:56.260]  I've seen them spying on members of parliament that are trying to rein them in and then
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:57.260]  raiding them.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:02.140]  This is real tyranny when the bureaucracy does this.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:05.180]  We're going to put their website on screen, tell folks about it.
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:10.700]  And the immensely feeble speaker of the House did not stop them coming in.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:13.900]  There could have been an order made, don't you think about it, mate?
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.900]  But no, they went along with it.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.900]  It was absolutely outrageous that this happened a year or two ago now.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:22.780]  And this secret police force is completely out of it.
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:24.580]  They came after me once.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.700]  This was terribly funny.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:30.620]  And I complained about them because they had not the slightest basis for coming after
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:31.620]  me.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:34.260]  And I put in a formal complaint about it.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:38.780]  And they sent two policemen up to our estate in Scotland to interview me about it.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:39.780]  And they went away.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:44.580]  And they produced a report saying that they had tried to interview me under caution.
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:48.260]  That means they suspected of a criminal offence, which in fact they didn't.
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:51.620]  And that I had fled to my residence in Northern Cyprus.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:55.940]  This was put in the report of the people I had asked to investigate my complaint from
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:58.180]  the secret police.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:01:59.540]  So I hit the roof.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.900]  I thought there's no point in messing around anymore.
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.420]  It's a culture of total lying.
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:06.940]  What they'd done was they'd put this report about because they wanted to show to ministers
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:10.740]  who had become interested in the way I'd been treated that I was a crook.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.460]  That was the aim.
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:16.660]  And so I then thought, right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:20.940]  I walked in to my nearest magistrates' court, which was Horse Ferry Road in London.
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.740]  I was in London at the time.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:24.820]  I told them the story.
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:26.700]  I said, this is what's happened.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:31.500]  I have never had any residence in Northern Cyprus, nor have I fled there.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:36.420]  I have been in and out of London quite openly from my residence in Southern Cyprus, which
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:38.940]  is part of the EU for heaven's sake.
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:42.140]  They could come there and get me any time they wanted.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.020]  And I've been openly in and out of London, and there's absolutely no basis for what
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:47.380]  they've written here.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:53.420]  And I want these people to be summoned to answer a charge of willful misfeasants in
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:58.340]  a public office, which is a very serious charge for which you can go to prison for life.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:02.620]  I said, I want them to be brought here to court to answer my charges.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:06.620]  So the magistrates recessed for half an hour to read the paperwork.
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:10.260]  They came back in and they said, Mr. Moncton, this was a few years ago before I was a law,
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.300]  they said, Mr. Moncton, we've read the paperwork.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:19.740]  We do not intend to hear you because we are going to order the secret police to appear.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:24.860]  We are going to summon them as you have requested next week.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:31.380]  So three days passed, and this was a great victory because 99% of cases in the magistrates
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.540]  court lead to convictions.
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:36.740]  So I had reversed their usual ratio.
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:41.180]  Now they were in the frame, they were in danger of being convicted of a very serious criminal
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.900]  offense, which would have led them to being in prison perhaps for life.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:46.540]  The secret police, the head of the secret police.
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:51.420]  So I got them to come to court, and what they tried to do was they got in touch with the
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:55.260]  clerk of the court, and they said, can you just lose the paperwork that said that Moncton
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.260]  was ever...
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.260]  More criminality.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:01.140]  So the clerk of the court, I rang him three days after I had the hearing, I said, I haven't
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:06.540]  had any confirmation paper to say that this case has been set down for hearing.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:08.740]  And the clerk of the court said, you were never here.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:12.180]  I said, just one moment, I've only just rung you.
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:16.820]  You haven't had a chance to check any of your records, and yet you already knew or were willing
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:19.660]  to say that I hadn't been here.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:20.940]  Now you're involved in the crime.
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:24.460]  I said, has somebody been getting at you?
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.460]  Because I think they have.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.900]  I said, look, I wasn't born yesterday.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:34.380]  I know just how criminal this country has now become, how even court clerks at Horsesbury
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:39.900]  Road magistrates can find themselves drawn in to this corruption of a situation.
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.900]  Stay there.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.060]  I want to recap the story and finish it on the other side.
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.060]  Come back.
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:47.340]  This is demonstrating the police state of the EU.
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:48.340]  That's what you're under.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:49.340]  Yeah.
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:51.940]  What, 80 plus percent of your laws are now made by these unelected bureaucrats.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:52.940]  Five-sixth.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:53.940]  Wow.
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:57.060]  We're going to come back, break this down, and then get into their plan for global domination
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:01.260]  with Lord Christopher Moncton, and then I'm going to give the phone number out.
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:05.940]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:10.260]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:14.580]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:15.900]  allows you to have.
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:16.900]  It's true.
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:21.620]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:25.940]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:29.960]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:33.420]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:37.140]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:41.860]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.660]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.060]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:40.660]  If you have questions or comments specifically for Lord Christopher Moncton who is the greatest
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:47.540]  champion out there fighting the globalist authoritarian takeover system of fake environmentalism,
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:58.180]  the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 specifically on this issue, 800-259-9231.
[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:02.380]  You can get into EU, tyranny, habeas, corpus, any of those issues, but also the whole global
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:04.300]  warming fraud, how they're being routed.
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:05.620]  And Lord Moncton, this is a big deal.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:09.380]  I want to get into how routed they are, but how they're planning to counter-strike what's
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:13.700]  coming up with the new agenda 21, 20-year anniversary meeting.
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:20.100]  But to look at the tyranny of Europe and the secret police, finish the story because some
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:24.620]  stations don't carry that last segment, that little five-minute, about what you've experienced
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:25.860]  with the secret police.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:29.820]  Now, you may find it surprising there is such a thing as a secret police in Britain, but
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:30.820]  we do have one.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:34.180]  It was founded by the Labour government in 1998.
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:37.740]  It was then called the National Crime Squad, then it became the serious organised crime
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:40.980]  agency, and next month it's going to be called the Crime Agency.
[02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:48.300]  These people came after me and some clients of mine on a totally spurious trumped-up charge.
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:53.140]  And because they behaved so badly, I made an official complaint about them, which unfortunately
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:56.980]  was conducted internally by them rather than externally by somebody else.
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:59.620]  And they put out a report saying that you had fled when you had.
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:03.020]  That's why they said I fled the country when they had asked to interview me under caution.
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:04.580]  I hadn't fled the country.
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:09.860]  I had been openly there in and out of my place I then lived in, in southern Cyprus, part
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:12.460]  of the EU, the northern Turkish bit.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:15.460]  They said I'd fled to my residence in Turkish northern Cyprus.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:17.940]  I don't have a residence, I never have had.
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.020]  I've only been there once.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:25.020]  And so the whole thing, and that was on a parliamentary delegation 25 years ago, so the whole thing
[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:28.380]  was trumped up, and I got them into the magistrate's court.
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:31.140]  I went straight to the magistrate's court, I said I'm telling my own story, I'm not
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:33.460]  even going to hire a lawyer, they've behaved so badly.
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:37.820]  I reckon I can tell the magistrates and they will find in my favour, and they said yes,
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:44.220]  we are ordering the secret police to come to court next week and answer the charges.
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:48.220]  So three days later, when I rang the court and said why haven't I had confirmation that
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:52.620]  this hearing is on next week, the clerk of the court immediately said you were never here.
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:55.740]  I said hang on a moment, you haven't had a chance to check your records.
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:11:01.100]  Have you done a deal with the secret police to erase all record of the magistrate's finding?
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:08.100]  I guess that's what you've done, I said let me tell you this, I will have you for conspiracy
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:13.700]  with the secret police to pervert the course of justice, unless within five minutes you
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.580]  find this record you say never existed.
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:24.660]  Because let me make this clear, I know your thought, I know I can't trust even the bureaucrats
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.740]  in court anymore.
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:30.300]  I can trust the magistrates because they are not part of the network, they're ordinary
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:34.100]  people like you or me, who do the judging, they're not even lawyers.
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:39.020]  But I said you court clerks, you get into bed with the police, and I know how corrupt
[02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:42.820]  you all are together, and I had witnesses.
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:46.860]  In the court I had a barrister there who was part of another case, I had somebody sitting
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:51.580]  in the public gallery, I had a journalist there, we had three separate witnesses who
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:57.340]  saw me there and saw the magistrate and took a shorthand note of his finding.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:02.380]  So you find that paperwork within five minutes and ring me back and tell me you found it
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:06.700]  or you go to jail mate, I'm not going to have this messing around.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:12.260]  Four minutes later he came back and said ooh, we found the paperwork, I said yes I rather
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:17.340]  thought you had, now I don't expect any further interference with this case, do I make myself
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:21.820]  clear and you are yourself not to appear as the clerk in the case, I want a different
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:22.820]  clerk.
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:23.820]  Recuse yourself.
[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:28.500]  Recuse just a clerk, a clerk you would call it, sitting underneath the bench and doing
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:31.220]  the legal bit, the clerks illegally trained the magistrates and not.
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.580]  And again you have members of parliament being threatened and raided by the bureaucracy,
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:39.180]  you've been, I was just mentioning what I'd read and it's happened to you, this is the
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.180]  secret police.
[02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:43.980]  Let me tell you what then happened, I went to court five of the secret police plus a
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.900]  barrister turned up and I did a deal with them, I said look, you know we can do this
[02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:53.420]  the hard way and go into court and the magistrates essentially having summoned you here are going
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:58.140]  to find against you because you've behaved very badly, you've done this so as to try
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:03.580]  to make it out to ministers, then I'm a crook and that's disgraceful, particularly when
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.860]  I had put in a complaint about the previous disgraceful conduct of this organisation
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:13.260]  and I said this is not acceptable, I want a letter of apology from the head of the secret
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:18.060]  police, it containing an undertaking that you will all leave me alone from here on and
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:23.100]  I got it, no argument whatsoever, they just caved in and said okay and they got off my
[02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:24.100]  case.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:28.100]  You're about the only person I know that's brought them to heel instead, as you mentioned
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:30.540]  even the speaker of the commons is scared of them.
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:33.580]  That's right but the next thing that happened, it happened just a few weeks ago, this is
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:42.220]  real breaking news, is that I got an email from somebody calling himself Dr Paul McCallum
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:47.700]  and he said that he had a company and he wanted to develop an invention of mine, the
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:51.980]  eternity puzzle which has sold a million copies worldwide, he said I want to develop
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:54.460]  it further and I have some ideas and can we...
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:57.780]  Yeah you're a big inventor, we should add that, you're really interesting.
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.220]  So he came and had a drink at my club and he made me sign a non-disclosure agreement
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:08.100]  and I made him sign one usual kind of business exchange but I read his non-disclosure agreement,
[02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:17.860]  it contained a clause saying this, nothing in this agreement shall waive the liability
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:20.900]  of either party for fraud.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:26.060]  Now that is not a standard term in a non-disclosure agreement, that had been put there because
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:32.940]  this was in fact the internal revenue service, the inland revenue, trying to get information
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.460]  about my private financial affairs to see if they could find a way back in because they
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:38.740]  were with the...
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:40.540]  They're sending spies after you.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:47.540]  They sent a spy, his name was Dr Paul McCallum and he has a company called Dai Butsu Limited
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:53.220]  and Dai Butsu Limited is a front company set up by the inland revenue, it hasn't traded
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:54.220]  or if it has...
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:55.900]  And for those that don't know, that's your IRS.
[02:14:55.900 --> 02:15:01.580]  That's the IRS, that's right, it's the internal revenue service and this was quite clearly
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:08.300]  an attempt by the IRS to find information from me, of course I spotted this.
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:11.660]  And again, they're politically after you and everybody knows you're squeaky clean.
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:16.820]  That's it and in fact they did have, and I must be very honest here, some justification
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:20.820]  for asking some questions, which if they'd been honest, they would have lifted the phone
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:22.260]  and just asked me.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:28.660]  I owed them some tax in fact on this invention because I'd had a large royalty payment and
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:32.620]  they knew this because my partners had all paid tax on it so they knew roughly how much
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:35.780]  I should have paid and they hadn't had the money.
[02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:38.660]  And instead of asking why they hadn't had the money, they go through this whole in
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:39.660]  corner nonsense.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:44.980]  What had happened was, I had said to my lovely wife, look we must pay this, can you please
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:47.020]  fix it with the bank, she handles all my transactions.
[02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:48.500]  No, I understand there's always mistakes.
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.340]  And no, there was no mistakes on our part.
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:51.340]  The bank didn't.
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:52.340]  The bank got it wrong.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:57.420]  We instructed the bank, the bank instruction was made out properly, the bank accepted
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:00.140]  the instruction, it said it had made the payment.
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:04.540]  My lovely wife, who's very thorough about these things, rang them the next day and said,
[02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:05.540]  did you make the payment?
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:08.060]  And they said yes.
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:09.780]  And then it turned out that in fact they hadn't.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:12.060]  But the point is they're going over you with a fine-tuned comb.
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:17.660]  Well yes, and what these creeps then did is they set up this whole in corner operation.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:21.740]  Now in fact, this is a rogue unit within the Inland Revenue, it's called the cross-cutting
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.260]  services unit.
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:28.060]  These are the people and we are slowly encircling them, we're going to get them eventually.
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:31.620]  And some of their people are going to go to jail because they've been after me and some
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:35.740]  of my clients for years without the slightest justification.
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:40.260]  And they're finally watching the records, found one little thing and raced in like Piranha.
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:45.260]  Yes, all they found was that the tax that we thought we'd paid hadn't been paid and
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:48.500]  instead of checking with us and where we were sent to the bank, what happened to the money
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:49.500]  and the bank hasn't.
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:55.300]  No, no, I had a property tax thing where the county deposited it but sent me notice they
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:58.620]  were going to start taking my property and I had to go get the check and go in and they
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:16:59.620]  don't apologize.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:08.020]  I had my registration sent to me misprinted wrong where it printed it off so I stuck the
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:11.860]  sticker on my car but there's no print, get pulled over, the cop goes, that's a fraudulent
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:15.500]  sticker and I reached my local partner and I go, this is how it was mailed by the state,
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:18.940]  get printed it up here, here it is, you want me to put this piece of paper on the front
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:19.940]  of my car?
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:23.700]  And the point is, is the government is constantly making mistakes.
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:31.540]  This was not just a mistake, this was a deliberate attempt to obtain information from me by deception.
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:33.460]  It was a criminal offense.
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:40.260]  So Dr Paul McCallum, if I have got you wrong in this respect, then I'm going to say this
[02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:45.260]  to you, I will apologize, I'll come back on this show and apologize to you.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:49.380]  So you have the chance now to get in touch with me and say you've completely misunderstood
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:53.180]  me, I was being genuine and you've got me wrong.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:58.460]  If that is the case, you get in touch with me, I will get in touch with Alex Jones and
[02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:05.300]  Alex will give me the freedom, I'm sure you will, to say, okay, I eat crow, I got it wrong.
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:09.420]  But I don't think, Dr Paul McCallum, that I did get it wrong.
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:15.060]  I think you were an inland revenue spy and if you think that that is going to encourage
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:21.180]  me or anyone else to think well of the inland revenue, you can think again.
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:25.420]  You have come up against me several times on behalf of my clients, every time you have
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:30.740]  been beaten twice in court in the most humiliating circumstances.
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:34.420]  Just leave us alone, get off our case.
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:39.260]  We will pay our taxes, we will do it sensibly, correctly and without any attempt at avoidance
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:40.620]  or evasion.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:44.700]  But we will not have this Christmas game, we will not have this spying.
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:48.300]  Enough is enough, the people are fed up with this.
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:54.660]  Now this links in, you see Alex, to the overall theme of this broadcast, which is that the
[02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:57.100]  governing class is out of control.
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:02.220]  They've approached all the dentists that my dad talks to to be homeland security spies
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.580]  on their patients.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:07.460]  They're setting up a spy network here that makes East Germany look like a wonderland
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:08.460]  of freedom.
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:11.420]  Yeah, that's right and this has got to stop.
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:16.100]  And so I'm very, very, very tired of all this because they're always coming after the likes
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:21.060]  of me, mainly because I dare to speak out and I say the EU is a dictatorship.
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:25.820]  I say that the euro is a Mickey Mouse currency, well hey, we can all see that now, but I was
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:30.340]  saying it years ago, I was saying it in 1996 before they'd started it that this was going
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:31.340]  to happen.
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:33.140]  I gave a detailed lecture.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:37.340]  I know it's on your website, stay there, we've got to get to the euro, what's happening
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:41.420]  with the euro, what do you see coming, what is it, and then we've got to segue into the
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:47.540]  latest environmental fraud, the Green Police, the $2,000 dollar-day fines for hay dust in
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:48.540]  the US.
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:54.500]  I mean, just 20% taxes in California, the mass exodus, and I love Californians, but
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:58.300]  then they come to Texas fleeing that and try to reinvent it here.
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:01.540]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:05.140]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods

[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:16.420]  Proteins are vital to your health, but to get the full benefit, they must come into your
[02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:18.740]  bloodstream as undamaged amino acids.
[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:22.440]  One world way is processed in a unique manner to protect the amino acids so they're easy
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.540]  to digest and use at the cellular level.
[02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:27.580]  The health benefits of undamaged weight protein are well documented.
[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:32.380]  They are healing, reduced inflammation, increased levels of glutathione, detoxification, weight
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:35.980]  loss, muscle gains, more energy, and a better sense of well-being.
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:39.580]  If you want to have the energy to achieve your dreams, consider adding one world way
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:40.820]  to your diet.

[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:57.340]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:12.020]  That's a point that I make a lot on the air, but it's so important.
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:13.340]  This is all transparent.
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:19.380]  The EU, the UN, they all interlock globally, our State Department, all of it.
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:23.900]  The Communist Chinese, they get authoritarian systems, that's why they all team up together
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:29.340]  to shut down industry, to raise taxes, because the elites are all basically exempt.
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:31.380]  They can commit whatever crime they want.
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:37.300]  The head of Facebook can publicly scam with his stock while he's selling it out the back
[02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.300]  door.
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:42.780]  He probably won't get in trouble because they're the insiders and they're waging war against
[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:43.780]  us.
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:48.980]  And if you look at the transformation of Europe into what looks like the old Soviet Union,
[02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:54.020]  the banning of crucifix, all of this, the going after property, the banning of space
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:55.020]  heaters.
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:59.420]  It's all little knickknacks at first where they set the precedent, they're in charge.
[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:05.900]  And the treatment with contempt of the citizen by the bureaucracy, like these revenue spies,
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:11.180]  these secret police, these people who think they can behave, just how they like, without
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:12.180]  anyone...
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:16.660]  Oh, the TSA here a lot of times will treat you like absolute scum on purpose, so break
[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.740]  down in this brief segment, long segment coming up, the tyranny of the EU and how 80% of your
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:22.740]  laws are made by them.
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:23.740]  Right.
[02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:29.020]  This is an official German government estimate made two or three years ago, that 83%, five
[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:35.180]  sixths of all laws made for us in the United Kingdom and indeed throughout the European
[02:25:35.180 --> 02:25:41.540]  dictatorship are now made by the 30 commissars, that's the official German name for them,
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:44.020]  the commissioners who run the European Union.
[02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:49.060]  But you know, the European Parliament doesn't even have the right to bring forward a bill.
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:50.620]  Only the commissars can do that.
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:55.460]  The European Parliament can vote on that bill, but its vote doesn't matter, it can be overruled
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:59.300]  by the commission, which also has the right to circumvent the parliament altogether and
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:02.700]  make a thing called a commission regulation directly.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:10.660]  Now, the EU's advisors were at the Cancun climate conference a couple of years ago,
[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.340]  I met some of them there.
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:18.460]  They were advising the UN on how it too could grab power from democratic nations like the
[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:23.740]  United States in the same way that the EU, by stealth over a period of 20 or 30 years,
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:28.380]  had grabbed enormous amounts of power, very nearly all power now of making laws and imposing
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:32.900]  taxes from the individual states of the European Union.
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:38.780]  And clearly the UN now says we want some of this, we want the chance to be a world government
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:41.620]  and have the powers of taxation over the whole globe.
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:47.140]  Can you imagine, given how powerful even the EU is just with a little old Europe?
[02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:52.500]  Trent Lott is now supporting that law of the sea, where the UN will be 10 miles out everywhere
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:54.940]  taxing you to go fishing or go out in the ocean.
[02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:55.940]  That's it.
[02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:58.380]  The hellish UN will now be off the coast of the US.
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:02.380]  That's it and the trouble with every time you sign a treaty like the law of the sea
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:08.700]  treaty, you're transferring power from elected hands in your country to unelected hands somewhere
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:09.700]  else.
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:14.300]  If we get Homeland Security off our back, imagine the UN and what about the UN, it's
[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:18.100]  even in the New York Times, but they say, oh, but it's kind of good, killing people in
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:22.100]  Africa and Latin America for the land to make it carbon sink zones.
[02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:27.340]  I mean, this is, that's what I'm saying, they're so over the top murderous, but because they
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:31.820]  wear blue helmets and Miss America says they love kids, we're supposed to roll over to
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:32.820]  them.
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:33.820]  That's right.
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:34.980]  And the thing to do is to do what I do.
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:38.700]  I've told you a couple of stories now about how the ordinary citizen, when they try to
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:40.940]  come after him, can fight back.
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:45.100]  You know, the secret police were amazed when they got a call from magistrate's court saying
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:54.300]  you're summoned to appear to answer a very serious charge of conspiracy to commit a crime
[02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:57.540]  of willful misfeasants in a public office.
[02:27:57.540 --> 02:27:58.780]  They were astonished.
[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:01.340]  They weren't used to having it done to them.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:06.500]  And you can bet that the In-N-Revenue isn't used to having the names, identities and front
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:11.900]  shell companies of its spies exposed all over international television.
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:18.620]  This is how one can fight back against these people because there's also good people in
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:20.300]  government sending us stuff now.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:21.300]  Absolutely.
[02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:25.540]  This is more and more going to happen because it's now got to the point where the governing
[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:34.740]  class worldwide has studied the EU, has seen how powerful the EU has become in its territory.
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:39.340]  And it says, you know, if we could do this globally, we could really have world domination.
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:43.500]  And they say that and then nowhere to run.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:47.100]  Just like Californians are running to Texas, there'd be nowhere to run.
[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:48.100]  That's the point.
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:49.100]  What are we going to do?
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:50.100]  Go to the moon or Mars?
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:51.820]  No, it's not going to be so easy.
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:54.540]  And so this is what they're trying to do.
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.940]  And we have to stop them.
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:58.900]  And you're doing a wonderful work here, Alex, in trying to stop them.
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:02.780]  And you know, sometimes people say, oh, Alex Jones, he's a bit extreme.
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:07.020]  Well, I can tell you this, nothing like as extreme as what they're trying to do to us.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.260]  And so you're quite right.
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.260]  That's the point.
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:13.460]  They're so authoritarian and it's naked and I'm just desperate to warn people.
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:14.460]  That's the thing.
[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:15.460]  People need to be.
[02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:18.740]  I mean, here am I, a peer of the realm for heaven's sake.
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:21.140]  And they think they can play these silly games on me.
[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:23.980]  They swat team members of the parliament that investigate them.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:24.980]  That's the thing.
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:25.980]  And they, you know, they...
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:28.500]  I mean, let me tell you, if I was a member of parliament investigating them, they swat
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:29.500]  teamed me.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:30.500]  Yeah.
[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:31.500]  I'd be in their face.
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:35.340]  I'd be here in trouble instead of everyone like a, you know, a dog, you know, rolling
[02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:36.340]  over.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:37.340]  Yeah.
[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:39.740]  And actually, I think we're going to have to bring our secret police to an end.
[02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:44.060]  I will be writing to our finance minister, the Chancellor of the Czechos, who's in charge
[02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:45.060]  of the Indian Revenue.
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:49.540]  He's in trouble to power on for it and say, look, you know, this is one time to manage
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:50.540]  that.
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:51.540]  Stay there.
[02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:52.540]  We've got to come back.
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:53.540]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:54.540]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.540 --> 02:30:03.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network sick of the globalist, you Genesis control freaks
[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:07.060]  adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die.
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:09.260]  Start purifying your water with pro pure.

[02:31:01.180 --> 02:31:02.500]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:06.460]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid seeds and secret storage
[02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:08.100]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:11.780]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:13.100]  silver or gold?
[02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:16.500]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:18.660]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:22.820]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid
[02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:23.820]  seeds.
[02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:29.140]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:30.980]  food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:32.100]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:36.300]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.780]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:44.540]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:56.460]  call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non hybrid seeds are the
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:57.900]  ultimate barter item.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:01.820]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:05.980]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:32:05.980 --> 02:32:10.700]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:15.020]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:17.220]  in or on the body.
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:21.980]  My name is Mario Sofaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:26.500]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:31.220]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:34.740]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:42.660]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:49.940]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:53.020]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[02:32:53.020 --> 02:33:11.420]  As well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:33:41.700]  silver lung system.
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:46.060]  This is tyranny the green police all of it it's unfolding you can't go to a national
[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:49.780]  park they've announced because humans are bad scores of national parks are gonna let
[02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:55.500]  humans in most areas no more cars you're not allowed to swim or go in the dunes I went
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:59.660]  to the Texas national seashore where I've been going since I was born suddenly they
[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:04.820]  were being rude bossing us telling us not to hurt the earth as we just sat there I mean
[02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:09.500]  it's this hen pecking it's about getting you accustomed to government interfaces when
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:13.460]  I've been in England they just come over and randomly we'd like to talk to you you're walking

[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:22.220]  at RightFriendFullWars.com well that the editor is a prisonplanet.com and they said oh yeah
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:25.900]  that's routine especially if you have a good-looking girl on your arm you know you know they're
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:30.900]  both handsome guys Paul's married down but Steve I'll be taking his his girlfriend you

[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:40.540]  and will always jab and demand to see his papers and he's very clean-cut and nice and
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:46.940]  again same thing here good-looking woman TSA attacks it's like literally living in a dictatorship
[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:51.700]  Lord Moncton finishing up on that and then give us a brief overview on the latest attacks
[02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:59.660]  what the greenie manies are up to the next stage of course is the Rio plus 20 conference
[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:06.060]  in Rio de Janeiro 20 years after the Earth Summit of 1992 which started so much of this
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:12.460]  rubbish going on and the new theme they tried global warming then it stopped warming so
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:16.540]  they called it climate change and it stopped changing so they called it climate disruption
[02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:21.540]  then it wasn't disrupting of enough then they tried calling it energy security now the latest
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:26.540]  phrase is sustainable development and what you notice with each of these phrases is that
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:33.620]  it's they're all attacks on the West by the rest of the world or by particularly the communist
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:38.820]  factions even within the West who do not want capitalism and prosperity and freedom and
[02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:47.380]  democracy to succeed and the main thrust of the draft conclusions of this conference
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:52.780]  which is it's already in draft I've already seen it is that Western countries must be
[02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:59.020]  made to pay the cost of the environmental disruption they are supposed to have called
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:03.340]  you said that in in in Durban a few months six months ago or so but then everything
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:08.020]  you said in the document that you got leaked they started announcing it well what happened
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:14.180]  then was that the I got the document and what I did there was when I got the final
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:18.300]  version of the document I actually had to parachute in to the conference because they
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:24.300]  tried to ban me from it the UN tried oh yeah that's no joke you actually they beat you up
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:28.300]  they've arrested you at other conferences I forgot you actually did parachute in a from
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:32.980]  a height of 10,000 feet you're not joking and and and guys search that mounted parachutes
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:36.860]  in the UN pictures of that me grinning like a you know from ear to ear as I jump out of
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:41.340]  this plane at 10,000 we've never done it before or since they're not going to stop you are
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:45.820]  they and so I got in because the publicity was huge of course and they couldn't then
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:50.020]  get away with with keeping me out I also said that I would take them to court if there's
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:54.700]  any more nonsense and so they backed off and said okay okay we accept you are something
[02:36:54.700 --> 02:37:00.980]  else and and so I got in and I got a copy of the final negotiating text which was available
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:04.900]  to you know you don't be clever it was available if you asked for it now because the world's
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:08.940]  press was there not one of them reported this document even existed let alone what was in
[02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:17.100]  it so I put in a blog posting at what's up with that which is the the great climate blog
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:22.620]  for those who are doubtful about whether this scare is really as strong as the usual suspects
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:28.740]  believe and I put up a posting that just said this Durban conference is proposing to set
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:33.500]  up an international criminal climate court which only people from western countries could
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:37.940]  be taken before it was going to give rights of legal personalities and mother earth I
[02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:41.860]  mean bonkers and they've since announced they are doing that and what they've done actually
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:47.180]  is they they dropped all these proposals within 24 hours of this blog posting going up because
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.060]  they was so embarrassed no no I mean I remember that that they dropped it and said oh that's
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:54.740]  preposterous and tried to even imply it wasn't true but now they're back I saw it in the
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:59.100]  news saying we do need to arrest the climate criminals in fact they want to arrest people
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:05.260]  that deny paying Al Gore money will save us that's right they do indeed and I've been
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:10.700]  this continuous sort of moan from the very extreme Marxist left about how the likes of
[02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:14.620]  me ought to be taken to well more and more they're saying let's be authoritarian what
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:19.260]  do they make of the guy Penn State University this is breaking news again they've just had
[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:27.900]  a conference on how to silence the climate deniers and Michael Mann of course the fabricator
[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:32.220]  of the hockey stick bogus graph abolishing the medieval warm period suggesting that today
[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:38.780]  was warmer than it was in 1500 all of this sort of thing he was he was there and I was
[02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:45.500]  named as being one of the serious deniers and the person organizing this said that he
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:50.380]  thought that a conversation should be held about declaring climate denial to be a crime
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:56.380]  against humanity now crimes against humanity are punishable by death and it was so forget
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:01.180]  just a re-education camp they want to kill us and it was James Hansen of NASA who first
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:06.540]  suggested that as far as I can discover that it should be treated to that anyone who questions
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:13.380]  this climate story should be regarded as somebody who ought to be executed for a crime against
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:19.500]  humanity now of course this is how far they were so desperate because they have the cover-up
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:23.460]  of the long hair and the sandals and tie-dye shirts we think they're non-threatening so
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:28.980]  if you're thinking of giving money to Penn State University or sending your kid there
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:34.460]  to be educated don't these don't you want to get educated by Jerry Sandoki these people
[02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:40.500]  are totalitarians they ought not to be given any encouragement or money of any kind Penn
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:47.180]  State University believes in executing the likes of me for alleged crimes against humanity
[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:51.340]  don't give them any oxygen don't give them your children and don't give them your money
[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:55.460]  and not to mention what they do to kids in showers well we won't go into that it's not
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:40:00.660]  for me to comment obviously but on this Penn State University attempt to say that the likes
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:07.220]  of me should be executed for treason against the planet crime against humanity the way
[02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:11.460]  they put it it's all quite subtle they don't say Monkton's gonna have to be executed they
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:15.620]  mentioned my name as part of this thing and no but actually I have seen them say we need
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:21.460]  green fascism now now now what do they make of the guy that came up with the Gaia theory
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:27.620]  they're they're they're king over there exactly coming out and saying and reversing himself
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:31.860]  well they of course furious with him and now they're attacking him and saying that he ought
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:36.700]  to be done for crimes against humanity because he has dared to betray the trust they had put
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:41.460]  in him as the author of this actually rather half but he's saying it's become a distraction
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:46.580]  from real environmental issues well that of course is absolutely correct those of us who
[02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:52.500]  believe in looking after the planet's environment properly don't want all the money diverted
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:58.560]  away from stopping deforested to Goldman Sachs away from to Goldman Sachs to run this carbon
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:02.460]  trading worldwide it's not just Goldman Sachs because it was Lehman Brothers they were right
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:06.580]  into this with Al Gore on the board and they went under because though I was off the ball
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:11.420]  I was so busy posturing about climate and trying to corner the market that they hope
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:15.700]  would be a global one in in the right to trade carbon dioxide they were shooting the moon
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:20.020]  they were going for everything and they went under and and that is what has happened that's
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:24.540]  Chicago climate exchange collapsed last year when the that's my next question they're collapsing
[02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:30.580]  on every front but they're only viciously more attacking how big a deal is it that their
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:34.020]  entire program is now being revealed to me what do you expect them to do because they're
[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:38.700]  still flailing around that's the thing when they start getting really extreme and they
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:43.980]  start really screeching like this you know they've lost one of my first battles with
[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:49.580]  the in and revenue in the UK they wrote over a year a series of letters saying we want
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:53.540]  you to come for interview under caution about your tax affairs and those of your clients
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:58.460]  and I said fine just tell me what criminal offence you think I've committed not just
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:02.860]  the legal characterization but the factual particulars I am entitled under the European
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:07.540]  Human Rights Convention to be told before I agree to be interviewed you tell me I'll
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:13.700]  come you don't tell me I won't come and they spent a year writing more and more vicious
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:18.300]  letters and in the end they wrote one so vicious that my lovely wife who opened it
[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:22.660]  burst into tears because she's a very sensitive last very sweet last my lovely wife and she
[02:42:22.660 --> 02:42:27.020]  burst into tears she was horrified at what they were saying about me and she rang me
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:32.100]  up because I was actually in Cyprus at the time and she was in Scotland and she said
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:36.900]  I've just had this really terrible letter floods of tears over the phone what do we
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:41.300]  do about it I said we don't even need to reply she said what you mean I said that is their
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:48.140]  instrument of capitulation the more savage they become the more they know they've lost
[02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:53.060]  and all these this governing class has made two huge mistakes which are now visible to
[02:42:53.060 --> 02:42:58.420]  everybody the first was the euro which was constructed along lines which were bound to
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:03.060]  fail I predicted in detail how and when and why it would fail and it's all come to pass
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:06.140]  exactly as it wasn't difficult to work out that's what I want you to do look more into
[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:09.780]  your crystal ball give us the other points the other is the is the global warming thing
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:14.660]  which the entire governing class bet the farm on this particularly on the left but you
[02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:18.860]  got you get wishy washy centre right parties like the Conservatives in the UK going along
[02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:24.060]  with it but the real enthusiasm for it was always on the hard left and it is wrong and
[02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:29.380]  everybody now knows it's wrong there was NOAA saying if you get 15 years without global
[02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:33.340]  warming the models were wrong we've had 15 years without global warming it's over the
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:39.740]  scare is over the results are in and the truth is out and the scare is over and what has
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:45.020]  happened is that the the governing class which likes to present itself as omniscient and
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:51.860]  omnipotent and invincible and invincible and invincible exactly they are now shown to have
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:57.260]  got feet of clay they're shown to have got yes long and because people can see that they've
[02:43:57.260 --> 02:44:03.820]  got things wrong it is that cynicism now on the part of it's a collapse of credibility
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:10.060]  which is this complete collapse of credibility which I think may yet save democracy well
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:13.340]  that's what I was about to say people have this idea especially from the churches that
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:17.340]  have been world council of churches paid off that it's the end of the world you can't
[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:22.060]  fight evil that's the way it is history's the opposite when good men fight evil all
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:26.260]  we have is victory sure we're going to lose the battles are going to be hard but those
[02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:31.540]  that persevere when we can route these people and every time we engage them in the info
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:37.260]  war their death stars blow into a trillion pieces so what are the new targets because
[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:41.940]  I'm ready to attack right well I think what we do now is we press home our advantage on
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:47.540]  the EU the only future for the for the EU now both as a currency and as a political entity
[02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:52.740]  is disintegration it's no longer possible or right to keep this together the peoples
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:57.820]  of Europe want out if you had a vote in Britain now 6040 we would vote to come out of the
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:01.060]  so it's going to disintegrate like the Soviet Union that'll disintegrate what we've got
[02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:09.060]  to make sure is that at the Rio conference where the milk and water current draft of
[02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:13.060]  the conclusions of the conference will be replaced by something much more extreme we
[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:18.700]  do not we do not let our government get away with that now Alex I'll do a deal with you
[02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:24.900]  here I will go to Rio I will get a copy of the final draft when it comes out and before
[02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:31.260]  it is finalized in negotiation I will tell you what's in it and then if what is in it
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:36.700]  is in any way unsuitable you get on the air tell people what's in it and make absolutely
[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:41.380]  sure that they get in touch with their senator and their congressman and with the White House
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:47.220]  and say we will not have our democracy taken away we will not have our powers and our wealth
[02:45:47.220 --> 02:45:53.180]  transferred to the UN in the name of sustainable economic development or environmental development
[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:58.460]  when in fact we are perfectly capable as a nation of regulating our own affairs and we
[02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:03.460]  do not need these people particularly if they're not elected by us yes how we should run our
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:08.780]  affairs shows the central point the central point here is that if we just take out this
[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:15.740]  constitution again I do that and if I just cite article one section one all legislative
[02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:21.820]  power here in granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall
[02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:29.580]  consist of a Congress of a Senate and House of Representatives period all power to make
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:34.860]  laws for you or give taxes to you or impose taxes on you those powers should be in the
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:39.820]  hands of people whom you elect and it's the same thing with the House of Commons and
[02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:45.460]  Lords but the bureaucracy purpose they've stolen it the Commons and Lords gave it away
[02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:50.460]  I remember having a big row with my father about this when the Treaty of Maastricht came
[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:55.420]  up for voting that was a treaty which finally gave away Britain's sovereignty and gave away
[02:46:55.420 --> 02:46:59.780]  our democracy but any treaty that's a fraud can be null and void it's time to tear it
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:05.260]  up and I said to him yeah I said to him don't vote for this well he wanted to vote for this
[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:12.300]  but in fact I was so angry his vote was discounted and even so that by a huge majority the House
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:19.980]  of Lords also voted to hand Britain's democracy away and this was a disgraceful betrayal and
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:24.900]  I want to reverse this now we have got to start saying to the governing class of the
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:30.860]  world we will not be bullied we will not have our democracy taken away if you want to set
[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:37.420]  up international institutions then they must be elected by all the peoples of the countries
[02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:43.100]  who constitute those institutions we will not transfer any more powers by treaty to
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:49.100]  any international organization that is not elected it's a simple enough rule it's Moncton's
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:56.020]  rule that in future no more Mr. Nice Guy we do not give up our powers of our Congress
[02:47:56.020 --> 02:48:03.980]  that are voted for by us to anyone else overseas unless that institution is elected by our
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:06.100]  people as well as the peoples of the other.
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:09.220]  And here to that but let me bring up some examples.
[02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:12.860]  Congress stopped declaring war in the 50s but they still gave their authorization and
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:14.940]  you just read out of the Constitution.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:20.420]  Now Obama has said I don't get any authorization from you even though they fund it and are
[02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:25.340]  supposed to but he went one further he said the UN gives me the orders in a public letter
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:30.060]  and statements I mean that is treason I mean that is not just the president saying I'm
[02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:34.380]  Julius Caesar that's that's bad enough at least it was a Roman being a dictator this
[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:40.100]  is saying I am an agent of the UN yes I mean that is beyond and this is what we've come
[02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:41.100]  to.
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:46.420]  The only future for the UN is the two ways it can go it can be elected or it must be
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:53.020]  disbanded the UN has long outlived what little usefulness it had it now simply sucks in money
[02:48:53.020 --> 02:49:00.460]  to itself only one cent on the dollar is paid out but it murders people everywhere it lines
[02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:04.180]  them up and shoots them to take their land and I got liberals coming to my door saying
[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:08.300]  give money for UNICEF and I'm like the UN murders them the UN wants to turn their power
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:09.300]  off.
[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:12.820]  Well unfortunately this actually happened in Uganda of course I mean you may think that
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:17.420]  Alex is being extreme merely because he shouts down the microphone but unfortunately he's
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:18.420]  outraged.
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:19.660]  It happened in Honduras.
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:24.340]  Actually happened in Honduras it happened in Uganda and all sorts of unspeakable crimes
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:29.460]  are now being committed in the name of the UN and really at its instigate.
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:31.340]  And for the earth I mean they say we're.
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:35.980]  This is a storyline of course but what is really going on here is that those who like
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:42.100]  the idea that they should rule from the centre and that we the people ought not to have any
[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:46.460]  say in the matter because we don't care enough about these things or don't know enough about
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:47.460]  these things.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:53.260]  They want to stitch us up with a world government if they can and when I first mentioned this
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:58.500]  people said oh well Moncton is just a conspiracy theorist so I said right go and read you can
[02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:02.460]  get it now still on the UN website I don't think they've taken it down yet.
[02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:10.380]  The next one paragraph 36 and 38 of the Copenhagen Treaty Draft of the 15th of September 2009
[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:14.700]  where you will find in both of those paragraphs the word government mentioned in a context
[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:20.460]  which is clearly that of world government and then read the rest of that treaty and
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:24.540]  you'll see it was essentially the bureaucratic structure for this world government that this
[02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:30.300]  treaty was setting out in 186 pages and then tell me there was and is the financial times
[02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:31.300]  of London.
[02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:34.620]  Newsweek they all come out and say world government's the answer.
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:39.140]  That's right this is this is the growing trend and it's all being manipulated and the thing
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:44.580]  that we the people should do is to say fine if there's to be a world government we elect
[02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:48.140]  it if we don't elect it then we give it no powers.
[02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:52.460]  We'll be right back Lord Moncton with phone calls straight ahead Lord Christopher Moncton

[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:05.120]  carbon tax thing, the global warming, it's all, and I'm just wondering if there's any
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:08.960]  other targets they might be going after other than carbon to try to get whatever they're
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:11.000]  trying to push through with the global warming.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:16.240]  Yes, I think what they're going to do now is to take the environment as a whole as their
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:21.640]  big issue. They've lost on carbon now. They know that. Of course, they don't want to admit
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:23.240]  it because governments can never...
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:26.120]  So they're going back to cave bugs and polar bears that can't swim?
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:30.120]  That's right. They'll be going back to that. They'll be going back to the whole question
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.840]  that every time humans do anything, they affect the environment around them. Well, of course,
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:39.680]  we do. And they're effectively going to say what we need is massive de-population and
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:41.840]  in particular, a massive de-industrial...
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:45.680]  They've been saying it openly. Get rid of people. Kill children up to age three. I mean, what
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:46.680]  a group of loonies.
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:52.160]  That's the thing. We are dealing with extremists who hate the West. This is still the main
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.760]  motive. They don't care about the environment. John, one of my great friends was a lovely
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:02.360]  man called Eric Ellington, who was one of the founders of Greenpeace. And he, like me
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:07.520]  and like you, I think, was a genuine environmentalist, really concerned about the true environmental
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:12.280]  problems of the planet. And he said, within three years, we all had to leave Greenpeace
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:16.720]  because it was taken over by Marxists. And he said, we were all non-political. We didn't
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:21.240]  know how to stop them. They took over our movement and they turned it into a political
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:26.440]  movement to destroy the West. It ceased to be genuinely about the environment. But you
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:29.760]  still get, of course, thousands of people giving money to Greenpeace every year because
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:33.280]  they think it's about the environment. When, in fact, what they're doing is furthering
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:36.320]  what used to be called Marxism and now it's called...
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:39.720]  Absolutely. Let's go to another. Thank you, John. CJ in Michigan. You're on the air with
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:40.720]  Lord Christopher Monkton.
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:41.720]  Hey, greeting.
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:42.720]  Hello, CJ.
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  How are you doing?
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:49.320]  Yeah, Mike. Well, I got a comment. You remember, Alex, they already were asking to burn down
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:51.360]  people's houses that were climate deniers.
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:55.920]  Oh, that's right. They've had all these professors and people come out and say, arrest people.
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:00.760]  Ignore the Republic. Ignore the right of the voters, these professors. And they said, yes,
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:02.360]  burn our houses down.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:09.120]  And indeed, Professor Richard Linsen of MIT, who is perhaps the world's foremost atmospheric
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:13.120]  scientist, he really understands how all this works. And he says there's no problem with
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.840]  the climate caused by us. He has had his house burnt down in circumstances which are clearly
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:19.840]  suspicious.
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:22.760]  Now, of course, we can't infer from that that this was climate extremist.
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.040]  Well, we know they burned down houses and ski resorts.
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:30.520]  And indeed, it's quite a fashionable thing. After all, most of the people who signed the
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:35.880]  Declaration of Independence had their houses burnt down by British loyalists at the time.
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:39.960]  So it is a kind of, I won't say a recognized method of protest. And you certainly don't
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:46.640]  do this at home. But it is a way in which extremists like to put their point. And I
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.360]  think it's got to be firmly discussed. Always talk about treating those who dare to question
[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:56.800]  the scientific nonsense behind global warming as though they were some sort of serious criminals
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:02.040]  against humanity, which as I say, that's a sentence of death if you're regarded as having
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:06.240]  committed a crime against humanity. That kind of thing has got to be resisted. We've got
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:11.080]  to say that this kind of thing will not pass. We're not having it.
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:14.800]  I agree. And we've got to recognize the type of wild authoritarians we're talking about
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:16.520]  here. I mean, these really are bad people.
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:20.600]  These are the crazies. And when they're in control, the entire government becomes something
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:25.000]  that is alien to the country. That's right. And we have to recognize just how bad it
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  is. And they've tried to dumb us down, but the less has had so much freedom that the
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:42.640]  sleeping giant is reawakening.
