[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:33.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.760 --> 00:39.440]  hello my friends we are live at two hours laying out before us very important
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.920]  radio show lined up for you today on this ninth day of August this Sunday
[00:44.920 --> 00:52.080]  edition ninth day of August 2009 we broke the news here Friday then it was on
[00:52.080 --> 01:02.040]  CNN Fox and many other channels that a black man was beat up by Obama supporters
[01:02.040 --> 01:07.160]  for daring to be handing on flyers against government-run health care and
[01:07.160 --> 01:13.000]  the national media tried to spin this on Friday and say that it was anti
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.520]  health care people attacking the Obama supporters but was really the other way
[01:16.520 --> 01:24.320]  around and now hundreds of reports are pouring in newspapers and TV reports and
[01:24.320 --> 01:31.400]  and citizen journalists shooting you know the raw video of thugs hired by the
[01:31.400 --> 01:37.200]  Obama administration beating people up there's also news where they're
[01:37.200 --> 01:43.800]  counseling senators speeches congress member speeches they're going into
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.160]  fortress mode because everywhere they go for their stagetown halls their own
[01:49.160 --> 01:52.520]  constituents are against them remember last week we were talking about Lloyd
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.800]  dogged the congressman had only mailed out mailers to his members two people
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.280]  that were his supporters and members of the Democratic Party one of my
[02:03.280 --> 02:12.720]  employees here's wives is a Democrat registered and so she got the letter in
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.080]  the mail I remember Rob do mentioning hey dogged's can be given a speech you
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.840]  want to go ask him a question I said no you're going out of town then I forgot
[02:21.840 --> 02:26.400]  about it then suddenly it was all over the television with a crowd all
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.280]  chanting no we don't want your government health care and then him leaving
[02:29.280 --> 02:36.720]  and he went on the news and said it was all staged by Republicans as if the
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.320]  American people you know don't protest don't demonstrate the media says it's
[02:41.320 --> 02:45.960]  dirty it's bad to protest it's dirty it's bad to demonstrate you've got to
[02:45.960 --> 02:53.960]  accept the cap and trade legislation you've got to accept all of this control
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.280]  you've got to accept government control of health care then they lie and say it
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.520]  doesn't ration care it doesn't control what doctor you can see it doesn't do
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.720]  this and that when it's all in the bill just like Obama says he's not for gun
[03:06.720 --> 03:10.600]  control but they've introduced scores of bills to radically restrict the second
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.800]  amendment and people then go read the bills and get upset or they say oh we
[03:16.800 --> 03:19.920]  don't want national compulsory service when they've introduced the bills to do
[03:19.920 --> 03:26.800]  it so all across the country Republicans and Democrats are being
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.440]  booed off the stage but the media will only report on the Democrats being
[03:31.440 --> 03:35.000]  booed off the stage to make it a left-right issue because they know of
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.720]  the people ever get together ever come together and realize that government's
[03:39.720 --> 03:43.040]  bought and paid for by offshore criminal interest it's over for the new
[03:43.040 --> 03:50.920]  world order so we're gonna be breaking this down today and this massive attack

[06:17.520 --> 06:26.040]  edition the ninth day of August 2009 I don't have words to describe how dire
[06:26.040 --> 06:31.640]  the situation is in this country how the social engineers the big offshore
[06:31.640 --> 06:35.400]  corporate banks and their sociologists and psychologists just how
[06:35.400 --> 06:41.320]  manipulative they are and how they're playing the public like a fiddle
[06:41.640 --> 06:48.240]  George Bush was a puppet Bill Clinton was a puppet Barack Obama is a puppet
[06:48.240 --> 06:54.280]  these guys are corporate front men that read off teleprompters Barack Obama has
[06:54.280 --> 07:01.720]  gone back on every promise he said he would do secret arrest secret torture
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.480]  continuing naft and gat pushing to expand it hiring nothing but lobbyist
[07:06.480 --> 07:13.360]  expanding warrantless wiretapping expanding the Patriot Act when he swore
[07:13.360 --> 07:18.160]  swore he'd get rid of it and then pledging he was different and I talked
[07:18.160 --> 07:24.920]  to Obama supporters I talked to one today at my mother's birthday party got
[07:24.920 --> 07:30.160]  known for years he said all politicians lie and I said you know all over the
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.280]  country Republicans and Democrats are being booed off stage and they want us
[07:34.280 --> 07:37.560]  to fight with each other as Republicans and Democrats I'm not even a
[07:37.560 --> 07:43.000]  Republican I told the guy his name is Harvey I said and you know that you
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.880]  know I was against Bush I said it's like a Don King fight Harvey because this
[07:48.880 --> 07:55.040]  fella's been a boxing promoter that's what Harvey is I said both people he's
[07:55.040 --> 07:59.360]  even promoted fights with Don King the point is I'm sitting there having this
[07:59.360 --> 08:03.160]  argument I said it's like a Don King fight where he owns both fighters and
[08:03.160 --> 08:06.440]  they finally kind of went oh I get what you're saying yeah I guess it's true but
[08:06.440 --> 08:12.720]  that's just the way all politicians are they just lie to us and I said Harvey the
[08:12.720 --> 08:18.040]  government was so corrupt and so bad and hurt your 401k so bad under Bush that
[08:18.040 --> 08:24.240]  they had this solution Barack Obama he was gonna save you just like Dr. Paul
[08:24.240 --> 08:28.480]  Craig Roberts father of Reaganomics former Wall Street Journal editor you
[08:28.480 --> 08:31.880]  know he came out for Obama and said I'm gonna vote for him and the last three or
[08:31.880 --> 08:35.120]  four months of the election I was saying I'm not voting for McCain I'm not
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.720]  voting for Obama either but I said to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts I said you watch
[08:39.720 --> 08:45.360]  he's backed up by Zbigniew Brzezinski and by David Rockefeller and by all
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.920]  these top globalist he's backed up by Henry Kissinger he got four times the
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.640]  money McCain got from Wall Street and Goldman Sachs the ones doing this he's
[08:53.640 --> 08:57.880]  bringing in Summers Larry Summers that changed the laws to let the banks carry
[08:57.880 --> 09:04.160]  out the derivatives and Robert Rubin and and and and he said I know I know but
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.880]  you just got to repudiate Bush well now he is a man of conscience he's not come
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.760]  out and said I was wrong Obama's worse than Bush it's hard to believe but it's
[09:12.760 --> 09:18.040]  actually true because he as a conservative for him Dr. Paul Craig
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.440]  Roberts to watch Bush triple the size of government use the Patriot Act against
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.880]  US citizens to see all that happened that million plus dead Iraqis he was a
[09:27.880 --> 09:34.240]  moral person so you morally almost had to vote for Obama but I knew it was a
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.760]  bait and switch because I knew Obama was handled and and controlled by Bush's
[09:40.760 --> 09:46.520]  controllers even more so and plus he was slick he had charisma something Bush
[09:46.520 --> 09:54.640]  didn't do didn't have and so he was much more dangerous he is a puppet but he's
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.120]  there to make you feel like you've invested in him he's there to make you
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.520]  feel like you are part of his power structure and that you're winning and
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.040]  you've defeated the evil Bush when meanwhile the whole agenda that Bush was
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.200]  carrying the baton for in this relay race now the anchor of the races Obama
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.280]  he's the closer and Bush perfectly passed that baton off and Obama's just boom I
[10:18.280 --> 10:24.200]  mean he is just smoking our liberties and freedoms he is burning down our
[10:24.200 --> 10:33.960]  liberty now that said Harvey and I who I've known for probably 10 years because
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.600]  his daughter went to school with my sister and sisters like 14 years younger
[10:38.600 --> 10:42.640]  than me this was the first time he looked shook up he looked upset and he
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.320]  looked even aggressive at first with me and I said that's fine you want to be a
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.200]  sucker go ahead and I started breaking his condition right there I go you know
[10:51.200 --> 10:54.040]  you've been suckered in your gut and you don't want to admit it and that that
[10:54.040 --> 10:56.960]  started breaking him breaking his condition because he's not stupid but
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.480]  he you people put themselves under mind control they want to believe the con it's
[11:01.480 --> 11:05.080]  like with con artists and Ponzi schemes even after you've lost a bunch of money
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.320]  people will then invest even more thinking they're gonna get it back stop
[11:09.320 --> 11:17.440]  being suckered but I was talking to another friend this weekend it was over
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.880]  at the house and I said you know we're getting all these Obama posters out
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.320]  everywhere and she actually looked upset and said look let's just not talk about
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.080]  Obama Alex I like you but let's not talk about and she was looking at me like
[11:29.080 --> 11:35.120]  kind of like it was like crazed look I mean these people are in just like Bush
[11:35.120 --> 11:38.160]  supporters when I was out exposing him as a puppet in New World Order and bad
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.880]  they didn't care they still believe WMDs were found they still believe all of
[11:42.880 --> 11:46.160]  this because they're caught in this left-right paradigm everything is the
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.400]  left-right paradigm now we've got a lot of death threats from Obama supporters
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.520]  we've got a lot of threatening things have gone on Obama supporters bragged on
[11:55.520 --> 11:58.920]  websites that we've linked to that they shut down the Alex Jones channel on
[11:58.920 --> 12:02.480]  YouTube with 30 plus million views and I had to file in federal court and block
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.680]  it well now it's gotten worse several top videos that are on the front page of
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.360]  YouTube getting tens of thousands of views an hour hundreds of thousands of
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.280]  views yesterday on their way to tens of millions and I've had videos that have
[12:16.280 --> 12:19.720]  been seen tens of millions of times I know when it hits the zeitgeist it had
[12:19.720 --> 12:25.320]  hit that you know million watts of power it was it was going supernova these
[12:25.320 --> 12:31.400]  videos they erased them and YouTube emailed us you can read their their
[12:31.400 --> 12:39.880]  their email in the story that has the headline up on info wars.com about
[12:39.880 --> 12:47.240]  Obama speech police Obama speech police shut down top YouTube videos and there
[12:47.240 --> 12:54.160]  it is on screen as we simulcast the radio show at prisonplanet.tv and the
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.240]  guideline was a community guideline they said they got complaints that my
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.240]  videos were racist and we looked in the comments of that video and other videos
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.960]  we actually have those quoted in the article saying Alex Jones is a racist
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.200]  everybody do your patriotic duty complain and get him shut down now even
[13:16.200 --> 13:19.840]  if what I was saying was supposedly racist you have to defend that free
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.600]  speech or everybody loses all their speech but there's nothing about him
[13:25.600 --> 13:35.760]  being 6.5% black 43.5% Arab and 50% Anglo-Saxon there's nothing about the
[13:35.760 --> 13:42.680]  fact that he's 6.5 you know he's as much African as I as as I am Native
[13:42.680 --> 13:46.040]  American that's about how much Native American I am fine you know again in the
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.960]  name of race they inject it constantly and they create the racism its tribal
[13:51.960 --> 13:54.800]  division is all it is that's how the British would control different
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.720]  countries they dominated was in India everybody was an Indian but they were
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.120]  different religions and different tribes they would play all these Indians
[14:02.120 --> 14:05.800]  there'd be one British person for every thousand Indians but they could control
[14:05.800 --> 14:12.840]  the subcontinent through divide and conquer and that's all the media is doing
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.120]  when they constantly talk about race I mean when you say you don't want cap and
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.040]  trade they write mainstream news articles saying you're racist CNN MSNBC
[14:21.040 --> 14:24.280]  they all say it if you're against giving up control of your life to
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.480]  government-run health care they call your racist I've got stacks of the news
[14:27.480 --> 14:33.800]  in front of me you've all seen it think about how over the top that is but see
[14:33.800 --> 14:37.480]  they know that you know you're not racist and that you're shocked by it
[14:37.480 --> 14:42.280]  it's not meant for you it's meant for insecure people out there that feel like
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.800]  everybody's out to get them to then freak out and cuddle up next to
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.920]  government like it's their savior it's meant to get everybody fearing each
[14:50.920 --> 14:54.520]  other it's meant for everybody to see their racial and religious differences
[14:54.520 --> 14:59.520]  but all camouflaged in the name of fighting racism which is really a made
[14:59.520 --> 15:04.360]  up term it's tribalism you know you take a bunch of white people up in Scotland
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.680]  you know 800 years ago every clan was killing the other clan even though they
[15:08.680 --> 15:11.960]  all look just alike people will find reasons everything the Star Trek
[15:11.960 --> 15:15.360]  episode where one guy's black on one side of his face and the other guys black
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.600]  on the other side you know it's a race of aliens where one side of their face
[15:18.600 --> 15:22.000]  is white the other side is black but the oppressive group oppresses the other
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.920]  group because they got the white side on one side instead of the other I mean
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.680]  that's the way it is in Scotland they would kill each other over just what
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.600]  color their kilts were they look just alike but but see because that's a human
[15:34.600 --> 15:39.720]  nature thing is being manipulated so now the media of the government and they've
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.920]  got bills introduced about the past where you're arrested if somebody doesn't
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.520]  like what you say the cyber bullying and hate crime bills say if someone doesn't
[15:48.520 --> 15:54.560]  like what you say you're arrested I mean this is the total end of America will

[20:22.840 --> 20:27.680]  I've studied what happened in Cuba I've studied what happened in Russia under
[20:27.680 --> 20:32.680]  the Soviets what happened in East Germany after the fall of the Nazi system
[20:32.680 --> 20:40.960]  in the East and what is happening is a carbon copy interwoven with a high-tech
[20:40.960 --> 20:51.160]  overlay I mean I have the New York Times right here in my stack called hot
[20:51.160 --> 20:58.640]  button and I have all these other news articles here where it's saying if the
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.840]  right-wing protesters are going to show up and yell that they're elected
[21:01.840 --> 21:04.800]  officials during town hall meetings then left-winging activity to start
[21:04.800 --> 21:08.840]  coordinating with those representatives provide them with cover says a four-page
[21:08.840 --> 21:12.680]  memo distributed by health care for America now a coalition group supporting
[21:12.680 --> 21:17.880]  President Obama's recommended plans now look you notice for two weeks I've been
[21:17.880 --> 21:21.440]  talking about this and now in the last seven days it became a big national
[21:21.440 --> 21:28.480]  story because I see trends remember months ago at tea parties Senator
[21:28.480 --> 21:32.640]  Cornyn and Governor Perry would be booed off the stage by Republicans
[21:32.640 --> 21:37.920]  Democrats and libertarians it was bipartisan I had camera guys at some of
[21:37.920 --> 21:43.480]  these events these were not staged anybody who was for the NAFTA highway or
[21:43.480 --> 21:47.640]  North American Union or any of this global stuff the people knew their votes
[21:47.640 --> 21:51.520]  they're informed the voters are finally getting informed they would boom off the
[21:51.520 --> 21:57.160]  stage now every day no exaggeration I mean my inbox is probably fulfilled with
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.400]  up 200 300 I can't read it all I was up till three in the morning last night
[22:01.400 --> 22:05.680]  just reading mainstream news where Republicans are being booed off the
[22:05.680 --> 22:12.760]  stage but it's never national the only national stories you're seeing out of
[22:12.760 --> 22:18.760]  Fox and CNN both the left and the right are about Republicans going out and
[22:18.760 --> 22:24.480]  booing Democrats off the stage my point is is I'm just reporting the facts
[22:24.480 --> 22:30.400]  government itself is literally collapsing right now the people know that
[22:30.400 --> 22:33.880]  both parties are controlled they know that no matter who they elect into high
[22:33.880 --> 22:38.320]  office the corporate looting the tens of trillions being stolen continues
[22:38.320 --> 22:41.880]  people know it's bipartisan they know the wars are bipartisan they know the
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.400]  patriot act is bipartisan all the liberals I know have been out buying
[22:45.400 --> 22:50.080]  guns the last five years getting shooting training people are really waking up
[22:50.080 --> 22:52.800]  they're not calling themselves liberal they're not calling themselves
[22:52.800 --> 22:56.800]  conservative so what the establishment wanted with Obama was that first have
[22:56.800 --> 23:01.040]  all this reconciliation and feel good and vote for Obama and prove you're not
[23:01.040 --> 23:05.360]  racist and then once he got in he's a proven liar about everything just like
[23:05.360 --> 23:08.200]  all these other puppets and then it becomes oh you just don't like him
[23:08.200 --> 23:16.280]  because he's black and they cold-bloodily know that that isn't true and so what
[23:16.280 --> 23:18.960]  they do is they show the few racist groups or whatever they don't like him
[23:18.960 --> 23:22.400]  and then say anybody else that doesn't want to give in their guns given open
[23:22.400 --> 23:26.200]  borders given after and get expansion anybody that doesn't want to give in to
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.840]  all this you're a racist but now they've gone one further people are shooting
[23:31.840 --> 23:35.040]  these unedited YouTube videos there's hundreds I can't even watch them all
[23:35.040 --> 23:40.000]  we'll play a few coming up the audio for radio the video for present planet on
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.440]  TV viewers where you'll have just peaceful mainly my listeners that's why we
[23:44.440 --> 23:50.120]  keep even before Kavuto and other shows had these guys on that we're about to
[23:50.120 --> 23:52.880]  have on the lawyer in this African-American gentleman that got
[23:52.880 --> 23:58.320]  beat up by thugs because they contacted us first it's really not liberal or
[23:58.320 --> 24:02.240]  conservative it's patriots it's Ron Paul supporters it's anti-new-world order
[24:02.240 --> 24:05.880]  people people that know what's going on that a shadow left-right paradigm he
[24:05.880 --> 24:13.480]  was out handing out flyers that had the Gadsden flag on it that's this symbol
[24:13.480 --> 24:18.840]  it's the coiled snake that says don't tread on me and it had just some bullet
[24:18.840 --> 24:24.200]  points on it with the subsection of the health care bill where it takes over
[24:24.200 --> 24:28.440]  your bank account takes money right out of your paycheck rations care I mean
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.080]  it's not republicans saying this it's in the bill what do you think they have an
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.480]  England in Canada and they come over and he's being a nice and they punch him in
[24:37.480 --> 24:42.480]  the nose and scream what are you doing here inward and the image of white
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.520]  people and black people but white guys lead the attack screaming what are you
[24:46.520 --> 24:52.120]  doing here inward being cheered by blacks see as long as you're for Obama you
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.200]  can beat up a black guy if you're white and scream inward and they're like high
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.800]  five yeah baby because it's about worshipping Obama and all over the
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.440]  country it's now confirmed it's even coming out mainstream news them the
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.560]  media last week said oh it's all-stage republican lobbyist republican lobbyists
[25:08.560 --> 25:11.520]  are going what are you talking about they tried to blame the libertarian party
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.040]  of Austin it's like two guys you know they're volunteers that run it it's got
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.640]  a lot of members with going to Lloyd doggits event when it was only Democrats
[25:21.640 --> 25:25.920]  that got nailed the flyer we know that somebody here in this office wife is a
[25:25.920 --> 25:33.360]  registered Democrat so I mean it's incredible folks the people are mad aren't
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.480]  you mad out there aren't you sick of all this aren't you tired of what's
[25:37.480 --> 25:41.760]  happening aren't aren't you tired of seeing your job is being lost and your
[25:41.760 --> 25:45.280]  buying power going down and and and everything's shutting down here in about
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.080]  twenty three point seven trillion that bush and Obama sold us out for and now
[25:50.080 --> 25:55.400]  Obama's people want more because they're the ones that engineered all this yes
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.520]  his management team are the very bankers that changed the laws in ninety six
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.840]  through ninety nine that's admitted even by them it's bipartisan looting it's
[26:04.840 --> 26:11.520]  all a big joke and here's the big news people are saying all settle down some
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.120]  people are it's no big deal that YouTube now says your videos are racist and that
[26:17.120 --> 26:19.840]  they've banned a bunch of your videos and are probably going to ban your channel
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.080]  that reaches conservatively a half million people a week now that's only
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.040]  one of many channels we've got and but it feeds all the other channels people
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.800]  grab it off present planet TV we put it there people grab that and post all of
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.960]  the world you know Obama deceptions had over 20 plus million views that's on a
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.400]  separate channel we don't put all our eggs in one basket and we support other
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.720]  people that upload our videos because of the censorship but YouTube is saying
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.680]  that they took the videos down because if any of their brown shirt minions say
[26:55.680 --> 26:59.960]  that something's racist when there's no mention of Obama being black being white
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.320]  being polka dotted what's crazy is they shouldn't take it down even if it is
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.680]  racist if it's not calling for violence but it didn't even have that in it these
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.400]  were calm videos where I said hey folks there's some links over here in the
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.400]  sidebar we show you Cornyn and Perry and all these other Republicans being
[27:19.400 --> 27:25.600]  booed off by Republicans and Ron Paul being standing ovation at CPAC the big
[27:25.600 --> 27:29.640]  Republican conference a few months ago when he says we don't need to have more
[27:29.640 --> 27:35.360]  wars you know it's wrong to kill Iraqis you see what happens of Democrats see
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.120]  all the Republicans standing up going we don't want to kill Iraqis and sharing
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.760]  Ron Paul that we find out that we all love liberty and freedom together we all
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.800]  find out the bankers own both parties and those are the videos they're shutting
[27:48.800 --> 27:54.840]  down they're not shutting down the spoof video that's got 150,000 views that I
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.120]  did Friday here on the TV show as the Joker making fun of Obama wanting to
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.440]  shut down the Obama Joker posters no they don't mind you know they're leaving
[28:03.440 --> 28:08.680]  that up what they don't want is where I'm calm cool and collected but when hey
[28:08.680 --> 28:12.840]  let's all be friends Republicans and Democrats let's just abolish the
[28:12.840 --> 28:18.160]  Federal Reserve let's just audit it at least let's just come together let's

[28:23.040 --> 28:26.800]  incredible but luckily people already copied those videos so people are now
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.720]  going this is the video that's racist because we have screenshots where they
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.720]  took it down and we can point to people that proposed it on their channels they
[28:36.720 --> 28:42.400]  are scared of unity they want to say racist now give me your guns racist give

[33:48.560 --> 33:54.200]  about the whole thing all right Ken can you tell me what happened
[33:54.200 --> 34:01.240]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen you see the camera doesn't lie and the
[34:01.240 --> 34:07.720]  police arrested the thugs that attacked him but what's sick is literally hundreds
[34:07.720 --> 34:13.200]  of reports are pouring in where you have ragtag libertarians conservatives
[34:13.200 --> 34:18.040]  liberals that have figured out Obama's a liar people showing up to say Obama
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.360]  don't have indefinite detention they're beating them up now if you don't want
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.280]  Obama to go into Pakistan they run up and call you a racist if you're black
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.760]  they run up and scream racist and then beat you and then black people stand by
[34:30.760 --> 34:34.320]  clapping as white people beat black people and scream the n-word I mean
[34:34.320 --> 34:39.360]  these videos are coming out of women being attacked savaged in some cases the
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.680]  police are backing up the union thugs in other cases other they're doing the
[34:43.680 --> 34:47.880]  right thing this happened outside st. Louis remember during the campaign we
[34:47.880 --> 34:50.840]  played the newscast where the police went on the news and said if you talk
[34:50.840 --> 34:54.920]  bad about Obama we're gonna arrest you I mean that's a hundred eighty degrees
[34:54.920 --> 34:59.400]  the opposite of what our country's founded on and I stood up to Bush when
[34:59.400 --> 35:02.880]  he had the free speech zones and tried to restrict free speech I'm standing up
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.120]  against this now and I've made videos about how Republicans and Democrats are
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.600]  being booed off the stage Americans are mad we're going into a depression here
[35:11.600 --> 35:17.760]  but the media only makes it about people protesting Democrats to get the two
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.800]  parties fighting with each other now I had two videos removed that were viral
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.400]  on the front page of YouTube hundreds of thousands of hits a day is what they
[35:27.400 --> 35:31.760]  were getting hundreds of thousands of views a day a lot of you probably saw
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.080]  on the front page of YouTube yesterday where I was pointing this out saying
[35:35.080 --> 35:39.720]  let's come together people saying it's racist and I want a carbon tax they're
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.880]  using a political weapon creating racism pointing it out to get everybody
[35:43.880 --> 35:47.500]  fighting with each other and most Obama supporters are waking up as a
[35:47.500 --> 35:52.640]  privilege gone from 84 down to the mid 40s now the media spends it and says
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.040]  well it's at 50 but most polls show about 44 to 45 so they're panicking now
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.720]  and most of supporters are waking up but a lot of them are getting aggressive
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.680]  and folks I've been running into longtime friends that suddenly look at me like
[36:07.680 --> 36:13.240]  I'm at all Hitler I mean and and and I've had to stand up to them and then they
[36:13.240 --> 36:16.560]  kind of shake out of it because they're so self-righteous soon as I stand up to
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.040]  them and say you know I stood up against George Bush you know that's a load of
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.920]  bull you know you've been that then they start kind of this is a Don King fight
[36:23.920 --> 36:28.000]  where the establishment owns both fighters Republican and Democrat but
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.920]  but side issue we found out that the acorn connected groups because we even
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.880]  see who's bragging they file complaints on their channels we have them listed in
[36:35.880 --> 36:40.520]  the article up on info wars.com we discovered their their filing fake
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.240]  complaints saying we're calling for violence and and for and for hate crimes
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.520]  we're not even talking about race in these videos except saying let's all
[36:49.520 --> 36:54.880]  come together black white everybody be friends they don't want that now how
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.680]  telling is that I want to go to Kenneth Gladney and I appreciate his lawyer
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.080]  David B Brown we had him on first even before Fox and their channels Friday but
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.800]  there's been new development since then who wants to comment first on the points
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.480]  I made and then go through now it's clear we have White House memos saying
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.840]  report on neighbors tell us if anybody's criticizing Obama they're saying
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.200]  people are on thin ice talk show hosts may get shut down in press conferences I
[37:24.200 --> 37:28.000]  mean this is really starting to freak me out who'd like to comment on this
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.520]  craziness first well you know if there's there's been a pattern of events and
[37:33.520 --> 37:40.600]  last week and months before that but it's kind of ironic that over this past
[37:40.600 --> 37:46.200]  year there have been no real reports of violence at any Tea Party events there's
[37:46.200 --> 37:51.640]  been no real reports of violence prior to last week up of any violence at any
[37:51.640 --> 37:57.520]  town hall meetings held by any representatives but then starting Tuesday
[37:57.520 --> 38:06.640]  when age can which is the health care health care now organization health care
[38:06.640 --> 38:13.200]  for American now organization which is comprised of acorn and AFL CIO SCIU and
[38:13.200 --> 38:20.320]  a number other organizations have come down with a memo instructing activists
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.400]  to contact elected officials before events to plan ways to preempt any type
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.000]  of opposition and when they say opposition they mean people who want to
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.240]  exercise their freedom of speech once that went down there's a reported from
[38:35.240 --> 38:41.840]  the AP that David Axelrod and Jim Messina had traveled to the Capitol to
[38:41.840 --> 38:46.160]  for their presentation to Democratic senators regarding these town halls as
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.080]  senators saw videos of disruptions at events held by the House members and
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.800]  we're told to organize these events more carefully as well as work with labor
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.320]  unions other friendly groups to generate enthusiasm then then Messina comes out
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.840]  with and says if you get hit we will punch you back twice as hard and this
[39:03.840 --> 39:10.400]  is only stirring up and inflaming the passions on both sides for conflict then
[39:10.400 --> 39:14.600]  we go to New York Times and it shows where AFL CIO President John Sweeney
[39:14.600 --> 39:21.920]  comes out and tells everybody that that they need to reclaim our democracy
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.080]  according to a statement and they're also putting out videos since dogged got
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.120]  confronted seven days ago eight days ago last Saturday where they show dogged
[39:31.120 --> 39:35.120]  and say it was all fake there's one problem I randomly because I live in
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.040]  South Austin Southwest Austin I randomly one of my dad's employees was
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.720]  there who's a Democrat because she got a letter and my neighbor was there
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.480]  grocery stopping at Randall's and saw it it wasn't staged these were Austinites
[39:48.480 --> 39:55.120]  who were angry but but but you know what's incredible about this is that
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.560]  they're now beating people up and the first reports spun this in a nebulous
[40:00.560 --> 40:03.480]  fashion like it might have been your client's fault and they're now trying to
[40:03.480 --> 40:08.320]  say your client attacked four people even though there's multiple video angles
[40:08.320 --> 40:12.800]  of this and the police arrested the people that cold bloodedly attacking
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.000]  tell us what happened to your client mr. Brown who's about to be on with his
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.920]  illness right now Kenneth Bladney and then we'll get it directly from the
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.520]  person who was assaulted by people in their union uniforms well Kenneth
[40:26.520 --> 40:29.440]  Kenneth was just trying to make a little money that day and he was out there
[40:29.440 --> 40:36.720]  selling these gas and flags the tea party flags he is Kenneth is and then
[40:36.720 --> 40:41.800]  they try to paint him as a conservative and he can is an independent
[40:41.800 --> 40:45.320]  Ken has his own thoughts in an individual he doesn't subscribe to the
[40:45.320 --> 40:52.200]  police of any party he's he's outside of that that context there Kenneth was
[40:52.200 --> 40:57.280]  just doing his job he was a viciously attacked by one member who called him
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.040]  the n-word he went to the ground was after he was punched and then he was
[41:01.040 --> 41:07.000]  pummeled by two other SDIU members and another person and Kenneth
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.280]  ways I think about a hundred forty nine pounds so when they spin it and they say
[41:11.280 --> 41:17.320]  that he attacked four people and they probably weigh an aggregate of over 800
[41:17.320 --> 41:22.920]  pounds with eight arms to his two arms when he's trying to make a living if
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.040]  they're the ones that have been playing passion Kenneth was there to try to make
[41:27.040 --> 41:30.920]  a living so for them to so that's another issue the media now that's
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.760]  clear said he was handing out flyers with flags on him he was he was there
[41:34.760 --> 41:38.840]  neutrally just selling some flags but it's like a guy selling hot dogs at the
[41:38.840 --> 41:43.040]  baseball that's like the guy they got killed at the G20 selling newspapers and
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.600]  the cops got caught covering up and they beat his brains in it's like it's like
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.160]  the guy selling hot dogs he might even care if the Yankees or the red socks
[41:51.160 --> 41:54.120]  when he just wants to sell his hot dogs and that's where Kenneth was I think
[41:54.120 --> 41:59.400]  Kenneth could elaborate more on his mindset and let's what he thought let's
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.520]  bring Kenneth up who is a black American and a man they these big guys I mean I'm
[42:04.520 --> 42:09.200]  a good-sized guy these were like huge guys just are whaling and slamming him
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.560]  in the ground yeah they were they were pretty big they were pretty big guys and
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.440]  actually screaming the n-word at you tell folks what happened yeah well like
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.920]  I like I've stated before I was there just setting up getting ready to hand
[42:22.920 --> 42:28.000]  out my flags and my butt and stuff like that so one guy from the union I was
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.760]  talking to a pastor's wife and one guy from the union he stepped up and said
[42:32.760 --> 42:39.120]  who in the F is giving out this stuff here and I said sir these are my
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.400]  merchandise and would you like a flag I even offered him a flag
[42:42.400 --> 42:48.120]  said well what kind of end are you to be giving out this effort so stay there
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.040]  stay there sir we got a break I want to come right back to you brutally racially
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.040]  assaulted and the media spun it and now they're getting sued and they're going
[42:57.040 --> 43:04.800]  to jail this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a

[47:43.720 --> 47:47.560]  Senate to his cousin Odinga the Muslim leader who was attacking black
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.840]  Christians the majority black-on-black to create violence this is public

[48:58.560 --> 49:02.880]  chronicle some of what's coming out how they hired these provocateurs a form of
[49:02.880 --> 49:07.520]  false flag to go start fights to then discredit the events some senators and
[49:07.520 --> 49:11.880]  House members are canceling events like it's terrorism it's so dangerous the
[49:11.880 --> 49:15.120]  American people are shouting at them that you know when it's getting violent
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.280]  when they're the ones that are violent but again start over so you're out there
[49:19.280 --> 49:26.360]  selling flags and you say would you like one sir and continue and when I offered
[49:26.360 --> 49:35.200]  the gentleman of flag he began to say well actually he asked me that what
[49:35.200 --> 49:42.600]  kind of in are you to be given away this type of stuff here and he snatched my
[49:42.600 --> 49:47.200]  button board and by him snatching my button board I snatched it back from
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.800]  when I snatched it back from him he raised his own hand up and hit me in the
[49:51.800 --> 49:57.360]  face he ran the system and when he hit me he knocked my glasses off by me
[49:57.360 --> 50:03.920]  trying to catch my glasses two other gentlemen came in and I hit me also in
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.560]  my face I went to the floor I went well I went to the ground put it like that and
[50:11.560 --> 50:17.440]  then someone else came up and I start kicking me kicking me in my head my back
[50:17.440 --> 50:24.080]  legs everything by the way this is all in video big giant slobs stomping on a
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.560]  little guy tell folks how big you are yeah I'm one I'm five seven and I weigh
[50:29.560 --> 50:35.320]  a hundred and forty nine now I have a question why did this white slob I mean
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.520]  talk about a racist he just thinks he's getting some money from Obama yeah and
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.040]  and and and and and now I saw black people standing around with them did
[50:44.040 --> 50:48.040]  they like watching a black guy get stomped on by big giant white slobs
[50:48.040 --> 50:51.960]  screaming n-word I mean did they it seemed like they didn't mind this well
[50:51.960 --> 50:56.400]  and our honesty let me tell you the guys that start the first guys that hit me
[50:56.400 --> 51:02.160]  were black well I see white guys falling on top of you yeah there was two there
[51:02.160 --> 51:07.560]  was one white guy that that actually hit me that was with the a black guy he was
[51:07.560 --> 51:11.720]  on top of me and then the other white guy he was pulling them off of me because
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.520]  he saw those guys beat me yeah well what well one white guy so big that that's all
[51:15.520 --> 51:20.280]  I can really see is this giant guy falling on top of you yeah yeah and so
[51:20.280 --> 51:28.200]  after that you know I got up I was disorientated and everything and they
[51:28.200 --> 51:33.200]  start coming at me again and that's when the police cordoned off everything all
[51:33.200 --> 51:37.640]  the exes and stuff and it came out they just started resting folks you know and
[51:37.640 --> 51:44.040]  it was a madhouse but I just wanted to say to everyone that's what I mean that
[51:44.040 --> 51:49.920]  you know I'm not a I'm not of any other other parties or anything like that I'm
[51:49.920 --> 51:57.960]  not for the right I'm not for the left I'm just the individual independent I'm
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.880]  not a cartoon character well you know in major polls and there's different ones
[52:02.880 --> 52:07.520]  that they show different numbers but it's all basic in some polls over 70% of
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.760]  Americans say they're now independent but they'll still go pick a lesser of two
[52:11.760 --> 52:17.040]  evils in an election but most Americans I mean Congress has an 11% approval
[52:17.040 --> 52:21.240]  rating that's Republican and Democrat and but you know I've got to say the
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.280]  Republicans aren't getting up and saying these are stage rallies by the
[52:25.280 --> 52:30.440]  Democrats when they get booed off the stage the Democrats are lying I had an
[52:30.440 --> 52:33.760]  argument with a family friend I've known for over a decade today and he was
[52:33.760 --> 52:39.320]  telling me I was a liar and and and I'm getting emails telling me that I'm
[52:39.320 --> 52:43.560]  working for big health care companies or I'm working for oil companies because I
[52:43.560 --> 52:48.000]  know I'm an American that has a right to be against big government but but
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.040]  regardless where is this going Alex supposedly I'm paid off by GOP
[52:55.040 --> 53:00.200]  operatives we've we've seen reports on the internet from these hacks that say
[53:00.200 --> 53:06.320]  that Kenneth is paid off he's a he's a GOP activist he's a tea bagger I mean
[53:06.320 --> 53:09.600]  none of these things could be further from the truth and I'm not I'm not Joe
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.600]  the plumber to tell you the truth I'm a Kenneth the Patriot and you know you
[53:15.600 --> 53:21.160]  can you can repeat that as many times if you like Kenneth the Patriot well this
[53:21.160 --> 53:26.000]  is just insane I mean we've got the video of them attacking the woman and the
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.920]  and I'm sure you're seeing this Mr. Brown Kenneth's lawyer because you're in
[53:30.920 --> 53:34.360]  the middle of this too are you getting hundreds of stories and videos emailed to
[53:34.360 --> 53:37.440]  you to the point of I'm here on the weekend with a skeleton crew of three
[53:37.440 --> 53:41.600]  people I mean I can't even watch all this much less cover it I mean they it
[53:41.600 --> 53:44.640]  looks like they've they've been given orders to go out and just beat the
[53:44.640 --> 53:49.720]  daylights out of everybody well Alex so we're in the middle of collecting a lot
[53:49.720 --> 53:53.080]  of information this is all a big whirlwind so we're actually having our

[54:38.080 --> 54:41.600]  Paul Watson Steve Watson Aaron Dykes writing articles chronicling this and
[54:41.600 --> 54:46.720]  they I was up here at 2 30 last night when I left and we were having arguments
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.000]  about you know who's gonna post all this a bunch of it's up on the sites I mean
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.920]  this is crazy you were telling me Mr. Brown again the attorney for the person
[54:56.920 --> 55:01.720]  that was a racially attacked for daring to have American flags American
[55:01.720 --> 55:05.920]  Patriot flags because you can't have that out on a street corner in America
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.280]  anymore you were saying that you've got a lot of evidence and I've got some of
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.160]  the same mainstream news articles where the White House and the unions are
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.560]  ordering this I want to be clear unions are just gangs of workers that have been
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.000]  good in the past to counter gangs of corrupt robber barons and police you
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.320]  know 100 years ago 60 years ago but the big Chicago mob model of using unions to
[55:28.320 --> 55:33.400]  beat people up that appears to be used now nationwide can you chronicle some
[55:33.400 --> 55:38.560]  of your research for us on that front well I began telling you a little bit
[55:38.560 --> 55:44.040]  about it according to you they they refer to their colorful the people the
[55:44.040 --> 55:48.400]  colorful t-shirts the purple shirts as they said that we're going to unleash
[55:48.400 --> 55:53.760]  the purple people and you talk about brown shirts well purple's the new
[55:53.760 --> 55:59.760]  brown Alex it's the purple people and organized labor's engagement in these
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.400]  buying classes is just the latest sign of the ferocity that of the fight over
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.280]  the direction of this health care overhaul and you're just trying to go to
[56:08.280 --> 56:11.800]  a town hall and it's admitted in the news they don't let you into the quote
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.840]  public town hall they question you are you for this or against it if you're
[56:15.840 --> 56:19.200]  wearing the purple people stuff you get into the town hall for a stage media
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.360]  event and then you're not even in America allowed to be outside you get
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.080]  punched in the nose well according to the Carnahan people and according to
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.160]  Russ Carnahan himself the representative that that held the the town
[56:31.160 --> 56:36.480]  hall he had a secret press conference the next morning hand selected
[56:36.480 --> 56:40.560]  reporters so that there would be no negative press coverage on it and there
[56:40.560 --> 56:48.640]  was a local journalist here Jamie Allman who put Mr. Carnahan to task and asked
[56:48.640 --> 56:55.240]  him directly about the involvement of the SEIU at these events and Mr.
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.160]  representative Carnahan say what stay there stay there we've got a break

[57:18.120 --> 57:23.400]  attacking it decrying him is as Hitlerian now under Obama it's many
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.120]  times worse and if you disagree with any of their policies they shout you down
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.680]  as a racist they are the ones injecting race into it into issues that have
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.560]  nothing to do with that they're race pimping but that's what Obama did as a
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.360]  race pimp for Annenberg Foundation in Chicago that's how they control these
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.400]  cities they play different ethnic groups off against each other America one

[1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:41.280]  full audience some stations don't carry this segment in the next segment with our
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:46.920]  guests we're gonna get into this video in the press conference where a brave
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:52.120]  reporter did indeed ask serious questions of the congressman who was up
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.560]  there peddling propaganda but but going to this issue first gentlemen before we
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:01.080]  have a one-minute break and come back Mr. Brown where are you going with this I
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:05.880]  mean not only was your client brutally attacked with racial slurs added for
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:13.080]  absolutely no reason on video with witnesses but they have tried to demonize
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:20.400]  him as he was saying earlier and implied that he took on four guys so don't you
[1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:24.960]  have to go after them legally now just to just to clear your your client's name
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:28.840]  fully I mean you have all the evidence well it's not about clearing Kenneth's
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:33.000]  name we know Kenneth has been in the right day the entire time no I know the
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:37.120]  video shows it in the police arrest of the bad guys but you know as you've
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.560]  seen the spin out there on the web I mean pretty soon they're gonna claim he had
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:46.080]  devil horns and was flying around in a broom well yeah but it's probably
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:49.120]  happening as we speak but
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:55.680]  Ken's laughing I don't know how funny it is though because you know we're in a
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:59.240]  Ken's in a pool of piranhas now and the piranhas are out there and they're
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:03.120]  gonna they're gonna it's all about money and power with them so they're gonna
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:09.520]  attack and attack viciously for their own agenda and their own interests so
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:14.840]  what our plan is we're putting together a strategic legal plan right now and
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:19.160]  we will be suing the appropriate parties but until we at least until we
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.680]  file that lawsuit I don't want to exactly go into all the strategy of what
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.920]  we're going to do but so be clear that that our action will be swift and it
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:35.040]  will be deliberate so the next few weeks you know I would put Obama on the
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:39.160]  spot I would call the FBI in and say we have a hate crime right here on tape
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:43.160]  we're gonna be calling we're gonna be calling for Chris Coster the Attorney
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:47.240]  General for State of Missouri to prosecute these individuals as a hate
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:53.880]  crime because it was the crime of the third degree assault was racially
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:59.360]  motivated even if it was the first the first perpetrator was it was a black
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:04.760]  American and nonetheless it was still racially motivated be clear of this
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:10.240]  because he did not believe that a black person could be selling the Gadsden
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.320]  Flags so it was a racially motivated beating and a brutal beating doesn't
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:21.680]  matter if you're black or white if you commit the crime based upon race then it
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.320]  will be considered a hate crime it will be elevated from a third degree salt to
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:34.640]  a de-missed of defaulting well just to have a historical note blacks fought and
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:40.160]  died in the very first skirmishes at Lexington and Concord if if my history
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.960]  serves so again that's almost denying African Americans their American
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:49.760]  heritage to be able to hand out a colonial flag I mean have they been
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:55.920]  trained by the DHS reports that anybody that hasn't has this symbol that I'm
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:00.040]  holding in my hand of the coiled snake don't tread on me I mean I guess that's
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:04.960]  why Nancy Pelosi says your astroturf they're saying your astroturf because
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:08.840]  that's what tyrants always do and we're saying no we're Americans who are free
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.200]  I'm not your slave I mean that's all this means was to the redcoats that we
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:16.920]  weren't their slaves I mean Kenneth why do you go out and hand out the Gadsden
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:23.960]  flags well I'm just I was just out selling selling the Gadsden flags and
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.480]  just trying to make a living you know trying to make a living for myself and
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.600]  and for my you know help out my wife and everything you know so this is even
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:34.360]  worse you weren't even out there politically you're just out there hey
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:41.560]  you want a flag I'll give you one these people I mean that's the crazy part
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:45.680]  about it is I run into Obama supporters now and they're like wild eyes they were
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.440]  all bought into this dream that everything was fine their house was gonna
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:52.960]  be paid for their car was gonna be paid for remember all that and and now they
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:57.880]  look at me or anybody else that doesn't worship him as it's my fault
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:02.760]  everything in fine this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:06.760]  consider buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:10.120]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:14.480]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:18.560]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:22.800]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:26.240]  power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.840]  months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is
[1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:32.920]  here again every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:37.160]  weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.800]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:44.760]  generators offered by solution from science a longtime sponsor of ours you

[1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:07.360]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:14.480]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network all right here's the
[1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:19.400]  audio and for prison planet TV viewers right now the video of one reporter
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:23.880]  actually asking serious questions then I saw reports of reporters being arrested
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:27.520]  who took photos of what really happened because somebody didn't want that those
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:31.520]  photos getting out and we're seeing I mean this gets crazier and crazier and
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:36.200]  remember the Obama people are sending us threatening emails the White House is
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:39.920]  called for Obama supporters to get out the streets and confront people this is
[1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:44.920]  New York Times but they're saying it's good and to create list of people and to
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:49.760]  report it to the White House and different branches investigative branches of
[1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:54.480]  Congress and others are saying this is illegal Nixon got in trouble for an
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:59.960]  enemy's list I mean they're saying spy on your neighbors report anyone and I
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:04.440]  and these Obama people they're crazy I mean I've never seen anything like this
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:09.840]  where you say hey cap and trades really bad it'll no other country has to make
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:13.080]  this new tax and it's going to shut down our industry and really hurt the
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.640]  economy and carbon dioxide what plants breathe and they'll go hot I didn't know
[1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:21.760]  you were racist Alex and I'm like no no it's it's cap and trade I I mean I'm
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:26.280]  like I'm not joking I mean I had videos removed that don't say anything about
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:33.400]  race and they and they removed them saying they're racist I mean ladies and
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:37.080]  gentlemen I can't believe this is happening let's play a clip of this
[1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:40.160]  congressman I'm being confronted by the media and then he really kind of just
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:45.920]  mumbles and the audio's level will jack it up here it is there's videotape of
[1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:49.840]  your supporters beating Kenneth Gladney and sending him to the hospital he
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:53.600]  spent the entire evening in St. John's Mercy Medical Center it was released
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:08:00.480]  this morning and was beaten by the union members how do you respond to that
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:10.320]  I didn't see any of that well the cameras the cameras did the cameras did but
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.680]  again the issue is here the media tried to spin this like oh there was a fight
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:19.440]  Republicans and Democrats got in a fight no it was the thugs attacking
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:23.480]  peaceful people and this is coming in everywhere so they're saying it's fake
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:27.720]  that spontaneous citizens aren't angry and that they want socialist health care
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:32.960]  and cap and trade to turn their guns in and I can play of the newscast effect
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:37.520]  let me just ask attorney David B Brown the man who was racially attacked Kenneth
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:42.120]  Gladney had you live near St. Louis did you see the newscast when the police went
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  on the TV during the election and said if you criticize Obama we're gonna be the
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:53.280]  judge and we're gonna arrest you I mean that's well I mean that's I didn't I
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.080]  didn't see those particular I've read about it on the Internet but the the
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:01.600]  crazy part about all this so I guess it's not so crazy I guess that we see
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:05.920]  out there is a pattern of this is a car and gets up there and mumbles and
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:09.640]  stumbles his way through there and pretends like nothing happened it tries
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:15.520]  to skirt and avoid the issue but then that the very same day a little later
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:20.840]  that day at 2 30 Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Stabilius
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:28.120]  holds a telephone conference with the SDIU members and she tells them keep on
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:33.000]  doing what you're doing into a direct context to the town all meetings if
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:40.480]  that's not ratification of a pattern of actions that are designed purposely to
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:47.480]  impede the everyday ordinary citizens ability to express themselves which is a
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:53.200]  fundamental right I don't know what is well I mean look P again I'm gonna say
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:56.760]  it for by the just tuned in Republicans are being run off the stage
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.760]  what happened when people start booing them for two or three minutes straight
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:04.400]  politicians leave so that's and the media spends it and says they chased them
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:11.560]  out no governor Perry senator Cornyn congressman dogged these videos just
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:17.520]  Google Cornyn booed you know this governor that governor booed I mean pick
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:22.360]  one they're all getting booed then when they leave they get basically chased so
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:26.080]  the media spends it and says the public you know tried to assault him or chased
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:30.440]  him out no as they leave the people follow him chanting they're mad and then
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.160]  the media lies and spends all of this and only reports on it when it's
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:39.280]  Democrats tells the Democrats racist are coming to attack you the Democrats get
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.840]  all puffed up and angry and run out and start beating black people
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:48.800]  how you're black racist I'm a pizza I mean that shows the crazy level of mind
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  control I mean you gentlemen agree that this is because we have the memos here
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:58.280]  that the Democratic Party and acorn and others are whipping these Democrats I
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:02.120]  mean I think a lot of these people are well-meaning I think a lot of these acorn
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:06.600]  people and union people really believe that a bunch of racists are coming to
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:10.920]  confront them at the event and so when they see a black guy they have to go
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:13.840]  ahead and attack him first because that doesn't fit into their false paradigm
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:19.000]  there's a pond in the chess game you know it's there's there's there's there's
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.600]  it's the power from above you know it's kind of like the Wizard of Oz you see
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:25.640]  Obama there but who's really who's really behind the curtain the same people
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:32.280]  behind the curtain for George Bush but but the the the point the point I want
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:41.600]  to make here is that the point I want to make here is that you know these people
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:48.000]  are being prohibited from from their First Amendment rights and it's driven
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.320]  by the powers that be I'll give you an example of the spin that that occurred
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:58.360]  the the very next night when we had a frenzy of people courting us to to
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:04.120]  speak all sorts of media outlets I get CNN calls us up requests for Ken to speak
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.160]  on Anderson Cooper I said well what type of what type of form is this yeah they
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:13.840]  said it was a debate I said a debate what Ken's gonna debate somebody and this
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:17.600]  is an intern for Anderson Cooper 360 I said Ken's gonna debate somebody debate
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:22.560]  who they said we want him to debate Russ Carney and about health care I'm like
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:26.560]  what does it have to do with Kenneth getting beaten down and getting his
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:32.360]  rights impringed upon this is just spin so that they can put Kenneth on CNN and
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:36.280]  try to make an idiot out of him which he's not but he is not a career
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.240]  politician he doesn't know that's what I'm saying is that and they're also
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:44.960]  accusing all of us that have our First Amendment hey I don't want to turn my
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.560]  guns in hey I don't want to have cap and trade I don't want socialized health
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:53.560]  care we've read the bill it's bad worse than you can even articulate it's so
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:59.360]  bad and they just go racist or they say that we're out at these events blocking
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:04.840]  their free speech when they're advertised as town halls I mean I mean
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:09.880]  people are mad and and and you know ABC News and a few have reported the truth
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:14.200]  that these are spontaneous because the first few days they tried to lie but I
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:18.800]  think we're winning this fight of getting the truth out it's just enclosing
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  gentlemen as this develops I want to have you back on Kenneth Gladney who got
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.160]  racially attacked for just being out there and they thought that you were
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:29.820]  against the Obama takeover and so they beat you up and you're gonna go to the
[1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:36.000]  hospital brutally attacked you any closing comments well I just like to
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:43.160]  say to everyone that I am an American citizen citizen I was beaten for
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:48.280]  something that I was paid to do and it is make an honest dollar I was doing I
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:55.600]  was making an honest dollar giving out gas flags and out of nowhere someone
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:00.480]  comes up to me get me in my face and attack me just attack me you know I
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:05.000]  just I don't I don't get that I don't understand you know what what's the

[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:45.920]  getting into churches and I mean these are political thugs and it's very very

[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:49.880]  the l.a. times that they should be taken down

[1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:06.840]  question do you really know what's in your tap water
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:10.520]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor
[1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.600]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:17.880]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer
[1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:20.920]  reproductive immune and developmental system diseases

[1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:19.000]  there is a science that the global architects are perfected of divide and
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:25.640]  conquer the great game they play us off against each other
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:30.040]  and that's all that's happening with obama but people are resisting and
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:33.240]  rebelling and going to any and all city council
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:36.920]  county commissioners state boards federal meetings
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:40.440]  and getting angry what the media didn't tell you always
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:44.520]  they first get up because i've talked to people i talked to
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:48.120]  again it was my mother's birthday today and a lot of her old friends were
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:51.880]  down here from dallas in places and one of them
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:55.720]  steve heinberg was there and he was a good friend of mine he was telling me
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:59.640]  about how he went to a town hall and they were shouting a republican off the
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:03.320]  stage and how there were all these goons
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:06.760]  handing out from acorn and things literature
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:11.080]  about the how great health care is and that there were other people there
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:14.200]  handing out literature saying it was bull that appeared to be just regular
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.960]  citizens you know the acorn people were all organized and focused and the other
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:22.760]  people weren't but that this turned into people
[1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:27.320]  basically chasing the republican leader off and then taking over the podium
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:30.520]  because people start chanting the republican left so the citizens just
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:32.760]  went up and started speaking at the microphone
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:36.440]  i mean in fact that was the article i had you print
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.160]  hartman i know you gave it to me i had several of them was here in my stack i
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.480]  meant to get to that then i'm going to your calls
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:48.200]  where we've got multiple reports where all these congress people there it is on
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.800]  the screen good good thinking citing safety concerns
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:59.000]  u-city councils cancels uh make cascals event a day after
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  russ carnahan event led to the arrest of five
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.600]  participants and a reporter they don't tell you it was the arrest of the
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:10.600]  obama people said they won't tell you that university city high school
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:14.840]  where u.s senator claire mcaskill was set to hold
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:19.560]  a similar event on thursday announced the forum had been
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:22.920]  canceled and they went on to say because of safety
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:26.920]  terrorist you know terrorist might strike so the message is
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:30.840]  just like the dhs report you don't like world government you don't like banks
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:36.120]  raping you you're a terrorist and i told you that was next would be them
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:40.120]  abandoning these meetings abandoning these events because they only want to
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.040]  have these events for the news to make it look like the public's buying into it
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:48.120]  so people sitting at home who are angry will go i guess other people don't care
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:51.640]  well i won't get involved because they know how human psychology works
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:55.320]  if you figure out both republicans and democrats are all awake and angry
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:58.360]  and then we actually agree with each other on more than we disagree
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:01.320]  and that the bill arrives at constitutions being violated we could bring
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:04.760]  all these crooks to justice we could audit the fed and arrest their butts
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:07.720]  for the crimes they've committed as ron paul said here last week
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:10.280]  all right let's go to your calls as promised for the balance of the show
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:14.280]  it's just youtube says they're going to shut down the alex jones channel
[1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:18.040]  they've sent us a notice to get ready for that for no reason
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:24.360]  uh just saying we're racist because nameless goons complained
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:28.600]  that means of a hundred people wanted to burn down my office under that idea
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:31.080]  that the police would come like the torches for them
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:35.720]  see in a republic the individual or the minority is protected against the
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:39.480]  majority in a democracy which hitler got elected in
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:44.520]  if 51 say kill the other 49 it happens in a democracy
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:47.880]  if people go and vote in austin to come take your house outright
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:52.280]  and move into it they do it and see they're telling these dumb down
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:56.360]  fluoride head masses that they're going to get the rich but the poor people
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:00.600]  think the rich or somebody driving a pinto that's got less
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:04.840]  rust on it than theirs or they're gremlin or they're uh you know
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:09.480]  whatever their hoopie is and so you like that apartment
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:13.240]  i mean the point is is that this is real folks
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:19.320]  the ultra rich use the poor working class or poor welfare class to wage war
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:23.880]  against the middle class pressure from above pressure from below
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.760]  folks if you got more than ten dollars in the bank you're in deep trouble if
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:29.800]  you're poor you're in deep trouble but they're going to sick the poor on what's
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:32.200]  left to this country the globalists don't want to free
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.040]  market their monopoly man is john d rockefeller the first said competition
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:38.200]  is a sin okay straight to your calls

[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.520]  everything that you're saying is completely real
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:55.800]  i'm a retired marina two-time war veteran i had
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:38:01.400]  some family come by and i knew that my wife's sister son had history of drug
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:05.080]  problems anyway i guess he was afraid of a two-time
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:09.720]  war veteran that's got ptsd ptsd and a hundred percent but um
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:13.960]  all you had to do is make a phone call and everything you're saying is true i
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:17.400]  was laying in my office actually listening to your radio show
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:20.360]  they came in they woke me up they got my son to open the door
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:24.520]  they tasered me they took me off barefoot all i had on with uh what i was
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:29.000]  sleeping in personally took me to a medical unit
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.200]  where i refused their shot because they wanted to give me shots or something i
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:35.960]  i'm not trusting any shot i've listened to you too long
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:39.000]  then they took me to jail and i was walking around jail barefoot so i'm
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.760]  just i'm also an author okay i've written three books
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:46.360]  the last book i wrote is called dream readers my co-author is interviewed
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.040]  clinton eastwood head kennedy jane russell
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:53.960]  i've interviewed darcy donovan that's awesome sitting to me but yeah for
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:57.960]  those that don't know they're gonna ban this is public most veterans owning
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:00.360]  guns first thing clinton did when he left office
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:03.800]  was turn over 86 thousand names of vets with ptsd
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.720]  no judge no jury you don't get your gun and they have a bill introduced called
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:11.080]  no fly no buy there's 1.2 million on it
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:15.480]  since they made its secret six months ago it was growing 25 000 names a week
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:19.800]  and they're saying that the attorney general will put you on a no gun list
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.880]  even though you have no crimes no convictions and then obama says he will
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:27.320]  hold us citizens in domestic bases
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:31.480]  with uh no habeas corpus indefinitely forever
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:36.120]  worse than bush and but then he does some shill thing about he's gonna
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:39.560]  investigate uh if there was torture when they know there was
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:43.240]  torture from the army's own reports he'll do that to cover up
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:49.240]  and yes the dhs report says the number one terror threat is veterans and the
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:53.960]  whole department of homeland security system is set up to take your guns
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:58.200]  write it up in an article send it to uh
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:01.960]  writers at info wars dot com anything else sir
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:06.120]  no i just wanted i just wanted your audience to know that um
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:09.720]  i mean i i can look out the window of my neighborhood at my landpost and i see
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:14.120]  a black thing on top of it this is uh it's a nightmare i just finished a book
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:16.360]  called dream reaches i'm not trying to plug my book
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:19.960]  no that's fine listen i appreciate your call now they got cameras everywhere
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:24.840]  it's golden eye you see that movie people should see it
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:27.880]  and there's an eagle eye i watched on the treadmill people kept seeing i needed
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:31.480]  to watch it it's all about this computer and it's watching and face scanning
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:35.400]  everybody from from from blimps they already had that 10 years ago people
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.800]  laughed at me now it's declassified they really have stuff like that
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.320]  and that's how they can launch terror attacks one globalist can go in
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.840]  and order the computer see it's not a computer running wild
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.520]  on its own it's being given orders and then it does it and then the globalists
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:53.640]  don't need accomplices and bob wooper just wrote a
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:57.160]  book about this he calls it the secret weapon of the pentagon
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:41:01.160]  it's not so secret uh let's talk to jay and mass

[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:17.080]  that if that if that if a few people complain and say it's racist
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:21.080]  then my videos gone and now they have bills that if somebody complains and
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:24.440]  say you hurt their feelings you get arrested federally i mean that's in
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:27.800]  the bill you know that that's just the last
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:31.240]  draw from you i don't know why that that hits me so hard but it just
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.320]  just twists right where it hurts the most for me well it's the soviet union i
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:39.640]  mean there's not much liberty left and they're getting rid of the last bits

[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:18.760]  claiming terrorists did it or saying it's a regular flu
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:22.280]  to set the military up to set up the fema camps they're taking over
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:25.720]  old shopping malls all over the country right here in austin
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:31.880]  the old mall they are a highland mall they are setting up fema camps but
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:35.240]  posing like it's good oh all the homeless come here
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:40.120]  oh we reeducate you here oh the army's running checkpoints to stop drunk
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.920]  drivers oh oh the governor of tennessee says we're

[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:56.360]  they're just incrementally getting everybody conditioned to this
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:51:00.680]  and so they're going to have the flu fear mongering and say your kids are
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:03.960]  dead if you don't take it and then just set the precedent
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:07.000]  and then later clamp down more and more it's
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:12.520]  it's an incremental domestication process so that's how they're going to do it
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:14.840]  but and we're going to fight back with our incremental
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:18.520]  we have the long view of history here but we fight
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:23.320]  as hard as we can now but we also understand it's a process we don't

[1:51:49.960 --> 1:51:55.240]  the news from last thursday and friday and so i don't have i i don't have the
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:52:02.360]  healthcare bill here in front of me uh but you can google a lot of senators
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:05.800]  have breakdowns of it with the subsections and links
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:09.720]  and so i've gone over those previously here on the show we've got about four
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:14.840]  minutes five minutes left but we've posted the breakdowns
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:19.720]  on info wars dot com in the featured story area we posted a detailed breakdown
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:25.400]  wednesday so go to the featured news area of info wars dot com the featured
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:31.640]  archive and go through and you'll see breakdowns of the healthcare bill
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:35.880]  and some stories we've got there that when we make a bullet point claim
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:39.880]  we have a link to the bill in the subsection but i don't uh i'd have to
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:43.240]  dig it out i actually do have it here in one of these stacks here
[1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:45.880]  i will look that up but uh my understanding was there were three
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:50.760]  separate bills there's a house bill and a senate health committee bill
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:55.160]  hello yes ma'am and then there's a senate finance committee
[1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:59.400]  bill and they're gonna vote on you know hash it out and change it around and
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:03.480]  vote on the final so yeah nothing if i understand it nothing's final
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:07.560]  right now it's just in the process and there's three different
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:10.840]  bills and i couldn't find that while i was looking to you i was trying to find
[1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:15.160]  it in my copies and i couldn't find what you were talking about so i'll go
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:19.400]  to your side and look that up but um i did attend one of the hearings
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:24.200]  the meetings here in austin and i think what's going to have to happen is that
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:27.320]  they're going to have to have the meetings inside and they're going to have to
[1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:30.280]  check people's IDs to see if they live in the district
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:34.200]  because i think a lot of people go they're confused they don't know where
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:38.280]  they're from the congressional district is and yeah but you can't start doing
[1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:41.320]  that it's good to have people from another district in another district
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:45.800]  this is america we don't have nazi checkpoints and yellow stars on us and
