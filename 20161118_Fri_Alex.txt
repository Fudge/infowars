[00:00.000 --> 00:15.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:15.440 --> 00:16.440]  show.
[00:16.440 --> 00:20.880]  I tell you, who would have thought Donald Trump would be the man to deliver the republic
[00:20.880 --> 00:23.200]  from the brink of death.
[00:23.200 --> 00:26.080]  He could not have picked somebody better for Attorney General than Senator Sessions.
[00:26.080 --> 00:28.880]  He is going to burn the gloves to the ground.
[00:28.880 --> 00:30.760]  DrudgeReport.com says it all.
[00:30.760 --> 00:34.760]  The globalists are meeting, panicking, trying to save their program.
[00:34.760 --> 00:37.800]  In Obama's own words, globalism is in crisis.
[00:37.800 --> 00:43.600]  The New York Times responds saying globalism does not exist and I am insane.
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.240]  So that talk about quadrupling down, I mean, these people literally are trying to engage
[00:49.240 --> 00:52.280]  in mind control and it isn't working.
[00:52.280 --> 00:54.840]  The fake news narrative is imploding as well.
[00:54.840 --> 00:55.840]  That's coming up after the break.
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.560]  But first, Paul Watson on the arrogance of the dying, true fake news.
[01:01.560 --> 01:06.800]  Having lost the election and lost the argument, the butthurt left and the rigged media is
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.120]  desperate to salvage some scrap of credibility.
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.200]  So they've decided to create a new panic over so-called fake news, pressuring Google and
[01:15.200 --> 01:18.080]  Facebook to take action against fake news websites.
[01:18.080 --> 01:24.080]  Oh, and when they say fake news, that includes any reporting or opinion that contradicts
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.360]  their leftist narrative.
[01:25.360 --> 01:29.600]  The blacklist that all the mainstream media websites are circulating as the official
[01:29.600 --> 01:35.600]  designation of what constitutes fake news includes info wars and Breitbart.
[01:35.600 --> 01:37.400]  Well, imagine my shock.
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.640]  But this list of fake news websites, it had to be created by a reasoned level headed impartial
[01:42.640 --> 01:43.640]  source.
[01:43.640 --> 01:46.080]  There can't be any bias involved in this, right?
[01:46.080 --> 01:47.080]  Wrong.
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.200]  It was created by a radical leftist safe space social justice warrior assistant professor
[01:51.200 --> 01:56.240]  who describes herself as a feminist activist and who supports extreme left wing groups
[01:56.240 --> 01:59.320]  like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street.
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.120]  Well, imagine my shock.
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.920]  So the media is circulating a list of fake news websites created by an incredibly biased
[02:06.920 --> 02:12.800]  left wing social justice warrior, which just by coincidence is full of conservative news
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.680]  websites and then demanding Google and Facebook send to that content.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.480]  This is all happening while Twitter also mass purges so-called alt-right accounts for
[02:22.480 --> 02:25.360]  daring to express unauthorized opinions.
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.640]  They're also promoting a Chrome browser extension that automatically flags so-called fake news
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.640]  websites based on this same SJW created blacklist.
[02:35.640 --> 02:37.760]  And imagine my shock.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.040]  Infowars.com is on that list.
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.240]  Listen, we all know that there are actual fake news websites.
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.480]  They're pretty easy to spot and some of them even admit that they're fake news websites.
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.480]  But there's a difference between fake news stories like this and having a conservative
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.480]  opinion.
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.560]  And anyway, who gave the mainstream media the right to be judge, jury and executioner
[03:00.560 --> 03:02.880]  of what constitutes fake news?
[03:02.880 --> 03:05.520]  All you do is put out fake news.
[03:05.520 --> 03:08.640]  You're the aficionados of fake news.
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.400]  You put out the fake news that Hillary Clinton was 98% likely to win the presidency.
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.280]  You printed out and shipped copies of Newsweek celebrating Madame President.
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.720]  You said the Cubs had a smaller chance of winning than Donald Trump.
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.800]  You put out fake rigged polls that were proven spectacularly wrong.
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.400]  You put out fake rape stories that ruin people's lives over and over again.
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.480]  You fake interviews with your own camera men claiming they're anti-Trump protesters.
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.920]  You create fake narratives like Trump being responsible for violence at his own rallies
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.320]  when it was DNC funded agitators all along.
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.720]  By this measure, nearly every mainstream media outlet should be put on a fake news list.
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.680]  Oh yeah, and when some fake news website puts out a fake news story, the worst case scenario
[03:57.680 --> 04:00.920]  is that someone makes some ill-gotten advertising dollars.
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.120]  Even the mainstream media pedals fake news like the fake news story that Saddam Hussein
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.360]  had, weapons of mass destruction, hundreds of thousands of people die.
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.680]  You're the f***ing experts at fake news, so how dare you accuse us of being fake news?
[04:16.680 --> 04:19.600]  And why the hell should anyone trust you?
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.840]  As WikiLeaks exposed, you're not the fourth estate you're a public relations front for
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.640]  the Democratic Party.
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.160]  You lost the argument.
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.200]  You trashed your own credibility, and now you're trying to resurrect it by claiming
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.480]  that everyone who beat you is fake news.
[04:35.480 --> 04:37.080]  Give me a break.
[04:37.080 --> 04:38.880]  No one trusts you.
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.200]  That's why you have to resort to dirty tricks and censorship, and it's not going to work.
[04:44.200 --> 04:54.160]  Because you suck, you lie, and everyone knows now that you're fake news.
[04:54.160 --> 04:58.360]  An extremely powerful report is on infowars.com, I'm going to tweet it right now at Real Alex
[04:58.360 --> 04:59.360]  Jones.
[04:59.360 --> 05:00.360]  Let's share it.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.680]  Donald Trump is not even president yet, and he is already cashing in on his word of bringing
[05:04.680 --> 05:06.200]  jobs back to America.
[05:06.200 --> 05:12.240]  I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.000]  I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.240]  Ford has decided to continue to manufacture its Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky, and
[05:20.240 --> 05:22.800]  not move to Mexico as they had previously planned.
[05:22.800 --> 05:25.960]  Ford has said they are happy to work with President Trump, and are glad he is making
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.160]  American manufacturing competitive and great again.
[05:29.160 --> 05:33.720]  Reports are also surfacing that Apple is considering manufacturing their iPhones in California.
[05:33.720 --> 05:38.440]  Apple has asked its Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing
[05:38.440 --> 05:40.080]  their iPhones in America.
[05:40.080 --> 05:44.400]  Are these the first dominoes to get Americans off the welfare state and into the workforce?
[05:44.400 --> 05:48.520]  Will there be a time when you can pick up an electronic, and it says Made in America,
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.600]  coming soon to a presidency near you?
[05:50.600 --> 05:55.720]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[05:55.720 --> 05:56.720]  I tell you that.
[05:56.720 --> 06:00.120]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[06:00.120 --> 06:05.080]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[06:05.080 --> 06:10.040]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[06:10.040 --> 06:12.280]  for power grid chaos.
[06:12.280 --> 06:18.880]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.480]  real threat to our grid.
[06:20.480 --> 06:23.760]  My friend's chaos is already here, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.360]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[06:28.360 --> 06:29.760]  of backup electricity.
[06:29.760 --> 06:34.840]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house, the solutions from science
[06:34.840 --> 06:35.840]  system.
[06:35.840 --> 06:38.440]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.

[06:59.880 --> 07:04.720]  Infowars is proud to announce the official Infowars Live app, available now for iPhone

[07:29.000 --> 07:32.520]  This is the first release, and it was completely built from the ground up.
[07:32.520 --> 07:36.320]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.080]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[07:40.080 --> 07:44.360]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[07:44.360 --> 07:45.360]  agendas.
[07:45.360 --> 07:50.280]  Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[07:55.520 --> 08:24.720]  of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:25.520 --> 08:35.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, to say that the news is an incredibly positive across the board
[08:35.760 --> 08:39.120]  is an understatement.
[08:39.120 --> 08:42.920]  I tend to celebrate things after the fact.
[08:42.920 --> 08:45.240]  I tend to also grieve after the fact.
[08:45.240 --> 08:51.000]  I won't cry at say grandparents funeral, but I'll start bawling a week or a month later,
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  maybe a year later.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.400]  But I tell you, when it comes to celebrating, I am in ecstasy right now.
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.600]  I am higher than a kite, and the only drug I've taken today is a half cup of coffee.
[09:01.600 --> 09:03.560]  I am higher than a kite right now.
[09:03.560 --> 09:10.480]  I am feeling so good because I've had time to really analyze what's happening and really
[09:10.480 --> 09:17.400]  track what Trump's really up to from the outside and the inside, and I'm telling you it's beautiful.
[09:17.400 --> 09:19.600]  That said, I don't see how they won't kill him.
[09:19.600 --> 09:20.680]  They're so damn arrogant.
[09:20.680 --> 09:22.600]  They don't care if it makes them a martyr.
[09:22.600 --> 09:30.920]  These people are very ham-fisted at this point because their best laid plans have gone astray.
[09:30.920 --> 09:34.280]  Ford is announcing that it's not going to move its plants out of the U.S.
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.280]  Not just one plant.
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.760]  It's now being announced that there's a whole initiative to just keep them here, period.
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.480]  Apple is now announcing they're going to move one of their main plants out of China to the
[09:44.480 --> 09:45.480]  United States.
[09:45.480 --> 09:46.480]  They said they're looking at it.
[09:46.480 --> 09:48.800]  It's basically a done deal.
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.920]  All because they know Trump is going to burn them if they don't, and China can go to hell.
[09:55.920 --> 09:59.560]  They can have 20-plus Foxconn labs for Apple.
[09:59.560 --> 10:01.120]  Can we have one?
[10:01.120 --> 10:04.400]  Can we maybe you get 20, something we get one?
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.360]  This isn't a trade war.
[10:06.360 --> 10:09.600]  The globalists have had their foot on our neck, and by the way, all these top analysts
[10:09.600 --> 10:16.360]  are now admitting, okay, the dollar's up, okay, all these equities are up, okay, yes, yes,
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.200]  this will make the average person more wealthy, yes, what Trump's doing is classic America,
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.200]  okay, yeah.
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.240]  But they'd all been intimidated and didn't have leadership to do this.
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.920]  He's now announcing Senator Jeff Sessions, who is one of the most honorable men in modern
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.760]  history, to be the new attorney general.
[10:38.760 --> 10:40.080]  Could not have had a better pick.
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.200]  I am just, notice it's not who they kept saying Giuliani and people like that.
[10:46.200 --> 10:56.840]  They said, splendid, splendid, splendid, delicious, oh, oh, it's just, literally, I have hundreds
[10:56.840 --> 10:59.920]  of articles here, each one better than the next.
[10:59.920 --> 11:01.520]  Just each one better than the next.
[11:01.520 --> 11:04.960]  Just look at this on the fake news front.
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.120]  We've looked forever for the name, the dinosaur media, the deception media, the prostitute,
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.440]  the scumbags, the collaborator media, but you know, they are the fake news media, the
[11:13.440 --> 11:14.440]  fake corporate media.
[11:14.440 --> 11:16.800]  And I've called them that before, but that's the name.
[11:16.800 --> 11:21.280]  They're now giving us that name because we're stomping them into oblivion.
[11:21.280 --> 11:28.840]  The awakening is just absolutely ultramassive, colossal, gargantuan, explosive to the power
[11:28.840 --> 11:30.840]  of 10.
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.440]  And so they come out with some cat lady, nothing against cats, but I mean, it's always got
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.520]  to be a cat lady wearing ironic glasses.
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.280]  A professor made a list of what's fake, and so Google adopted it, and then Quantcast adopted
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.080]  it, and then we learned it's this whole way to purge libertarian and nationalistic media
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.320]  that's dominant.
[11:52.320 --> 11:53.320]  Guess what they did?
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.400]  Quantcast removed it and actually showed us what our ranking was today.
[11:56.400 --> 11:59.400]  They agreed, okay, yes, you're not fake news.
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just challenged them.
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.320]  We said, listen, I know you're a cat lady and a social justice warrior, and you think men
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.320]  existing is bad.
[12:07.320 --> 12:09.640]  I mean, she literally just thinks men are bad period.
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.240]  We get you, you're entitled, you think you're God, you live, you know, like a hobbit in
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.000]  your little university, in fantasy world.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.400]  But guess what Info Wars is?
[12:19.400 --> 12:25.440]  I kept saying it was 167 as of last week, giving an idea of drugs is like 90-something.
[12:25.440 --> 12:31.680]  InfoWars.com is 126, 100, and all they do is hook into Google Analytics.
[12:31.680 --> 12:32.680]  We have these numbers.
[12:32.680 --> 12:34.360]  We're even bigger than that.
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.400]  Now, here's the key, Info Wars is not the center of what we did.
[12:39.400 --> 12:40.400]  It's not.
[12:40.400 --> 12:42.440]  It's like 25%.
[12:42.440 --> 12:44.960]  We have any idea how big, I mean, I'm not even bragging.
[12:44.960 --> 12:50.120]  I just realized I need to throw it in the enemy's face and just laugh at them.
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.240]  We're bigger than the BBC and what like CNN combined.
[12:54.240 --> 12:56.320]  We're bigger than the New York Times.
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.480]  These people are delusional.
[12:59.480 --> 13:05.320]  And guess what, a Mexican kingpin, he's not even Mexican, a Middle Eastern kingpin doesn't
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.400]  finance us, our listeners do.
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.000]  It's just a beautiful American system.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.120]  We are wrecking you.
[13:13.120 --> 13:19.440]  So I want to salutedrudgereport.com more than anybody in this fight going back even 10 years
[13:19.440 --> 13:22.240]  ago supporting us, taking a lot of heat, I know for it.
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.880]  But Drudge knew we were hardcore cutting-edge news and we've developed over the years.
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.360]  InfoWars isn't even really a modern design.
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.520]  We're going to redo it soon so it looks cleaner and better like Breitbartter and other sites.
[13:31.520 --> 13:34.360]  But I mean, just with an old design and stuff, it's like four or five years old.
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.000]  We are wrecking the enemy because of you.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.360]  You are the info where I keep explaining it, folks, that it isn't hype.
[13:42.360 --> 13:46.920]  We have free market culture, Americana, the apple of the world's eye.
[13:46.920 --> 13:49.280]  We turn the breakers back on, folks.
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.160]  We'll be the shining city on the hill.
[13:52.160 --> 13:55.360]  And that's why they're panicking with their race garbage and all of it.
[13:55.360 --> 14:01.360]  I mean, trying to make the new majority that is Hispanics and Asians and others feel like
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.440]  they can't have the American dream, that it's antithetical, that it's racist.
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.080]  Why'd you come here, then, because a shell of what was there is better than where you
[14:10.080 --> 14:11.080]  came from?
[14:11.080 --> 14:12.080]  I get it.
[14:12.080 --> 14:18.120]  You just can't come here and be indoctrinated into some brainwashed enemy of the middle class
[14:18.120 --> 14:19.720]  and be turned into an anti-white racist.
[14:19.720 --> 14:22.040]  It's not going to happen.
[14:22.040 --> 14:23.040]  We're going to fight it.
[14:23.040 --> 14:26.000]  There's a lot of news on that front as well.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.960]  But God forbid Trump bring back factories, air-conditioning factories, refrigerator factories.
[14:32.960 --> 14:35.520]  Hundreds of them are announcing they're staying now.
[14:35.520 --> 14:37.720]  Because they were just waiting for the initiative.
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.480]  They were waiting for the president.
[14:39.480 --> 14:41.280]  They were waiting for the leader.
[14:41.280 --> 14:44.240]  Just like in Viva Vendetta, he's talking to the inspector and the inspector goes, why
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.240]  did you do it sooner?
[14:45.240 --> 14:46.240]  Why didn't you?
[14:46.240 --> 14:47.840]  He goes, I was waiting for you, man.
[14:47.840 --> 14:50.200]  I was waiting for a few good people on the inside.
[14:50.200 --> 14:52.080]  I was waiting for you.
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.440]  That's why they want us to start a civil war and go and shoot cops in the back of the head
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.440]  like that's a revolution, because that will cause us all to implode and beat each other's
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.440]  throats.
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.440]  So let me explain something.
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.400]  I don't know the words yet, but baby, we are in the lead and it's ours to lose.
[15:06.400 --> 15:09.600]  And I want to thank Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.240]  About four days before the election, I sincerely broke down and cried on air.
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.680]  And I used to maybe tears my eyes once or twice every couple of years when I thought
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.640]  about, you know, dead family or some sad story or saw something sad on the news.
[15:22.640 --> 15:24.840]  I'm a sentimental guy.
[15:24.840 --> 15:28.120]  The tears in my eyes that I get at the dinner table at night and driving home from work
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.440]  now probably 50 times a day sometimes is the energy of the Republic coming back from the
[15:33.440 --> 15:34.440]  dead.
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.640]  These aren't tears of pain.
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.640]  These are tears of joy.
[15:37.640 --> 15:39.960]  That doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[15:39.960 --> 15:41.840]  It doesn't mean evil isn't spiraling out of control.
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.960]  It doesn't mean there's not all the nanotech and GMO and genetic engineering and all of
[15:45.960 --> 15:46.960]  it.
[15:46.960 --> 15:52.040]  But I can feel the spirit of good beginning to come back into the world right now and
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.800]  people are breaking the bondage.
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.400]  They're coming out of the matrix.
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.600]  They're coming out of the lie and it is, you can, you can, you can, you can feel it.
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.080]  It's like you go to a pep rally and you feel the energy or a concert, you know, the brain
[16:05.080 --> 16:10.160]  waves, you can feel the electricity and Trump feels it too.
[16:10.160 --> 16:12.400]  And Trump wants that positive energy.
[16:12.400 --> 16:14.680]  That's why he goes where the good is.
[16:14.680 --> 16:20.200]  That's why he feeds off of it because he's not out to get you.
[16:20.200 --> 16:25.640]  You think it's why the love sitting around in gold palaces, like seeing people poor?
[16:25.640 --> 16:27.280]  No, he didn't like it.
[16:27.280 --> 16:28.960]  Lobos though.
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.840]  They admit they engineered art and architecture in the last 60 years to make you feel ugly,
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.200]  to make you feel small and to make you feel hopeless.
[16:36.200 --> 16:37.200]  Look it up.
[16:37.200 --> 16:39.320]  It's been declassified two years ago.
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.160]  CIA finance, ugly architecture and art to make people feel small.
[16:43.160 --> 16:44.160]  That's not the CIA.
[16:44.160 --> 16:49.720]  That's criminals that have hijacked our government.
[16:49.720 --> 16:52.920]  So the social engineers want to fight.
[16:52.920 --> 16:56.160]  As I've always said, I don't know how this is going to end, but it's the journey is
[16:56.160 --> 16:57.160]  the destination.
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.120]  It's the fighting that God wants to see.
[16:59.120 --> 17:00.120]  You want to fight.
[17:00.120 --> 17:06.040]  You better believe you've got one and you could misrepresent what I say and twist it
[17:06.040 --> 17:07.040]  all day long.
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.480]  People come here in much bigger numbers than they come to you and they find out what's
[17:10.480 --> 17:11.480]  really going on.
[17:11.480 --> 17:13.720]  And quite frankly, sometimes it's embarrassing how I act yesterday.
[17:13.720 --> 17:16.200]  I was so hateful towards these people because I hate them.
[17:16.200 --> 17:17.200]  They're out to get me.
[17:17.200 --> 17:18.200]  They're my enemy.
[17:18.200 --> 17:19.200]  They're your enemy.
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.200]  They're the enemy that I was being very nasty.
[17:20.200 --> 17:21.200]  You know what?
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.200]  I'm proud of that.
[17:22.200 --> 17:23.200]  That was real.
[17:23.200 --> 17:24.200]  That's who I am.
[17:24.200 --> 17:25.200]  I love a lot.
[17:25.200 --> 17:26.200]  I hate a lot.
[17:26.200 --> 17:27.200]  I'm not going to sit here and make excuses for it.
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.360]  I got a lot of hate because I got a lot of love.
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.520]  It's beyond hate.
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.560]  They're just despicable traitor filth.
[17:35.560 --> 17:36.560]  I don't want to think about them.
[17:36.560 --> 17:37.560]  Excuse me.
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.280]  I'm not an vindictive person, but I love seeing Hillary rotting and falling apart and just
[17:42.280 --> 17:44.600]  seeing that witch melt in front of our eyes.
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.480]  Thank you, Jesus Christ.
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.080]  Thank you, Father, above for your son.
[17:48.080 --> 17:49.440]  Thank you for the Holy Spirit.
[17:49.440 --> 17:52.040]  Thank you for goodness, and thank you for everything you've done.
[17:52.040 --> 17:55.760]  We repent from what we've done, and we commit to be better people.
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.000]  It is such a great time to be alive.
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.360]  I can feel the spirit of God rising, and the more God comes into the world, the more these
[18:05.360 --> 18:08.480]  evil people are just despicable and disgusting, aren't they?
[18:08.480 --> 18:10.280]  Is your spirit stronger?
[18:10.280 --> 18:14.080]  You recognize them more, and you can't be around them.
[18:14.080 --> 18:18.660]  Because we start resonating, ladies and gentlemen, that's why they hate us.
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.720]  They don't want us in the world, folks.
[18:20.720 --> 18:23.160]  We can't get along.
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.000]  The sheep and the goats don't co-exist.
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  Figure that out.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.080]  They're not giving us quarter, none no quarter given, none taken.
[18:32.080 --> 18:39.960]  We're going to run those black flags up, baby, committed to this, and I can feel their howls
[18:39.960 --> 18:45.280]  of despair as their lust to hurt the innocents, and their lust to make people poor, and their
[18:45.280 --> 18:52.440]  lust to dominate and break society's will, as their will is broken.
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.760]  The greatest scythe was these controlled churches, always telling you it's the end of the world
[18:55.760 --> 19:00.640]  right around the corner, and give up, because there's no point, and the devil runs everything.
[19:00.640 --> 19:03.720]  The devil's only here to test us, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what the future
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.720]  brings.
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.400]  Undoubtedly, revelations will be fulfilled, but in God's time, and any man that tells
[19:08.400 --> 19:11.160]  you he knows is an agent of the devil.
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.880]  That's Christ.
[19:12.880 --> 19:18.400]  Let no man deceive you, and tell you he knows the hour of the day.
[19:18.400 --> 19:26.400]  It's all there, and we're going to come back, and I'm just, I mean, oh my God, this is all
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.400]  lush.
[19:27.400 --> 19:28.400]  It's news.
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.240]  There's some important things we have to look at, Western women being raped in the Middle
[19:31.240 --> 19:32.240]  East.
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.600]  When you get raped, you go to prison, even if it's admitted, because you're not a person,
[19:36.600 --> 19:43.200]  and that's why I'm a bigot, because I don't want radical Islam running our entire country
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.200]  and world.
[19:44.200 --> 19:47.520]  And then we've got the Islamists licking their butts and stuff.
[19:47.520 --> 19:50.760]  That's all coming up on, I'm going to show you.
[19:50.760 --> 19:52.720]  In Italy, people basically licking their butts.
[19:52.720 --> 20:21.560]  Stay with us.
[20:21.560 --> 20:48.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[20:48.240 --> 21:14.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[21:14.240 --> 21:40.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[21:40.240 --> 22:07.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[22:07.240 --> 22:32.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.440]  But now, a landmark U.S. government study confirms increased health risks from exposure
[22:36.440 --> 22:39.200]  to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[23:56.720 --> 24:03.080]  We have a Big Berkey Water Filter.
[24:03.080 --> 24:04.080]  We are back live.
[24:04.080 --> 24:10.520]  You know, things are different when Trump has launched GreatAgain.gov.
[24:10.520 --> 24:12.880]  That's right, GreatAgain.gov.
[24:12.880 --> 24:13.880]  Thank you for your support.
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.560]  An actual federal government executive website can read about the President-Elect, the Vice
[24:18.560 --> 24:24.120]  President-Elect News, Making America Great Again, Serving America, that means getting
[24:24.120 --> 24:26.640]  jobs in the executive branch.
[24:26.640 --> 24:30.640]  And I saw different clips last night of John Stuart and others saying, what does it mean
[24:30.640 --> 24:31.840]  to make it great again?
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.040]  No one ever asked him.
[24:33.040 --> 24:35.800]  No, it means cutting taxes.
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.280]  It means sitting a lot of power back to the states.
[24:39.280 --> 24:43.160]  It means doing the things that made this country so successful again and not running
[24:43.160 --> 24:46.440]  it down all day.
[24:46.440 --> 24:47.440]  That's what it means.
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.800]  And then they sell the idea, no, it means make it white again.
[24:50.800 --> 24:56.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, America in most areas is 50% Hispanic now.
[24:56.760 --> 25:01.200]  Now, if you look at demographics, like I said, in 10, 15 years, depending on the demographics,
[25:01.200 --> 25:04.080]  70% or more will be Hispanic.
[25:04.080 --> 25:07.880]  There have been Gallup polls where 71% of Hispanic Americans that are citizens want
[25:07.880 --> 25:08.880]  to control the border.
[25:08.880 --> 25:11.360]  Sure, every other Latin American country tries to control their border.
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.880]  You don't have a country if you don't.
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.160]  They've got new polls out where it's almost 60%, but they have brainwashed some Hispanics
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.200]  that if someone likes Donald Trump or someone wants to control the border, that there must
[25:24.200 --> 25:25.200]  be racists.
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.320]  No, we just can't have totally open borders.
[25:27.320 --> 25:28.320]  No one else does.
[25:28.320 --> 25:30.520]  This is globalism conquering our country.
[25:30.520 --> 25:33.280]  You're being used to do that.
[25:33.280 --> 25:39.200]  I would love it if it was a Hispanic president or a woman president if they were like Trump.
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.920]  I do not care what color their hair is, what color their skin is, what color their eyes
[25:43.920 --> 25:44.920]  are.
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.480]  What's going on inside that brain, and Hillary Clinton is a demon witch, has nothing to do
[25:49.480 --> 25:50.760]  with the fact that she's a woman.
[25:50.760 --> 25:52.680]  Oh, you just don't like strong women.
[25:52.680 --> 25:55.080]  Give me a break.
[25:55.080 --> 25:57.480]  Give me, I love strong women.
[25:57.480 --> 25:59.280]  Man, they can help me get stuff done.
[25:59.280 --> 26:01.600]  It's like saying, I don't want a strong wife.
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.760]  I don't want someone that helps me get stuff done who's, I want, are you kidding?
[26:06.760 --> 26:11.320]  What a man's looking for is a dynamic, strong woman.
[26:11.320 --> 26:13.960]  It's just total insulting of reality.
[26:13.960 --> 26:20.360]  Are there poor white people that look around and see a bunch of Hispanics doing better than
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.840]  they are because they're farmer generations and are working harder and get pissed off?
[26:24.840 --> 26:25.840]  Sure.
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.320]  But that, that is underlying and very, very small.
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.400]  And it's just, again, they have tripled down on this entire race narrative and the goodness
[26:32.400 --> 26:34.520]  is almost no one is buying it.
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.160]  And when Trump delivers prosperity and the mainstream media tries to cover it up and
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.760]  sabotage it, it's going to be irrevocable.
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.880]  I am so glad I was bummed out at first that mainstream media has just intensified their
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.560]  lives, but I understand that's a failed system they've been engaged in.
[26:52.560 --> 26:56.400]  And so their playbook is a losing playbook.
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.240]  So if there are enemy, we shouldn't interrupt our enemies while they're destroying themselves,
[27:01.240 --> 27:02.240]  should we?
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.240]  Now, this is a short segment.
[27:04.240 --> 27:06.600]  Let me tell you some of the news is coming up in detail.
[27:06.600 --> 27:09.680]  Look at drudgerport.com.
[27:09.680 --> 27:17.760]  Obama is over in Germany and Europe, he just left Greece yesterday, trying to prop up globalism.
[27:17.760 --> 27:18.760]  And that's the headlines.
[27:18.760 --> 27:19.760]  Globalism and crisis.
[27:19.760 --> 27:22.240]  I mean, that's the Financial Times of London, you name it.
[27:22.240 --> 27:23.240]  Der Spiegel.
[27:23.240 --> 27:24.800]  I've got stacks of news.
[27:24.800 --> 27:26.320]  Global government's in trouble.
[27:26.320 --> 27:29.760]  And what, what does Merkel say?
[27:29.760 --> 27:32.080]  She says, we're not letting the EU go.
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.880]  German finance minister, Warren's Britain, could still be paying into Brussels coffers
[27:35.880 --> 27:37.600]  in 2030.
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.400]  They're telling him, we're not letting you go.
[27:39.400 --> 27:41.560]  You never voted to be part of this.
[27:41.560 --> 27:43.160]  You're not allowed to leave now.
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.920]  You didn't do your article 50, right?
[27:44.920 --> 27:45.920]  So you can't go.
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.720]  And as I said, folks, people go, oh, Briggs, it's been scuttled.
[27:49.720 --> 27:51.040]  We knew this would happen.
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.760]  But the process of forcing them out in the open to say, you can't leave, we run you.
[27:56.760 --> 28:02.800]  I mean, 20 years ago, you couldn't even get people to admit there was a European union
[28:02.800 --> 28:03.800]  being set up.
[28:03.800 --> 28:04.800]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.240]  When I was first on air, just five years, six years before it was official.
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.280]  And it was already codified under law.
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.440]  They just hadn't announced it, kind of like the North American union is already in place.
[28:14.440 --> 28:16.920]  The Asian union's been in place for decades.
[28:16.920 --> 28:19.680]  They don't tell you until it's all done.
[28:19.680 --> 28:23.520]  And TPP was going to be done for the Asian union and the Atlantic treaty between the
[28:23.520 --> 28:29.240]  US and Europe was going to weld the three super states together.
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.480]  That's official trilateral commission info.
[28:31.480 --> 28:37.640]  But remember on Monday, the New York Times said, Alex Jones is crazy.
[28:37.640 --> 28:40.120]  I have it right here.
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.400]  Globalism doesn't exist and Obama's in Germany saying we've got to defend globalism.
[28:45.400 --> 28:46.600]  It's in crisis.
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.080]  But here's the New York Times telling its readers it doesn't exist in its code word
[28:51.080 --> 28:52.080]  for anti-Semitism.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.080]  What?
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.240]  But where does this crap come from?
[28:57.240 --> 29:03.440]  The TPP with more than 50 countries running us, what's that have to do with Jews?
[29:03.440 --> 29:06.600]  It's countries all over the world with corporations taking over our sovereignty.
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.600]  They just inject that.
[29:07.600 --> 29:09.360]  It's like, I don't like your health care plan.
[29:09.360 --> 29:10.360]  It's a ripoff.
[29:10.360 --> 29:11.360]  Shut up, racist.
[29:11.360 --> 29:12.640]  What's that have to do with racism?
[29:12.640 --> 29:13.800]  This is a ripoff.
[29:13.800 --> 29:14.800]  Shut up, racist.
[29:14.800 --> 29:17.040]  And then that's all you've got.
[29:17.040 --> 29:19.560]  Conspiracy theorist, racist, and fake news.
[29:19.560 --> 29:20.560]  That's it.
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.360]  Racist conspiracy theorist, fake news, throwing a homophobe, and you're like, I don't, what?
[29:26.360 --> 29:27.360]  I'm a libertine.
[29:27.360 --> 29:28.360]  Everybody knows that.
[29:28.360 --> 29:31.760]  Well, you just stop it.
[29:31.760 --> 29:32.760]  Absolutely incredible.
[29:32.760 --> 29:34.400]  So when we come back, we've got a bunch of clips.
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.960]  We're going to get into all of this because their whole fake news initiative has blown
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.560]  up in their face spectacularly, spectacularly.
[29:43.560 --> 29:48.680]  They're already reversing this blacklist that they're sending around saying, man, info wars.
[29:48.680 --> 29:49.800]  We'll be back.
[29:49.800 --> 29:51.080]  We're on the march.
[29:51.080 --> 29:53.520]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.520 --> 30:01.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.240 --> 30:05.280]  Donald Trump is moving fast to build his new administration, making many key appointments
[30:05.280 --> 30:06.640]  thus far.
[30:06.640 --> 30:09.760]  President-elect Trump has named the following appointments.
[30:09.760 --> 30:12.840]  Senator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, Attorney General.
[30:12.840 --> 30:16.800]  Representative from Kansas, Mike Pompeo, head of CIA.
[30:16.800 --> 30:21.280]  Former military intelligence chief, Michael Flynn, national security advisor.
[30:21.280 --> 30:24.600]  Media executive, Stephen Bannon, chief strategist.
[30:24.600 --> 30:28.960]  Chairman Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff.
[30:28.960 --> 30:33.120]  Trump has also created a short list of possible appointees for other key spots, including
[30:33.120 --> 30:35.200]  a new Supreme Court justice.
[30:35.200 --> 30:39.920]  Rumors are swirling that there may be a position for his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway,
[30:39.920 --> 30:44.480]  former mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, and even detractor, Mitt Romney is being tossed
[30:44.480 --> 30:49.600]  around as a possible secretary of state, while former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, has said
[30:49.600 --> 30:52.320]  he will not be in a Trump administration.
[30:52.320 --> 30:53.400]  I'm Owen Troyer.

[32:05.520 --> 32:06.520]  produce.
[32:06.520 --> 32:09.800]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[32:09.800 --> 32:13.240]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[32:13.240 --> 32:15.440]  it's very, very important.
[32:15.440 --> 32:22.120]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[32:22.120 --> 32:24.360]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:24.360 --> 32:26.440]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[32:26.440 --> 32:30.760]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:30.760 --> 32:33.640]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[32:33.640 --> 32:35.320]  It works like an antioxidant.
[32:35.320 --> 32:38.200]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[32:38.200 --> 32:41.400]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.

[33:20.360 --> 33:27.840]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[33:27.840 --> 33:32.720]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns,
[33:32.720 --> 33:42.760]  Hugo Chavez took the guns, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[33:42.760 --> 33:47.040]  Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[33:47.040 --> 33:48.040]  They did.
[33:48.040 --> 34:05.200]  Oaths have been given, they've been taken, the answer to 1982 is 1776, you're listening
[34:05.200 --> 34:07.520]  to the Alex Jones show.
[34:07.520 --> 34:13.320]  Oaths, oaths of oath, the true power is the commitment of the will.
[34:13.320 --> 34:28.680]  Wall Street Journal, China presses tech firms to police the internet.
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.760]  That's a fake headline, it's a real story but a fake headline.
[34:33.760 --> 34:40.440]  China is impressing the Communist Party dirtbags, the biggest mass murderers in all of history.
[34:40.440 --> 34:45.360]  Over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus under Mao Zedong alone, who have got their
[34:45.360 --> 34:53.880]  people in total wicked bondage, involved in political and cultural Congress with our
[34:53.880 --> 34:58.960]  elite, are setting up a planetary system and there they are, telling us what to do with
[34:58.960 --> 35:00.800]  Hollywood, telling us what to do with the internet.
[35:00.800 --> 35:03.800]  You think they like the fact they can't block this show, it's very hard for them to block
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.600]  this transmission, going into China, you think they like that?
[35:08.600 --> 35:13.120]  You see mainstream media, we see the Democrats saying Zuckerberg, you better censor the web
[35:13.120 --> 35:15.120]  more.
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.360]  Zuckerberg came out this week and said, it's not that easy, it isn't just a fake news
[35:18.360 --> 35:24.920]  issue and you know it, because Peter Thiel owns part of Facebook and isn't letting him
[35:24.920 --> 35:25.920]  do it.
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.760]  I say, Peter Thiel, more and more I research him, I know he's gone to Bilderberg, I know
[35:31.760 --> 35:36.760]  it's a secret meeting, it's global, it's bad, but what matters is what people do in the
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.120]  real world and if he's opposing tyranny, more and more that's a good thing and helping
[35:41.120 --> 35:42.120]  Trump get into office.
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.200]  And so the whole Bilderberg group has been against Trump, but just a few people on the
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.600]  inside that aren't bad can turn this whole tide, but look at this, China presses tech
[35:52.600 --> 35:58.560]  firms to police the internet, third annual world internet conference aimed at proselytizing
[35:58.560 --> 36:05.000]  China's view to a global audience, that's right, the big world internet conference
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.440]  is basically run by China, China is making its move, when we say China, we mean the evil
[36:11.440 --> 36:16.480]  folks that run it, so we have the Chinese telling us what to do, we've got the EU telling
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.200]  us what to do, saying globalisms in crisis, but imagine being a New York Times writer
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.320]  and you get to sit there and write articles like Gibbs did his press secretary saying
[36:27.320 --> 36:31.520]  the drone program doesn't exist years after it's public and been on the news a thousand
[36:31.520 --> 36:39.520]  times a thousand, globalism, a far right conspiracy theory buoyed by Trump and we claim there's
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.280]  multinational corporations and multinational agreements that we're not part of and we claim
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.240]  it's transferring power, it's totally insane.
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.280]  Meanwhile we're not letting the EU go, German Finance Minister Warren's Britain could still
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.120]  be paying into Brussels coffers in 2030.
[36:55.120 --> 37:03.200]  The rise of populism tops anxiety list at Frankfurt banking meeting, the anxiety, globalist
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.480]  plot survival, I wish I could come up with terms like that, because that's what's happening,
[37:08.480 --> 37:13.800]  globalist are plotting their very survival, as they said in every globalist publication,
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.360]  our world government is in crisis, our planetary plan we've been doing for 60 years is going
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.400]  to fall if Donald Trump gets elected, after Brexit and Russia pulling out, this is a beautiful
[37:23.400 --> 37:25.400]  thing.
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.600]  The Russian agent Trump just got forward to stay in the US, the Russian agent is trying
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.800]  to get an apple and they're saying they're going to do it probably back to the United
[37:33.800 --> 37:41.080]  States it's factories, oh the iPhone will go up $5, watch the economy, big deal.
[37:41.080 --> 37:45.520]  Isn't that just amazing, oh my gosh the Russian agent, boy I would need more of these Russian
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.080]  agents then don't I, the Russian agent just is moving to have the Attorney General be
[37:50.080 --> 37:56.600]  Senator Jeff Sessions, the total patriot, oh my gosh those dirty Ruskies again, truth
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.360]  is there was no Ruskies involved with Trump, now everybody sees how ridiculous that whole
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.360]  thing was.
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.160]  Now it's the globalist shutting off our power, shutting off our coal plants, shutting off
[38:06.160 --> 38:09.880]  our factories, shutting off our steel mills, buy, design and Trump's just going to flip
[38:09.880 --> 38:15.440]  the switches, he's 62 days from office and already Apple's coming back, Ford's announces
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.400]  definitely staying, new factories are being announced all over the place, power plants
[38:20.400 --> 38:23.800]  are now being told they can be turned back on, they're totally clean, oh they can now
[38:23.800 --> 38:28.480]  compete, oh sorry General Electric, you thought you'd double and triple prices and you did,
[38:28.480 --> 38:38.280]  your little honeymoon, screwing everybody over is bye bye.
[38:38.280 --> 38:43.880]  And then wait till people's power bill goes down, the evil city of Austin, people that
[38:43.880 --> 38:47.520]  run it, there's not real elections here, this place is not a real elections in decades,
[38:47.520 --> 38:50.560]  I've seen it certified at the state board level, back in Plains High File, they admitted
[38:50.560 --> 38:53.760]  it but still certified it.
[38:53.760 --> 39:01.280]  The city owned four power plants, one was old, took a shut it down, three were new and
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.120]  they shut them all down, didn't even sell them, they said no we own them, we want to
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.760]  shut them down, one part is left, it's the giant Fayetteville plant, 50 something miles
[39:09.760 --> 39:14.700]  from Austin, it didn't shut off, one third of it's still on but it supplies something
[39:14.700 --> 39:20.440]  like 10% of Houston's power, Austin owned the other plants there and just shut them
[39:20.440 --> 39:27.080]  off, they're just shut off, gigantic, clean, modern, multi-billion dollar power plant,
[39:27.080 --> 39:33.200]  that's military sabotage, that's globalism, hurting you and your family and the evil racist
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.440]  Donald Trump wants to turn it back on and give you cheap electricity, oh what a horrible
[39:37.440 --> 39:45.480]  man, oh my gosh and you see all these poor, disheveled, hopeless people, they can be black,
[39:45.480 --> 39:51.520]  they can be Hispanic white, they all look stupid and panic and scared and just running
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.080]  around like the government's their mommy and they're in a jail cell, hoping a little window
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.680]  opens and a little plate of food comes in.
[40:00.680 --> 40:03.400]  In Venezuela, I remember hearing about this from a Venezuelan fellow who worked here
[40:03.400 --> 40:08.800]  in IT and then I later saw it in the news, they make you pray to Hugo Chavez for your
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.560]  school lunch in the morning, they have you pray to Christ and no food comes, then you
[40:13.560 --> 40:22.320]  pray to Chavez and milk and cereal comes, talk about desperate, talk about sad, talk
[40:22.320 --> 40:28.720]  about unbelievably horrible, this is what we're entering into and America has been given
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.520]  a reprieve, all I care about is delivery, I don't care who he appoints or what he does,
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.120]  I've said that, there's been some indicators I don't like, some things I do like, look
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.480]  at Sessions, look at Steven Manin, this is beautiful.
[40:41.480 --> 40:46.720]  Alright, I need to start getting into the news here, just briefly let me get into some
[40:46.720 --> 40:53.760]  of the most important and exciting news and information first, the story's up on infowars.com,
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.200]  it's got some very powerful videos that Paul Watson cut breaking down the hypocrisy and
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.160]  the lies, the mainstream media fake news narrative is already beginning to collapse,
[41:04.160 --> 41:12.040]  Quantcast restores infowars, blacklist of fake news websites removed from Quantcast,
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.480]  they had accepted the Google Chrome that had loaded in a liberal social justice warrior
[41:17.480 --> 41:23.040]  female professor who just, she's judge, jury, executioner, she just decides what's fake,
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.560]  now she's God, like the Snopes lady, she has a cat, she lives in an apartment, that's
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.080]  fine, she is God, she arbitrates, Obamacare is free, of course it isn't, there is no
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.240]  IRS mandate, of course there is, there is no death panel, of course there is, but listen
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.640]  Snopes said it isn't there, okay, there you go, and this lady said so, so yes ma'am, yes
[41:41.640 --> 41:47.760]  ma'am, boy we're so fake, oh we said Donald Trump and the polls were fake, of course we
[41:47.760 --> 41:53.120]  just think that I had the inside intel, that's why Trump's like it's rigged, it's rigged,
[41:53.120 --> 41:55.840]  they didn't want to tell people we're way ahead in the internal polls, because they
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.320]  would sound like a sore loser, but they knew, from the media, from the New York Times, the
[42:01.320 --> 42:06.720]  Osmerga station, Jones keeps claiming that, you know, the internal polls show he's really
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.920]  way ahead, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[42:10.920 --> 42:16.640]  who was right, that's right, see because we tell the truth here, that's what we do, we
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.360]  don't sit around out to get people all day like you people.
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.560]  So the mainstream media fake news narrative was already beginning to collapse after the
[42:25.560 --> 42:29.560]  author of a blacklist of fake news websites removed the list, because you can get sued
[42:29.560 --> 42:37.400]  for that sweetheart, and Quantcast, ReinstatedInfoWars.com to its ranking as the 126, that's not
[42:37.400 --> 42:43.320]  news site folks, that's site period in the world, most traffic website in the world,
[42:43.320 --> 42:50.320]  I'm just relish in the fact that we are kicking their butt up one side and down the other,
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.720]  whoo, I mean, when it comes to news, I think only the Mighty Drudge Report, let's let's
[42:55.720 --> 43:01.080]  pull it up on Quantcast, like 98 or something, only Drudge is bigger, we are slaughtering
[43:01.080 --> 43:08.600]  them, Drudge is 102, it fluctuates back and forth, just slaughtering them, by the way,
[43:08.600 --> 43:11.640]  the big news websites all have these weird little bots and stuff that republish their
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.760]  stuff and play games and manipulate, I don't know, we don't have any of that on, we just
[43:15.760 --> 43:23.440]  bare knuckles annihilate them, and again, Infowars is 20 something percent depending
[43:23.440 --> 43:33.160]  on the day of our reach, we have big algorithm systems in there, computer models, Google,
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.320]  you name it, war game at all, and when we really use that stuff we just kind of go look
[43:37.320 --> 43:42.720]  at them, God, look at that, like Death Star level firepower is blowing the enemy to pieces
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.840]  and the enemy just hops up and down and goes, we're wearing fancy suits and we're at CNN,
[43:47.840 --> 43:51.680]  and then no one listens to them and they're just caught fake news, fake reporters, fake
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.360]  everything, dispewing this info, giving all the questions Hillary before hand, there's
[43:56.360 --> 44:05.800]  all sorts of evil activity, just think about that, the mainstream media is fake news, yesterday
[44:05.800 --> 44:10.720]  we reported how Quantcast had apparently delisted Infowars.com, at the same time that
[44:10.720 --> 44:14.760]  the mainstream media was circulating a list of fake news websites that included big conservative
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.400]  news outlets such as Infowars and Breitbart, Infowars has also been reinstated as Quantcast's
[44:19.400 --> 44:29.040]  list of top websites and has skyrocketed to 126 on the list, now before I go any further
[44:29.040 --> 44:37.080]  I want to just make a point here, normally news organization this big would bring in
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.040]  billions of dollars, I'm good at reaching people, thank God, and could you spread the
[44:41.040 --> 44:46.200]  word, but I'm not good at making money, and we need to bring in a ton of money, I have
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.240]  the responsibility to hire four or five more reporters, camera people, editors, and other
[44:51.240 --> 44:56.400]  things we need, we are on a shoestring budget comparatively, if I was in New York or someplace
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.920]  I could have 15, 20 employees, not 60, but when I say employees that's like janitorial
[45:00.920 --> 45:06.560]  stuff, accounting, customer service, our own warehouse for shipping, I mean we talk about
[45:06.560 --> 45:11.720]  news folks, it's like 25 people total, we need 30, 40, 50 people, I mean we've got the
[45:11.720 --> 45:17.160]  staff of a small town newspaper, and we are changing the world, but I don't have the big
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.360]  corporate sponsors, I sell products, that's how we fund ourselves, and I have this penchant
[45:21.360 --> 45:27.240]  for trying to give people good deals, that's just how I am, $9.95 for the Trump as my president
[45:27.240 --> 45:31.120]  shirt that includes shipping, we don't make any money on that, but it's so effective people
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.360]  buy five times more if I sell it at cost, I just want to see Trump as my president everywhere,
[45:35.360 --> 45:41.640]  so see to get the message out, I sabotage our overall capitalization, so I'm just saying
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.640]  there's nowhere you can spend money that will have a bigger effect than infowars.com, or
[45:46.640 --> 45:51.520]  clicking on the ads on drudgeport.com, there is nowhere, so when you get brainforcer, you
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.680]  get, look how good our info is, look how effective and cutting edge, try the nutraceuticals,
[45:55.680 --> 46:01.360]  try the supplements, we've got the very best heirloom non-GMO seed varieties with 15, 14
[46:01.360 --> 46:05.040]  different companies, at the lowest prices you're going to find out there, we've got
[46:05.040 --> 46:11.640]  a Made in America apparel, infowarsstore.com, or call toll 3-888-2533-139, and I want to
[46:11.640 --> 46:18.120]  thank you for what you've done so far, but it's time for most of the people, I mean
[46:18.120 --> 46:22.240]  we know, because again it's all algorithms, that's how the internet works, that maybe
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.640]  4% of the folks that come through ever buy anything, if 10% bought something we could
[46:26.640 --> 46:33.280]  double in size, triple in size, and I am committed to go all the way, we could do so much more
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.200]  if we have a Washington bureau that's permanent and are in New York, where I have folks in
[46:38.200 --> 46:42.280]  London, I'd like to expand and actually set an office up in London and have Paul launch
[46:42.280 --> 46:49.120]  a whole TV operation there, still a small operation, but very effective, I don't want
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.320]  to grow, but it's our responsibility, I'm not going to sit here and have half measures
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.600]  with the enemy, I'm not risking my life to play games, I want to press the issue and
[46:58.600 --> 47:03.320]  run them to ground and then give them no quarter politically and straight them into oblivion,
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.520]  and we can do that if we keep our eye on the prize and have the eye of the tiger and our
[47:08.520 --> 47:15.800]  savage in this fight, now we have brain force plus in now with 20% more capsules and it's
[47:15.800 --> 47:23.080]  got even stronger formula, it's been tweaked, brain force plus an amazing new tropic, now

[48:17.760 --> 48:27.400]  yet so just go to infowarsteam.com, now expanding on that, we have PrismPlanet.tv that has the
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.520]  nightly news for subscribers, I want to thank all those old subscribers, 20 people can use
[48:31.520 --> 48:37.880]  each membership there, also we have the new app that's 4.95 a month that we are now uploading
[48:37.880 --> 48:43.040]  special exclusive behind the scenes videos, live videos, special documentaries, you name
[48:43.040 --> 48:47.200]  it, there's now over 100 pieces of new original content there but the real reason to have
[48:47.200 --> 48:53.120]  it is that there are discounts of up to 50%, the biggest sales we have are exclusive to
[48:53.120 --> 48:57.560]  members of the app, there's a free version, infowars.com, that has the daytime video feed,
[48:57.560 --> 49:03.240]  audio feed, podcast, news, articles, you name it, but the paid one has the live feed,
[49:03.240 --> 49:09.400]  the archives, the discounts and news alerts that we send to you that we're about to start,
[49:09.400 --> 49:15.960]  we're still tweaking a few things but I'd say it's running about 98%, so infowars.com,
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.040]  also it's key if they start censoring more, you never know what they could do, it's set
[49:19.040 --> 49:23.320]  off at Nuke, Lord knows what and infowars will be gone overnight, only a fraction of the
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.920]  folks that are listeners have ever gone to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and
[49:27.920 --> 49:32.120]  signed up for our free email newsletter that has exclusive videos, articles, promo codes,
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.240]  you name it and I know everybody's sick of email, I'm sick of it too but with infowars
[49:37.240 --> 49:43.080]  and our relationship it's important that we have your email so infowars.com forward slash
[49:43.080 --> 49:48.320]  newsletter, go there today and it is so essential that you then take our emails and forward
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.120]  them to folks because this is how we get TNTell out and talking to all the experts, it's essential
[49:53.120 --> 49:56.720]  that this is something I never did, I mean back in the age of email being top, we'd
[49:56.720 --> 49:59.680]  have tens of millions of folks signed up if I'd just done it, only started the last few
[49:59.680 --> 50:02.880]  years promoting it and hundreds of thousands of people have come and signed up but it's
[50:02.880 --> 50:08.960]  just a fraction, only 400,000 people or whatever have downloaded the free app, I mean you know,
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.880]  we're 126 on the internet just on our website, we've had 5 billion views conservatively on
[50:13.880 --> 50:19.240]  YouTube and all we can get is 400,000 people to download the free app, I mean I'm not bitching
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.400]  but Drudge is right, we have to have our own platform separate from them that aren't as
[50:23.400 --> 50:28.000]  easy to censor, I mean you know, they censor us, we point it out, you point it out, they
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.440]  back off but they keep coming back which is a tactic so it's an internal battle, bottom

[55:06.200 --> 55:11.080]  we're starting to turn the tide, the fight's just begun, we've got to intensify our operations
[55:11.080 --> 55:17.520]  obviously, by the way, Daria, one of the producers was pointing out, yeah you're not bashing
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.960]  China enough, they loaded 70 million Americans phones with spyware and stuff to basically
[55:22.960 --> 55:28.880]  steal your bank account information and rob you, I mean folks, our military hardware that
[55:28.880 --> 55:34.240]  came out 10 years ago, they're doing that, are longer, China is literally all over us,
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.400]  every movie I go see about science fiction or technology, China runs everything as our
[55:38.400 --> 55:45.800]  boss, every movie, every movie, you'll notice it, I mentioned it five years ago, now it's
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.760]  every movie, and now they announced China's taking over, that means communist Chinese,
[55:50.760 --> 55:56.760]  they're in the news saying censor the internet in America, how about you go to hell, okay?
[55:56.760 --> 56:04.200]  I had China, Paul didn't want me to get into it, but Paul had China basically come out
[56:04.200 --> 56:12.840]  a mess with him, in London, three years ago, oh yeah, folks, we're not in Kansas anymore,
[56:12.840 --> 56:19.360]  we're talking James Bond movie stuff, so understand, folks, believe me, there's a lot more going
[56:19.360 --> 56:24.680]  on you don't know about, this country is under full scale attack, the people we've got in
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.040]  aren't perfect, but they are not out to get the nation, do you understand, people better
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.720]  decide which side they're on right now, the Russians aren't doing anything, they're seen
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.080]  as destabilized, the globalists are trying to bring them down, just like they're bringing
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.400]  us down, I'ma say it very slowly, the globalists are allied with China, against the United
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.040]  States and Russia, the EU is meant to destroy Europe and suck it down, it wants to destroy
[56:45.040 --> 56:51.240]  the third world, the globalists are against humanity, it's a scientific system that deindustrializes
[56:51.240 --> 56:56.560]  you, I'll use the oblivion analogy, it's like a big alien spaceship that lands and sucks
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.120]  up your oceans, kills your planet and leaves, okay, it's cold blooded, it's scientific,
[57:02.120 --> 57:08.040]  it's psychopathic, it's the enemy, you better understand the real system in the world, and
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.120]  I know you know that, I haven't gotten to it yet, I'll cover it in the next five minutes,
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.720]  I don't want to bash Muslims, I don't want to bash the communist Chinese, but they're
[57:16.720 --> 57:20.720]  horrible, they're out of control folks, it's like saying I don't want to bash Germans in
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.160]  World War II, but they had a bad leadership and a bad culture at that time, I'm gonna
[57:25.160 --> 57:33.920]  say the Nazis were bad, ladies and gentlemen, most of these Muslim countries, women are
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.680]  kept as basically property, and then the left has this fetish about Islam all day, British
[57:39.680 --> 57:46.000]  woman gang raped in Dubai says I'm petrified out here alone after she's arrested for extramarital
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.160]  sex, she goes and complains she's raped, and they go sweetheart, there ain't no such thing,
[57:50.160 --> 57:57.600]  you're not, a man can do whatever he wants with you, so there's another one, shock video,
[57:57.600 --> 58:03.160]  police force 80 year old Italian hotel owner to house African migrants, this is just commandeering,
[58:03.160 --> 58:06.640]  just this little bitty end with this little old man, and the police show up and say you're

[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:59.600]  com James congratulations my friend hey Alex thank you so much and just by way of introduction
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:08.080]  I've had a chest cold the last few days after a week of adrenaline and unbelievable amazing
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:13.160]  highs and amazing lows I'm recovering here physically so I apologize I'm not a hundred
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:19.200]  percent but I'm so great to be with you well absolutely my friend I know I've I was exhausted
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:23.360]  for three or four days as well kind of like dizzy actually but I'm now back to normal
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:29.240]  hopefully you get back soon what do you want to start well I think I think that one of
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:33.680]  the things that Roger Stone and I discussed last time I was with you was the was the tipping
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:39.560]  point that we thought that we had not reached as a country I think we are now beyond the
[1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:46.560]  tipping point where social media and the power of independent media is is greater it is greater
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:51.680]  than than the mainstream media we have reached that tipping point we are at a point where
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:57.240]  the the the power of the media is now not what it once was when I was at that election
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:02.920]  night Hilton hotel and I saw the big lights and the hundreds of journalists I could see
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:08.480]  them physically sobbing I could see them crying because they had now realized that they had
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:15.160]  lost their power and and it was a very moving moment for me because we have spent I've spent
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:20.520]  the last eight years of my life fighting these people tooth and nail persevering over their
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.400]  firewall breaking news on YouTube even while these companies like YouTube and Facebook
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:31.600]  and Twitter try to shut us down and and to reach that climax where now we are now more
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:38.200]  powerful than they are it was a very touching moment for me and and it showed that the whole
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:44.000]  game is now changed we are living in a new world where we are now more powerful than
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.760]  they are and that's just that's just the bottom line and Trump has to realize that and we
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:52.400]  did this I'm not just saying it's true from the grassroots because we really believed
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:56.760]  in America in free market in the Second Amendment they were trying to dominate us and studying
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:03.400]  history and studying past wars and this is a new type of war an information war predominantly
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:06.880]  you never know when an evil empire is about to break up you never know when it's about
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:11.960]  to fall it's going to tell you to the minute you know that the evil king kills over that
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:18.320]  it's victorious it's all powerful it's unstoppable and this system was so delusional they were
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:23.320]  believing their own BS I mean listen when info wars.com which is most people are obsessed
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:28.240]  with their site it's a small part of our overall reach 23% according to the Google algorithm
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:36.480]  on a daily basis it's 19% 25% but average 23% a year and when we're numbered 124 on the
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:43.600]  web folks we did we have reached 5 million people on YouTube alone and this just shows
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:48.160]  what info wars is doing and we're not even getting started imagine how much that freaks
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:50.360]  them out James O'Keefe.
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:57.040]  Yeah I mean we were when we were on I was on I think Tommy Lorenz Facebook live stream
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:02.920]  and and they were like 1.7 million people watching it and CNN's Brian Stelter this is a reliable
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:07.720]  sources and the show is called reliable sources he tweets at me and he goes you know James
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:14.560]  so we we got 1.2 million viewers on CNN and I said Brian we got 20 million views on our
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:20.280]  YouTube channel in the last week we had 100 million Twitter impressions you know you nobody
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:26.920]  watches CNN they are delusional they're losing the bottom line is Alex is they realize they
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:32.600]  are losing their power that's it they're they're losing their control over the voter and they're
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:36.440]  losing their power over the people and they panic and they get emotional and when they
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:41.240]  get emotional they make mistakes and then when they make mistakes they lose their credibility
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:46.480]  and the audience that is the American people leave them and they go to organizations like
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:51.080]  info wars organizations like project veritas and they go to where the action is the exciting
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:57.320]  and by the way there's only six or seven networks and systems their audience is so tiny now
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.920]  even Fox is nothing compared to the independent media but they're still so delusional and
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:04.540]  nothing it's Fox but they just don't know it yet we're not bragging we're just explaining
[1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:09.880]  folks the new media landscape for everybody there are high school people and college kids
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:14.240]  that are getting 100 million views a month there are hundreds of prominent people that
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:19.840]  have just suddenly popped up that are huge I'm excited to see that I mean what's scary
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.640]  to the establishment is there's we're not just getting the regular news audience the
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:30.080]  Liberty movement has expanded to where this is almost like a blood sport or a new form
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:34.560]  of entertainment we're making politics fun again and I think that's where they lost
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:41.600]  the paradigm is the the memes and all of is what I'm getting at yeah well when we were
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:47.880]  Alex before after I spoke to you last time on election day we were in Philadelphia exposing
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  voter fraud and it was easy to expose I mean we released videos on election day in Philadelphia
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:57.920]  where we would go to the poll site and you know with a hidden camera we'd go up to the
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:02.920]  supervisor the judge and they told us who to vote for that's a crime you can't do that
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:06.840]  they were saying vote for Hillary I mean these are election judges these are supposed to
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:13.240]  be making sure that these elections are conducted fairly and without bias and as I was in my
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:18.720]  car driving around Philadelphia with my team going frankly some of us were risking our
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:22.640]  safety to do this because these were in neighborhoods where people were intimidating people they
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:28.040]  wouldn't let you in as a journalist we were going around I was tweeting live streaming
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:33.580]  that I was doing this I was monitoring fraud and these girls were attacking I mean viciously
[1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:39.920]  attacking us calling us racist and and and I mean every one of them and it dawned upon
[1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:44.400]  me when I was in my car driving around North Philadelphia there getting attacked I realized
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:50.400]  you know what these guys are so desperate they are so they are they're such losers they're
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:55.360]  stuck in their cubicles wherever they are in their skyscrapers attacking citizen journalists
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:00.960]  for doing the jobs themselves it dawned upon me that this is now a turning point that I'm
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:07.360]  out where we are out there collectively doing their jobs for them while they condemn us
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:11.720]  and and it's that realization it's that it's it's I don't know what else to put it's a
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:18.240]  tipping point it's a shift in the power and perception of media and I totally agree James
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.320]  O'Keefe here's the next question then how do they strike back well we've seen them with
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:28.080]  this delisting with Google Chrome and Quantcast but one day after they did it they re-listed
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:33.680]  info wars and Breitbart and others because everybody looked at it and said some professor
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:38.480]  just declare she's God and says what's real and what isn't after this entire mainstream
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:44.400]  media got caught faking polls faking election results for giving the questions to Hillary
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:49.280]  fake interviews I mean I've looked for names for the mainstream media all these years they
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:55.040]  finally gave it to us they're the fake media by them calling us that I finally realized
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:00.160]  that's really the their name don't you think I think you have to yeah yeah that's exactly
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:05.120]  right I'm looking at the same thing that that fake list of fake news sites were where they
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:10.160]  where we made a list of fake oh you were on there too absolutely yeah yeah so I mean listen
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:16.000]  this is what I would say to that judge a man by his work product not by the name you used to describe
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.440]  him they're obsessed with titles and and and and what do you call you an activist or a criminal
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:29.520]  or a fake or a hoaxer judge someone by what they do judge Veritas our organization by what we expose
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:36.880]  you guys are so clean and so good and so hard-working and so dedicated and so classical journalism
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:42.080]  and and and then they go oh he's a he's a convicted criminal not saying he went to federal building
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:47.680]  a public building to show that their phones weren't broken and I mean oh my god oh my gosh I mean
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:52.320]  yeah yeah Bob Primer was actually a convicted felon that that's that's even Anderson Cooper
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:56.720]  on CNN struggled with attacking me for being a criminal because they're trying to defend actual
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.600]  convicted felons that were exposing but this is what this is the bottom line your question was
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:07.280]  where do we go from here and my answer is you do the job for them you do their work you do the
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:12.160]  investigative reporting you expose the corrupt administrative agencies by the way our government
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:16.960]  mostly consists of administrative agencies who are not even accountable to the executive branch
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:21.680]  there's the permanent sort of infrastructure that exists of our federal government you do the job
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:28.000]  you you report the the abuses of power you expose the corruption you these protests that are happening
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:34.880]  for the inauguration day Veritas has people in investigating and embedded in those you expose
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:41.520]  what's actually happening and people that is the american people will naturally go to where the actual
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:46.720]  journalists exactly so so it's it's a total tipping point except for the minority of people
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:52.880]  who are white black hispanic you name it that really are anti-white racist butthurt weirdos
[1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:59.200]  like de Blasio with his crew uh you know de Blasio there in new york the mayor mckelthillan
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:04.880]  has an article spokesman says sign was meant to protest white supremacy it says f whiteness
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:14.400]  black lives matter with a bunch of weirdo straight laced chicken-necked uh neurotic white liberals
[1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:21.200]  running around bashing white people when the average white person i know is just a you know
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:26.400]  regular schmo like anybody else i mean it is what is this upset it's it's really these are sickening
[1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:33.520]  people these are racist and and i mean and and i'm so tired of them well we we did a story uh on
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:38.480]  election day day before election day we went into in mere de Blasio's district new york city
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:43.840]  we went into the poll location of huma abedin and we got offered her ballot they handed us
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:49.280]  huma abedin's about we had full burqa on because the elections commissioner we did another video
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:53.600]  where the elections commissioner was saying that anybody can vote without an id there's
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:59.520]  so much fraud we bust people around so mere de Blasio fired this is yesterday fired this
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:04.320]  elections commissioner we caught on tape for telling the truth i think he should have been
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:09.360]  given a medal he was being honest he was he was forthcoming about the fraud he was describing
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:13.760]  that they go to places like certain neighborhoods like china town and they quote bust people around
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:19.520]  to vote they put them in a bus and they go from poll site to poll site so mere de Blasio fired the
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:26.880]  elections commissioner for revealing the fraud uh this is how corrupt mere de Blasio is but listen
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:33.120]  people like i i can't say it enough just citizens have to do their job places like reddit were crowd
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:38.000]  sourcing investigative journalism out during the last few weeks they were looking through fec
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:42.800]  disbursement forms they were giving that to us and while these journalists in their ivory towers
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:47.520]  were condemning us there but there's that picture right now de Blasio demands resignation of elections
[1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:51.600]  official who actually told the truth and said it's wrong there's fraud and he wants to stop it
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:58.160]  and then he gets how about de Blasio resigns so so so let's expand on this briefly i forgot that
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:02.560]  it's beautiful how reddit and all these other big sites are crowd sourcing the wiki leaks
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:08.320]  crowd sourcing election research this is humid this is this is the people making it a game
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:13.600]  to fight corruption that's what they've always been afraid of it's fun it's an animating contest
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:19.920]  that jefferson talked about yeah and and one of the most enlightening moments of my of the last
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:26.560]  45 days when i was breaking these stories and date and the washington post tweeted at me and said
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:31.760]  why don't you actually show me a video of obama meeting with these people show me the video and
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:37.680]  i tweeted back i said hey dave shouldn't that be your job isn't that your job at the washington
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:42.960]  post but they're they're totally reactive they there you couldn't even break a woodward and
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:50.720]  bernstein style story they're a bunch of white shoe arrogant harvard snobs they push classism
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:56.480]  and racism because that's who they are we're just gutter brawling blue collar patriots we're
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:03.120]  going to kick their ass every time yes and they're reactive and they are reactive to what we do
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:08.400]  that's the beautiful part they're they're now talking about what we are talking about we set
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:13.360]  the narrative now yes they criticize us they call us names but they can name call all they want
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:18.160]  judge a man by his work judge oh don't you know how they call us fake news and they call us alt
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:23.440]  right exactly we're not going by their labels anymore well they said is steve bannon they said
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:27.920]  they called him a white supremacist i mean i know steve bannon i've worked for steve bannon he's not
[1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:34.240]  a white supremacist he's a he's a hard-working very he's a good businessman every everyone at
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:39.040]  Breitbart news is they're decent people they have their views but you know what i say i say if the
[1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:44.960]  media wants to hashtag stop bannon they should endorse him because at this point the people are
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:49.360]  going to do the exact opposite of whatever the media tells them to do bannon is a trailblazer
[1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:54.720]  is a trailblazer and took right mark in the right direction and helped win the selection
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:59.040]  again america is about betting on the people that are trailblazers who do the right thing
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:05.120]  and win these are winners we're talking about absolutely and i think the media people are
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:09.280]  now going to do the exact opposite of what the media tells them to do they've they're the the
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:15.600]  vaulted as britain said that the vaulted power of the media is not what it once was their entire
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:20.960]  business model is based on credibility and when they and relevance and then we when they become
[1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:27.040]  irrelevant when people don't trust them anymore we're living in a new world it really is historical
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:34.000]  i can't alex i can't emphasize just how big how game changing how transformative the last couple
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  weeks are and we are the tip of the spear buddy we are we are it i mean this is we are at the at
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:46.640]  the front lines of of of democracy of information and we're on the front lines of the rebirth of
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:52.000]  our constitutional republic and the new renaissance my friend and when we get when we get thousands
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:58.320]  of people every single day and that is true uh we today we got hundreds of of tips and people
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:04.640]  say come to my my school board come to my come to my town council come to my state office and
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:08.800]  expose this and the secret is you're going to expose a lot of it but they're all copying
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:12.560]  veritas in your book that lays out how to do it and how to do it legally and lawfully as a
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.360]  investigative journalist they're now all starting their own little town watches and again the return
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:24.320]  of america's here it is horrifying them yes it is it is horrifying them but we have a responsibility
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:28.640]  to build a institution you're right people are going to do it on their own and that's important
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:33.120]  we're going to as long as it's legal i'm saying they should go to you as well but i'm just saying
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:38.320]  don't wait for orders from headquarters folks just do it yeah just go out and like reddit the reddit
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.720]  community is a great example these are people who crowd sourced it out they went they found dulema
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:47.520]  rodriguez was the protester who shut down the highway in arizona during that video series people
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:52.480]  found little video clips of her and they said that's her that's dulema she was paid by illy clinton
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:58.800]  so people are doing it themselves and it is a beautiful thing to watch that the normal people
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:05.680]  doing the job of nbc news while nbc news puts insurmountable obstacles in their path it is very
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.440]  is moving to watch wow the fact that this is happening james i've been interviewing you
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:14.000]  probably eight nine ten years whatever it is and i tell you you were on fire i mean even though you
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.120]  you're under the weather i've never heard you so excited is there a feeling not of completion
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:25.280]  but of satisfaction that wow we are on the right side of history there is a god we've had this great
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:30.000]  victory we've got more work to do but there is a light at the end of the tunnel sometimes the good
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:37.200]  guys win yeah i don't know if you know i'm a i'm a i'm i myself i'm catholic so i'm a i'm a man of
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:45.440]  god i i believe that there is um it's satisfying it's it's redemption being there that night seeing
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:52.400]  this happen i think we're given another chance as a country to um you know benjamin franklin said
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:57.280]  it's a republic if you can keep it you can feel the providence can't you in the air yeah i can
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:02.160]  feel i can feel the province because there are too many this investigation took us a year to do
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:07.200]  too many things could have gone wrong it was so risky it was so dangerous i mean we were invited
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.080]  to the white house we could not go it's the equivalent to use a cheesy analogy of like you
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:17.200]  did five death star runs and every time you blew it up i mean it was just all was incredible
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.360]  yes and i think so i think we've been given another chance this is
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:28.560]  this we we have an opportunity here to reverse course and i think that i think the solutions
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:31.760]  are beyond the legislative process i think it's going to require normal people doing
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:36.080]  extraordinary things and to see that the hundreds of thousands of people in this country take it
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:41.360]  upon themselves to do the job of the media that to me shows us that there is much hope for the
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:46.560]  future so it's redemption sure it's satisfaction and it's hope and it's the fact that the battle's
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:50.160]  not won even though we're starting to turn the tide you know i forget who said that we can look it up
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:56.800]  but they say that it is it is it is great times it is it is tumultuous times it is
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.680]  it is extraordinary times that make extraordinary men and women and i think that's what we've seen
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:09.760]  here absolutely in closing trump ford coming back apple saying they're gonna look at coming back
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:14.160]  all i mean it's just it's it's too it's crazy i'm really worried they're gonna try to kill him
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:22.080]  well i mean i if if there's ever a plot to do anything like that my hope is that our cameras
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.720]  would be would be infiltrating conversations that effect and hell they're all over the news
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.400]  saying killing uh why aren't these people being arrested saying kill trump i'm gonna kill trump
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:36.320]  you know they what they're on twitter saying they want to kill both you me and trump and and jack
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:41.600]  dorsey is not kicking them off recall the jack dorsey is now see twitter is now removing people
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.680]  on twitter they removed me they reinstated me but i have left twitter uh what's that
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:52.800]  james what has had to leave to a twitter we also have uh mylo has been banned i mean that
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:57.040]  is it's horrible there's a number of people that left twitter they tried to ban me but then 30
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:01.840]  000 people sent emails to twitter and they reinstated so look i can't reveal everything
[1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:07.040]  we're doing but we're going to be on the front lines exposing all of this and uh if there ever

[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:47.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:52.960]  you're listening to the alex john show
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:04.720]  how a news breaking story security experts discovered a secret backdoor what we're talking
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:11.760]  about is software from a chinese company already pre-installed installed already loaded in an
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:17.440]  estimated 700 million android devices again pre-installed if you bought it was already in
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:23.840]  there we're talking phones tv's cars wearables and let's chinese officials attention listen to
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:28.480]  your phone calls read all your text messages steal your family friends phone numbers even
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:34.320]  remotely control your device to install things like apps morgan when you make it that look i was
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:37.680]  very concerned about that i was a vice president all could tell lucent we were building out the
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:42.160]  national public safety broadband we had concerns about two companies out of china which are the
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:47.280]  ones that are the cell phone manufacturers wallway and zte their ties to the people's liberation
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:51.200]  army the fact that generals are running this and a house select committee on intelligence
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.560]  issued a report in 2012 talking about the dangers of this so now what you have is is you've got
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:00.560]  pre-installed spying software they say hope this was a mistake we didn't mean to have this on
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:05.040]  american phones you've got 700 million phones you're collecting data you know where it's coming
[1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:09.440]  from so i don't think it's a mistake that they were collecting this information it was found
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:15.280]  inadvertently that's from fox business actually doing their job the best stuff is on fox business
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:20.240]  on mainstream tv the best is fox business it's almost as good as info wars sometimes but notice
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.920]  that's not what the general fox viewers are getting it's very sad but that's because smart
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:30.400]  business viewers want real information they don't want a bunch of bull i had to play that clip
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:35.440]  because last hour i i have to correct myself i said 70 million phones i had the software
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:40.880]  loaded on i apologize it's 700 million and i've said this many times nine times out of 10 i'm not
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:47.120]  exaggerating i tend to dial stuff back it's a real problem i've got i'm not trying to lie
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:52.880]  but i tend to dial back and then people think i'm dialing up oh 70 million phones i mean come on
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:36:02.000]  i have 700 million devices phones you name it now again i've had whistleblowers on 20 years ago
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:09.360]  from the msa james bamford uh you name it telling us all this they've been doing it that long look
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:13.920]  i'm not out to get chinese people because they're asian my sister's korean adopted i love her to
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:18.720]  death china feeds on its own people the point is is when trump says we're being screwed by china
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:23.600]  man we're being screwed and they try to have this fake nationalism against russia russia's not doing
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:29.040]  this russia can barely keep from collapsing because they've been under global ascensions the threat is
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:34.400]  china so joining us for the rest of the hour is roger stone of the stone cold truth dot com every
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:39.840]  wednesday he's going to host the fourth hour here paul watson hosts thursday's rest the crew
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:44.960]  will host other hours i i i do intend uh in the near future as soon as we get another line of crew
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:50.880]  hired uh because we got one crew working seven days a week right now uh we're going to add more
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.680]  broadcast here to the info wars operation and more than happy to work with the folks at gcn as well
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:00.080]  but we are more and more doing things on our own syndicating the broadcast sitting on a satellite
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:05.200]  ourselves just because it's better to do it you know here out of the hacienda uh in austin texas but
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:12.320]  i gotta tell you i'm an eternal pessimist because i don't want to get arrogant and think i'm winning
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:23.680]  uh and then have a problem um i shot a big elk a few weeks ago and looked like he was down i went
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:28.320]  over there some great steaks the crews been eating it and i got over there 20 months later and he
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:34.240]  got up it was pretty dangerous and had to pull out my uh smith and west and 500 handgun that i had on
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.880]  my side and take him take him down but again you don't want to be too confident we don't want to
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:44.000]  say as the wolf says in pulp fiction that all is well and we can all you know service each other at
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:51.280]  this point we're winning but i didn't celebrate enough eight eight nine ten days ago i i will
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.280]  tell you sessions is a great choice to the attorney general ship ford returning 62 days before trump
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:03.600]  even gets in because trump called the heir to the ford dynasty and said look stop being anti-american
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:08.240]  i'm gonna tax the hell out of you don't do it he capitulated it's the president folks got power
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:12.480]  the globals want to sell that power out we've still got it we can still get a reprieve apple says
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.240]  they're probably going to come back um just a lot of really positive things a lot of good things
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:23.600]  are happening and then we got the numbers for info wars today they put us in this database put out by
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:30.320]  some ford foundation southern primary law center connected uh professor woman who i guess is god
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:36.160]  and they delisted info wars dot com prison fighter dot com bright bart dot com project veritas
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:40.000]  everybody saying we were fake and then google was putting up messages saying don't go to these
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.560]  sites they're dangerous we're on a roger stone here in about 10 seconds and i love where he says
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:49.200]  in a parking garage i guess you like like leaking the deep throat like drudge says only safe spot
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.080]  the talks in the parking garage these days with the chinese 700 million devices being tracked by him and
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:57.440]  i told people 20 years ago they could dial into your phone and listen to you now it's all admitted
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:02.480]  see folks another thing we've been caught in fake news but they had to back off today when they
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:09.040]  finally relisted who knows how high it went info wars dot com today it was 126 on the web drudge is
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:14.720]  like 100 uh so when i tell you that we're getting 10 15 20 million visitors a day folks i'm not
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:21.600]  kidding and and let me expand on that 80 plus million viewers election week and i thought it
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:27.680]  would actually trail off it it it hasn't i mean it it's it's not i mean i thought we'd go down
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:33.600]  about like 60 percent it's it's it's only gonna be like 20 percent uh this is just insane and and
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:37.440]  the problem is i'm just wondering how they're going to strike back you've got them desperately
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:42.720]  trying to prop up globalism meeting with merkel obama roger stone how big is this win i mean you
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:46.480]  want to be to celebrate uh you know last week you said look tomorrow we can get back on the
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:50.640]  parapet but i've got to tell you i'm ready to celebrate now i'm kind of having delayed euphoria
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:59.280]  here well alex uh i am uh i'm reaching you from a uh from a parking garage kind of a homage to
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:06.800]  deep throat if you will uh i'm uh in town to meet with some of the transition people look i'm very
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:14.400]  very pleased uh excellent news today jeff sessions a senator who's been on this program uh an
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:22.400]  early trump supporter uh a believer uh particularly in stealing our borders uh in the rule of law
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:29.040]  the right man uh at justice in my opinion the right man to proceed against the clinton's
[1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:36.480]  with a grand jury proceeding uh excellent news of general mike flinn uh who uh who
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:46.400]  promoted the uh the clinton's and went to the um uh to uh the trump side actively campaigning for
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:54.640]  trump a very effective surrogate for donald trump now at nsa you see the beginnings of a team of
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:41:03.520]  nationalists a team of men and women who will put america not the globalist agenda first so so far
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:10.240]  so good alex i'm very pleased let's keep talking about this situation with flinn and nsa wow
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:20.000]  well there was an attempt uh to derail him by some of the globalists uh general flinn had
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:27.520]  filed with the congress to do some uh lobbying essentially educational work for a tertiary
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:35.040]  turkish american interest um evidently he did not file uh a uh foreign agents registration act it's
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:42.640]  not clear that he needed to but he may have needed to it was an oversight it was very clearly an
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:49.760]  honest uh mistake i think it's being rectified in no way should it keep this distinguished man from
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:55.040]  serving in the trump cabinet and trump wants him for the head of the national security agency that's
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:42:01.920]  a big deal uh it's it's an enormous deal because of course it coordinates the activities of the uh
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:09.040]  the central intelligence agency defense intelligence uh the pentagon i mean this is the job that
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:18.800]  henry kissinger had this is the the molder of the president's foreign policy uh and um look i
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:25.680]  wanted flinn for vice president it was a minor problem turned out to be a democrat but that said
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:32.240]  i i think he's reflective of the kind of men and women uh that you are going to get out of a trump
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:39.760]  administration uh not men and women who are part of the washington establishment not party of the
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.720]  two-party duopoly that has run the country yeah this is a general who was basically removed this is
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:49.120]  general who's removed by obama two and a half years ago because he wouldn't back isis and al-qaeda
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:55.120]  in syria this is the guy that blew the whistle and exposed the whole thing that's exactly right
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:02.400]  alix he's shown his medal this guy stood up to the clinton's uh and uh he's an he's an excellent
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:10.400]  choice there is discussion now of uh governor jan brewer going to interior uh former governor of
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:18.240]  arizona she would also be an excellent choice again an early trump supporter not a globalist a
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:24.960]  nationalist um these are the kind of uh of names that i'm hearing uh and they're very encouraging
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:31.360]  the battle royal of course is still secretary of state now there's no question former mayor
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:38.800]  juliani is expressed his interest former un uh representative under bush john uh bolton has
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.120]  expressed his interest uh senator robert corker is i think ranking on the senate foreign relations
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:51.120]  committee has expressed an interest yesterday evidently the president elect reached out to uh
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:57.680]  nicky hailey the governor of south carolina now i don't know that she has the credentials for
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:05.200]  secretary of state but it tells me that perhaps perhaps president elect is looking for another
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:12.720]  choice for uh secretary of state uh look i know john bolton i like john bolton he's a great guy
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:17.600]  he's a great guy to play poker with he's a great guy to drink with he's a great guy to play cards
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:24.400]  with uh but he's not uh he's not a non-interventionist particularly when it comes to russia let's just
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:29.600]  say it he's got a hard on for he's got a neocon he's got a he's got a neocon hard on for russia
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:37.200]  yes now he did to his credit unlike many of the other uh neocons who cut and ran
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:45.360]  he supported trump in the general election and he uh and he very actively campaigned for it uh
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:51.040]  so he has some standing in the camp uh but i would really like to see somebody who more
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:56.400]  accurately reflects reflects the president's views on russia as well as they're just sending
[1:44:56.400 --> 1:45:00.000]  back to be the u.s ambassador to the u.n or something why promoting the secretary of state
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:07.600]  well look uh there may be another place for bolton to serve he's an able man but you can
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:14.000]  bring a whore to church that doesn't mean you should ask her to lead the choir all right look
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.720]  i've been asking some of the questions here what else is going on in trump landia he's delivering
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:24.480]  on so many fronts uh they're just this seems to be so exciting and mainstream media's numbers are
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:30.960]  still declining the liberty media is exploding we completely dwarf them now this is just i believe
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:35.440]  a total tipping point's been achieved i'm concerned though that they're going to get so panicked
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:41.280]  that they hit the panic button and and and do something rash well i was i have now been able
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:47.920]  to confirm something you reported last night alex and that is chelsea clinton has reached out to
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:55.280]  members of the trump family in a desperate plea not to have her parents prosecuted unfortunately
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:02.880]  it does not work that way we are a nation of laws not a nation of men and i think those in the
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:09.120]  trump inner circle believe that this is a question that is best left to the grand jury this is a
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:15.440]  question that is left not to politics but to career prosecutors who can examine all the facts
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:20.720]  there's a lot of alleged crimes here 30 years of alleged crimes as you know alex there's no
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:28.240]  statute of limitations on treason so perhaps selling missile targeting technology to the chinese
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:35.680]  in return for campaign contributions perhaps a special prosecutor should should visit that
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:42.080]  issue and exceed exactly what happened uh what do you think the pucker factor was this morning
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:47.200]  when president elect trump selected for confirmation which i'm sure he'll get the senate
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:51.680]  being senator sessins with the great record what was the pucker factor over at the clinton crime
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:55.760]  command center when they learned that senator sessions is going to be the new attorney general
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.520]  i mean that had to absolutely have the fear of god in those scumbags yeah i would have thought
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:06.480]  people would have been jumping out of some of the high windows in the building look that sessions
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:13.760]  is the law and order attorney general that donald trump was describing uh this is precisely uh the
[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:19.680]  man you need i hate to gloat but i mean every time i think about it i'm having my my brain's
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:26.080]  releasing just endorphins right now roger is that okay well look i had i had kind of a secret hope
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:32.800]  that sessions might go to defense uh but i'm very happy with him uh as ag there is some
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:39.040]  discussion of general mattis at defense another military leader who came to trump side early
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:45.760]  who is tired of the half-hearted efforts uh informed policy uh of the obama administration
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:50.640]  where you don't really know whether they're in business to help our enemies or to thwart our
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:56.320]  friends but that seems to be the bottom line meanwhile my friends in chapaqua tell me that
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:02.400]  hillary clinton is heavily sedated uh and that they are really uh huddling with their lawyers
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:07.520]  let me stop you because you said to me privately on election i don't know that can say this well
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:12.240]  i'm gonna say it you you were the first person to tell me that that it had been confirmed that
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:18.560]  hillary had dressed folks up in bernie outfits in chicago to go attack i later talked to sources in
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:22.240]  chicago and they said no the cops high level had told them not over dinner because one of these
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.360]  guys is friends with with one of the high level uh police captains that they were so pissed because
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:30.960]  they were ordered to just let them beat cops up you name it it was just in beat up families it was
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:36.000]  just so disgraceful you were right on that and and and then you said election night on air
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.320]  oh i bet she's sedated but you said privately well the word is she's flipping out she's sedated
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:44.880]  it's not come out from secret service from cnn people that she blew up for hours had to be
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:49.440]  sedated that's why she wasn't out till the next day and now she comes out on wednesday it looks
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:54.400]  like she's dying uh with with no makeup on it looks like she's about to die so so you just
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:49:00.480]  dropped that bombshell what's going on well uh look i think you and i were absolutely right we said
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:06.800]  at the time that her health was not good we were told it was a conspiracy theory still don't believe
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:12.320]  her health is good uh when you see her without the makeup when you see her without the careful
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:19.760]  lighting she does not look well i have confirmed as you did that she threw a violent fit when she
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:26.240]  learned that she was not going to win she was uh her usual foul she attacked pedesta right and
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:34.720]  screaming obscenities at mook and and pedesta over what could have been the worst presidential
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:41.440]  campaign in modern political history given the billion dollars plus that they had to spend
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:48.240]  and dwarfing the lousy two hundred and fifty thousand that uh donald trump spent he's very proud
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:53.840]  of the fact that he spent less money he got more votes why do you think i'm a habit he's seeing
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:50:01.120]  like uh looking even more anorexic crying in public totally freaked out well she may be looking for
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:07.280]  a sympathy factor perhaps that's where this is going that people will feel sorry for her and
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:14.320]  therefore perhaps she won't be prosecuted but there are crimes at the clinton foundation
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:20.480]  alex that are even as yet unreported sure of course when i look at the work of charles or
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:27.680]  tell who's one of the most respected guys retired from wall street a true financial expert someone
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:35.600]  who has specialized in this area of nonprofits the crimes there that have yet to be reported
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:40.560]  are extraordinary or to come back final segment roger stone and get into whatever he wants to
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:45.120]  talk about i've been asking the questions here but wow what an amazing time to be alive and to see
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.560]  trump delivering delivering delivering delivering all i care about is policy i don't care if he
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:54.400]  puts jenna claus in you know secretary of state jenna claus better do a trump watch and better
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:58.400]  deliver this republic back and so far i'm seeing to look trump deliver a hundred percent this is
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:04.320]  incredible at least uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food

[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:14.560]  we're looking at what we're facing and how we make sure trump is surrounded by real patriots
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:20.880]  well first i got to tell you is that everybody in my family now wants a trump is my president
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:27.120]  t-shirt for inauguration day so i think they were ordering yesterday i can see this is going to be a
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:34.960]  a very hot item for both those who are going to the inauguration and those who can't make it
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:43.360]  we are exploring having a pro trump demonstration to support the president at the inauguration
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.040]  let's just say we're going to do it i we are out there looking for a location i know you're
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:55.760]  interested we should have details momentarily i think it's very important that supporters of
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:01.600]  the president show a show you know we don't just want the communists and all the races run around
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:06.400]  and claim that there's no opposition to them and let them hog all the media exactly there's no way
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:10.960]  we're going to do that so the difference is our people aren't going to be paid to be there our
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:15.680]  people are going to be there because they're patriots because they're true believers the
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:21.360]  the soros crowd as you know they'll be there because they're being paid to be there they're paid
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:28.480]  agents provocateur uh paid agitators uh these uh these demonstrations are getting more and more
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:33.840]  pathetic yeah in fort lauderdale they were handing out flyers saying donald trump will
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:40.800]  dissolve gay marriages no he won't that's not what he said with leslie stahl on 60 minutes it's not
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:46.880]  what he said in his acceptance speech that's not what he's ever said it's the kind of leftist smear
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.240]  uh that we're looking at that's right uh what about steve bannon they are really gunning for him
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:57:00.400]  steve bannon is a patriot uh he is not an anti-semite he is not a bigot he is not a white
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:06.320]  supremacist he is he's not even we're mainstream they're the radicals what are they talking about
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:12.880]  we are the american mainstream yes he wants to seal our borders yes he believes in the rule of law
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:18.640]  yes he wants us to have better trade deals with our trading partners he wants to rebuild our national
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:25.520]  economy they hate him because he's effective they hate him because he sees the big picture and he
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:32.560]  knows who trump's real enemies are so uh i i think he's in great shape i think he's doing a great job
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:39.200]  and the mainstream media effort to lynch him has failed it certainly has uh separately is the minute
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:46.240]  we have left they're going to counter strike but this this news of sessions means that trump's i mean
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:51.440]  it means trump's putting in sessions that means justice shows that hillary is is going to get
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:58.080]  in some big big trouble now uh wow this is big yeah no i think grabbing the reins of justice is an
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:08.000]  absolute key uh look we all understand that their game plan their long-term game plan was censorship
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.920]  they want to shut info wars calm down they want to shut stone cold truth calm down they want to
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:19.840]  shut bright mark down they will not ever be allowed to do that's right their latest fake news thing

[2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:30.400]  with an update on the intelligence community and everybody that basically turned against hillary
[2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:34.880]  and he was just one more person telling you that documenting it talking to his sources but this is
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:42.080]  just a massive awakening across the board to tyranny and to see trump now putting jeff sessons
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:47.600]  in as the head attorney general he's not confirmed yet but he's got a very good record been in the
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:53.760]  senate i don't see the senate not confirming him this is going to be a big deal it's going to be a
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:59.280]  day long remembered and it's not about settling scores with hillary getting up here on air and
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:05.680]  going after her saying put her in prison putting airplanes in the sky she's a very vindictive person
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:14.640]  but i had to do it and i would have no power if it wasn't for you we're all just one contiguous
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:21.600]  body that loves liberty and we absolutely kicked their butt and to see record numbers of black
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:29.360]  and hispanic americans vote for trump against all the brainwashing all the stuff that he's a racist
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:39.120]  just showed that self-preservation in common sense is a lot more effective than pity party brainwashing
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:45.840]  they want us to be it's not even racism we face it's all this neurotic
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:50.400]  political correctness uptight i mean i'll just tell you get around so-called liberals they're the
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:55.840]  most anti-liberal people i've ever been around liberal means hospitality and fun and low taxes
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:02.400]  and freedom and not judging people and stuff like that that's how i am until you try to dominate me
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:06.640]  and guilt me i'm like what the hell are you talking about and i've been around modern liberals man
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:11.680]  they are the most obsessed neurotic weirdos i told the story about a year ago we're gonna go to
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:17.280]  bright come back with our guest a couple years ago i got invited out to a buddy's lake house
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:21.920]  and there was a boat dock shared by the community of like i guess five six houses in this little

[2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:58.320]  what's happening meanwhile they're panicking the globalism's in trouble the EU's collapsing
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:02.160]  world government's in trouble but the new york times comes out and says i'm insane
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:07.760]  globalism doesn't exist talk about gaslighting we got a former psychological warfare head of the
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:11.840]  state department maybe you can tell us about gaslighting and and or or maybe it's not gaslighting
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:16.240]  maybe they're just mentally ill and still delusional dr steve pacinic joins us the bottom of the hour
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:20.400]  then your phone calls what do you think of the election where all this is going i'm gonna start
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:28.160]  there trying to kill trump 800 25 at 99 231 800 25 at 99 231 show best-selling author wrote books
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:33.600]  with tom clancy produced films involved in all sorts of clandestine activities very interesting
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:38.080]  guy who actually was out there in the you know in the fields in the streets now just as an analyst
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:43.040]  breaking down what's happening and boy hillary tried to steal five states she did steal five
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:47.360]  states she still lost but they were confident they printed up you know newsweek that she was mad
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:51.200]  and president uh i think we've reached the tipping point we're not out of the woods yet
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:54.640]  but maybe i'm wrong dr steve pacinic what do you think of steve pacinic dot com
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:01.200]  alex i want to congratulate you for getting on the front page of the washington post i
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:07.360]  think that's indicative of the fact that jeff bezos and the entire liberal community which
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:15.120]  was controlling and controlled by the clinton's and the corporations is now disintegrating what's
[2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:22.880]  happened is it's really an american revolution in a very unique way and roger stone was correct when
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:28.640]  he said you were the cutting edge in terms of the words he spoke the fact that you stood there
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:35.440]  and and continuously hammered at the issues that we were concerned about the false flags the 9 11
[2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:42.640]  the sandy hook and they praised you by saying you're a conspiracist you're a true third and
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:48.720]  that is the new language of our revolution in other words to be called a true third to be called a
[2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:55.120]  conspiracist means a lot to us if we're all truthers and we say that obama was lying and
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:02.320]  bomba created false flags obama uh uh uh celebrated the fact that he killed osama bin laden when
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:08.160]  osama bin laden has been dead then what's happened in our revolution is that we're basically stating
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:15.200]  the truth and we went against the system the system has now been completely turned upside down
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:22.800]  never in our history had we had a multi-billionaire who's made his own business never had to go out and
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:29.440]  ask for help from others other than his own family has been bankrupt in his companies which is standard
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:36.320]  for business in the real estate industry let me tell you it's standard and at the same time went
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:43.440]  around seven times a day eight times a day on his own play playing on his own expense account
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:50.720]  and basically mustered the wrath of the american people to get elected into the presidency i i
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:13:00.480]  i welcome him i wish him the best of luck and i think he's chosen well jared kushner his quiet
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:08.000]  advisor i think is quite brilliant i think bannon uh as a chief of staff was a very good choice
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:15.200]  and i think the notion that he was anti-semitic is absolutely absurd i mean bannon well they
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:19.440]  don't even say where it comes from he's not even anti-israelan anyway they just make this crap up
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:25.520]  well but alex you gotta look at you know the the press doesn't even look at the basic history
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:32.160]  uh bannon was an executive in uh investment banking in mergers and acquisition now i've
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:39.040]  been in that position in another firm kidder but to be engolman's facts and to be anti-semitic
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.720]  that's just not possible then he went into the movie business and became an executive producer
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:51.200]  and the producer of a lot of films again in an industry that was predominantly jewish then he
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:14:00.880]  works with uh jared kushner and avana trump ivanka trump who basically are orthodox jews so the notion
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:08.720]  that he is both an anti-semitic races and it's just absolute nonsense so what you see basically
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:15.680]  is the propaganda machine from the left or wherever the paper's coming from has never done due diligence
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:20.720]  they never did due diligence thank you you crap i mean what they do is it's like when i said
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:25.840]  a jewish mafia doesn't run things i don't believe that but the immanuals are a mafia just like there's
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:29.760]  italian mafia then they turn that into anti-semitism in your view let me ask you this what do you
[2:14:29.760 --> 2:14:34.400]  think of the immanuals i mean i mean look what's going on in chicago one of them and he happens
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:40.560]  to be my agent he's not a very effective agent he took over the william marr's agency with which
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:48.080]  i've worked with for 30 years he's arrogance self-serving uh totally you know i think he's a
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:53.200]  bore i mean i'm no longer with that agency but sure that's my point is i was saying they're not
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:58.400]  running anything i was saying specifically though they act like gangsters i have to say that somebody
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:05.440]  who served in the idf and has not served in the united states army happens to be of dual loyalty
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:12.480]  and i've said before i do not approve of american jews having two passports you either have one
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:18.960]  american passport or one israeli passport you cannot have two if you have an israeli passport
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:25.440]  then go to israel serve israel but don't come and use our country bb had two passports he took
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:31.440]  advantage of the education we gave him here all the way through mit then he came back and had the
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:37.840]  influence to insult us to demand things from us israel has no right to demand anything from us
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:44.080]  it may be our ally but it's not our best ally there are many other countries who've been close to us
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:51.920]  israel has been a little child who has to be spanked repeatedly and has to grow up a lot of me
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.160]  to go off on all israel jack i'm just saying they spew this racism crap when when it's when it's
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:01.120]  not even there and i think it doesn't work anymore what do you expect them to strike back with because
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:05.280]  they seem to have only increased their lies they they don't seem to have learned from this do you
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:10.720]  think that's an accurate statement that's correct i think what's happening is in a revolution when
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:15.600]  you start doing the same thing again and again as einstein would say and it's not effective it becomes
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:21.360]  stupid one of the things that i said a long time ago about hillary was she was not as bright as
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:27.760]  everybody thought i don't mean in terms of just being able to spout our policy she never was able
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:34.080]  to be creative initiate anything on her own and think out of the box was strategic when she did
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:41.520]  and the democrats did we had libya we had iraq we had syria so what you have is a lack of sophisticated
[2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:48.160]  intelligence on the liberal side what you have is constant the latter of the same type at this
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:53.360]  point they're totally shocked everything you said about the liberals i haven't counted in my own
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:59.040]  area i couldn't believe that the people wouldn't talk to me people were afraid they were scared
[2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:04.720]  that they would be raped pillage and this would be a bullshitter cuspalinist takeover i said no
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.880]  this is a revolution but it's a revolution that was done very peacefully through the internet
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:17.840]  using many of our own people within the government and it was done to take out corruption now trump
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:24.160]  and his family represented the voice of america and the energy of america when did we ever have
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:30.960]  an entrepreneur like trump who came forth dedicated his whole life and mission and said i don't want
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:36.640]  your salary i don't want your pension i don't even want your health care that's what the citizen
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:43.520]  warriors all about and he is going to appoint people who are along those lines jeff sessions i
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:49.040]  don't know him i have a lot of respect for him but this is a man who's been in the law steeped in
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:55.760]  the loft for god how many three four decades 40 years that's exactly right and he worked all
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:18:01.920]  the way up from his own county senate and came to the the national government this is not somebody
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:07.920]  who on a whim came in there this is not a loretta lynch who works at ogan and hartson this is not
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:13.840]  a james comey who also worked at hogan and hartson this is a gentleman who represents the south
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:20.560]  then we have mike then we have pants the vice president representing indiana then we have uh
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:28.480]  a mike uh pompio from uh tanzas are you is america beginning to understand that trump understands
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:32.000]  what our country's event let's stop right there i'm gonna skip this breaks we have more time you
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:36.480]  you've been saying for five six years there'll be a devolution that that europe will break up
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:41.280]  you predicted the brakes it here and you predicted that that that trump noticed the south voted for
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:46.160]  him understands where america's left not bash of the north it's just been taken over by corruption
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:50.400]  we have to grow it back in the south the midwest then bring the freedom back to the east and west
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:54.000]  coast and and you've been predicting this would happen i know the intelligence community looking
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  at this as well so let's talk about this well for a long time as we were talking about globalism
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:04.880]  and the president talked about interrelationships i was talking about devolution of power because
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:11.360]  the very structure of interrelationship was asymmetric and it was an example where if you
[2:19:11.360 --> 2:19:20.080]  had the e you and the e you had one uh printing press for the for 26 or 30 countries it would not
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:26.560]  work england understood this england understood that the sterling the pound could never be attached
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:33.520]  to the e you because euro because the e you wasn't determined by france or germany it was determined
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:39.280]  by a bureaucratic Brussels in brussels which was totally ineffective had thousands of which
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:44.480]  has socialist ideology but is robber baron at the same time and so again we're seeing the
[2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:50.400]  global government project fail aren't we it totally is failing because england is breaking out spain
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:54.400]  how did you know six years ago it was about six years ago on the show that it would fail i mean
[2:19:54.400 --> 2:19:59.680]  i wanted to believe you then but i didn't see the evidence well because what i look at is the initial
[2:19:59.680 --> 2:20:05.680]  structures of institutions and where they are fragile and when i began to see when i was in
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:10.800]  france i grew up in france part of my life when i was in france in the 80s and the master
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:16.080]  agreement was made i understood very quickly that if you're going to change french france
[2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:23.280]  or german dutch marks for the euro you already failed why because germany was so powerful that
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:29.520]  the dutch marker was in fact determining the outcome of the entire trade organization in europe
[2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:34.960]  and i don't think obama understood this bush jr never understood it our intelligence community
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:40.000]  could understand part of it but they couldn't understand the the the speed at which we had
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:45.920]  the evolution of power the same thing in washington even though trump has come to washington he's
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:50.960]  really staying in its own place and that makes sense by the way i predicted he didn't tell me this
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:55.680]  i predicted he'd stay at trump tower at the time just to have a break with the whole system
[2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:01.280]  that's correct and he is broken with the entire system when everybody said as if it was a joke
[2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:07.680]  that he was twittering no he explained it very well in the 21st century if you do not use twitter
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:12.640]  you failed well he's not done they're trying to take his best weapon away from him well he has his
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:16.960]  enemy leslie stall in front of him saying please give up your direct communication with the people
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:24.320]  please please let us be your intermediary so we can betray you well in a way alex with all the
[2:21:24.320 --> 2:21:29.040]  respect i don't see them as enemies because they're not that strong they're not that formidable
[2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:35.440]  when they see you alex jones is an enemy that's formidable i mean what you have done over 14 years
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:41.280]  makes it formidable and remember it was a voice and it was the internet that you used and created
[2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:45.200]  and you were able to syndicate that show i hear you well listen i don't talk about me all day but
[2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:51.680]  what do you make of 126 on the web now total site five billion views on youtube i mean do you think
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:57.360]  they figured out they're getting their ass kicked yet they don't want them you don't understand when
[2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:01.920]  when it hurts they don't want to admit it there's a there's a dynamic called denial and it's not a
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:07.680]  river in egypt they want to deny what happened to them how are you doing it how can you explain if
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:13.040]  you're hillary and bill clinton or chelsea how you spend one billion dollars that was my next
[2:22:13.040 --> 2:22:17.280]  question she really thought she would win we confirmed with our sources she threw fits attack
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:23.040]  people had to be sedated right so so how was she so delusional when she was paying for fake polls
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:28.480]  we knew it to still think she would win well when you live in a bubble and this is what we were
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:33.440]  talking about for decades you and i she lived in the bubble where she never had to do anything on
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:38.960]  her own never drove her car never had to go see a doctor who was a real doctor who could diagnose
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:44.560]  the Parkinsonism and she was always protected by the secret service but i want to thank certain
[2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:49.840]  members of the secret service who revealed to us that she had these diseases even if she
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:54.400]  got into the white house which i didn't think she would make she could never remain as president
[2:22:54.400 --> 2:23:00.320]  of the united states it just wouldn't happen i can't go into the reasons why but she understood it
[2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:06.160]  unfortunately bill clinton and the democrats never understood what i was saying months before and
[2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:12.480]  almost a year before there do not run it wasn't an issue of my threatening them it was a warning
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:18.320]  to them you cannot run you are not viable as an entity i don't know who is going to run against
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:23.840]  her at that time but we knew very well within the system she could not be accepted within our
[2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:28.560]  system it shows how disconnected from reality they are and so is the cloistered corporate press so
[2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:32.480]  what happens to the corporate press they kind of like blowing the wind like a facade are they
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:38.480]  fully collapse right a alex what's happening is where you're growing with all due respect
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:43.760]  they're basically having a cash flow problems even the new york times had a little article three or
[2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:49.200]  four days ago a small article saying how their cash flows have diminished because none of the
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:55.440]  advertisers are going to go to the new york times but it's down 97 90 listen how do they make
[2:23:55.440 --> 2:23:59.840]  800 million dollars a year and then we're bigger than them literally on online again it's all
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:06.560]  delusional and people finally see the emperor has no clothes 97.5 reduction in their profits
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:13.040]  third quarter they are in free fall well they're basically bankrupt what you have here is you have
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:18.320]  an entity which is basically bankrupt but they don't want to declare the bankruptcy you have a
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:23.280]  mexican drug lord that's been funding them on the cash flows you don't need reporters anymore you
[2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:29.440]  don't need an editor all of that is nonsense what has happened thanks to info wars and break
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:35.280]  art and others and and what we've done it was to get a take away the newspapers to take away
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:41.760]  their content and basically realigned it with a 21st century what do i mean by that the internet
[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:47.280]  and social media was so powerful that you knew how to use it brettbart knew how to use it bannon
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:52.720]  knew how to use it and most importantly trump knew how to use it he was brilliant he absolutely
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:25:00.320]  understood the power of the social media and the twitter now i studied that in 1973 at mit when i was
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:05.120]  taught by darpa the internet and social media you and i've talked about it where your father was
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:11.600]  involved in that but in 1973 before zhaka berger gates came out and self aggrandized themselves
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:17.360]  we were already talking about the impact of the social media on the world and that was funded by
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:24.720]  darpa and the cia in its heyday now you see 50 years later trump literally using it and
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:30.960]  and that the democrats had no idea they didn't even use it at all and what did they do they went
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:36.160]  exactly the old road but not the road and they're still going the old road i don't understand it i
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:42.160]  mean because they're ignorant they were ignorant self delusional and arrogant when you have that
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:48.480]  tripod and you have that triad it's a very deadly combination it's basically self-destructive you
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:53.760]  and i have talked about that you and i have never been self-destructive we've always fought we got
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:26:00.080]  hit we weren't always right but we kept on coming back hillary was totally self delusional and her
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:05.760]  her cult it was really a cult group i'd never seen anything like this it was a cult it was a
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:11.440]  cult it wasn't a movement it wasn't a liberal movement it wasn't a movement that had creativity
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:17.680]  the closest person to that creativity was the person i happened to have heard a year ago in
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:23.440]  war in new hampshire that was bernie sanders who could articulate exactly what the millennials were
[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:30.800]  concerned about he articulated a formula that made sense trump understood that i understood that you
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:37.040]  understood it i wrote a blog a year ago saying that the normal opponent to trump would have been
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:42.000]  bernie sanders not hillary clinton sure so they screwed up by doing that and expanding on that
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:48.160]  i mean he was getting 10 to 1 15 to 1 by the end 20 to 1 likes and traffic on facebook and twitter
[2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:52.880]  that's always for any marketer and they have these big algorithms total proof that's why they were
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:56.880]  panicking but at the same time still believing they could win because they were putting out fake
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:02.000]  polls but people didn't buy the polls so they didn't go get on the bandwagon for hillary that's
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.960]  where they lost it the fake also because hillary didn't want to hear anything that you didn't want
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:12.000]  to hear alex you and i understand that we open up and we listen to different things as you just
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:17.920]  mentioned when i talked about devolution of power and it was seemed out of style at this five six
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:24.160]  years ago i wasn't blowing smoke in the wind at this time we don't have to be self-aggrandizing we
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:31.120]  simply say the system has changed we've gone from paper to the internet we've gone from numbers to
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:37.280]  binary and the old establishment hadn't figured that out yet no the intelligence community had but
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:43.760]  what happened was she had seconded guys like michael hayden and others who were sycophants
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:49.360]  we in turn went back to our own people at a lower level and said look we've got a problem
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:54.960]  she had a civilian coup now you have to understand what that really meant for our my own people my
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:00.800]  own people being military intelligence civilian intelligence and all across the board they understood
[2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:07.200]  right away when hillary and bill had co-opted combi loretta lynch the fbi the cia she was
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:11.840]  setting up something really dangerous she had to be dealt with there was no question and and the
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:16.960]  minute that occurred and i got to go ahead that meant we ran a counter coup as you know better
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:22.240]  than anybody else we ran it through a julien assange and i've got to say julien assange
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:28.400]  honorary citizenship to america he really has helped sure how could trump you know i get three
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:32.960]  years ago say it's a traitor i get on his face you know you know snowden how could he not pardon
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:38.320]  snowden or give assange asylum here when these are the guys that got him elected snowden is a
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:44.880]  separate issue i have to differ with that snowden was part of the cia he was part of the nsa snowden
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:51.440]  had a top secret clearance and then special access program it's a very sensitive issue when you are
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:57.520]  part of an organization like daniel elsberg and you suddenly become what they call a whistleblower
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:02.560]  i'm very very mistrustful of who you are and who you represent you might be a double or triple
[2:29:02.560 --> 2:29:07.280]  agent doesn't just represent who he is he doesn't represent the rest you think trump's right saying
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:14.880]  go after him yeah i would say yes but sans is good i would bring him through a process that's civil
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:20.400]  he should have a defense lawyer the best that money can buy hogan and arson or william and conley
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:25.200]  i'm sure there are enough lawyers in the senate who can recommend that and he should be tried
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:29.440]  and see but as for sans he should be given an award all right yes folks can find your books
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:34.800]  cbchinnick talks at cbchinnick.com all interesting in your audience alex i we couldn't have done it

[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:13.120]  and like literally twisted it's like yesterday i said i don't know what happened to sandy hook
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.520]  they take me out of context where i say i could see how it was actors and stage they have green
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:21.360]  screen they've staged so much other stuff it just doesn't make sense i guess the whole thing could be
[2:34:21.360 --> 2:34:26.080]  fake people are i was talking about people criticizing me for saying at least part of it was real
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:32.480]  and they'd been caught with real events having actors to then try to squeeze as much emotion
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:36.640]  out of it as they can i mean seeing i just got caught last week with fake fake fake interviews
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:42.080]  and they take a complex thought like that where i'm really trying to tell people what i think
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:46.960]  and you're like looking into your brain saying how do you describe this because it's complex i don't
[2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:52.400]  know usually i know and so i can be definitive but when i don't know i'm like well i look at it on
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:57.920]  this side look at it on that side and i feel sorry for the the parents of the kids and i know there
[2:34:57.920 --> 2:35:03.120]  are school shootings and it's terrible so and then the media thinks they've got me oh he backed
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:07.280]  with they had a new or daily news article today a bunch of others alex jones comes in and says he
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:11.920]  doesn't believe sandy hook was staged and then one minute later contradicts himself no i didn't
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:18.720]  i was very clear just like i just was the whole official story is very convoluted a lot of it
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:23.120]  doesn't add up and a media that's been caught lying so much is running it so how do i believe
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:29.120]  anything i could have a neighbor that's lied to me 50 times who i know is a criminal and they come
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:33.600]  and tell me uh oh hey come home your house is on fire i'm not going to believe them even if the
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:40.320]  house is on fire it's what i'm saying so then they play these games you see they play these games
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:45.360]  and they could take anything and turn it around like i do not believe a jewish conspiracy runs the
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:52.560]  world but there are a lot of criminals that happen to be jewish that hide behind anti-semitism claims
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:36:00.160]  like the mayor of chicago there's irish mafia there's italian mafia there's jewish mafia there's
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:05.280]  dixie mafia they're all bad we don't have one mafia running the world but i think the
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:10.400]  manuals and obama are like a mafia oh my god jews around the world alex jones said it oh my god
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:16.960]  and he's jerusalem post and you read these cutoff quotes all cobbled together it's like man there's
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:22.640]  a reason people don't believe you or listen to you it's crazy
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:28.560]  rob jacob says jewish a great friend of mine the oldest employee at this company
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:34.000]  he tells the story grown up in brooklyn where some of the hasidic jews i found
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.200]  me great folks but he said they were some of them are really obnoxious and he's jewish he's
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:40.720]  allowed to say this would come up and say you need to come to our meeting or you need to do this
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:44.400]  you need to be in this business deal and when he wouldn't agree they'd go oh you don't like jews
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:49.440]  like sit there and peck at him and you know mess with him and you know it's just crazy folks i don't
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:54.880]  like white supremacist i don't like uh you know jewish mafia i just don't like criminal groups and
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:37:00.560]  every group's got it let's let's stop lying about it i can take you all over the place and find
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:05.440]  toothless white people that are the dumbest people you can imagine who hate everybody including
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:09.760]  their neighbors all they got is running around going i don't like the mexicans i don't like the n
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:15.440]  word those people are jackasses they're jokes me and my dad corrected me last week you said you
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:20.320]  know you're talking about my dad who ran for office as a republican and uh who was loved by
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:23.200]  the black folks and things and he stood up the clan had the clan threatening me he goes they
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:26.880]  weren't that threatening there were a bunch of goobers and wimps i mean he did stand up to him
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:30.000]  and they did threaten anybody goes you know wouldn't like it was that scary and i said well of course
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:34.880]  you know your dad was a badass and he had the people behind him but he they still did threaten him
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:39.760]  because i've been threatened over him myself in east texas but i mean that's what i mean like my
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:45.040]  family has literally fought the kkk and i get to sit there and have dumbasses tell me i'm with the
[2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:52.400]  kkk with a bunch of potbelly dumbasses who want to run around acting like they're in some cool club
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:56.800]  i've been invited to the inauguration and don't even want to go to that i'm going to be out the
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:38:02.960]  street fighting the demonstrators exposing them that's where i am anybody figured out yet i don't
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:08.320]  want to be in anybody's club i'm not in anybody's club i don't care if you're black white woman man
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:12.480]  as long as you're cool i like you if you're an a-hole i don't like you want to go to your phone
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.880]  calls it's just i'm back there and matt one of the producers is going yeah look at this article
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:21.920]  you got a bus fee they admit here's bannon over a year ago talking about how we're trying to wash
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:26.960]  out racism in the in the libertarian right-wing movement and how everybody how we want to get
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:30.720]  everybody including minorities involved that's what i'm trying to do that's why the white
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:39.520]  supremacists hate me more than benjamin netanyahu a world where he said racism on the far right
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:47.600]  gets washed out and yeah he called putin a kleptocrat he doesn't like putin it's a diverse
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:52.560]  group the point is that i'm not even sitting here saying seven bannon's perfect they just
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:58.240]  misrepresent they say he's an anti-semite when breitbart's basically a pro-israel outfit this is
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:05.200]  just horse crap it's all and i'm not even here defending it because oh you're getting us oh
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:11.520]  you're on target oh i better defend it's you're a joke info wars has never been about race garbage
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:18.320]  except for exposing it if you google alex jones a jewish agent or whatever you'll just get i mean
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:23.760]  literally you go to the nazi websites folks they hate me more than anybody on earth and you know
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:29.040]  why it's because i just want everybody to have freedom and i want to win the culture war where
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.760]  no matter what color you are you're into free market the second amendment and freedom i don't
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.160]  care what color you are we can ride around and jacked up monster trucks drinking bears shooting
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:45.280]  fully automatic weapons i mean you know i just i just am not a creep folks and i get there's an
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:50.720]  anti-white agenda god there is one but that's that's what the system sells because racism is is is
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:54.960]  successful with dumb people and there's no shortage of dumb people regardless of skin color
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:01.760]  but if you google and just go look at what the white supremacists and you know i found out the
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:05.120]  white supremacists are a bunch of feds they're a bunch of southern poverty law center people
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:11.760]  i'm gonna say right now eight times out of ten from our research white supremacist leaders
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:16.320]  work for the big foundations forward foundation to the poverty law center it's not like they
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:20.880]  infiltrate of these groups so they can control them and you know see what they're doing they create
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:30.720]  them they create them they're gang members folks that's all it is it's gang crap like oh you got
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:37.440]  a blue bandana you got a red bandana it's all this crap and i personally am sick of it you know i've
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:41.120]  got a bunch of clips here to play and i'm going to put a sandy hook special out tonight on the

[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:04.320]  satellite i mean i don't know what was going on there i'm explaining to you again but it's
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:12.160]  just funny is a three dollar bill now when i'm decisive and i've got hundreds of polls that
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:19.200]  were done privately showing trump way ahead and i told you he was going to win it's because i've
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:26.000]  had the facts the only thing i've got is my credibility and by the way credibility doesn't
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:31.920]  mean the way i present information oh alex jones yells and screams sometimes abs a freaking lootily
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:36.960]  because i'm real but when it gets down to information man i'm not going to lie to you
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:42.480]  because of my integrity my most valued possession is that who i am is right here on my sleeve
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:48.160]  like this is a jay right there on my shirt that's who i am my integrity is right here

[2:54:13.040 --> 2:54:16.640]  it's not just that they're saying all the trump supporters are racist with almost no evidence
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:24.160]  it's that they've got all these hyped up people beating up white folks and then cnn even goes well
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:31.120]  they're white they deserve it moving we played those clips and then meanwhile all trumps trying
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:35.760]  to deliver his tax cuts and things like that people are really really seeing through this right now
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:41.920]  and so i just tell the system keep it up i mean you are just so delusional there's something about
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:48.640]  wimps that strolled in and took over this free country that they've taken our restraint as weakness
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:52.480]  they've taken our kindness as weakness and they're about to find out that well they are finding out
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:59.520]  that's not the case i mean they death threat me and stuff i'm like i'm a freaking maniac you really
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:04.560]  think i'm scared i'm not just saying that i mean i really am a maniac i mean i'm kind of ashamed of
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:11.200]  it at some point i mean you think i'm thinking i'm playing games here with you people i'm sworn
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:18.080]  on the altar of god my entire soul against you i had turned myself completely over to the resistance
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:26.400]  of you do you understand what that means you're trying to threaten me that's a joke you're a joke
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:34.160]  the truth is i'll lose my soul and be destroyed if i don't resist you i know that
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:41.520]  my frantic resistance to you is is my panicked psyche realizing how evil you are that i've got
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:47.200]  to resist you or i'm with you i'm guilty constantly that i'm not doing up to fight you you sacks of
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:54.400]  filth it's not because i'm some good person but it's because i love god if there's a bright
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:57.520]  point in the universe you're the furthest point from it and i just think you need to know that
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:01.280]  not the demoralizing way i just want you to know you mean nothing to me those of you that
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:05.280]  serve this system and i'll talk to our listeners a lot i'll talk to the enemy because i want the
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:10.880]  enemy to know that i see you and i know who you are and you know i see you and that's good
[2:56:11.760 --> 2:56:16.320]  i want to let let nick finish on the kissinger thing yes i was doing the goblin joke he met
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:20.880]  with kissinger yesterday um he says he'll meet with the um the shaw of iran
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:28.720]  so all i care about is leaving the guns alone defending the borders cutting taxes
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.240]  prosecuting the clintons not putting his foot on america's neck that's what we're pushing
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:41.520]  that's what we're promoting and just not caring about political correctness down all these
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:47.440]  moral high ground people that want us to go we're sorry we've been bad you're right i'm sorry i'm
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:53.440]  racist and i'm not in fact i transcend all you people's pushing the racism line nick go ahead
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:57:00.160]  um you know i'm thinking this is probably just their last bitch efforts to try you know and i
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:05.040]  know he's not going to sell out but try to get trump on board before they go to plan b which is
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:08.720]  unfortunately they're going to try to take them out and that terrifies me that that's a possibility
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:14.560]  that's right and trump by the way trump by the way is is is really into the spirit of it and is very
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:18.720]  the fatalistics the word that's been used but that's improper he just is committed
[2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:25.120]  and he has no fear he loves it right that's why you won't move out of trump's tower
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:31.440]  i kind of wish he would well brother look trumps trumps trumps in another level now and so
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.200]  he stepped up there that's what it's all about brother and uh all of us that fight this tyranny
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:44.400]  right there with him so this is biblical this is biblical i appreciate your call great points there

[2:59:04.320 --> 2:59:10.320]  important what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our
[2:59:10.320 --> 2:59:15.520]  telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you

[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:19.360]  republic defense fleet has won decisive battles against the globals we've captured
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:28.880]  a capital but only have a tenuous beachhead would you like to know more all right ladies and gentlemen
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:33.600]  let's uh what kind of ended quickly on here's some more starship troopers just in florida so
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:42.720]  what do we do okay so basically you already have the platform to get us started so we need to go out
[3:00:42.720 --> 3:00:49.280]  to multiple cities multiple states and form teams and all those states that go out we can hit gun shows
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:55.280]  we can hit uh act for america programs like that that we know are vetted and that actually are on
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:01:00.320]  our team and on our side and get out hand out flyers have him with their interview people get
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:04.480]  their questions get their consent sure we should continue energizing the base for a liberty movement
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:09.520]  but i say get outside the box and don't just go where awake americans are i think we should adopt
[3:01:10.640 --> 3:01:15.920]  liberals i think we should adopt immigrants uh who are here legally and and and like i'm i'm serious
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:20.160]  the way to beat this is give people jobs be their friend not just because we're being patronizing
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:23.920]  but the globals are going to turn them into racist nut jobs so we're going to have to reach out to
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:29.440]  people yeah that's it that's my that's what it is just get out there whatever it takes to get out on
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:33.440]  the streets and have people hit yeah look look look notice they've totally ignored martin with
[3:01:33.440 --> 3:01:38.160]  their king's plan and they've gone down to resegregation they want everybody in little groups the
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:43.200]  answer is reach out everybody come together get out of comfort zones and really do it now it doesn't
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:47.840]  mean it's easy man i've had you know brainwashed idiots i'm going to call them racist they just
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:51.840]  think i'm out to get them because i'm a white guy bow up to me since the media did this but that's
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:56.240]  the media's fault that's why i got to make sure the mainstream media basically implodes by the way
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:01.600]  i like tom hanks as an actor but after he had all these ads saying trumps racist i'm not watching
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:07.520]  another tom hanks movie and i mean i'm not going to see inferno i'm not i'm not i'm done even though
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:12.560]  clenis would you put him in that last movie it was good uh sully i'm just done with tom hanks hey
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:17.760]  ovar tom hanks you're an enemy of this country you're a piece of crap i'm done with you that goes
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:22.960]  for michael moore any of these guys i'm done a great point justin all right christin virginia
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:31.040]  you're on the air say about what the globalists have done to our country that you can be talking
[3:02:31.040 --> 3:02:38.560]  to ron paul and jesse ventura and it seems like they don't have no hope about affecting real change
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:45.840]  in our country you know he said this failed that failed everything else failed uh ventura was basically
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:52.080]  saying if everything gets bad he just moved effect he'll just go to his crib in mexico i was just
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:55.760]  what do you think about that i'll be honest with you about ron paul i'll be honest with you about
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:02.000]  ron paul he's a purist and wants to change ideology but the problem is you got to mix ideology with
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:06.960]  the politics because whatever the energy of the time is you've got to at least touchstone that
[3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:12.160]  not a manipulative way but cover that issue hijacking the issue to get folks into here the truth
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:17.840]  so paul is too pure ventura i think is a little bit but hurt over the fact that he's not in the
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:23.760]  limelight or whatever and so just wants to basically you know act like he doesn't care real revolution
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:30.160]  is happening with trump right now this is the real deal and then the last thing i said i was
[3:03:30.160 --> 3:03:37.200]  watching uh michelle obama on on the campaign trail and and she was doing that that speech about
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:43.680]  trump and taught i seen spear in her eyes and and it dawned on me that it was like fear from
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:49.520]  their legacy it looked like they built up eight years of this classy this that and other and then
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:55.200]  one instant trump doing just half of what he said he's going to do for the american people their whole
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:01.280]  legacy if you call poops and that's right oh imagine oh we're just going to cut your taxes to zero
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:05.680]  forget giving you money and telling you how to live your life here's your money imagine and then
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:10.960]  there'll be a boom and that exactly discredits their whole thing doesn't it yeah it sure does
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:17.280]  and i just i just want to find that real funny and then i asked my white friends in the small
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:23.920]  town what do you think about another white person coming up to you calling you a freaking white male
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:30.480]  and the look on their faces like because i we live in a small town it doesn't happen around here

[3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:26.160]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:38.320]  misrepresent what i say because i simply say i question the official story so they made a big
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:42.560]  issue out of that we got more phone calls coming up but briefly i just wanted to say this you know
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:48.320]  i said it was 70 million phones and devices that the common Chinese loaded uh backdoor devices to
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:53.280]  steal your passcodes to rob your bank accounts uh you name it no no i'm sorry it's 700 million
[3:08:53.280 --> 3:08:58.960]  devices and this is just an illustration imagine and i'm not some rusa file or been to russia
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:04.400]  just rush is doing nothing imagine they were saying rush is hacking us the communist chinese had
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:11.120]  700 million devices we now learn that they put backdoor technology on to control everything
[3:09:11.120 --> 3:09:15.360]  that emerged with the globalist this is just crazy but before we go there i just want to say one thing
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:20.240]  we're all excited right now about liberty movement and trump what's happening
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:25.680]  but listen this wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for god's hand moving so it is god doing this
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.080]  the mvp and all this we can say is julian assigned to matt rudge or
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:35.280]  whoever but it really is god at the end of the day so i just want to say that i'm so thankful to god
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:39.600]  it's such an amazing time to be alive uh david night absolutely you know alex that report that i
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:44.000]  did yesterday about the two cities you know we've got new york city where they float a petition
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:47.840]  saying get trump's name off of our apartment building meanwhile you got another petition
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:53.360]  being floated in a russian town and they want the name of a road that was put in by the
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:10:00.400]  communists who are proud of their godless atheism they named not one but two roads godless in this
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.480]  small russian town and these people are circulating a petition saying they want one of these roads
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:09.120]  renamed donald trump that tells you two things it tells you number one these people feel they
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:13.760]  have really dodged the bullet we've had nothing but obama and hillary clinton saying let's declare
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:19.120]  a no fly zone let's let's go to war with the russians uh this is like the beginning of the cold war
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:22.960]  we had the key to khrushchev coming to the uman beating his shoes yeah shoe on the podium saying
[3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:27.360]  we will bury you i mean that's what these people were looking at was a real threat and they just
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:32.560]  dodged that bullet on the other hand the people in russia as you just pointed out uh about this
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:36.320]  victory belonging to god we have to understand that there's a lot of people in russia that are
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:42.160]  moving towards god as you've got people in new york and other bastions of the democrat party
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:46.640]  proudly becoming godless atheists moving the other direction and so these people are saying
[3:10:46.640 --> 3:10:51.600]  hey we don't want to be known anymore you know why they're so scared i can feel they can feel god
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:56.240]  coming back into the world yeah as we open the door it's happening yeah i mean i mean it's not
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:11:00.560]  mumbo jumbo we didn't prescript this there's no teleprompters do you not feel the energy
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:05.200]  like i can feel the battle going back and forth but lately it just seems like the liberty is just
[3:11:05.200 --> 3:11:11.120]  exploding yeah yeah it absolutely is amazing and it's amazing to see that happening and we see people
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:14.400]  you know choosing upsides you know choose who you're going to serve you're going to serve the
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:19.920]  gods godless atheists with their communism with their socialism will never be there for you yeah
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:25.440]  or you're going to serve the people who uh have compassion for others who've tried to help people
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:29.840]  and that's what we're seeing not only in america but we see an awakening alex you're talking about
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:33.280]  across the entire world because that's why there's been a demonization of america
[3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:37.200]  because for all of our evils it was truly had a christian core to it that's right that's what
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:41.360]  the enemy hates yeah yeah there's never been a perfect country and we don't ever have any perfect
[3:11:41.360 --> 3:11:45.840]  people and you can go in and you can you can pick at somebody's life and you can find a lot of bad
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:50.000]  things about anybody uh just just like earlier this week where the people are apoplectic at the
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:56.080]  university of virginia because somebody there had referenced thomas jefferson and uh you know so yeah
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:00.560]  you can find bad things in jefferson's life and you can ignore the massive number he tried to
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:05.680]  enslavery in the first bill of rights they wouldn't let it and they said he had slaves
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:10.800]  that was people that were on his family that he was had children with he was trying to end it
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:16.800]  he couldn't yeah yeah that's how they distort everything yeah he tried to end it he was born
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:21.600]  into it he's a hero not a bad guy that's right you have to look at it in the context the time
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:27.040]  he was and what he tried to do and he had a long section you try being in virginia yeah and say
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:32.880]  1800 trying to enslave it that's right that's right that's not too popular yeah exactly uh yeah he
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:37.760]  kind of stuck out there and and actually he was but then they invert it the founder of the democratic
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:42.640]  party you said their later were races they they invert it and make him a racist yeah yeah he had
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:47.200]  long sections in the declaration of independence uh talking about slavery and then he and other
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:53.040]  virginia plant uh plantation owners uh and again it was a time they lived in there was some paternalism
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:57.920]  but they wanted to free their slaves but they said how do we do this because if we let them free here
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:02.880]  there's they're going to be picked on by the people they came up with uh Liberia and uh they
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:07.680]  repatriated some of them back there so i mean they they did what they could uh but he was focused
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:11.920]  Lincoln looked at ship and everybody back what's that yeah exactly yeah just throw people out on
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:15.360]  the side of the beach as a matter of fact you know you go back and you look at what Lincoln said
[3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:19.600]  in the debates with Doug look he said i would not free one black slave i could yeah but they
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:24.160]  gave him back to yeah exactly so you know there was some really racist truth is the truth is
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:27.680]  what they teach is not what went on yeah that's right you have to go back to the original the point
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:33.040]  is is that it's the west not so much the u.s but england that ended slavery now they're really
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:37.360]  used and they did it without a war they did it with the first he had one guy wilber force who
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:41.760]  spent his entire life making that his cost and never let me see it yeah i stopped the slave
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:46.240]  trade and then just before he died he stopped the ownership of slave and they compensated people for
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:51.520]  their slaves and did it without a war and we're living though to see globalism i mean who would
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:56.560]  have thought a year ago there'd be a headline on drudgereport.com that they're desperately put
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:01.120]  it on screen desperately trying to save it they're just plotting their survival now
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:07.200]  and what wilber force did and and i talked about how Nigel Farage reminded me of wilber force
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:11.840]  because he hammered this singular issue and it's something that he's done for decades and how
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:17.040]  wilber force eventually prevailed and i know that uh even though they're pushing back on it uh in the
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:21.600]  uk and on brexit they say they don't have a plan so forth it doesn't matter the beginning of the end
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:26.720]  exactly but but again going back to where you started with god okay why did william wilber
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:31.200]  force do that it was because of his christian conversion and he was going to become a pastor
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:37.600]  and he had newton who wrote amazing grace said no you're where god wants you to be change that
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:41.520]  get rid of of slavery do something there so that's what he did we're all called to do for
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:47.040]  different things that's what he did he made it his life on calling and it was inspired by his
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:51.040]  christian principles and that's what even people like stefan malinu who's not a christian he said
[3:14:51.040 --> 3:14:53.680]  look i mean that's his question and i'm going to get out here because i know you got to cover
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:58.400]  stuff and take all of this big special coming up i'm not demonizing the mainline church but world
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:03.600]  council of churches national council rock of fellers 1900 you know set it up the church is all
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:07.520]  it's the end of the world don't fight evil just go to the church give us money big mega church
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:11.840]  save souls if you're not fighting evil your soul is not saved whether whether the other world's
[3:15:11.840 --> 3:15:16.960]  next week or a thousand years from now we have to oppose this evil now and so i i'll tell you i just
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:23.120]  go off my gut and also intellectual analysis i get in mega churches i feel so empty i don't
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:27.760]  feel panicked anywhere but in mainline churches now little bitty community churches little christian
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:32.880]  churches i feel great little bible studies i go to i feel great in big churches i feel sick i
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:37.600]  because the office of a preacher keeping people down not letting them know their real mission
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:42.160]  i think it's the most satanic position there is yeah and i'm telling you i've been there
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:46.960]  and i've actually dealt with some of them with with with with mega churches they are an instrument
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:52.160]  of pure evil we have to look at the entire structure and get something that is more like
[3:15:52.160 --> 3:15:56.640]  the early home churches that they had before uh constantine took that over where you have
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:02.160]  people who are engaged who are involved instead of setting their passively and watching somebody
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:06.480]  do something at the front you know that that's what happened uh at that point that's really
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:10.880]  happened exactly it becomes something that you watch as opposed to something that you participate
[3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:13.680]  in that you are part of that you have some response and that's whatever it's folks you're
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:18.640]  in the info or you're taking action out there that's why this is not theater this is real and i
[3:16:18.640 --> 3:16:22.480]  think when you look at what's coming up alex donald trump is still gonna have these big massive
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:27.600]  rallies he's gonna go around we need to understand that everybody is truly you know buck mister fully
[3:16:27.600 --> 3:16:32.880]  said hey we're all crew on the planet earth we're all crew on this movement of liberty and if we go
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:38.080]  back to sleep and say donald trump is president so he can do everything uh we're gonna lose just
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:42.000]  like what you're talking about mainline churches you get one guy he may be a great guy he may be a
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:46.800]  great pastor a great teacher but if he's the only one doing anything nothing is going to happen and
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:51.600]  if we got a president and you just set back and don't do anything uh we're not going to get anything
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:55.760]  changed well trump that's what he said to me you know when i talked to him last week he said
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:59.280]  just keep it up alex i need you i appreciate you in your audience i said well thank you sir
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:04.560]  and he goes no i i mean it you tell them thank you i know they're the heart of what's happening
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:08.320]  and and and the spirit of this yeah every time i talk to trump it's about the spirit
[3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:14.640]  he's pretty heavy yeah i mean on tv he's not fake but that's kind of him being limited trump in
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:20.960]  person it's like it's really piercing uh and uh that's what scares them folks they know trump is
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:26.320]  not out to get you oh yeah i keep saying that trump not out to get you he loves beating big
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:32.960]  corporations he loves it he can't wait to cut poor people's taxes to zero and look at what we've seen
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:36.880]  in the since he's been elected in the week and a half or so since he's been awards already staying
[3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:40.800]  yeah we see all these positive changes that have happened and we see the drumbeat of the
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:44.240]  mainstream media coming back well you're not really going to do what you said you're going to do
[3:17:44.240 --> 3:17:49.440]  about the borders or about the trade deals or about peace with uh you know going after russia
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:54.000]  and peace uh not going after russia but going after isis uh partnering with them and you're
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.040]  you're not going to do all that stuff that you said by the way notice the russians went from
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:01.040]  being threatened with war two weeks ago they kept bombing isis to now they've got strategic
[3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:05.920]  bombers bombing isis we're not for war but isis is bad our government put them in charge
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:09.280]  we now have a moral responsibility to let the russians take them out that's right and when i
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:14.320]  look at people who just before the election npr went into north carolina where i lived and so i
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:18.560]  got my attention i was i was flipping through the channels and i heard the places where i lived and
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:23.120]  they talked to these christians who said well normally we vote the republicans because uh you
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:29.520]  know we we're concerned about abortion but my husband is a lawyer for foreign companies establishing
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:33.280]  copyrights here in this country so we're kind of looking at hillary clinton because we don't like
[3:18:33.280 --> 3:18:38.000]  what donald trump is doing exactly tpp yeah so exactly they wanted tpp so looking at a way to
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:42.160]  rationalize and they said well i think being pro-life means that you help these refugees and
[3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:46.880]  i just was screaming at the radio who created the refugees who well that was some change agent
[3:18:46.880 --> 3:18:50.560]  that's all uh exactly uh briefly we're gonna skip this break go to your phone calls i'm gonna punch
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:18:56.000]  you out here and go to some meetings we have a lost leader special in info wars 995 trump
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:19:01.200]  was my president shirt it's about to sell out info wars dot com legalized freedom on the back

[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:13.440]  just more pills but actually a stronger formulation brain force plus is now here i'm really good i mean
[3:19:13.440 --> 3:19:20.240]  i'll give myself credit it's actually like staggering it's bizarre it's like is this a simulation
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:24.240]  we're like leading the fight against the new lord or all this but but we do need the funding
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:28.240]  and i'm not good at raising money for a media organization this big we should have 10 times
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:33.200]  the money coming in we don't so i'm just asking you please support us uh support our sponsors
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:38.080]  info wars store dot com info wars life dot com for the sub the supplements or simply call toll
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:44.080]  free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine and just briefly solicitors of science
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:49.440]  has an amazing solar generator i've been talking about uh all the wars we're trying to start and
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:55.200]  what's happening in the cyber warfare solicitors of science is having a moving warehouse sale
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:19:59.280]  here are three reasons you should get one of their perfect power solar generator systems
[3:19:59.280 --> 3:20:02.960]  it's the same one i have top of the line model in my home i've actually about two of them over the
[3:20:02.960 --> 3:20:07.040]  years you know what they can sell them is cheap i guess it's miniaturization cost goes down uh it's
[3:20:07.040 --> 3:20:12.240]  expandable has a wind input and even produces pure sine wave power so you can run medical equipment or
[3:20:12.240 --> 3:20:18.000]  even military grade electronics go to power grid chaos dot com that's power grid chaos dot com
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:25.040]  power grid chaos dot com save 70 off all supplies last power grid chaos dot com and look i want to
[3:20:25.040 --> 3:20:29.120]  pay our crew because it takes stress off them to pay more so they can take care of their families
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:35.920]  and what they're doing i want to be able to hire more people i literally don't want a bigger house
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:42.400]  i don't want to fancy your car um i i i everything is about a war with these people and i really want
[3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:48.160]  to beat them and you can see what info wars is done now 126 on the web of all websites bigger than
[3:20:48.160 --> 3:20:54.640]  the new york times online bigger than the bbc and now bbc is all digital we're we're you know we are
[3:20:54.640 --> 3:21:00.640]  devastating them and so all i'm asking you to do is support us and pray for us and spread the word
[3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:05.040]  even if you can't purchase products spread the video spread the articles it's having a giant effect
[3:21:05.040 --> 3:21:11.760]  and i just asked myself if we've already gone out of billions of websites 126 where could we go
[3:21:11.760 --> 3:21:16.880]  david with providence well it's amazing and the time that i've been here four years i've been here
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:21.600]  just to see one metric that i can easily look at and that's the number of people uh that we have
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:26.400]  following you on the youtube channel how that is skyrocketed it's about six times what it was when
[3:21:26.400 --> 3:21:31.760]  i started here it's amazing to see how that is continuing one channel a billion 100 million
[3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:35.440]  viewers maybe yeah but i mean look three years ago they came in they said i haven't got the numbers
[3:21:35.440 --> 3:21:39.680]  there because the vice president changed i'm not bragging but listeners should know this we got a
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:43.360]  call they go the vice president of youtube wants to talk to you and check him out he's like one of
[3:21:43.360 --> 3:21:48.240]  the you know top 20 people youtube or google and he goes yeah you have five billion views we're going
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:52.080]  to send you out to sign non-disclosures i can't get it all at the point is they let me into the
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:56.400]  real google stuff and and and and and some folks even flew to town we looked at they wanted me and
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:21:59.840]  they go listen everybody'll be kicked off though if they don't agree to it you're going to monetize
[3:21:59.840 --> 3:22:03.680]  all this and it'd be a lot of money because you know we were all over and i said well i want to
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:08.000]  keep spreading it and some people will refuse to go under this i don't want to just say my stuff's
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:13.520]  freed everybody and then suddenly claim copyright i said i can't do that they said okay well just at
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:16.800]  least do your channel which is why they kind of let's us learn more on copyright stuff because
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:23.200]  it's all bs before but it was five billion two and a half years ago they had a whole map showing it
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:28.160]  like in a computer algorithm yeah in a 360 deal the stuff they've got is incredible so five billion
[3:22:28.160 --> 3:22:33.760]  two and a half years ago five billion videos watched and so i mean imagine i see that so you
[3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:38.720]  know what what i see is the tip of the iceberg and the metrics that i see i don't typically see
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:44.080]  these metrics on websites and even when i look at something that i can follow like youtube it's not
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:47.680]  a full mix well hey it ain't chop liver over a billion views on our main channel yeah exactly
[3:22:47.680 --> 3:22:51.920]  yeah and paul watson's got 300 million views and you know you had just our channels together it's
[3:22:51.920 --> 3:22:57.360]  two billion views but imagine imagine if two years ago two and a half years ago we were five
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:23:02.880]  billion what is it now see we don't get all that that supervision of google and all that but notice
[3:23:04.160 --> 3:23:08.320]  facebook now zuckerberg i'm not crediting him it's just true he came on said look we're not
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:13.120]  just going to ban fake news it's not that simple because he realizes most his traffic is the
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:18.880]  patriots it's like we've seen you so dominate where you're the entire organic system they can't
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:24.960]  cut you out because you are the system yeah yeah thanks that makes sense yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
[3:23:24.960 --> 3:23:28.640]  gonna cut their nose off despite their face and that's what they're doing with twitter when they do
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:34.640]  this censorship and we see james wood saying well that's it then i'm gone and so he basically just
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:38.080]  pulled out said he's boycott all right i'm gonna hand this over to you we got this big sandy hood
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:41.760]  piece coming up calls everything else day but night are you glad you moved down here for
[3:23:41.760 --> 3:23:45.600]  north carolina three or four years ago it's been amazing i really wanted to make a difference and
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:49.360]  i think this election cycle i feel like we really have made a difference for sure and look selling
[3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:53.280]  your house and businesses you're a successful guy was a hassle and a few years into your kind of
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:23:58.320]  like any but didn't all pay off yes yes and not in money i mean it paid off and look at this oh yeah
[3:23:58.320 --> 3:24:02.960]  yeah you know alex i worked for the longest time you're trying to make things happen in north carolina
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:06.800]  with a libertarian party or the it's like this just isn't working it's not it's not happening so i quit
[3:24:06.800 --> 3:24:12.000]  with that this is where it's happening you made a bigger difference one individual getting out there
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.120]  and educating people because that's what the libertarian party has been doing most they don't
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:19.520]  really want to be politicians they don't want to control other people's lives but they want people
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:24.080]  to wake up they want people to take responsibility for themselves but you were able to do that
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:29.280]  in this platform and really have a major effect especially in this election but over the last
[3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:34.320]  20 years even before this election you had a major major effect but i mean i keep explaining
[3:24:34.320 --> 3:24:38.480]  i'm just genuine i mean i really believe what i'm saying people connect to that but it's the
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:44.160]  viewers i'm just a little focal point yeah that happened to actually pop up it's a mirror of all
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:50.400]  them it's like the sun i'm a mirror they're the sun they're the power it's like i could you know
[3:24:50.400 --> 3:24:55.280]  they're the ones of every race color and creed it's very humbling you know it's very humbling
[3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:59.280]  to have all these glowing wonderful people they could be hispanic black white doesn't matter
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:03.120]  they all have this glow in their eyes they're alive they're good people it's like i get tears
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:07.440]  of mine last night i took family at the steakhouse and this family came over they had a down syndrome
[3:25:07.440 --> 3:25:10.960]  daughter and their son everything and they were just they were so proud of me and i was
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:16.000]  and i was so humbled by the life in their eyes the humanity i was like i'll die for these people
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:23.680]  yeah absolutely well you know we uh we started talking about it religious perspective and i've
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:28.720]  had missionaries who would who would go to difficult countries and they would say i'm
[3:25:28.720 --> 3:25:32.080]  i'm gonna go there because god's working there i can see things happening there so you just go
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:37.520]  where god's working and and you know that's it is god is now working in america yeah that's right
[3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:42.160]  it's a big deal yeah appreciate it thank you alex well you know when we look at what's
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:49.600]  happening with these pics i am i'm really happy with this uh uh pic of uh flinn also with sessions
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:55.600]  i'm concerned about bolton and i would i like to throw something out to uh donald trump if he's
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:01.520]  listening or anybody uh is paying attention as we look at this you know he's uh put in flinn as a
[3:26:02.640 --> 3:26:07.280]  in an intelligence position how about william benny or thomas drake or somebody like that to
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:12.960]  replace lion james clapper okay because he's leaving uh james clapper is leaving we gotta
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:18.400]  have somebody who is d and i remember that the d and i where james clapper is that's the guy who's
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:23.760]  head over the nsa over the cia over all the military divisions of intelligence homeland
[3:26:23.760 --> 3:26:29.920]  security 16 organizations the d and i is head over remember james clapper was the guy that was
[3:26:29.920 --> 3:26:35.040]  asked just before the snowden lakes he was asked by senator ron widen he said are you listening
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:39.760]  to americans you know because we had this big thing back in the 1970s the church commission
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:46.560]  we had the pike commission uh they told people that the nsa and the fbi the cia were illegally
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:51.440]  monitoring americans instead of foreign intelligence services and so they had this thing called the
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:58.480]  fisa the fisa act okay that was supposed to keep that under control and instead what they did was
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:04.640]  they used that as a tool as a technique they inverted it they perverted it and they used it as a way
[3:27:04.640 --> 3:27:11.200]  to get a search warrant on mr mrs verizon as ran paul pointed out okay so we've had this situation
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:18.080]  and it began with james clapper he started in his intelligence service as that thing was starting
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.920]  and now he's coming out where they have first been shut down by the exposure of illegal activity
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:29.440]  then they took it over and they made it a tool and that's what he's leaving us with this guy who
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:34.960]  lied to the face of senator widen and you could see when he asked him that question he kind of
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:41.040]  looks down i mean you talk about obvious body language okay you don't have to be uh a uh a
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:45.520]  mentalist to uh to take a look at that read that body language you know what he was saying everybody
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:49.200]  knew he was lying he goes out we knew they were listening but you could just watch him as he was
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:53.440]  lying and then it was just a couple of months later that we got the documents from ed snowden
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:57.360]  and so i think it's very important i think it would be great to have somebody that has
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:02.960]  as in the integrity of william benny who has the love of the constitution and the rule of law
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:07.840]  so that's what we're seeing with jeff sessions we're replacing somebody like loretta lynch
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:14.080]  who had absolute contempt for the legal system who had absolute contempt for the idea that there
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:20.080]  would be a a standard of justice for everyone no loretta lynch and james comey think there
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:24.560]  should be one standard for the people at top who are friends with them and a different standard
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:27.760]  for the rest of you remember james comey said she committed all these felonies but don't you try
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:33.120]  this at home no we need to have somebody like jeff sessions i think who is going to be an honest
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:39.760]  person amazing turnaround to see jeff sessions there but let's also uh take a look at uh some of
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:45.520]  these people that whose names are being floated out there uh secretary of state romney john bolton
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:50.480]  seriously i mean it is john bolton's name being floated out there by people who like john bolton
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:54.080]  remember roger stone said uh you can take with a grain of salt a lot of these names that are
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:58.240]  going to be thrown out there because it's going to be people who are promoting this individual
[3:28:58.240 --> 3:29:02.880]  that individual who gets people to promote him that way uh maybe that's the case hopefully that's
[3:29:02.880 --> 3:29:09.280]  the case with john bolton and maybe uh as as bad as mit romney is maybe what they're trying to do
[3:29:09.280 --> 3:29:13.760]  is make him look better if if uh trump is going to do a political appointment i hope he doesn't
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:20.000]  i hope he doesn't do a political appointment like uh obama put in hillary clinton or john
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:24.160]  carrey as secretary of state no it'd be great if we had somebody who was competent instead of just a
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:31.280]  political appointee and i want when we come back we're going to play alex jones's uh reply to a
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:36.480]  daughter of sandy hook one of the sandy hook victims who says that uh trump must disavow alex
[3:29:36.480 --> 3:29:40.480]  jones alex jones will have his reply right after the break stay with us you're going to want to hear

[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:31.840]  this message is not for the fake news media the corporate news media that got caught lying to us
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:37.680]  with hundreds of fake polls during the election lying about hillary being invincible the same
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:44.320]  folks that got caught doing fake news broadcast the same people that got caught with fake guests
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:50.000]  and interviewing their own reporters the same people that got caught giving hillary the debate
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:54.880]  questions beforehand repeatedly this is not a message for them they're always going to lie
[3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:59.840]  it's what they do they're paid to do it it's why they have almost no audience but i do want to
[3:33:59.840 --> 3:34:06.720]  reach out to the victims of criminal crime out there whether it be a baseball bat a car a gun a
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:14.000]  knife i want to reach out to my listeners as well and just clarify where i stand on the reported
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:21.520]  tragedy at sandy hook that took place at that elementary school for the last three or four
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:26.800]  years it's been mainstream media's number one attack against me to say that i said that there
[3:34:26.800 --> 3:34:32.800]  was never anyone that actually died there i've hosted debates between both sides and i've been
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:37.680]  criticized by both sides people that say that no one died there and people that say that the official
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:43.680]  story is exactly as we've been told and i've always said that i'm not sure about what really
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:49.120]  happened but there's a lot of anomalies and there has been a cover-up of whatever did happen there
[3:34:49.120 --> 3:34:55.120]  there's a few clips hillary used in her campaign of me out of context saying i can see how people
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:00.240]  that look at all this evidence say no kids died there uh this whole thing's a giant hoax but at
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:07.200]  the same time there is some evidence people died there they take that out of context and misrepresent
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:12.880]  that's why they're the deceptive corporate media but for those that do have an attention span for
[3:35:12.880 --> 3:35:21.040]  say 10 minutes or so i will present to you the questions and i'm gonna be quite frank i don't
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:26.080]  know what really happened i know there are real mass shootings i know people lose children i'm a
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:33.200]  father it hurts my heart so i don't know what the truth is all i know is the official story of
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:41.120]  sandy hook has more holes in it than swiss cheese there has been a uh a shooting instead of some
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:47.760]  nature at sandy hook elementary school there's federal agents say they recovered two high-powered
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:54.160]  pistols from the scene and a semi-automatic rifle called a bush master they say now that uh there
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:36:02.240]  were actually four handguns recovered inside the school not just two as we were initially told uh
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:06.880]  all the ones that i know of at this point were crushed by the uh the long walk with a long weapon
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:12.400]  so the rifle was the primary weapon yes it's believed at this hour and it's been confirmed
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:17.680]  to abc news by state police there in connecticut that two shooters were initially believed involved
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:22.320]  in the mass shooting one of those shooters now dead they did walk a guy out of the woods i saw him
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:28.080]  walk a guy earlier with handcuffs he walked by us and said he didn't do it it was a grown man a grown
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:32.880]  man yeah he's sitting in the front of the police car over there now how was he dressed uh camo pants
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:38.080]  with a dark jacket well they have they have an individual in custody who they're talking to and
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:42.560]  i am told they are looking at this person as possibly a second shooter now that changes the
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:50.800]  dynamic here a little bit they had their entire lives ahead of them birthdays graduations weddings
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:37:00.640]  kids of their own i mean he's a worse actor than glenn beck with glenn beck's fate crying okay i mean
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:04.800]  this is disgusting okay
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:21.120]  my name is robbie parker one thing that's uh becoming somewhat of a concern and that is
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:28.960]  misinformation that's being posted on social media sites these issues are crimes they will be
[3:37:28.960 --> 3:37:36.080]  investigated statewide and federally and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:40.640]  this information are identified board members these are your children and you wouldn't let
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:47.760]  paramedics and EMTs into the building you've got 27 children declared dead within eight minutes
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:53.840]  who does this who is so great at that job i don't know if they staged this one but the same familiar
[3:37:53.840 --> 3:38:02.400]  telltale signs are now coming out now to be clear corporate media was to misrepresent what i've said
[3:38:02.400 --> 3:38:09.200]  so this is not for them i'm gonna do my best to lay out my questions here i've got more than 20
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:16.560]  news articles and video clips to go over number one the day before this tragic event happened
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:23.280]  an email was sent out by bloomberg's anti-gun group saying prepare for a big event but the biggest
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:28.960]  piece of evidence the smoking gun if you would of a cover-up of whatever really happened is the
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:36.640]  way back machine the internet archive we see sandy hooks newtown website k through 12 having zero
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:45.440]  traffic 2008 9 10 11 12 and then all of a sudden it just explodes it's impossible to have zero
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:55.040]  traffic to a k through 12 entire school system and the word is that school system was shut down
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:03.680]  for those years that's what the records show but they tell us it was open i don't know the
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:09.920]  moon landings were faked but i don't put anything past these anti-gunners and early on that day we
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:15.680]  watched footage of kids going in circles in and out of the building you'd be running them away from
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:22.240]  the building emergency helicopters weren't called instead porta-potties were prepared for the press
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:28.560]  within hours of the event i saw the helicopters that did respond the police helicopters saying
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:34.640]  that there were men or a man in the woods in camouflage the media later said that was a
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:40.400]  conspiracy theory so early on i'm like well i saw local news of the guy in the woods and they took
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:44.960]  him in custody now they're saying it never happened so that shows there's some of a cover-up happening
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:51.680]  and then i saw anderson cooper i've been in tv for 27 years i know a blue screen or a green screen
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:58.960]  turn and his nose disappear then i saw clearly that they were using footage on the green screen
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:04.560]  looped because it would show flowers and other things during other broadcasts that were moving
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:12.880]  and then basically cutting to the same piece of footage then i saw cnn do faked satellite interviews
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:19.280]  with reporters clearly with the same traffic and the same cars right behind them conducting the
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:25.680]  interview face to face then we see footage of one of the reported fathers of the victims robbie
[3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:32.240]  parker doing classic acting training where he's laughing and joking and they say hey we're live
[3:40:32.240 --> 3:40:40.400]  and he goes oh and maybe that's real i'm sure it is and they're getting ready to make fun to come
[3:40:40.400 --> 3:40:56.720]  to the microphone so we'll listen to her okay my name is robbie parker
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:05.280]  my family is one of the families that lost a child yesterday in the fanny
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:10.960]  but you added to all the other things that were happening
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:18.800]  and all the other fake news the media has been caught in and cnn back in 1991
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:25.040]  openly faking scud missile attacks on saudi arabia and israel when they were back in
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:31.600]  Atlanta and the satellite feeds caught them admitting that it was all fake we'd be crazy
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:36.320]  not to question this because bare minimum they were faking some of the shots and some of the
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:40.400]  coverage specific given these restrictions but within those parameters what did you see well
[3:41:40.400 --> 3:41:45.840]  what i saw i didn't see anything here i look very almost straight up all this there's a vapor
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:51.040]  trail coming from my right to my left and there's a cloud of something it looks like it might have
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:42:11.120]  been an explosion of cloud so to be clear we point out clear chroma key also known as blue
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:16.160]  screen or green screen being used and we're demonized we point out they're clearly doing fake
[3:42:16.160 --> 3:42:22.640]  interviews we point out that normal emergency procedures weren't followed and their answer
[3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:29.760]  is to say that we said nobody died and ladies and gentlemen the questions i asked are not offensive
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:35.120]  to any parent who lost a child that day they're not offensive to the connecticut state police
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:42.240]  they're not offensive to anyone there's such simple questions why no trauma helicopters
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:48.320]  why would you not let paramedics board members these are your children and you wouldn't let
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:55.440]  paramedics and EMTs into the building you got 27 children declared dead within eight minutes
[3:42:55.440 --> 3:43:01.280]  who does this who is so great at that job columbine happened in the 1990s when there were
[3:43:01.280 --> 3:43:07.280]  less surveillance cameras and we got play by play blow by blow we got the surveillance footage all
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:13.040]  released they sealed the surveillance footage they sealed the death certificates they sealed
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:19.200]  everything in connecticut like it was more secret than the manhattan project this has never been
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:24.800]  done in any other case look at the headlines privacy versus transparency connecticut bans
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:30.800]  access to many homicide records post newtown school shooting expert threatened over sandy hook
[3:43:30.800 --> 3:43:36.480]  investigation feds came to his house you name it said you better drop it newtown destroys suspected
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:42.880]  sandy hook shooter's home turns out he got the gun illegally from his mother and didn't buy it
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:48.720]  illegal in the open market but the media still lies and says he did and filed a lawsuit against
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:55.760]  bushmaster then we have the bank burning down adam lands his home so no one could buy it and
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:01.280]  investigate it they didn't just burn down adam lands his home to get rid of it they didn't just
[3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:06.720]  seal all the records no no no when they demolished the school they made everybody that was part of it
[3:44:07.680 --> 3:44:14.960]  signed nondisclosures and then this agatha christie who done it gets even weirder rob do's uncle
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:23.120]  respected fbi agent that runs his own big security firm john do rob do's uncle is at the foyer meeting
[3:44:23.120 --> 3:44:30.400]  that our reporters at and tells our reporter he's never seen anything like this before concerning
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:35.360]  the cover up all these bureaucracies have paper trails and it just doesn't add up and that's what
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:39.600]  my uncle said yeah tell us everything he said he said so i said what did you think he said well i've
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:44.800]  never sat in a court proceeding like this ever in my life i said what do you mean he goes well
[3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:50.880]  he goes here's you got this small town the biggest event in their history by far and nobody knows
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:55.280]  nothing nobody remembers anything and there's no paperwork for anything no i just don't understand
[3:44:55.280 --> 3:45:01.600]  how this is going on in this small town and what do you mean he goes well he goes even he goes
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:07.200]  even when we were you know going after the mob he goes got it they would remember well god he
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:11.040]  he didn't say god but i remember back in the day my dad taught he was you know working on so it was
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:14.880]  god yeah well one of the guys it was there was a lot of different mobsters they were going after
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:21.200]  back in the 80s and and 90s i guess he retired sometime in the 90s um but he said you know we
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:26.480]  never had a case where nobody knew nothing you know he said i just couldn't understand it how in
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:30.160]  this small town nobody knows anything the school board guy doesn't know anything the maintenance
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:34.800]  guy doesn't know anything uh the head select woman doesn't know anything the stuff is being
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:39.840]  delivered and nobody knows how i got there so this town's mascot is sergeant schultz essentially yeah
[3:45:40.880 --> 3:45:45.680]  you know you learn a lot over the years running a major media operation like him full wars and
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:51.760]  one thing i've discovered is that when msm attacks you on something a lot of times it's because it's
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:56.800]  your strongest information and they want to discourage you from covering it they want to
[3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:00.480]  make you think that you're discredited because you're talking about it it's kind of like saying
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:04.960]  oh you're all discredited because you're for trump he's gonna lose by 20 points everybody knows he's
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:10.320]  a loser even though internal polls showed him losing and it's the same thing with a sandy hook
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:15.440]  i've moved on from this story but they're always attacking saying i'm going after family members
[3:46:15.440 --> 3:46:25.120]  of victims this is a tragedy i wish it never would have happened but quite frankly i wish that
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:30.880]  the official story was true because that's a lot less scary than them staging something like this
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:36.160]  but when you think about how they stage wmd's to kill over a million iraqis you think about all
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:40.880]  the other hoaxes all the other lies all the other rigging and the way they're freaking out about it
[3:46:40.880 --> 3:46:45.680]  trying to cover up every level of it it just makes me ask what really happened there because
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:50.400]  i've hosted debates as i said and said that i don't know what really happened
[3:46:51.520 --> 3:46:57.680]  when i sit there and read quotes of other people saying they believe it staged the media knows full
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:04.000]  well they take that out of context and have me definitively saying it when i've always said i don't
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:11.280]  know what happened there but it needs to be looked into and why should anybody fear an investigation
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:16.080]  if they have nothing to hide in fact isn't that in shakespeare's hamlet me thinks you
[3:47:16.720 --> 3:47:23.200]  protest too much so here is my statement for the media when they call up saying where do you stand
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:30.720]  on this where i've always stood when there were other mass shootings i would simply point out that
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:34.400]  they're very rare statistically and why should we all give up our rights because some other bad
[3:47:34.400 --> 3:47:40.880]  person does something a guy with a car runs over 50 people do we ban driving cars it's the same thing
[3:47:40.880 --> 3:47:45.840]  and there have been other instances of shootings that are very suspicious aurora is one just look
[3:47:45.840 --> 3:47:53.760]  into that but this particular case they are so scared of investigation so everything they do
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:58.160]  basically ends up blowing up in their face so you guys are gonna get what you want now i'm gonna
[3:47:58.160 --> 3:48:03.200]  start reinvestigating sandy hook everything else that happened with it i'm out on the show signing
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:07.600]  off rimfullwars.com if you're watching this transmission think for yourself i know it's a
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:17.440]  thought crime and then ask yourself what is it so strange about sandy hook and that tragedy but i
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:22.320]  will say this finally uh my heart does go out to all parents that lose children whether it's
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:27.680]  stabbings or whether it's to car wrecks or whether it's to stranglings or whether it's to blunt force
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:34.080]  trauma or murder uh firearms whatever the case is i'm a parent and my heart goes out to all parents
[3:48:34.080 --> 3:48:40.160]  that have lost children uh in these tragic events and so if children were lost in sandy hook
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:47.200]  my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents and the people that say they're parents
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:54.720]  that i see on the news the only problem is i've watched a lot of soap operas and i've seen actors
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:48:58.560]  before and i know what i'm watching the movie i don't want to watch something real
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:02.960]  let's look at the sandy hook
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:14.080]  all right and that's elix jones's response to a call for trump to distance himself from elix
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:18.960]  jones because we question the events the official story that's sandy hook and you know that's the
[3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:25.520]  whole thing going back to the jfk assassination the cia or rather the fbi uh actually is cia
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:30.320]  that came up with a conspiracy theory because if you didn't believe in the magic bullet theory
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:37.040]  if you thought that there was more than just one shooter operating a bolt uh a bolt action rifle
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:42.800]  you know you were conspiracy theorist it's a gas lighting tactic and we have to understand
[3:49:42.800 --> 3:49:47.600]  one of the things that we're about here at info wars and we're not going to back away from this
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:54.000]  even if it's something that hurts us you know alex took a lot of flak still does for pointing out
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:50:00.720]  the inconsistency is the lies of 9 11 we had three steel buildings that fell down never happened
[3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:04.880]  before since and only two of them were even hit by a plane isn't that interesting and of course
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:09.280]  you've got the guy who owned the third one saying pull it down but and we got witnesses saying yeah
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:14.400]  we heard explosions and so forth no don't look anymore at that just move away and if you do
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:18.320]  we're going to ridicule you we're going to call you a conspiracy theorist or now the new
[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:23.280]  gas lighting term is going to be fake news hoax news no we're going to look at this and when we

[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:33.680]  and we're going to ask questions and we're going to expect some reasonable explanations and if we
[3:50:33.680 --> 3:50:38.640]  don't get them then it becomes even more suspicious you know the guy that was in there wolfgang halbig
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:42.080]  he was there because he had been a law enforcement officer he'd also been a school
[3:50:42.080 --> 3:50:46.480]  administrator and then he combined those two to investigate school shootings like columbine
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:50.400]  that's what he did for a living had never seen anything like that before just like rob do's

[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:39.680]  prescient this was because now we've got the protesters out there saying trump is not my

[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:21.680]  report that came out on the dredge report it was intercept he picked it up i think it was
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:26.480]  wednesday night talking about how they discovered this kind of dark skyscraper in the center of
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:29.760]  new york city well you know we had the same sort of thing very close to where i lived in north
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:35.680]  carolina i'm going to tell you about that on info wars prime app the connection between these two
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:40.960]  at and t facilities and uh so i've got things like that that i'm going to be talking about and

[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:50.160]  app and it is half off right now as we roll that out now the time we've got left real quickly
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:54.720]  we're looking at the way that they're pushing back against these appointments and i as i've said
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:56:59.600]  before i have the utmost respect for senator sessions he's the only senator had the integrity
[3:56:59.600 --> 3:57:06.560]  to look at this sweeping trade treaty called tpp or ttip he took the time to read it nobody
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:11.440]  else did and not only that but he was so outraged by what he saw in terms of loss of sovereignty
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:18.400]  that our economy would be managed by a committee that was appointed by these multinational corporations
[3:57:18.400 --> 3:57:23.680]  that had secretly written this treaty uh they would decide and uh who was going to be in the
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:28.160]  treaty they could add china later on it wasn't against it wasn't a balance against china they
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:32.800]  would also be able to decide which countries would rise and fall which industries would rise and fall
[3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:38.960]  it's a total loss of sovereignty there were so many things and he created a massive presentation
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:42.800]  that he gave to the senate nobody cared on the senate so he goes in he's the only one who reads
[3:57:42.800 --> 3:57:46.560]  it and he says hey guys you got to see this nobody would listen to him but donald trump
[3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:52.800]  you know senator sessions never endorsed anybody before donald trump he endorsed donald trump
[3:57:52.800 --> 3:57:56.880]  and he explained to donald trump the true issues behind that the constitutional issues behind it
[3:57:56.880 --> 3:58:01.520]  and so when they come out and say well you know this guy is a racist attacking him like
[3:58:01.520 --> 3:58:05.280]  they do bright bart and you've got this woman saying well you know there were some allegations
[3:58:05.280 --> 3:58:11.440]  about a couple of things that he said 30 years ago so he's a racist and it's like really allegations
[3:58:11.440 --> 3:58:17.440]  she said there's no statute of limitations on racism and i heard that and i thought oh so there
[3:58:17.440 --> 3:58:23.360]  wasn't any statute of limitations on uh robert bird were there okay the kukleks clan guy that
[3:58:23.360 --> 3:58:30.080]  hill ran bill loved okay this is a guy who was an exalted cyclops a founder of the kukleks clan
[3:58:30.080 --> 3:58:35.760]  branches but the democrats had no problem with that guy these are some minor allegations compared
[3:58:35.760 --> 3:58:39.920]  to that and they're just allegations unproven thanks for joining us join us tonight seven central
