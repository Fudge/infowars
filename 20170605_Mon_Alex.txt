[00:00.000 --> 00:14.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday. Get ready for a huge transmission. But first, a powerful
[00:14.600 --> 00:19.040]  report by John Bowne on how sick the left is dealing with the London Bridge attack.
[00:19.040 --> 00:25.640]  The latest issue of the Islamic State's weekly newspaper, Al-Naba, released two days ago
[00:25.640 --> 00:31.520]  warned that another terrorist attack in Britain was definitely coming. Al-Naba, a 16-page
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.720]  colour newsletters, distributed within ISIS territory, but it is also posted and distributed
[00:37.720 --> 00:44.120]  online via the usual ISIS mediums such as Telegram and Social Media, this according
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.680]  to PJ Media. England's Prime Minister Theresa May has responded to the online availability
[00:50.680 --> 00:57.480]  of ISIS threats. We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed, yet that
[00:57.480 --> 01:03.080]  is precisely what the internet and the big companies that provide internet-based services
[01:03.080 --> 01:09.960]  provide. We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements
[01:09.960 --> 01:16.800]  that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning. And we
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.800]  need to do everything we can at home to reduce the risks of extremism online. While the Mayor
[01:22.800 --> 01:28.640]  of London called for people to not be alarmed that innocent people were being mowed over
[01:28.640 --> 01:33.760]  and stabbed by Islamic terrorists in the heart of London. Just like terrorists are constantly
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.520]  evolving, finding new ways to disrupt us, harm us, attack us, the police and experts
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.000]  and all of us are finding new ways to keep us safe. Londoners will see an increased police
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.640]  presence today and over the course of the next few days, no reason to be alarmed. Clearly
[01:50.640 --> 01:56.520]  there is reason to be alarmed. Apparently, even with a warning, there is just so much
[01:56.520 --> 02:02.840]  UK police can safeguard against while the general public remains defenseless. The terror attack
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.480]  began on London Bridge around 10 p.m. as tourists and pedestrians stopped to take photos of
[02:08.480 --> 02:13.400]  the scenic landscape. Out of nowhere, a van reaching speeds of 50 miles per hour plowed
[02:13.400 --> 02:19.280]  through the bystanders, killing seven and wounding over 45. The three attackers wearing
[02:19.280 --> 02:24.480]  fake suicide belts then continued to burrow market where they got out of the van and began
[02:24.480 --> 02:31.400]  stabbing people. The terrorists were confronted and shot by armed officers within eight minutes
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.080]  of the police receiving the first emergency call. Eyewitnesses reported hearing the attackers
[02:37.080 --> 02:44.360]  say this is for Allah. Regardless, mainstream media dragged its feet on labeling it as terrorism.
[02:44.360 --> 02:50.200]  As the gruesome details unfolded, President Trump tweeted, We need to be smart, vigilant
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.440]  and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban as an extra
[02:56.440 --> 03:03.840]  level of safety. The response from the left was predictable. CNN host Reza Aslan tweeted,
[03:03.840 --> 03:09.520]  This piece of s*** is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency.
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.880]  He's an embarrassment to humankind and a group of Muslims in a bizarre show of solidarity
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.720]  prayed in front of Trump Tower. We are here in front of the Trump Tower, which is just
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.440]  really a symbol of the kind of policies and the divisiveness and the hatred that we have
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.000]  seen come out of this administration that has really led to divisiveness of our communities
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.600]  or to divide our communities. And here we're showing this is what New York City looks like,
[03:34.600 --> 03:39.440]  people, black people, brown people, progressive Jews and progressive white allies. We have
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.320]  come here to say, we will break bread with you, we will stand in solidarity, we will
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.440]  embrace you and we will stand with you against hate and divisiveness. No, it's not the fact
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.560]  that there's no real response from any Islamic leaders while innocent people are killed and
[03:53.560 --> 03:58.520]  maimed on a regular basis. No, that wouldn't have anything to do with divisiveness. It's
[03:58.520 --> 04:03.280]  our president that's responsible. That's right. Our president calls for the protection
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.520]  of U.S. citizens from the possibility of events spiraling out of control as they are in the
[04:08.520 --> 04:16.120]  U.K. And the left wants to rub tolerance in our faces. I don't think that a major terrorist
[04:16.120 --> 04:23.520]  attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who's trying to organize
[04:23.520 --> 04:30.400]  his city's response to this attack. The terrorists want us to live in a state of constant fear.
[04:30.400 --> 04:37.000]  Why does the left have the power to condone the deaths of innocent people in what is clearly
[04:37.000 --> 04:44.220]  Islamic jihad shielded by an ongoing tacky under the umbrella of the left's misguided
[04:44.220 --> 04:54.000]  and dangerous political correctness? John Bown for infowords.com. Ladies and gentlemen,
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.880]  CNN admits they were producing fake news. Now they're spinning it, but this is big. We'll
[04:58.880 --> 05:05.800]  show you the video straight ahead. Well, folks, it seems like life on the D list, our decapitation
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.840]  list isn't what it's all cracked up to be. You've seen the now infamous images of comedian
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.440]  Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head of Donald Trump, and you see the endless news
[05:15.440 --> 05:20.400]  stories of her apologizing, her being called out by the left and right, and losing some
[05:20.400 --> 05:25.000]  of her lucrative paying gigs. That's right. Kathy Griffin's gonna hold a press conference
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.520]  to complain about bullying from the Trump family. She should be lucky people are even
[05:29.520 --> 05:35.800]  talking about her. And now we see the true response of the liberals. I'm a victim. During
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.920]  this press conference, they're also going to announce her true motivation behind the
[05:39.920 --> 05:43.800]  photo shoot. Well, it doesn't really matter what your motivation was, Kathy. That's a
[05:43.800 --> 05:48.040]  mute point at this time. Please, for the sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back
[05:48.040 --> 05:52.160]  into your she lob layer, and just be happy that tweets are the only thing coming your
[05:52.160 --> 05:57.520]  way. Rob Dew reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news and ask yourself, what

[08:26.760 --> 08:33.920]  We're on the march. The globalist empire is on the run. Thank you for joining us ladies
[08:33.920 --> 08:41.520]  and gentlemen on this live Monday the fifth day of June 2017. We're going to be live here
[08:41.520 --> 08:48.720]  for the next four hours. Let me tell you who's coming up. Mike Cernovich and of course Mark
[08:48.720 --> 09:01.640]  Antrobe who broke the incredible video of CNN staging news events in London in the aftermath
[09:01.640 --> 09:09.280]  of the latest weekly terror attack there on London Bridge. And of course one of our crew
[09:09.280 --> 09:16.680]  has worked at CNN. He obviously had non disclosures that can't get into that. But when he worked
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.800]  at CNN they told you specifically do not do this. This is seriously unethical. Anybody
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.400]  taught journalism school knows this. If you're covering live events or whatever you don't
[09:28.400 --> 09:34.200]  stage people. Now CNN got caught. They're spinning it. It's all over the news. We first
[09:34.200 --> 09:40.400]  Cernovich pushed it out yesterday. It went viral. We broke it basically at four o'clock
[09:40.400 --> 09:46.360]  yesterday. It went mega viral. Today it's Fox News. You name it. CNN has responded saying
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.200]  well we were out there as news but yes then we saw a demonstration nearby and had them
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.200]  then come with the police and stand in front of the cameras with their signs. We have the
[09:56.200 --> 10:00.680]  footage. They're handing out the signs to them. They're clearly directing them. A lot
[10:00.680 --> 10:06.480]  of these people don't even look like they're really Muslims. The beards look fake and CNN
[10:06.480 --> 10:12.200]  has been caught before staging Gulf War scud chemical attack. That's admitted. They've
[10:12.200 --> 10:20.000]  been caught using green screens. CNN caught staging protests. It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.840]  It's also on Infowars.com. So they've been caught doing this over and over and over
[10:25.840 --> 10:38.320]  again. CNN caught staging fake news scene. Infowars.com, Mike Cernovich. So the whole
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.880]  facade covering up global government, covering up how the mainstream media is totally fake
[10:42.880 --> 10:51.840]  is falling down. CNN has done this over and over again. It happened with Nancy Grace when
[10:51.840 --> 10:59.680]  she was out at the Newtown Connecticut school shooting where she's sitting there supposedly
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.840]  talking to somebody on satellite and you can see the same cars are driving in circles on
[11:04.840 --> 11:10.600]  a cul-de-sac and the same engine noises everything. They're right there. There's footage of Cooper
[11:10.600 --> 11:17.880]  with his nose disappearing but it's worse than that. They've got blue screen because
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.600]  you can see they only took like a two minute clip or something. So you see flowers moving
[11:21.600 --> 11:28.440]  one way at a memorial and all of a sudden they again are moving the other because the
[11:28.440 --> 11:33.400]  wind's not constant. So you've got a loop where the wind's blowing and then it ends
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.480]  because there's not a lot of wind and the flowers are dead still. So they're waving
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.680]  suddenly they all stop and you can see it's an edit. Now I don't know what happened at
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.440]  Newtown. I believe school shootings happen. I believe kids get killed. It's terrible.
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.200]  It's horrible. We've had debates where we've looked at both sides. It doesn't matter what
[11:51.200 --> 11:57.960]  we're telling you is CNN is famous for faking stuff. That's coming up at the bottom of the
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.640]  hour. Megan Kelly is going to be here tomorrow and I've decided to do the interview. I've
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.320]  kind of got a little bit cold feet a few times. It's exhausting. They're going to be here
[12:07.320 --> 12:13.560]  at nine in the morning till 10 at night. They want to interview me at 8.30 at night at some
[12:13.560 --> 12:20.480]  house they've rented and I'm going to be exhausted and I know what they're doing. Everybody
[12:20.480 --> 12:27.720]  knows I go to bed at 9 o'clock. It's well known and I'm not and so I'm just I'm just
[12:27.720 --> 12:33.480]  going to do it and it should be interesting. She interviewed Putin. She told me a few weeks
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.520]  ago that her next big interview was Putin. She was going to leave to Russia. She did
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.480]  leave to Russia. She got the interview and she told me I was her next interview and then
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.480]  of course Trump's the next one after that I guess. She told me that Trump and her worked
[12:47.480 --> 12:53.080]  it all out. But I'm going to stop right there. I've talked to her about 45 minutes and she
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.840]  came off very, very nice, very, very flattering, very, very genuine sounding. But I just told
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.640]  myself this is the Megan Kelly that took a clip of me talking about Hillary being behind
[13:03.640 --> 13:07.240]  the Jihadis and Libyans sharia killing hundreds of thousands of people including tens of thousands
[13:07.240 --> 13:11.280]  of children who were raped and murdered many cases and saying she's directly responsible
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.920]  for the murder and torture and rape of children and they played it on Fox News with her saying
[13:16.920 --> 13:24.880]  I said that Hillary did it in some basement. When it was the front and the back of the
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.640]  clip were cut off. We've played it here just like they played in my custody battle Joe
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.520]  Rogan when we say we don't agree with Trump saying you know women jump on you can grab
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.120]  them. But it's not rape. It's just uncouth and not gentlemanly. If a woman is approaching
[13:41.120 --> 13:48.200]  and coming on to you, then it's not rape. So he's in the bushes running out grabbing
[13:48.200 --> 13:56.080]  on a woman's genitals that sexual assault that was edited. It was played. The news media
[13:56.080 --> 14:07.280]  picked it up. Incredible. Incredible. And I'm going to leave it at that. At this point
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.600]  down the road I'll be able to get more into this and more of what went on there because
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.120]  it's very important and very, very important that people know what the end result of that
[14:17.120 --> 14:24.240]  was. And that the many people on the jury have signed affidavits about the effect that
[14:24.240 --> 14:32.440]  had on them and the fact that they believe they were deceived. One quote was it's like
[14:32.440 --> 14:39.720]  a forced confession. I'm going to stop right there because we've had a good outcome with
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.840]  the court. It's best for the children last Tuesday. And that's why you haven't heard
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.920]  anything about my custody case in the news. I do have liberals come up to me in Austin
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.680]  and say, aha, you lost your kids. I don't even respond. I go, man, you're really a nasty
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.640]  person that you would sit there and say that to me while I'm pumping gas. But that's some
[14:59.640 --> 15:05.560]  victory as if that would be a good thing. And then it's not even true. The ruling didn't
[15:05.560 --> 15:12.080]  even say that. But that's how deceptive the fake news media is. That's how dangerous they
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.440]  are. I mean, just nine years ago, the New York Times famously wrote in a review of a
[15:17.440 --> 15:24.800]  film called the New World Order that was on the Independent Film Channel that was two
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.360]  years off and on following me around. And I'm there at Bilderberg at Chantilly where
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.520]  they just met this weekend for the third time we've covered it. This big five-star conference
[15:35.520 --> 15:45.960]  resort in golf course that's next door, right in the middle of all the big defense contractors.
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.680]  And I'm sitting there and they're following us and there's Marines in plain clothes and
[15:50.680 --> 15:56.880]  helicopters and Secret Service with MP5, H&K, and they said that I was insane and that there
[15:56.880 --> 16:04.980]  was no Bilderberg. Well, how's it feel now? DrudgeReport.com is linked to our story. Press
[16:04.980 --> 16:09.720]  coverage of Bilderberg. Highest ever. Kit Daniels in FullWars.com. Bilderberg, more
[16:09.720 --> 16:18.560]  exposed than ever. As Trump nationalism rises, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of major
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.480]  European newspapers, the BBC, the London Guardian all covered it and it forced. They wouldn't
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.160]  cover it Thursday and Friday, but by the time foreign news covered it and Drudge linked
[16:27.160 --> 16:36.720]  to it, it forced US newspapers to cover it as well. So isn't that interesting? The big
[16:36.720 --> 16:42.520]  shadow corporate government openly having to put out their agenda now, openly meeting
[16:42.520 --> 16:47.400]  20-something miles from Trump plotting how to overthrow him. That's come out. And now
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.440]  it's exposed, just like CNN's been exposed. All it took was one person with a camera
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.360]  to see them out there with a huge dolly and professional lights. That's not news gathering
[16:57.360 --> 17:04.520]  in the daytime of big lights. And then directing with directors, people over into the shot
[17:04.520 --> 17:09.240]  with clearly a director in front of them, getting them all ready and then shooting it.
[17:09.240 --> 17:13.160]  And then you see some of the other CNN people looking at the person filming and looking
[17:13.160 --> 17:19.160]  suspicious. This is 101. They even handed them the self-made little, you know, signs
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.240]  are supposed to be self-made that look like independent people made them and they're all
[17:23.240 --> 17:30.280]  basically cookie-cutters handed out to them. This is unbelievable. With the cops, they're
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.920]  directing them and bringing them into the shot. Oh, look, the Muslims are upset about
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.320]  the terror. They don't criticize Islam. They just say, come together, put up with it, go
[17:38.320 --> 17:42.160]  along, don't be upset, keep the borders open. But since you can't really, you know, get
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.360]  the real Muslims to come out and apologize or come out and say they don't support it,
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.640]  they literally had a guy get out there in a Sama bin Laden look-alike outfit, including
[17:50.640 --> 17:57.760]  the green army jacket, the exact turban and the exact, I mean, they got a Sama bin Laden
[17:57.760 --> 18:05.560]  look-alike out there to say, see, even Osama bin Laden, a look-alike. I mean, it is a literal
[18:05.560 --> 18:16.280]  six foot three, six foot four Osama bin Laden look-alike in green army jacket. I mean, you
[18:16.280 --> 18:24.720]  cannot make this up. With the cops all standing around, I'm like, they're the good guys. Meanwhile,
[18:24.720 --> 18:29.160]  if communists attack me and Cleveland and the police drag me to safety, they put on
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.520]  the news, Jones arrested. And still to this day, they show photos and newspapers of the
[18:33.520 --> 18:38.680]  police with their hands on my arms, you know, supporting me and getting me out of the crowd
[18:38.680 --> 18:46.440]  and go, look, look, you see, he's a criminal. Fake news, fake news, fake news, fake news,
[18:46.440 --> 18:51.240]  fake news, fake news, fake news, then they'll use us doing a correction every six months
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.680]  like, oh, look at him, he's fake news. He did a correction when they have to do corrections
[18:54.680 --> 19:01.080]  every day in newspapers and on television. So CNN has come out, you just type in CNN
[19:01.080 --> 19:06.720]  caught staging news. And they've, okay, well, sure, we did direct the people, we did get
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.240]  them out in front. We did do it with this demonstration, but we do that all the time.
[19:11.240 --> 19:17.080]  No, you're not supposed to do that. That's staging things and you know it. Now is it
[19:17.080 --> 19:23.760]  as bad as saying scud missiles? We're coming over to Tel Aviv and you were really in Atlanta,
[19:23.760 --> 19:30.720]  Georgia at CNN Center, like I did in 1991. No, it's, it's, it's not as bad as that. You're
[19:30.720 --> 19:35.200]  absolutely right. It's not as bad as Anderson Cooper being in New York and claiming he was
[19:35.200 --> 19:40.920]  in, uh, Connecticut. And why do they do that? Why do they act like they're out in public
[19:40.920 --> 19:45.240]  when they're not? Because they know we're out there jumping on camera and bullhorning
[19:45.240 --> 19:49.200]  and making points. And that's why we have the contest $200,000 that started to happen
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.720]  this weekend. A lot of great videos on info wars.com. We're going to be posting in one
[19:52.720 --> 19:58.880]  area of folks getting the point out that CNN is backing ISIS CNN back to Arab Spring CNN's
[19:58.880 --> 20:05.600]  fake news. You name it. The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom

[23:39.680 --> 23:45.120]  night shortly prior to her death. Or so the Oregon police say. Another mind control victim

[24:26.960 --> 24:33.040]  Local radio meets television meets the patriot movement meets 1776 worldwide. Again, I'm
[24:33.040 --> 24:40.320]  your host Alex Jones. There is so much to get to here coming up in the next segment.
[24:40.320 --> 24:48.560]  We have the citizen who saw CNN staging the fake news with the fake demonstration, which
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.720]  they admit they were staging, but they go, oh, it was a real demonstration in the area.
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.520]  This violates all the rules of journalism. It's what they constantly do when the media
[24:56.520 --> 25:01.160]  only focuses on the handful of Muslims saying, let's have peace. Let's come together. When
[25:01.160 --> 25:05.360]  down the street, there's, you know, countless videos of folks celebrating it. This is how
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.760]  they distort. A lot of times they won't even say it's Muslims that have attacked. So that's
[25:09.760 --> 25:13.880]  coming up in the next segment. But right now, I want to go to this report by Paul Joseph
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.960]  Watson, the truth about the London Bridge attack. It's very powerful. It needs to go
[25:18.960 --> 25:25.320]  viral. It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Then later coming up, Al Gore claims he lives
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.880]  a carbon free lifestyle. The guy has, last time I heard like 14 houses, one of them is
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.520]  like 30,000 square feet. He has huge private airplanes. He has one of the biggest carbon
[25:35.520 --> 25:43.400]  footprints in the world. He owns an oil company, Occidental Petroleum. That's coming up. And
[25:43.400 --> 25:49.040]  then we have the Megan Kelly being destroyed, destroyed by Vladimir Putin. So that's coming
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.360]  up the start of the next hour and then so much more. We have the author, no campus for
[25:53.360 --> 25:56.880]  white men joining us, dealing with campuses now, just saying, no white people allowed
[25:56.880 --> 26:00.920]  or, you know, you can't be here this weekend or you can't be in the park and then the school's
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.440]  backing that. I mean, this is just total globalist creation of racism. This is terrible. It'll
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.680]  make white people racist, folks. That's the plan. CNN caught staging fake news that's
[26:10.680 --> 26:15.080]  coming up. But here it is. The truth about the London Bridge attack. Seven people were
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.880]  killed and almost 50 injured when marauding terrorists went on a van and knife rampage
[26:19.880 --> 26:24.840]  in London last night. Because carrying on exactly as before after the Manchester bombing
[26:24.840 --> 26:30.120]  worked out great, didn't it? The terrorists shouted, this is for Ella, while they slashed
[26:30.120 --> 26:33.560]  at women's throats. When you're saying they were stabbing everyone, what did you actually
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.880]  see them do? They were running up going, this is for Ella. When they first see him, they
[26:36.880 --> 26:40.520]  went, this is for Ella. And they run up, they stabbed this girl. I don't know how many times,
[26:40.520 --> 26:45.400]  10 times, maybe 15 times. And she was going, help me, help me. And I could not do enough.
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.760]  The BBC has footage of the terrorists saying this but is still refusing to broadcast it.
[26:50.760 --> 26:58.280]  The attack was celebrated again by Muslim viewers of Al Jazeera. 41 attacks and 451
[26:58.280 --> 27:03.440]  dead so far during Ramadan. One of the victims says he was approached by a man who said,
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.920]  this is for Islam before sticking a knife in him. But of course all this has nothing
[27:08.920 --> 27:14.320]  to do with Islam. The accomplices were arrested in Barking where we paid for police to protect
[27:14.320 --> 27:20.320]  Islamist hate speech back in 2010. Once again, the community failed to alert authorities
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.040]  to terrorists in their midst, proving this is a far bigger problem than just radical
[27:26.040 --> 27:31.680]  Islam. But Sadiq Khan said terrorism is just part and parcel of living in a big city. Except
[27:31.680 --> 27:38.240]  if you live in Tokyo, Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, etc, etc, etc. Or any other big city without
[27:38.240 --> 27:44.880]  a huge Muslim population. Higher Muslim population, higher terror problem. Fact. Theresa May's
[27:44.880 --> 27:50.400]  response? To regulate the internet. Not a word about changing a border policy that allows
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.400]  ISIS jihadists who fought in Syria to slip back into the country. Not a word about interning
[27:56.400 --> 28:01.600]  the thousands of known jihadists who are allowed to roam our streets. Not a word about tackling
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.160]  the hateful ideology spread through mosques and prisons that inspires these attacks. Not
[28:07.160 --> 28:13.160]  a single word. Pathetic. May wants longer prison sentences for terrorists. Oh gee, that's
[28:13.160 --> 28:18.440]  really gonna deter a would-be suicide bomber, isn't it? She says this ideology is a perversion
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.080]  of Islam. Proving once again that she hasn't read the Quran. Hey, at least if we elect
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.880]  Corbyn, we'll be honest about the fact that we've totally capitulated. And what I left
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.920]  this most outraged about? The innocent victims crushed and stabbed. Their blood running down
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.160]  the gutter. No. They're more outraged about Donald Trump's frigging tweets. We can't
[28:38.160 --> 28:44.200]  go on like this. If the government doesn't introduce actual measures to fix this, vigilante
[28:44.200 --> 28:48.840]  groups will take it into their own hands. You'll see a spate of hate crimes and the
[28:48.840 --> 28:54.920]  left will be more upset over that than the actual terrorist attacks. We need a total
[28:54.920 --> 28:59.440]  ban on people coming into the country from terror-linked countries, except if they're
[28:59.440 --> 29:05.040]  politicians, journalists or doctors. If you're coming from Libya, Syria or any of these countries
[29:05.040 --> 29:10.640]  without good reason, no. You're not getting in. We need to seriously look at capping
[29:10.640 --> 29:16.160]  Muslim immigration into the UK. We need a massive surveillance program targeting mosques
[29:16.160 --> 29:22.160]  and the immediate arrest of anyone preaching jihadism. We need known Islamists in prison
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.440]  to be put in solitary confinement for the duration of their sentence so they can't radicalise
[29:27.440 --> 29:33.480]  others. We need the thousands of known jihadists in the UK locked up for life or permanently
[29:33.480 --> 29:40.520]  deported. Those are actual solutions. Lighting a candle, tweeting hashtags and lecturing
[29:40.520 --> 29:48.000]  me about Islamophobia isn't a f***ing solution. That's surrender. That's capitulation. How
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.160]  about we honour the victims with more than just words and empty platitudes?
[29:54.160 --> 30:03.600]  We'll be back. I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War.
[30:03.600 --> 30:07.760]  The collapse of the left continues. After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher
[30:07.760 --> 30:11.440]  is now the latest under fire for a public statement. Here's Bill Maher in an interview
[30:11.440 --> 30:16.920]  with Senator Ben Sasse. You're welcome. We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.
[30:16.920 --> 30:30.040]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember, the left does eat
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.400]  its own and liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognises
[30:34.400 --> 30:39.480]  the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognise the reality of the insane left.
[30:39.480 --> 30:42.840]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost him
[30:42.840 --> 30:47.560]  his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning, which
[30:47.560 --> 30:51.720]  will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This is Owen Schreuer
[30:51.720 --> 31:01.680]  for Infowars.com. Are you tired of winning yet?
[31:01.680 --> 31:05.560]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.280]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates,
[31:10.280 --> 31:15.880]  the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right
[31:15.880 --> 31:20.920]  here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[31:20.920 --> 31:26.200]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[31:26.200 --> 31:31.240]  your co-workers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:31.240 --> 31:36.240]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:36.240 --> 31:42.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure
[31:42.120 --> 31:47.880]  Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[31:47.880 --> 31:52.440]  incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older
[31:52.440 --> 31:57.320]  or more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so
[31:57.320 --> 31:59.840]  revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.

[32:52.040 --> 32:55.000]  a bad product. What you find in our news is the same thing
[32:55.000 --> 33:16.200]  you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com. It's the win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[33:16.200 --> 33:22.800]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:22.800 --> 33:48.080]  the Infowar. To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[33:48.080 --> 34:09.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most amazing stories I've seen in years to take
[34:09.320 --> 34:15.160]  us behind the curtain of fake corporate news. CNN's famous in 1991 for saying they were
[34:15.160 --> 34:21.320]  hit with a scud missile in Tel Aviv with nerve gas. They were in CNN Center in Atlanta with
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.160]  Jacko, the reporter and the rest of it. Everybody knows about that. Then they've been caught
[34:25.160 --> 34:30.560]  doing other green screens, claiming their own location in places like Newtown, Connecticut
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.120]  because they don't want other citizens being there, you know, jumping on camera saying
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.360]  things basically. So they do it from their studios and then they claim their out there
[34:38.360 --> 34:42.560]  on the ground. Well, this is different. This is getting a fake demonstration together with
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.840]  a bunch of signs they hand out to have, quote, Muslims say, let's come together. We're sorry
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.480]  for the terror attack. But that's not really happening or going on. So they have to produce
[34:53.480 --> 34:59.600]  it. It's a PR event. And we've had CNN reporters on over the years who exposed that in Middle
[34:59.600 --> 35:06.000]  Eastern countries were paying quarter million dollars, half million dollars to CNN to produce
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.960]  pieces that were promoting Islamic dictatorships and saying they were good. So we've had those
[35:11.960 --> 35:16.640]  reporters on. So this is what CNN does. And they're really bad about it internationally.
[35:16.640 --> 35:22.520]  They don't do it as much in the U.S. So Mike Cernovich yesterday hit me with a video and
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.640]  I saw it and it was incredible. And this gentleman's at work. So he's got to go very soon. So I'm
[35:26.640 --> 35:32.240]  going to go to Mark Antrow first. It's a citizen out there who saw this, you know, the day
[35:32.240 --> 35:37.680]  after the attack. And he sees the police and folks having these signs handed to him and
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.880]  they're doing PR pieces and then they wave more people in. And there's a CNN reporter
[35:42.880 --> 35:56.680]  with lights and this in the big dolly. It's like a full, you know, crew that is out there.
[35:56.680 --> 36:00.160]  And then CNN came out and said, yes, there was a nearby demonstration. We brought them
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.480]  in to do this. Well, it still shows you're staging by not showing the full demonstrations.
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.480]  If that's true, you're showing what you want us to see. This is totally unethical for anyone
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.240]  that's worked in journalism. I have a crew member that worked at CNN. They were specifically
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.000]  told, don't do this. He's not an undisclosure. He can't come on, but he's in the control
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.120]  room. That's how this really works. If I went out and staged this, it'd be terrible.
[36:25.120 --> 36:32.440]  So this is a big deal. So Mark Antrow, he's on Twitter at Twitter at Mark Antrow.com.
[36:32.440 --> 36:37.400]  I want to give you the floor first. I appreciate your courage coming on. You're there in London.
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.080]  Give us your overall view of what's happening in the world, what you're witnessing unfold,
[36:42.080 --> 36:47.080]  and the fact that your story now is in hundreds of news sites. CNN's responded saying, okay,
[36:47.080 --> 36:51.360]  we did stage it, but it was a real demonstration. Cernovich predicted this. They'd say, oh,
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.040]  we did stage it, but we went and found real people to come be part of it. Well, I mean,
[36:56.040 --> 37:02.720]  who knows if they'd stage this? What won't they stage, Mark?
[37:02.720 --> 37:11.240]  There's a few good points in there. What's going on in London? I mean, I've just lost
[37:11.240 --> 37:18.520]  the words. I mean, if we had some context, we came before last. ISIS put out the threat
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.560]  over Ramadan that is going to be a holy month of war, following the Westminster attacks
[37:23.560 --> 37:30.440]  and the Manchester attacks. Me and my girlfriend had planned to go out in London that weekend,
[37:30.440 --> 37:36.480]  but we changed our plans. People are saying people in London aren't scared and that we're
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.200]  carrying on as normal. We're not. I mean, I've spoke to obviously many people who have the
[37:42.200 --> 37:48.800]  same issues and feelings as me. The media is portraying one thing and people are feeling
[37:48.800 --> 37:55.320]  very, very different. Last week, we changed our plans. This weekend, my girlfriend had
[37:55.320 --> 38:03.800]  plans to go out into Central London on Saturday when the night of the attack. I went to collect
[38:03.800 --> 38:10.880]  my girlfriend on Saturday and her mum had called her. When I met her, she was in absolute
[38:10.880 --> 38:16.480]  pieces, just ran up to me, cuddling me, asking me what's going on in an absolute panic. She
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.400]  had been out like everyone else enjoying her Saturday evening, having fun with friends,
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.360]  and it turned into absolute chaos. I mean, we were in Oxford Circus. I mean, I don't
[38:26.360 --> 38:31.400]  know if you're familiar with London at all, but Oxford Circus is the busiest tube station
[38:31.400 --> 38:40.120]  in London. We had to go back via there. It was just disconcerting and horrible. We came
[38:40.120 --> 38:45.600]  up to Victoria to get the overground. There was just police everywhere, confusion. In
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.080]  the end, we just ended up spending a fortune to get the taxi back because it redeemed its
[38:51.080 --> 39:00.520]  safer. So I suppose that's my initial take. To your point around CNN faking the narrative,
[39:00.520 --> 39:06.920]  I mean, it's just morally bankrupt as far as I'm concerned.
[39:06.920 --> 39:11.280]  Let's expand on that, sir, because you're a witness to so much of this and shot the
[39:11.280 --> 39:16.400]  video that's now literally one of the probably in the top two stories of not top story right
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.200]  now with CNN coming out saying, okay, we did bring in these people. We did stage it. We
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.040]  did shoot it like it was a movie, but they were real Muslims and they were real, you
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.720]  know, protesters from a mile away. So it's okay. How do we believe any of this? This
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.920]  is why journalistically no one would ever do this. And I want to know why are they so
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.760]  arrogant to go out and do this? Meanwhile, Tommy Robinson as a report from Rebel Media,
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.800]  what's up on info wars.com where UK government is housing radical jihadist and paying for
[39:43.800 --> 39:49.920]  them and E moms at the mosque where this guy came from are basically promoting all this
[39:49.920 --> 39:55.200]  and they're shooting Jihad videos there. And as you said, saying month of Ramadan, we're
[39:55.200 --> 39:59.480]  going to go out and go crazy and already it's like 400 people have been killed in Europe
[39:59.480 --> 40:05.040]  and other areas in just the last week of Ramadan. They're killing people everywhere and more
[40:05.040 --> 40:08.840]  and more. You don't even really see it on the news. It's like somebody got stabbed.
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.840]  Somebody got run over. Somebody got kidnapped. And it's just so for every terror attack we
[40:12.840 --> 40:18.760]  hear about, the word is there may be as many as 20. We don't I mean, taxation is a whole
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.320]  different issue for another day. But I mean, in the UK, I'm not sure exactly what the taxes
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.840]  like in the states, but we pay about the average person pays about 43% of their salary and
[40:28.840 --> 40:31.320]  tax, which as far as I'm concerned, it's modern slavery.
[40:31.320 --> 40:38.920]  As you say, yeah, I mean, for that to go to people who are coming over here who are making
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.840]  no net contribution after being given so much, I mean, I think that's despicable in and of
[40:42.840 --> 40:43.840]  itself.
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.520]  If you go back to where the CNN, yes, yes, let's let me get me the floor. Again, we have
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.080]  the man that shot the video, Mark intro, living there in London. This is what the day after
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.480]  describe it. You're walking along. What do you see? And as you're talking, we'll be rolling
[40:56.480 --> 40:57.480]  the footage.
[40:57.480 --> 41:03.920]  Yeah, no, of course. So describe what you saw. Also, I can just see myself. I can't
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.320]  see the video. So hopefully I'm in sync with you. But at the very beginning of the clip,
[41:08.320 --> 41:15.040]  you'll notice there's two white officers walking away. And just our hearing. I've got it. So
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.240]  just into the shop now, we've got two Asian officers come in. We've got I think names
[41:20.240 --> 41:26.680]  Becky setting up the scene with CNN. And the white officers have gone. The white officers
[41:26.680 --> 41:32.840]  were there for at least an hour previously to these two officers becoming on the scene.
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.360]  And we just literally just see it being set up. They were these guys, I can't comment
[41:37.360 --> 41:41.680]  whether they're sincere or not. These are already here by before I arrived. So I can't
[41:41.680 --> 41:48.240]  say either way, but their role or how complicit in any set up there. And there's been. But
[41:48.240 --> 41:56.120]  I mean, you clearly see Becky lining the shot. So if you'll see BBC who are next, start waving
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.600]  and setting up a scene with them, telling them to get into shot. And that's a key point.
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.240]  It's not just CNN. We've got a feeding frenzy of international media there all helping direct
[42:05.240 --> 42:14.920]  this. Yes, I mean, BBC with the ITN, ITV, but it was CNN scoop. BBC were asking CNN if
[42:14.920 --> 42:22.040]  they could do it live at the same time BBC were live and CNN categorically said no, which
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.560]  I found quite outstanding. Here you go. This is BBC now saying they're in the shots. They
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.880]  pushed them in. This is what gets me. So the scenes about to go live. I'm not sure if you've
[42:32.880 --> 42:40.120]  got the audio there, but Becky starts to see after setting it up, a whole false pretense
[42:40.120 --> 42:45.840]  and she opens up and I open in line. This is a wonderful scene here. And I don't know
[42:45.840 --> 42:49.240]  if again, you've got to do this. You walk through the scene without audio. Then we're
[42:49.240 --> 42:52.320]  going to go back to the point where Becky starts talking. The CNN reporter will play
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.320]  it for the radio.
[42:53.320 --> 43:00.720]  And so you hear me laugh and I go, that's because you've put the scene together. To BBC director
[43:00.720 --> 43:08.000]  laughed with me. I mean, they know, they know it's fake. Becky, to be fair, she wasn't on
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.800]  an auto queue here. That's all David working for an auto queue. That's all the CNN production
[43:12.800 --> 43:23.320]  kits. There's feeds coming. Even BBC was laughing at it, knowing how unethical it was.
[43:23.320 --> 43:31.080]  I assume she's director, but a lady turned around to me when I went after Becky said,
[43:31.080 --> 43:34.480]  it's a wonderful scene here. I laughed and when that's because you put it together and
[43:34.480 --> 43:41.440]  she left with me. I mean, you can't say fairer than that. But at the end of the video, unfortunately
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.320]  Twitter only lets you upload a two minute, 20 second video because the actual video is
[43:46.320 --> 43:52.240]  about three and a half minutes. But at the end of the video, you see, I kind of pan
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.040]  around to get, I guess, like a wider shot. And you come back and the two Asian officers
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.800]  have gone and the two white officers are coming back into the scene. I mean, it could not
[44:00.800 --> 44:07.520]  be any more stage. So while CNN are saying, yes, these are sincere Muslims, they are
[44:07.520 --> 44:13.320]  against ISIS. I'm not disputing that for a second. But what I'm saying is how false
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.920]  are the pretensities, how staged it was. And for Becky to stand and go, this is a poignant
[44:18.920 --> 44:23.160]  scene. It's a poignant scene because your script is a poignant scene. It's not poignant
[44:23.160 --> 44:28.240]  scene because that's the truth of reality. And that I think to me, that's a real issue
[44:28.240 --> 44:29.240]  here.
[44:29.240 --> 44:33.760]  Sure. Well, the BBC got caught for the Queen several times in Africa because she wanted
[44:33.760 --> 44:39.120]  it, creating a soundstage to meet African villagers a decade ago. That was a big scandal
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.920]  then because, look, it's one thing if you say here at the set we built, she met people,
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.840]  but you don't say here we are in a village and it's a soundstage. I mean, that's fake
[44:47.840 --> 44:48.840]  news.
[44:48.840 --> 44:55.160]  Oh, I mean, it's the given business. No two ways about it. If it was Halfton's didn't
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.480]  see the white officers were there. They weren't trying to create a false narrative. And to
[44:59.480 --> 45:00.480]  presentry presents.
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.040]  When you say white officers, you don't mean racially. You've got the PR police and you've
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.160]  got the actual police. I mean, describe that for folks.
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.920]  Well, I mean, it is what it is. There is two or three white officers with a couple of arms
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.360]  of officers there for at least now proceeding. The footage I recorded is just like in New
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.120]  York City, but also in London, you have the police. They're like the PR police that we're
[45:22.120 --> 45:25.960]  like, they have, I think a white band on their hat. They wear a white or yellow vest.
[45:25.960 --> 45:31.440]  He's his post officers. I'm just saying the media will spend it and say you were saying
[45:31.440 --> 45:34.880]  like they were white people for folks that don't know. You've got PR police and you've
[45:34.880 --> 45:37.280]  got armed police that are response police.
[45:37.280 --> 45:41.680]  Oh, yes. So I mean, are typically off. So we've got three different types of police.
[45:41.680 --> 45:47.440]  It's funny one. So we've got the armed officers who are there in the background. I'm not sure
[45:47.440 --> 45:51.840]  what their department would be called. But I suppose if the equivalent of a SWAT team
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.640]  or most in America, and then you've got the standard police who are unarmed or typically
[45:58.640 --> 46:04.240]  carry a trenching or a taser, maybe pepper spray. And then what we do to boost up the
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.520]  numbers is have community support officers. I may be wrong in saying this, but as far
[46:09.520 --> 46:11.880]  as I'm aware, they can't actually arrest anyone.
[46:11.880 --> 46:17.720]  Sure. So you've got the community response PR folks that can write tickets for parking
[46:17.720 --> 46:23.000]  meters and stuff, but can't do anything. They're there running and directing clearly with CNN
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.080]  this. And we've got a clip of that footage. We're going to Mike Cernovich and then let
[46:27.080 --> 46:30.640]  you get back to your work. So we really appreciate you. But here is the clip you were talking
[46:30.640 --> 46:34.480]  about where she's saying, Oh, what a wonderful scene. Yeah, because you staged it. Here it
[46:34.480 --> 46:35.480]  is.
[46:35.480 --> 47:00.960]  Go ahead, Mark. Oh, no, I was just going to say, suppose the police in that shop would
[47:00.960 --> 47:05.960]  have been the Metropolitan Police. They weren't the fake police, so to speak, but they weren't
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.120]  armed officers, but they would be the usual police officer.
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.360]  Sure. The point is the government's helping direct us with the media. This is obviously
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.320]  some PR stunt that was approved up higher, or you wouldn't have police there directing
[47:16.320 --> 47:17.320]  it.
[47:17.320 --> 47:19.280]  Yeah, no, 100%
[47:19.280 --> 47:25.440]  Absolutely. Well, I want to go to Mike Cernovich. We appreciate you doing this, Mark. Any other
[47:25.440 --> 47:27.800]  points you'd like to add about what you witnessed?
[47:27.800 --> 47:36.480]  No, I mean, the video speaks for itself. You can clearly see I've had so many people
[47:36.480 --> 47:40.960]  calling me far rioting things. I mean, I'm a libertarian, I believe in the non-aggression
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.560]  principle and people are just trying to twist the narrative. I'd say, watch the video and
[47:45.560 --> 47:46.560]  make your own decision.
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.920]  Yeah, you're a person that shot a video seeing admits they were staging it, but says it's
[47:50.920 --> 47:56.560]  not fake news. Address the information. It's like in the pub when they're stabbing people,
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.520]  somebody goes, you effing Islamist, and someone goes, don't call them that. I mean, it's like
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.000]  you're being killed and you're defending the people attacking you.
[48:05.000 --> 48:13.320]  Yeah, I mean, what can you say? Typically, again, being libertarian, I'm a big fan of
[48:13.320 --> 48:16.080]  Ron Paul on foreign policy.
[48:16.080 --> 48:17.080]  Absolutely.
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.080]  And
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.880]  Let me throw this in right now before you got to go to the Marine Cernovich in. Mike
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.560]  had the idea. He does this routinely just to honor people because the globalists honor
[48:26.560 --> 48:29.720]  themselves, and they use taxpayer money to do it. We don't do that. We use listener money
[48:29.720 --> 48:35.520]  to do it. He wants to, and he doesn't have as big an operation as us, $1,000 prize to
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.040]  you for what you've done because you're going to be demonized, you're going to be attacked,
[48:40.040 --> 48:45.520]  but also we should recognize you. And I have this demonstration idea that Cernovich had
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.360]  to go out and call seeing an in fake news where shirts that say it, Kathy Griffin shirts
[48:49.360 --> 48:53.920]  that say CNN terrorist, but it can be Fox News, MSNBC. We don't care. Go after them all. And
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.840]  I said $2,500 or $1,000. Those are the two prize levels, $200,000 in total prizes. And
[48:59.840 --> 49:04.720]  I said, you can be creative. Just show their lies. Just show what they're doing. Pay them
[49:04.720 --> 49:07.640]  on the side of your truck, pull up in front of them when they're live, you know, saying
[49:07.640 --> 49:14.080]  CNN lies, CNN's fake. It doesn't matter. But because you did this 2,500, give us your address,
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.720]  $2,500 on top of Cernovich's thousand, that's $3,500. Just not that you wanted money, but
[49:20.720 --> 49:25.640]  just the recognition that you're real media and we want to appreciate you and we want
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.720]  to donate to that. And we want to recognize that that has value in our culture and needs
[49:30.720 --> 49:38.840]  to be appreciated. Mike Cernovich. Yeah, exactly. So we wanted to surprise you and award you.
[49:38.840 --> 49:43.040]  And also we want to send a message that, you know, the fake news media, what they'll do
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.480]  is they'll steal your footage and then they'll sell advertising and then they'll profit off
[49:47.480 --> 49:52.240]  of you. But Alex and I and the Info Warriors, we don't really believe in that. We think
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.720]  when you do a good thing, you know, we should recognize that. And we also want to inspire
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.960]  more people to take action because if you think about it, this is the biggest story
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.040]  maybe of the year, fake news. I mean, if the media weren't fake, this would be in the New
[50:07.040 --> 50:11.160]  York Times. This would be everywhere. But of course, they're trying to cover it up.
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.920]  And we want people out there with cameras knowing that, hey, if it's a holiday, if it's
[50:15.920 --> 50:21.240]  a Sunday, it's your day off. If you see the fake news out there trying to craft a narrative,
[50:21.240 --> 50:25.280]  get that phone out. That does matter. And also we know people are going to try to fame
[50:25.280 --> 50:29.800]  you and lie about you. So this is a nice cushion. So have a vacation, have a nice dinner with
[50:29.800 --> 50:33.040]  your girlfriend on Alex and me. We're very, very grateful for what you did.
[50:33.040 --> 50:38.760]  Exactly. And we also want to recognize people video some stupid celebrity or the video,
[50:38.760 --> 50:42.440]  you know, Oh, here's a cake. I'm eating the show for their friends. Be journalists. Go
[50:42.440 --> 50:47.800]  out, film everything, show everything, put it out, point it out and become more powerful
[50:47.800 --> 50:52.360]  than CNN. The New York Times is Matt Drudge always said anybody with a keyboard or a camera
[50:52.360 --> 50:57.200]  is just as important as the New York Times. We are. So when we have somebody on like Scott
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.920]  or you'll Greer coming up later or Owen and David Knight coming up or Mike Cernovich or
[51:01.920 --> 51:07.840]  Mark Antrow, we're all just as important black, white, old, young and and Muslims that don't
[51:07.840 --> 51:12.080]  want to be under radical Islam. You should speak out as well. If you really don't support
[51:12.080 --> 51:14.680]  this, a closing comments, Mark.
[51:14.680 --> 51:22.520]  Oh, yeah, I'm speechless. I mean, I, I think with, like I said, I've made my points around
[51:22.520 --> 51:28.280]  the feeling in London, the video speaks for itself. So finally, huge thanks to you, Alex,
[51:28.280 --> 51:34.000]  have me on and Mike, you've, it's what last 24 hours have been an absolute rollercoaster.
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.880]  Like I can't tell you when you first the end me, they're retweeted. It's been mental.
[51:40.880 --> 51:43.800]  So it's been, it's been a good enjoyment.
[51:43.800 --> 51:47.960]  It's a great honor to have info wars and thank you. Thank you, sir, to have info wars and
[51:47.960 --> 51:52.800]  Cernovich with his own platform to know Cernovich picked it up, started going big. He called
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.800]  me right away. We retweeted it exploded. Now it's in hundreds of newspapers everywhere.
[51:57.800 --> 52:01.480]  CNN's having to respond. It shows the power of the people and the value of info wars.
[52:01.480 --> 52:05.040]  And that's why info wars is so important. It's why they're after us. So Hillary said,
[52:05.040 --> 52:08.520]  we lost her in the election last week. That's why they're moving heaven and earth to destroy
[52:08.520 --> 52:13.160]  us right now. But thanks to you and your prayers, folks, we're standing strong. I will talk to
[52:13.160 --> 52:18.360]  you soon. Mark, Andrew, give us your address or where you want 2,500 cent. I know Cernovich
[52:18.360 --> 52:22.960]  is going to send you a thousand, but believe me, I want to thank you again because you
[52:22.960 --> 52:24.840]  are the resistance. Thank you so much.
[52:24.840 --> 52:27.400]  Pleasure. Keep it a good work, Alex.
[52:27.400 --> 52:31.880]  No, you keep it up. Again, these folks are always so humble and so thankful to us. Mike
[52:31.880 --> 52:36.440]  Cernovich, as you said, we have to celebrate the citizen journalists like Matt Drudge has
[52:36.440 --> 52:41.880]  done, how Drudge the last 10 years linking to alternative media, helping build. I mean,
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.480]  without Drudge, daily caller, info wars, world net daily, what would have been a third of
[52:47.480 --> 52:50.960]  what they were. So let's thank Drudge right now too. Go ahead, Mike.
[52:50.960 --> 52:56.480]  Yeah, that's the whole point. Drudge and Andrew Breitbart rest in peace. They were really
[52:56.480 --> 53:00.400]  about the revolution and supporting people because one thing I see on social media that
[53:00.400 --> 53:01.400]  I don't like.
[53:01.400 --> 53:04.280]  Oh yeah, we don't let even daily caller that I've been nice to it only writes nine pieces
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.920]  about me now. Same thing about Breitbart still and others. And it's sad. Drudge is the real
[53:08.920 --> 53:12.880]  deal. He brings it. It isn't about I've got the biggest website. So I'm not going to give
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.600]  you power. It's about winning. It's about defeating the new world order. Go ahead. Sorry.
[53:17.600 --> 53:22.320]  Exactly. So yeah, that's what Drudge does is he drives the traffic to all these people
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.920]  and he's built everybody up.
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.800]  He has helped build and given the blood supply to the new media.
[53:27.800 --> 53:28.800]  Exactly.
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.160]  And so now even if they destroy him, it doesn't matter. His greatest accomplishment is that
[53:33.160 --> 53:35.760]  he lives on through that no matter what. Sorry.
[53:35.760 --> 53:41.200]  No, no, exactly right. And that's why, you know, you retweet, I retweet stuff so much
[53:41.200 --> 53:46.000]  is a lot of people just took Mark's video and I go, man, I don't think that's right,
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  dude. So I messaged Mark and I go, I want to make sure I can use it and give you all
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.240]  the credit you deserve and, you know, wanted it to honor him truly. And that's what that's
[53:54.240 --> 53:58.880]  my message to people on social medias. If you have a big platform, make sure you're
[53:58.880 --> 54:01.840]  retweeting the people are given credit honoring the people.
[54:01.840 --> 54:05.400]  There is nothing more honorable except for a firefighter or a cop getting killed helping
[54:05.400 --> 54:09.840]  somebody or a soldier than being in the info war, standing up and knowing you're going
[54:09.840 --> 54:15.080]  to get bullied and called things just because you videotaped and showed the liars.
[54:15.080 --> 54:19.800]  And that's why it's up to us to show leadership. And that's why the people who are listening
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.240]  in, they know that when they buy the info war products, when they support it, that money's
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.680]  going right back out to the info war. That money isn't going to Lamborghini's and Ferraris.
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.800]  Oh, they're trying to destroy me in this country. I mean, I am so committed. I just, I just
[54:33.800 --> 54:38.400]  absolutely want more capital so I can get everybody hired and be strong and move forward
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.360]  because it's, it's, I'm not complaining, but it's been, it's been wild. It's been rough.
[54:42.360 --> 54:48.240]  I asked for this, but it is just, they are so pissed at us. They are so angry and please
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.160]  listeners, we have great products at infowarstore.com. I even skipped a break and have it plugged.
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.720]  We are going to end the Memorial Day special, but I sent it for a week. We have to because
[54:55.720 --> 54:59.320]  we sold out of the secret 12 vitamin B 12. We're about to sell out of X two for about
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.600]  to sell out of super mail, but I'm still going to keep it discounted 30% off 40% off survival

[55:19.800 --> 55:24.000]  are already off now because they're about to be sold out. If you sign up for auto ship,

[55:40.120 --> 55:45.400]  critical in the war that we need to be resupplied and a fraction of our wonderful listeners.
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.280]  They're all awesome. Buy the products. If you just go to infowarstore.com, if you'll
[55:49.280 --> 55:53.720]  just buy the products or call triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[55:53.720 --> 56:00.240]  I can pay my crew what it is so they can live decent and be focused and expand. So please,
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.120]  these are great products infowarstore.com. Mike Cernovich, what do you make of the left
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.560]  making excuses for this attack and where this is all going? I mean, what is the state of
[56:08.560 --> 56:14.080]  the world right now? Well, I mean, we predicted it yesterday when we talked about it. We said
[56:14.080 --> 56:17.680]  right away, we know what they're going to say because we, well, you predicted it. You
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.480]  said they're going to claim they brought somebody from a protest, which they then said
[56:21.480 --> 56:27.480]  exactly. So we know their lies right away. Now, Sean and my wife goes, how does the media
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.680]  think they can get away with it? And I said, well, because before info wars, before a
[56:31.680 --> 56:37.120]  judge, before a social media gateway pundit, before citizen journalism, the media got away
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.680]  with that every day. And now they realized they, Alex, millions of views, millions of
[56:42.680 --> 56:49.080]  people have seen that video now. More people watch that video than will watch CNN this
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.440]  entire week. More people will listen to you on info wars and all the social stuff we got
[56:53.440 --> 56:59.160]  going on that are going to even watch CNN. So this is a message to the fake news media.
[56:59.160 --> 57:02.960]  You think you're going to stage things. We got our people everywhere with cameras. You
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.760]  better stop lying. And that's what they're scared of. That's why
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.440]  May, who I don't think is a bad person. She's better than last prime minister. She's like,
[57:11.440 --> 57:15.680]  Oh, let's censor the internet. Well, they admit in the whole UN plan. That means us. They
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.800]  always censor us, not the jihadi. So their answers censor the web. No, Paul's right.
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.160]  I don't want draconian controls, solitary confinement and all this, but you've got to
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.680]  do it because we're not going to lose our rights because they bring in some incompatible
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.720]  group of crazy woman, woman, hating cavemen. Yeah, I want a bunch of woman, hating cavemen
[57:34.720 --> 57:41.200]  and nightgowns. Did you see that CNN's Reza Aslan had tweeted out that he hopes, uh,
[57:41.200 --> 57:46.080]  Todd Dickerson gets raped. I kid you not. I didn't see this. Tell us about it. Okay.
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.760]  So yeah, there's a CNN employee. I think we have it on my timeline. Reza, Reza Aslan
[57:50.760 --> 57:56.160]  is the point. And he had tweeted in 2004. I'll pull up the tweet. He had tweeted out,
[57:56.160 --> 58:01.760]  I want, uh, Todd Aiken to be raped and I am serious because you and me, of course, if
[58:01.760 --> 58:07.000]  we say anything satirical, they treat it as actually as real, even though it's clear satire.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.560]  Yeah. Reza Aslan said, just to be clear, I was indeed wishing someone would rape congressman
[58:12.560 --> 58:19.160]  Todd Aiken. I'd hate to be misunderstood. So this is not satire. This is actually CNN
[58:19.160 --> 58:23.800]  wishing rape on people. I recognize that guy's name. I don't follow CNN. He attacks me all
[58:23.800 --> 58:28.560]  the time. Yeah, this is CNN guy right there. So we need to get this story pushed out hard.
[58:28.560 --> 58:34.360]  Wow. Well, I guess he supports Islam. Was that, they're into raping men there as well.
[58:34.360 --> 58:37.720]  Well, I guess if you're against raping men, you're anti-gay and that's how the left will
[58:37.720 --> 58:40.680]  spin it. They'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, hour number two, a little bit more
[58:40.680 --> 58:46.120]  with Cernovich than I've got to just Putin annihilated. Megan Kelly, just annihilated
[58:46.120 --> 59:14.120]  me and lied. I hope I do as well tomorrow.
[59:14.120 --> 59:18.540]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like survival
[59:18.540 --> 59:23.560]  shield X2, super male vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and
[59:23.560 --> 59:28.720]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects. This formula is the
[59:28.720 --> 59:34.200]  platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. And this part is most important.
[59:34.200 --> 59:39.440]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[59:39.440 --> 59:44.480]  quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're
[59:44.480 --> 59:48.560]  finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral
[59:48.560 --> 1:00:15.280]  fusion. Take action now before we sell out. If you are receiving this transmission, you
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:22.280]  are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:41.480]  Alright, I've got to get to this Megan Kelly destruction when she interviewed Putin a few
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:46.200]  weeks ago and aired last night on NBC. That's coming up in the next segment. Mike Cernovich
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:50.620]  is here with us who had the great idea to kind of take our Bill Clinton's a rapist contest
[1:00:50.620 --> 1:00:56.480]  and come out with it and say, uh, no, mainstream media is fake. The media is your enemy. Seeing
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:03.960]  in his ISIS, Kathy Griffin, uh, you know, loves terrorism, whatever. But you go to infowars.com
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:08.480]  forward slash contest. We've got the rules for $100,000 in prizes. We've got, uh, you
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:16.200]  know, folks out there getting it on the news that we're seeing more and more evidence
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:21.800]  that CNN works with terrorists and CNN is ISIS, but it can be whatever, whatever you
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:26.400]  do. If it's good, if it's successful, I want to pay out until the money's gone. Of course,
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:30.240]  not like I'm trying to like say, Oh, that one doesn't work or this one doesn't work.
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:35.320]  I want to pay out. I want to have guests on. I want to see it happen. I want you to get
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.160]  that threshold. I will honestly look at it. And when it's a $200,000, that's our budget.
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:43.520]  It's over. So Mike Cernovich, you've got the floor. My friend really appreciate you and
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:47.680]  all you're doing. Your energy is amazing. Uh, other points you'd like to impart to the
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:55.040]  viewers. Yeah, it is shown. I actually sent Nico that tweet from Resla because CNN employs
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:00.840]  a guy. Reza Aslan is a guy who said Trump is a piece of, you know, SHIT and he had to
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:06.120]  apologize and he goes, Oh, well, I don't use inflammatory language. And there, Reza, um,
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  Aslan had said, just to be clear, I was indeed wishing someone would rape Congressman Todd
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:16.320]  Akin. I'd hate to be misunderstood. So that is not statire because of course you and I
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:20.400]  if I, you know, bang my chest, they'll say, Oh, Cernovich, you know, he's, he's having
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:24.840]  to melt down. He thinks he's a gorilla, even when it's clearly being just satirical. But
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:31.400]  Reza, Reza Aslan had actually said, I want somebody to be raped. This is CNN. This is
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:35.760]  who they put on the news. This is why when I tell people and Alex tells people, they,
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:40.680]  they accuse us of making things up. When I tell people, CNN wants you to be raped. They
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.760]  want your children to be raped. They want you to be murdered. People go, that's crazy.
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:49.920]  Look at that. That is the face of CNN. They have a will. They have a will to dominate.
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:56.160]  I mean, this is a group of ravenous scum. Yeah. Who wishes death and destruction on
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:02.040]  the American family, on the American patriots. They want you enslaved because, you know,
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:06.080]  this is their religion. A lot of people don't realize because they say that they're atheists
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:11.360]  and they don't believe in God. Their religion is to enslave people. And that is why they
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:15.500]  want to destroy Christianity, destroy the family. That is why they even want to destroy
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:20.520]  moderate Islam, right? Because you and I, we respect the Jews, the Muslims, everybody
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:25.440]  who wants to be a patriot and make America better. What the news wants, they want the
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:30.880]  radical Islamic terrorism because they know that can destroy the family. And if you destroy
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:35.400]  the family, then they'll be able to enslave more people. And that's ultimately their
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:36.400]  end goal.
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:41.040]  How do you think Trump's doing my turn of it right now?
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:46.520]  He got us out of the Paris Accord, which is great. A lot of what is happening, for example,
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.120]  50,000 refugees, you know, refugees are going to come in and people blame Trump. But that
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:56.240]  was actually Brian Hook and Margaret Petterline who did that. They're actually going behind
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:01.200]  Rex Tillerson's back in the State Department and allowing more terrorism and terrorists
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:05.720]  to come into the country. So a lot of things Trump are getting blamed for are actually
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:10.160]  his active sabotage by people like Brian Hook, people in the State Department, people in
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:11.160]  the deep state.
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:16.120]  So on the big issues, the only thing that I wish Trump would do are two things. I wish
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.680]  you would tweet more and I wish you do a little bit of cardio because we really need him
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.360]  around for a long time.
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:26.560]  That's right. And third, he needs to do at least once a week, probably twice a week.
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.440]  He needs to do the fireside chat and take control of the media again. He's been the
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.200]  big international TV star. He's to get up there and really sit there to desk and talk
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:37.520]  about his plans, directly to the people. That is the number one thing he's got to do right
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  now.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:42.840]  Yeah, I was actually interviewed and they go, what should Trump's communication strategy
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:47.320]  be? And I said, he should run it like a media outfit, like info wars or even like I do in
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:52.480]  social media, have b-roll footage of where he goes, narrate the b-roll footage, talk
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.480]  about.
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:56.080]  Nowadays, it's so simple. It's a piece of cake. It doesn't be overproduced. I know he
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:04:57.080]  wants to make it perfect.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:03.400]  That's why he hadn't done it. No, just get in there and do it. Thank you, Mike.
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:07.560]  The collapse of the left continues. After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.240]  is now the latest under fire for a public statement. Here's Bill Maher in an interview
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.880]  with Senator Ben Sasse.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:17.440]  You're welcome. We'd love to have you work in the fields with us. Work in the fields.
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:22.440]  That's part of that. Senator. I'm a house b-roll.
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:24.840]  Yeah, I'd say the show.
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:29.800]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember, the left does eat
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:34.160]  its own and liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes
[1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:38.640]  the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of the insane
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:42.480]  left. While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:47.280]  him his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning,
[1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:51.160]  which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This is Owen

[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:31.680]  you are the resistance. We now take you live to the central Texas command center. It's
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:40.280]  Alex Jones. Many Americans hear the name Vladimir Putin and they think he runs a country
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:47.240]  full of corruption, a country in which journalists who are too critical could wind up murdered,
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:53.560]  a country in which dissidents could wind up in jail or worse. To people who believe that,
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:58.520]  what is your message? I want to say that Russia is developing along
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:04.160]  a democratic path that is certain and no one should have any doubt about that. But why
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:09.080]  do you feel you have the right to ask us these kinds of questions and do it all of the time
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:16.040]  to moralize and to give us lessons on how to live? We're ready to listen to comments
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.440]  when it's done constructively with the goal of establishing a relationship, creating a
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:26.320]  common environment. But we will absolutely not accept when these sorts of things are
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:39.120]  used as an instrument of political conflict. I want everyone to know that. That's our message.
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:44.640]  Putin is reforming Russia. Putin is promoting Christianity. Putin is promoting people having
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:52.640]  children. Putin is promoting not having three-year-old sexualized with a reading hour with a tranny
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:10:02.080]  at the New York Library, with the toddlers. Putin is fighting radical Islam. Hollywood
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.800]  and the Democratic Party and the globalist and the John McCain's of the world are working
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:19.960]  with it. That's the facts. That's what happened. Let's go through some of these clips. Where
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:26.840]  to start? Let's start from the beginning. Hackers could be from the U.S. shifting blame
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:32.440]  on Russia. Well, that's actually come out in the Vault 7 CIA leak that they admit it's
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:36.840]  real that they are staging hack attacks and blaming it on Russia and that they even tried
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:40.640]  to plant stuff on computers in Trump Tower. That's why they're going with the Russian
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:45.040]  narrative. They've been trying to frame Trump. Putin implies JFK was killed. Well, there's
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:49.640]  no doubt about that. The U.S. actively interferes in political campaigns in other countries
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:54.560]  all over the world. So how is it Russia isn't supposed to? Because Russia a little bit did
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:11:00.480]  on RT, but it was like most of the reporting was pretty liberal and I don't like it. And
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.280]  RT America is weak. It's big global. RT global is pretty big. Only because CNN's discredited
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:11.440]  itself. But I mean, I've seen the numbers. Do you think I have time to talk to ambassadors
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.280]  all over the world? You know, as if he's coordinating all this, you people are so creative over there.
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:21.320]  Your lives must be boring. I mean, there's so many of these clips. We're going to go
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:27.040]  to right now as we analyze NBC and Megan Kelly's interview with Vladimir Putin ahead of her
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:33.720]  next target. Here it is. You had said for months that Russia had nothing to do with
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:38.480]  the interference of the American election. And then this week you floated the idea of
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  patriotic hackers doing it. Why the change and why now? I hadn't said anything. It's
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:50.760]  just that French journalist asked me about those hackers. I told him the same thing
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:57.640]  I can tell you. Hackers can be anywhere. They can be in Russia, in Asia, even in America,
[1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:04.320]  Latin America. They can even be hackers, by the way, in the United States, who very skillfully
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:12.040]  and professionally shifted the blame, as we say, onto Russia. Could you accept that?
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:17.920]  In the midst of a political battle, by some calculations, it was convenient for them to
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:24.320]  release this information. So they released it, calling out Russia. Can you imagine something
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:27.080]  like that? I can.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:32.600]  By the way, they use the fact that Putin's honest. Obviously, you've got 200 million
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:37.880]  people or whatever it is in Russia or more. And then you've got 300 million in Europe
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:41.200]  and 300 million here. And there's all over the world. And everybody knows you can go
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:45.360]  anywhere. You can go to a library and hack somebody. Or you can go, you know, have some,
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:49.160]  you know, teenager in his mom's basement or it could be the communist Chinese. It could
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:54.480]  be anybody. But it came out in the Vault 7 documents that our government was doing hacks
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:02.160]  in America and then blaming Russia.
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:07.400]  Vault 7 marble framework reveals that the CIA evaded forensics to attribute malware
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:12.280]  to other countries. There it is. M4Wars.com has an even more detailed report showing the
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:17.240]  actual documents.
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:23.680]  But Putin's honest. He's like, we're not directing cyber attacks on you. But I'm sure there are
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:30.440]  Russians that are angry at you that were. Let's just be honest. Of course there are.
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:34.840]  Is there Russian mafia running around stealing credit card numbers? You believe they are.
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:40.360]  We know they are. Are Nigerians doing it? Are there Mexican hackers stealing credit cards?
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:45.080]  Are there American hackers doing it? Of course. That's what goes on. And there are every political
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:51.440]  persuasion geographically saying an attack came from Russia. It appears. So we're militarily
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:56.800]  going to attack Russia. That's what NATO said three years ago when Hillary wasn't even Secretary
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:03.520]  of State. She gave a speech saying, we need to look. If Russia involves in a cyber attack
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.800]  using military force on them, then the State Department adopted that. Just type it in.
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:15.880]  State Department. Pentagon says they may respond with military force against Russian hacks.
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:21.160]  How do you prove that? Are there Russians in uniforms attacking? Are there tanks? Are
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:26.160]  there submarines? Are there ships? Are there landing parties? Do planes fly over us with
[1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:32.800]  Russian flags on the side bombing us? No. We're told this is what's happening. Is Russia
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:40.240]  sided with Islam? No. Is Russia sided with Christianity? Yes. Does that make me a Russian
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:46.880]  agent? No. Ever been to Russia? I'm reporting on the bona fide facts of what's going on.
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:53.080]  Type it in for yourself. Click web. You'll find it. Hillary says we should respond militarily
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:15:00.680]  to Russia if they have a cyber attack. That's the quote. Hillary says respond militarily
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:09.000]  to Russia if they launch a cyber attack. If Russia launches a cyber attack, launch a military
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.920]  attack on them. That's suicide. That's insane. That's no proof. This is the woman backing
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.680]  the Arab Spring. Let's go to the JFK comment. Putin implies JFK was killed by the CIA. Here
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:27.120]  it is. Then the former KGB agent floated a Cold War conspiracy theory about U.S. dirty
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:32.720]  tricks. But there's a theory that Kennedy's assassination was arranged by the United States
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:38.480]  intelligence services. So if this theory is correct and that can't be ruled out, then
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.520]  what could be easier in this day and age than using all the technical means at the disposal
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:49.160]  of the intelligence services and using those means to organize some attacks and then pointing
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:55.120]  the finger at Russia? For the record, U.S. intelligence has concluded Mr. Putin himself
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:16:04.720]  ordered the disruption of the election. Now, since we found it, let's go ahead and put
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.640]  the article up where Hillary said if there's a cyber attack from Russia, hit them militarily.
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.720]  There it is. Washington Times. Hillary Clinton, U.S. will treat cyber attacks just like any
[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:17.040]  other attack. She goes on to say we'll use military, except you can't prove it. And that's
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.000]  now official government policy under Obama and Trump's trying to change it. But they're
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.680]  saying he must be a Russian stooge because he doesn't want to mash troops on their border
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:34.320]  and fund George Soros overthrowing countries so we can teach Ukrainian kids their sexuality
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:42.200]  when they're three years old. Why would government be involved in a NAMBLA program? Now, this
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:46.440]  is a key one because the United States hijacked by globalists. I always hear the U.S. does
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:50.800]  this, the U.S. does that. No, the people that have hijacked us are famous for overthrowing
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:55.040]  governments, manipulating elections. The United States has half the military force on the
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:00.280]  planet. The United States, who I love, is the biggest manipulator of elections the planet
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:03.880]  seen. But it's one thing if you're trying to stop communists, we don't even do that
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:12.720]  anymore in Cuba and in Venezuela. Instead, we try to overthrow Hungary or Romania or Poland
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:20.120]  because they're anti-EU, they're anti-Ratical Islam, they're anti-socialism. So we've become
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:26.520]  like the new Soviet Union. The Euro is the new Soviet Union. And they're trying to make
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:32.440]  us like that and I don't like that. If Putin acted like this, I'd say you're assassinating.
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  I don't have any skin in the game for Vladimir Putin, but he's not doing that. He's doing
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:43.960]  exactly what I do in almost every case. It's quite frankly uncanny. But again, Hillary
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:48.120]  said it's like the Russians get it from somebody in the U.S. and she goes, info wars, losses
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:53.240]  the election. And quite frankly, it's true because I'm an American. I'm promoting the
[1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:57.760]  Renaissance. I'm promoting freedom. I'm promoting everything that they hope we forgot. I didn't
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:04.640]  invent any of this. I'm just bringing it back. I'm an American. I'm not a Russian. I'm an
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:09.000]  American that wants freedom. I'm an American that wants open free societies and I want
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:14.040]  Russia to be prosperous and free and China and Mexico and everybody else because that's
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:21.320]  how I am. I'm not a scumbag. It's not rocket science and the scum that hates God and hates
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:26.560]  Christ and hates families. The Hollywood scum hates Russia. I've talked to high level producers.
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:38.560]  They go Hollywood hates Russia because they're Christian. Hollywood is satanic. Let's go
[1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:44.680]  ahead and go to this clip. Here it is. U.S. actually interferes in political campaigns.
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:49.240]  I will tell you something that you probably already know. I don't want to hurt anyone's
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:55.000]  feelings, but the United States, everywhere, all over the world, actively interferes with
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:59.760]  the electoral campaigns of other countries. Put your finger anywhere on the map of the
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:05.120]  world and everywhere you will hear complaints that American officials are interfering in
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:11.800]  internal electoral processes. But with respect, that sounds like a justification. It doesn't
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:17.000]  sound like a justification. It sounds like a statement of fact. Every action has an
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  equal and opposite reaction. But I repeat, we don't even have to do that. Presidents
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.760]  come and go and even the parties in power change. But the main political direction does
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:33.120]  not change. That's why in the grand scheme of things, we don't care who's the head of
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:38.600]  the United States. We know more or less what is going to happen. And so in this regard,
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:42.760]  even if we wanted to, it wouldn't make sense for us to interfere.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:49.360]  That's right. And Russia now understands soft power like America was until the sixties.
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:53.160]  Be open, be free, be strong. Everyone will want to be with you. Don't go around trying
[1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:58.680]  to make everybody do what you want like Russia was doing before that in the Soviet Union.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:02.400]  And then the whole world wants to go to Russia for help and wants to think they're the big
[1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:06.680]  moral authority, despite all their problems, because we're so bad, not that they're so

[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:03.960]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:07.760]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this

[1:23:56.320 --> 1:24:20.320]  Here's more of Megan and Putin. A special counsel has been appointed to investigate
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:32.680]  the law of attraction.
[1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:46.880]  There were no meetings. I have no idea. I'm being completely honest with you. I don't
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.660]  know. Your question is different. Do you think that from all over the world or from the United
[1:24:51.660 --> 1:24:55.960]  States the ambassador reports to me every day who he meets with, or what they discussed
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:01.280]  there, that's complete nonsense? Do you even understand what you're asking or not? Listen,
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:05.720]  his boss is a minister of foreign affairs. Do you think that I have time to talk to our
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:09.620]  ambassadors every day, all over the world? Complete nonsense.
[1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:16.000]  Now, let's expand on that. She knows the public's dumbed down, at least her audience. And they
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.480]  keep running the story every week like it's new. Sessions when he was a senator met with
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:28.060]  the Russian ambassador. So did Nancy Pelosi like 10 times more than he was like 80 something
[1:25:28.060 --> 1:25:32.400]  times. He'd met with him three times the year before the campaign. With her it was like
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:35.200]  80 something times. I don't even know how she could be meeting with him so much. And
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:40.640]  then photos and videos were released. I mean, what do you think the Russian ambassadors?
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:47.360]  They're Chinese and Russian and British and German and French and Brazilian and Mexican
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:52.520]  ambassadors and diplomats coming out of your ears on Capitol Hill. They're everywhere.
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:58.520]  They're black limos everywhere. That's what countries do. But they make it dirty. That's
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:02.320]  why Trump hasn't even met with Putin yet. Even though he was because, oh my gosh, he
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:06.800]  had the Russian ambassador three weeks ago. Remember? Oh, it's treason. He gave him the
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:16.400]  secrets in the Oval Office. That's how they play these games. I know Megan Kelly probably
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:26.440]  asked me if I'm a Russian. I mean, it's ridiculous, lady. You people are so creative over there.
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:31.360]  Let's go to this clip where he talks about your lives must be boring. Here it is. Have
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:35.880]  you gone back to speak with the ambassador about what was in those discussions he had
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:41.560]  with Jared Kushner with anybody else from the Trump campaign? No. Never? No, I haven't.
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.200]  Aren't you interested? No, because have there been anything significant? He would have reported
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:49.000]  it to the minister. The minister would have reported it to me. There weren't even any
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:55.640]  reports. There's nothing to even talk about. There wasn't even any kind of specific discussion
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:27:04.000]  about sanctions or anything else. For me, this is just amazing. You created a sensation
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:11.920]  out of nothing. And out of this sensation, you turned it into a weapon of war against
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:18.360]  the current president. Well, this is, you know, you're just, you people are so creative
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:24.720]  over there. Good job. Your lives must be boring. Total lies. Listen, they say he gave away
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.400]  where the submarines are three weeks before the Pentagon announces two subs being deployed.
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.480]  They land in Seol's a show of force. Oh my gosh, the same day he talks to the Filipino
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.640]  president and said, I sent two subs. It was on the news. Trump doesn't give anything classified
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:43.080]  out. He won't say anything about military operations unless it's authorized, unless the
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:47.840]  Pentagon tells him to do it. He has totally put them in charge after he gives them orders,
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:53.720]  which is what a president hasn't done in 60 years. And that's why the bureaucracy is
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:28:02.240]  pissed. They want to run the military through the president. Let's go to this other clip.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:07.040]  He talks about General Flynn. Here it is. Did you know General Michael Flynn? He came
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:11.760]  over here for a dinner, a photo of which has been widely circulated. Maybe you're a Russian
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:18.560]  agent. What was the nature of your relationship with him?
[1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  You and I, you and I personally have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn.
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.200]  You and I met yesterday evening. You and I have been working together all day today.
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:33.800]  And now we're meeting again. When I came to the event for our company, Russia today,
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:38.840]  and sat down at the table next to me, there was a gentleman sitting on one side. I made
[1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:44.080]  my speech. Then we talked about some other stuff and I got up and left. And then afterwards
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:48.320]  I was told, you know, there was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things.
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:53.800]  He used to be in the intelligence services. That's it. I didn't even really talk to him.
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:59.240]  That's the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn. And again, that's at a major press
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:03.280]  event. And that's what generals do. You get out of the military, you go and consult all
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:07.200]  over. He did it for Turkey. He did it for Canada. He did it for the UK. He did it for
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:12.920]  the US. He was consulting for, but that's what generals do. He's retired for four years.
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:18.760]  He got paid $34,000 to go speak at an RT event. And of course it's all political influence.
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:25.480]  Of course it's what, that's what diplomacy is. The difference is Russia isn't communist.
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:30.360]  Russia isn't promoting, destroying America. Russia is out from the same globalists that
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:36.480]  we want to get out from under. Does it mean they've got some cakewalk? Does it mean they
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:40.680]  don't have major problems? Absolutely. But Russia is not our enemy. The globalists want
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:45.320]  to make it our enemy. And Trump's a pragmatist. He understands they've got major resources.
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:51.040]  We ought to do business with the Russians. We'll be back with a big gas stay with us.
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:30:03.520]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:07.960]  The collapse of the left continues after Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown. Bill Maher is now
[1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:11.880]  the latest under fire for a public statement. Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:17.120]  Ben Sasse. You're welcome. We'd love to have you work in the fields with us. Work in the
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:25.560]  fields. That's part of that. Senator. I'm a house b***h. Yeah, it's a joke. So Bill Maher
[1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:30.560]  uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember, the left does eat its own and
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:35.360]  liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes the reality of radical
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:39.880]  Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of the insane left. While I don't believe
[1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:44.000]  this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost him his job, I do believe that
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:48.040]  this is just another example of the left crashing and burning, which will only mean
[1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:53.080]  more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. Are

[1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:24.320]  beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:08.760]  year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:14.240]  that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:20.480]  from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.040]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:31.280]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:34.240]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:38.360]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:43.200]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm
[1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:46.880]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday,

[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got some incredible stories on infowars.com. CNN admits they were
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:38.120]  staging fake news the day after the latest terror attacks that are just becoming a regular
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:42.520]  occurrence. The mayor says we should just accept this Islam's a religion of peace. Literally
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:49.440]  said that again. We've caught them staging fake Muslim demonstrations against the terror
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:52.600]  attack because they can't get the regular Muslims to come out and decry it. We've got
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:56.660]  plenty of footage of them out there promoting it. This is just craziness. So that video,
[1:33:56.660 --> 1:34:02.120]  it's up on infowars.com. That is a huge, huge story. Dredgerport.com is linked to our story.
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:07.400]  Press coverage of Bilderberg highest ever. And we just have links here, hundreds of mainstream
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:12.760]  news publications reporting on private corporate world government that until just a decade
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:18.840]  ago was totally secret out in the open. So globalism, world tax, carbon taxes, it's
[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:25.680]  all out in the open and it's all dead on arrival. How they ever have a private corporate world
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:30.760]  government that would take over and manage our lives and run our lives and tell us where
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:36.240]  we live and what we do. I should talk to executives and media folks. They'd say, Alex, they never
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:40.480]  get away with that. That's outrageous. And I said, they're doing it by stealth and total
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.500]  media coverup. They said, Alex, that would never fly. It's not real. Oh, well, then my
[1:34:45.500 --> 1:34:53.360]  job I learned about 20 years ago was just exposed that it was real and it be game over.
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:59.200]  And so we're now in that process. Instead, they're just trying to normalize world government
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:03.000]  now and go, of course we have private world government that's above the law and taxes
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.600]  you and tells you you're going to live in a tiny apartment and triple charges you and
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:10.800]  takes your car away and you can't have mothers and fathers anymore. And of course, I mean,
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:16.440]  I remember just at the inauguration five months ago, six months ago, January 20th, I was there
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:20.920]  and I was at George Soros script funding an $80 something million for that one March.
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:25.120]  200 something million for the next marches around the country. And they were handing
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:30.160]  out plastic hajibs, American flag hajibs. So I search engine while I was out on the street
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:36.120]  shooting videos, the day after the inauguration. And sure enough, he was funding it. And sure
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:41.880]  enough, it was Muslims running it handing out hajibs. People didn't believe me. Three
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:49.040]  months later, USA Today said liberals now wearing hajibs in sign of anti Trumpism and
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:55.600]  for feminism. Google it. USA Today, hajib, the new sign of feminism. That's like saying
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:36:00.880]  putting Jews in gas chambers is the new sign of you know, Judaism or something. I mean,
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:06.360]  our worshiping Hitler is pro Israel. I mean, this is the upside down crazy town. A jib
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:12.720]  becomes symbol of resistance, feminism and age of Trump. See, I mean, I was stunned on
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:17.200]  the airplane ride back and then I learned it was happening everywhere. We've got a problem.
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:23.080]  The feminists are, you know, coming out doing all this and people are getting upset and
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:26.240]  the Muslims are pushing their agenda of enslaving women. What do we do? The right wing has a
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:31.200]  point. Well, just say Islam is the new feminism. And now that's what they're doing. And then
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:37.000]  I see articles and stories and videos where Oh, there are no white people allowed, you
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:44.840]  know, in Missouri or Kansas or Oregon or Washington or Texas at a campus. And I saw this week
[1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:48.120]  and a half ago, people didn't believe it when we first reported it evergreen state faculty
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:54.720]  turn on professor say he's endangered students when they told him he's a big liberal, big
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:59.640]  SJW uses all the cult language they use. It's crazy. But they said no whites allowed,
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:03.000]  you know, on a certain day in the campus, he said, Well, that's discriminatory. Plus,
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.280]  they have the dorms and it's like not letting black folks go to us, you know, lunch counter.
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:11.960]  They said, Oh my God, you've got to go. It's like Yale and they said banned costume parties
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:17.400]  and the liberal professor goes, Listen, you're allowed. It's free speech. They went literally
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:25.440]  screaming and he was fired from being the assistant dean. So now the college is just
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:30.320]  shut down because this is the social division. The globalists want to test on the campuses
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:35.000]  and it's so weaponized. It's spreading. We're going to talk. By the way, I want to I read
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.720]  this book a while back. I want to carry this, but I'm glad we finally got it. But I want
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:43.320]  to carry this info or store.com. The camp, no campus for white men. Scott Greer. This
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:46.960]  came out a few months ago, six months ago or so, but he is so on target. He's going
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:53.560]  to give us the breakdown of this in just a moment. Follow him on Twitter at Scott Greer,
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:58.560]  Scott in Greer. But before we do that briefly to fund our operation, we had a Memorial Day
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:03.120]  special that was one of the most successful we've ever had because two items were the
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:10.360]  lowest sale level, I mean, lowest price ever. It was 65% off on colloidal silver. I mean,
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:15.360]  for 1995, we probably able to same stuff. It's a whole foods for 2495. At 1995, this

[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:03.840]  at cost, even though after he signed the climate or killed the climate deal and pulled out
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:07.480]  of globalism and stood up the last few weeks, you know, he's rock star popular again with
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:11.440]  our audience. I saw him get totally popular, go down some back up, even though these shirts
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:14.680]  are selling like hotcakes, they're all limited edition. They're at cost because I want to
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:19.640]  spread the word, stand up to bullies and have you be able to meet like minded people in
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:23.000]  your area. They'll get your dinner bought for you in high fives in most areas, but if
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.200]  this Berkley or downtown Austin, you will probably get slapped in the back of the head.
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:29.680]  It's happened to me. So watch out. We got Paul Watson's shirt and Sarbatism is the
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:34.360]  new counterculture and so much more of the triggers. Lib tards. And then finally, we
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.720]  introduced this about a month ago and unfortunately it's been so popular. A lot of the items
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:43.960]  are going to sell out the next few weeks. We've got six new items, non-nano, organic
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:49.720]  SPF, 30% zinc oxide sunscreen, not the nano. It's the natural good kind. We have the DEET
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.760]  free herbal bug spray. It's a cream that works so well. We have the concentrated peppermint
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:59.520]  mouthwash, 10 to 1. We have the pure unscented body wash. We have the pure tea tree shampoo.
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:02.920]  We have the long lasting natural deodorant and more. This is one of the top brands in
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:06.480]  the country, one of the top three you see sold at Whole Foods. We got them to private
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:12.760]  label, 20% off retail and then auto ship, 25% off additional on the EmRick's essentials.
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:16.560]  That's my middle name. That's what the marketing crew picked up on. Kind of egomaniac, but
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:20.000]  that's what they did. They said, well, like Tom's the main or this or that, people like
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.200]  a name. So it's EmRick's essentials. I think it's a good name, but there you go. Infowarsstore.com
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:30.280]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And when you fund us, you
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:35.480]  know it's changing the world. We got a $200,000 contest going that already, I think we got
[1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:42.320]  some winners in DC. You name it. CNN is terror. CNN's fake news. CNN hates America. It's big.
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:46.480]  We just had this guy at 2,500. That's the highest level you can win. The 200,000 of them will
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.960]  be paying out as fast or as slow as it happens. It's about to happen quick. And he just, you
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:56.080]  know, just exposed CNN doing a fake newscast. So 200,000 cash prizes, infowars launches,
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:01.960]  operation, expose the MSM terrorist, do it however you want. If I deem, I'm the judge
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.800]  that you did it. $1,000. If you really do great, 2,500 and I want to pay out. Now, if
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:10.960]  you just kind of get on the internet for five seconds with a sign on our own feed with it,
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:15.400]  I want to give you $1,000. I can't do it. There's a lot of that. Hey, A for effort. But some
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:18.840]  of you got on the news. So we're going to go through that train wreck. So I'll do a lot
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:22.480]  of these contests is actually, you know, getting with you and, you know, getting to you, but
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.560]  it's fun. We want to have you on as guest. That's how we do it. Just like we did with
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:30.640]  the fellow that was our first winner, 2,500 in the last hour. Oh, and we're finding the
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.200]  operation. I should add with limited edition. It's like eight different designs. CNN terrorist,
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:40.640]  white, black and gray T shirts with Kathy Griffin's ugly face. This will bring everybody
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:47.560]  together. So again, info or store.com in fours, life.com or triple A two, five, three, three,
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.800]  one, three, nine and police support our local affiliates as well and their local sponsors
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:57.720]  and spread the word. This is an information war at its critical. Now, I just mentioned
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:04.960]  earlier, I'm not going to recap that campuses all over saying no white people allowed. And
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:09.840]  this is the white professors running this, but then some say this is wrong. This is racist
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:14.160]  and they're driven out. So first, it's Halloween parties and then it's the constitution pocket
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:19.720]  constitutions. The day of absence usually consists of students of color leaving the campus for
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:23.960]  the day to bring awareness to their presence and issues. Now it's you've got to leave,
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:31.000]  which is pure forced segregation and discrimination. So why is the left pushing this? How pervasive
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:37.040]  is it? Why is it so wide scale? We know it's not just mental illness. It's concerted directed
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:41.200]  social control. So joining us, the author of no campus for white men also writes for
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:46.480]  the daily caller. Scott Greer joins us. Scott, thanks for coming on today. Thanks for having
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.720]  me on, Alex. You bet. I've been ranting for five, 10 minutes when we came back from break.
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:54.600]  What do you want to start? I mean, how pervasive this is? What's behind it? Your book chronicles
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:59.840]  it. That's exactly right. I with the, we'll just start with the evergreen thing. I when
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:04.040]  I first heard about this story that they had harassed and intimidated and even forced
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:09.480]  a professor off campus for merely opposing a day to force all white people off campus,
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:14.000]  I was wondering, are these act to these activists here of my book title and then take it up
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:19.120]  as a challenge to make a reality? Because this is like them proving that my book ceases
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:25.840]  exactly right, that they have this secret deep inner racial animosity building up towards
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:30.640]  white people just for a lot of things that they hear from the professors and administrators
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:34.360]  that white people have done all these bad things in the world and that they, everything
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:38.880]  that goes wrong in your, with your life, it has something to do with this evil white supremacy
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:44.160]  that controls America. So when evergreen first proposed this day of absence, usually as you
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:49.320]  get, you previously mentioned, it's usually directed that minority students leave campus
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:53.880]  to show how bad racism is. That's fine. That's, they volunteer to do that and they're not
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:58.160]  forcing anyone to follow along with it. Well, this year, their new idea was to say, why
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:02.800]  do we have to leave campus? Let's force all those evil whites to leave campus instead
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:08.800]  so we can protest racism. This principle, this, excuse me, professor merely said like,
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:13.120]  that's forcing oppression. That's dangerous. You're not helping your cause at all. And
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:17.720]  then they, of course, forced him off due to threats of violence, which the local campus
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:21.560]  police said, Hey, we're not going to do anything about these protesters, but we are going to
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.280]  tell you, you got to stay off campus because things aren't safe. And when you look at the
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:31.720]  videos of this, it's a good point there. They held all the faculty and administrators hostage
[1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:35.280]  in one building and essentially hostage because they weren't letting them leave. And then
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:39.840]  the school president, excuse me, said that like, Hey, I need to use the bathroom. And
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:43.640]  they're like, no, sorry, you've got to hold it. We're, you got to meet our demands first
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:49.280]  before we can let you leave. So this is a extreme example of what we've seen at various
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:55.840]  other campuses of building up demands that are only made for students, students, and
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:58.520]  it's not, it's very racial exclusionary.
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:03.360]  And let's be clear. The Soviets, the Soviets, if somebody did bad something in the neighborhood,
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:08.640]  they would then punish the whole neighborhood, the Nazis, somebody shot a Nazi saying Poland,
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:15.160]  they'd kill the whole street. The essence of authoritarianism is to say, white people
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:21.080]  did some oppressing things in the past. So you, because you look like those people, you're
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:27.240]  now guilty is total mental illness. Plus, in the great aggregate, it was Western Europe
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:31.520]  that ended slavery globally. So this is true ignorance as well.
[1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:36.440]  Yeah, exactly. They don't, they don't really care about history. This isn't about history
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:41.120]  or facts. And they don't ever use reason or data or evidence to support their arguments.
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:46.840]  They just say, this is white supremacy, or this is making me feel unsafe. And I outlined
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:50.520]  this all in no campus for white men. And they deployed these tactics again at Evergreen
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:56.920]  State. The reason why they were intimidating and harassing professors and forced Mr. Weinstein
[1:45:56.920 --> 1:46:02.400]  to leave campus is because they said his views threaten our very existence, that violence
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:05.520]  is going to happen to us, even though they have no evidence to back this up. And there's
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:10.320]  no examples of this happening at any other campus. They said merely allowing this person
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:15.240]  to speak and have these views is dangerous to us. And even when you make the point that
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:19.440]  authoritarian regimes make an example of somebody, you know, they would shoot the neighbor or
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:23.200]  if your neighbor or somebody does something bad, they're going to punish the whole neighborhood
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:28.280]  in order to make the neighborhood get the point. This even happens with Evergreen State.
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:33.840]  Nearly a quarter of the faculty have signed a petition demanding that Professor Weinstein
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:38.880]  be punished for going on Tucker Carlson tonight and sharing his story, according to them that
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:44.360]  launched a white supremacist backlash. Exactly. So they try to kick him off. They threaten
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:49.040]  him. And then because he didn't give in to the bullying, he now needs to be punished
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:56.080]  and destroyed. And let's expand on this. We had, uh, what, was it Missouri State? Missouri,
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:00.760]  yeah. Oh, that's right. Me, soon. I'm teleprompter free. I'm going from memory where they kicked
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:06.520]  all the white students off of the commons area, but they had white professors that were
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:12.960]  enforcing it. And then meanwhile, I saw numbers that it killed enrollment, almost 30% the
[1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:20.920]  next year. This is going to destroy the colleges. Yeah. Mizzou is getting hurt very bad right
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:25.640]  now. They've had to close at least three or four dorms because of how bad enrollment
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:30.240]  is. And it's not even just a Roman alum, alumni donations are also plummeting. So a
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:35.120]  lot of the money that they could count on to offset the bad enrollment numbers isn't
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.960]  coming in either. And that's all due to them catering to these campus leftists. And at the
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:45.720]  Mizzou case, they just made up that there's a systemic racism going on. And they said
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:50.720]  that they're like, well, we found this one graffiti in a, in a, in a restroom that we,
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:55.480]  we assumed is racist. Thus there's racism everywhere and there's white supremacy everywhere.
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:00.720]  And even at some point when there was a mounting criticism of the actions of the protesters,
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:05.680]  they made up that, um, clansmen were roaming the campus and attacking students when there
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:11.600]  was no evidence for that at all. So they will resort to lies and deceit to support their
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:15.280]  cause when they're starting to lose. And we're starting to even see that in the Evergreen
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:20.320]  state where they're saying that like they're saying that there's some white supremacist
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:24.400]  backlash now and they're all their lives are threatened when there's no evidence for that
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:28.200]  at all. They, all these students are safe and sound. The only people who were threatened
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:32.880]  are the professors who will dare oppose them.
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:36.680]  Your book breaks it down and now it's getting worse. Where do you expect this to go?
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:43.240]  Oh, it's getting much worse. I think the only thing they, unless lawmakers start cutting
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:47.760]  funding for these schools, things are getting much worse because really these things have
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:51.560]  gotten heightened ever since Donald Trump was elected president before we hadn't really
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:55.640]  seen violence. We had seen, as you pointed out, showed with the Mizzou clip, you know,
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:00.600]  we saw that they would form a protective barrier and say, you can't come here. They would
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:05.400]  disrupt speeches. They would use, you know, shouts and all that. They wouldn't use physical
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:09.400]  violence. But ever since Donald Trump was elected, we keep seeing violence being used.
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:15.040]  Sure. And we see the media promoting kill Trump. We see MSNBC analysts saying blow up
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:18.960]  his properties, ISIS. Please help us get rid of him. I mean, this is true insanity. No
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:22.360]  campus for white men. Scott Greer is our guest. We're going to break in a moment, but here's
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:26.920]  a clip of a week and a half ago with the no white day. And then I guess some white still
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:29.360]  dared show up. So here's some of that footage.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:49.880]  Oh, this is your racism. Total. I mean, don't you think the KKK thinks they're good to
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:57.680]  do? I mean, it's the same mindless ignorance. Look at these people. I mean, what the hell?
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:06.240]  I guarantee you most of those folks are living on scholarships. You name it, their protection
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:19.960]  from all the imaginary white supremacists. Take this down. We're going to go to bright
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:24.880]  and come back with our guests. Folks, what's happening is I remember being about 11 years
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:29.280]  old, starting to be going to puberty had an attitude problem. And we were walking around
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.560]  in a grocery store and then went to a hardware store and everybody was so nice to my dad.
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.200]  They were all being so friendly to him. And I said, dad, why is everybody so nice to you?
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:42.480]  They said, because I'm cheerful and I'm happy and I smile at them. And I remember having
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:47.600]  that lesson. Oh, if I don't act like a jerk, people like me. So imagine just running around.
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:51.000]  You think there's KKK under the table. You're starting fights with everybody. It's going
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:56.400]  to make you unemployable wards of the state. And that's the social engineering plan. I

[1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:17.360]  We are back live. We're talking to the author, Scott Greer. We wrote No Campus for White
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:23.440]  Men and you see this type of stuff all over the country and it's so crazy you can't believe
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.560]  it because I was brought up, Martin Luther King was a good guy, had a great idea, that's
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.440]  how I was raised. This is 180 degrees difference from Martin Luther King and just the space
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:38.120]  of eight years under Obama, this all happened and then it's all directed by the big foundations.
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:45.560]  It's directed by the media so I guess they want to put us back in groups is what this
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:51.000]  is basically coming down to. Scott Greer, why do you think this is happening? I mean,
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.760]  we know it's an engineered program. Why would Soros fund Black Lives Matters? Why would
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:59.360]  they try to sow all this division? What's going on here?
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:04.560]  Well, I think for the reason why it's happening among the students is that this is a power
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:10.080]  play. This is a way to play these identity politics to say that there's all this racism,
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:15.840]  white supremacy, that all the people who control this are these evil white races. It makes
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:20.240]  for an effective tool to gain more power and gain more advantages on a college campus.
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:26.880]  A lot of these students get into college in large part due to them siding on their application
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:32.040]  saying that I'm a preferred minority that you want due to affirmative action policies.
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:36.600]  Once they get into college in part due to that, it says, hmm, why don't I carry this
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:40.920]  along for the next four years and gain more power and advantages? We're seeing this with
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.360]  the demands that they're making. At University of Wisconsin just a few months ago, they were
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.360]  demanding free tuition for all minority students because of racism that's still apparent at
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:56.600]  the very left wing University of Wisconsin, Madison. At several schools, they're demanding
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:56:02.480]  cheaper dorms that are better than any other dorms that are exclusive only to African Americans
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:07.280]  or Hispanics. And they demand the, and they're able to get these demands by just saying,
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.080]  we're victims. We're, we're oppressed. We're hearing all these microphones.
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:15.920]  Bottom line, the colleges are being held hostage by their own ideology. They were trying to
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.400]  create to go out and hold the country hostage. Their own vile, globalist propaganda of racial
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:29.000]  manipulation is backfiring. Yeah, it's, it's backfiring because most normal Americans are
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:34.640]  seeing these crazy kids yelling over fantasy racism that's not there. I mean, these are
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:39.720]  very left wing campuses ever. How many places in the country, there's thousands of cases
[1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:44.600]  of Jewish groups, black groups, Hispanic groups, but also white groups themselves saying somebody
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:50.000]  burned across or carved something on their dorm or they saw swastika in the clouds. I
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:55.280]  mean, this is crazy. Yeah, they, they, I have a whole chapter in
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:01.520]  no campus for white men dedicated the hoaxes that they use to demand action at these colleges.
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:04.760]  There's several examples. I mean, last year when Hillary Clinton was still running for
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.800]  president, even though she, we might think that she's still running for president by
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:14.000]  her current actions, she highlighted a fake hate crime that had been committed at a New
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:18.040]  York university where three women claim that they were assaulted by racist passengers on
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:22.640]  a bus. It actually turned out that they had assaulted passengers on the bus and that was
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:25.880]  the cause of the fight, but that's caused a huge protest movement to start up their
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:31.120]  campus. I previously mentioned the university, Missouri, where students were protesting there
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:35.080]  over a sketchy allegations of racism, Yale University.
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:40.480]  Let me set her up in the new five more minutes for the next hour if you can. It's not just
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:45.560]  universities too. What is the point of people attacking Jewish cemeteries and then saying
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:49.880]  it's anti-Semitic to get Trump to talk about his first congressional speech and then they
[1:57:49.880 --> 1:57:54.240]  attacked Trump as he privately said it's fake and it turned out it was fake. Why, why are
[1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:57.240]  people staging this?
[1:57:57.240 --> 1:58:01.040]  Because it's a good political tool. If you claim that there's all these hate crimes happening
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:06.400]  because of Trump are, you know, the crazy right wingers or something, you're able to
[1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:11.240]  get more, you're able to dismiss Trump. You're able to undermine him. You're able to undermine
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:15.640]  his supporters and you're saying, oh, all this Trump is causing all these hate crimes.
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:19.800]  So people will and they'll get that individual person will claim them because they'll get
[1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:23.440]  instant sympathy. They'll be turned into a hero. There's that case of people are being
[1:58:23.440 --> 1:58:27.440]  taught. You don't look at a job. You don't work hard. You don't excel that way. You just
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:33.080]  become a big victim. And so they're learning how to just be big drama queen victims as
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.440]  the society prepares to collapse. We're going to come back with a bunch of other guests
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:39.720]  in the next hour, but I want to come back with our guests briefly and talk about how
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:59:04.720]  do we fix this from his research? Scott Greer. Stay with us the third hour straight ahead.
[1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:10.720]  Two years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:16.720]  of their own air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet
[1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:21.960]  war. Pathet engines added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:28.360]  our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:35.360]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated
[1:59:35.360 --> 1:59:41.840]  herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:46.040]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our
[1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:53.840]  bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life.com with Anthroplex.
[1:59:53.840 --> 2:00:12.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:19.200]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:26.520]  to Alex Jones. Scott Greer with us for five more minutes and then we've got our reporters
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:30.200]  back from Bilderberg joining us in studio. I want to show you David Knight. I want to
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:35.120]  get a kid to pop in as well. No canvas for white men. The transformation of higher education
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:40.520]  into hateful indoctrination. This is all by design, but it's backfiring. It's killing
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:46.520]  tuition. It's killing attendance. It's killing alumni contributions all over the country.
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:54.640]  It's still the system presses on because it's about social control and also taking minorities
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:01:00.280]  who are the new majority and putting them into a racial control system again because
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:06.040]  the Republicans for all their problems did in segregation, did break the back of what
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:09.960]  was happening with the Democrats in the South. The Democrats then flip to the minorities but
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:14.040]  have now developed a new racial strategy there. So I don't know how you counter this. I don't
[2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:18.440]  know what you do about it. Folks are just making themselves unemployable. They're creating
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:22.640]  horrible records on themselves and they're also creating such chips on their shoulders
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:26.640]  that they're just mental patients. Social justice warriors, white, black, I don't care.
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:31.160]  I mean, millennials in general, a lot of them are great, but a large portion are just wrecked.
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:37.120]  They are wrecked. Absolutely can't take criticism. Can't take hard work. I don't care what color
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:42.760]  they are. It is devastating. The babies that we've raised here. It's very, very sad. So
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:47.640]  I don't even know how we turned this around. Final comments, Scott Greer.
[2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:52.600]  Well, the first thing that could be turned around, at least on a college level, is just
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:57.040]  for these administrators to tell these kids, no, like, no, we're not caving into your man's.
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.080]  No, we're not firing this. But they're not. They're trying to crucify instead of everybody.
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:05.480]  Yeah. Instead, you know, these professors and administrators caved every demand. If
[2:02:05.480 --> 2:02:10.280]  they stopped caving into every man, if they just refused to give into these bullies, that
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:13.720]  would start a lot of these things. It would just say, look, you can play victim all you
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:18.280]  want, but we're not going to reward your behavior. Whether it's social justice wars or whatever
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.640]  they're black, white, but they act like toddlers, just the flouncing, the throwing fits, the
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:26.000]  rolling around the ground. These are literal toddlers.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:30.720]  Yeah, absolutely. But that's to demonstrate that they're a real victim, that they can't
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:34.920]  control their emotions because life is just so hard for them being oppressed every day.
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:38.520]  What about the how many colleges from your research? I know it's handing out Play-Doh
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:42.360]  and pencils and stuff for four year olds when you throw a fit. They encourage you to come
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:46.440]  and then they have nap times now and you play like you're a baby.
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:52.440]  Yeah. Those are what happen in safe spaces. You see something that upsets you so much
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:57.480]  like a conservative sharing a different point of view. You go to these safe spaces where
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.800]  you can play with Play-Doh and, you know, pretend you're a five year old for a day when you're
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:05.960]  really a 20 year old adult who's supposed to be acting like adult. But this is the type
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:10.600]  of behavior colleges reward. They have, if you play a victim, you're going to get more
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:14.520]  privileges and benefits on a college campus than you were if you're not a victim.
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:18.040]  This is one of those evil privileged people. This is beyond idiocracy and it's supposed
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:22.800]  to come 200 years from now where, oh, you saw a pocket constitution. There's video. Come
[2:03:22.800 --> 2:03:26.720]  here. We have the Play-Doh and they go, and you sit down like you're in kindergarten and
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:32.120]  play with Play-Doh. I mean, what? Yeah. And they, and they'll arrest the people who are
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:37.320]  handing out constitutions. So it's, you know- Oh yeah, I forgot that part. It's always worse
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:40.800]  than I can, I'm sorry. Arrest them and then give you Play-Doh. Sorry, it was, yeah.
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:45.560]  Yeah. They'll always use brute force against the dissidents, the people who oppose the
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:49.840]  snowflakes and the people who are crying and acting like victims. If you're privileged,
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:55.000]  they'll use as much force as possible the actual legitimate oppression upon you.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.680]  But we should be accelerating legitimate privilege for everybody and wealth centers, getting
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:03.920]  everybody into a culture of wealth and success. I'm telling you, we're going to like Venezuela
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:07.000]  very, very quickly. How long is it we can survive under this? Is there any way to turn
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  the tide?
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.480]  Well, there's always a chance that you can turn the tide. I mean, right now, this is
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:17.680]  only really limited to colleges. The real problem is if it gets out into the general
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:22.040]  society, if corporate America starts having safe spaces, if they start putting out warnings
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:27.560]  about microaggressions- Oh no. You know about sensitivity training? It is here, my friend.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:31.120]  Yeah. They already have that. But even if they expand that, I mean, pretty much most
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:36.400]  Maverick children corporations already have that sensitivity training. But if they have
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:40.600]  to deal with these snowflakes coming from colleges and that they're like, well, I can't handle
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:44.640]  this work because it's triggering me. If they just let them sit in a corner and play with
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:48.400]  Play-Doh all day when they're supposed to be working, that's when society really starts
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:49.400]  a problem.
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:52.880]  Exactly. All right. No cameras for white men. Scott Greer. I can't believe I'm even reading
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:56.120]  that headline. It's all out in the open now. Thank you so much, my friend.
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:05:03.360]  Thank you. I tell you, truth is stranger than fiction.
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:07.520]  The collapse of the left continues. After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:11.200]  is now the latest under fire for a public statement. Here's Bill Maher in an interview
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:16.680]  with Senator Ben Sasse. You're welcome. We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:24.840]  Work in the fields. That's part of that. Senator. I'm a house ******. No. It's a show.
[2:05:24.840 --> 2:05:29.780]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember, the left does eat
[2:05:29.780 --> 2:05:34.120]  its own and liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:39.200]  the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of the insane left.
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:42.560]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost him
[2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:47.280]  his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning, which
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:51.560]  will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This is Owen Troyer for
[2:05:51.560 --> 2:06:01.560]  Infowars.com. Are you tired of winning yet?
[2:06:01.560 --> 2:06:05.920]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:10.640]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:16.360]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:22.240]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:27.120]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar. It is a classical 360
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:31.440]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:36.720]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:40.800]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:45.800]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.080]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:54.960]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:58.720]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:03.240]  with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com. It's not just our water we need to filter. It's
[2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:07.080]  not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:12.920]  for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:17.800]  our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:23.480]  Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:28.360]  it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children
[2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:33.480]  for the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:38.880]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:45.080]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:49.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:54.560]  putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:08:12.480]  a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:37.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:45.600]  Well, big props to our crew, Kit Daniels and of course Owen Schreuer and David Knight
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:52.840]  who went to Virginia 20 miles outside the White House where the Bilderberg agenda admitted
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:55.760]  that they are dealing with Trump and a lot of people that were there admit they want
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:00.680]  to overthrow Trump. So global government is definitely in trouble. Drudge had our article
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:05.240]  linked earlier. Press coverage of Bilderberg highest ever. And if you search Bilderberg
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:10.880]  and click news, hundreds and hundreds of articles, this is simply, simply amazing.
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.320]  Why is this important? Because the very people that have been for 30 years cooking up carbon
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:23.040]  taxes with Ken Lay and Al Gore now have a president that delivered and not just delivered
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:27.960]  saying he's pulling out what he said in that 35 minute speech. We're replacing those clips
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:31.600]  again because it's so epic. We're going to get to that. I was asking David, I said,
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:35.640]  what do you want to cover? And he goes, Trump's speech because you just, you've got, I'm glad
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:39.640]  because it was last week, but this has not been given the credit it deserves. So say
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:44.000]  what you want, a good Supreme Court justice, 40 plus percent down the illegals coming in,
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:50.520]  the economy going from stalling to coming back, the global is trying to make that fail,
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:56.240]  crushing the real al-Qaeda ISIS that Obama and Hillary launched. I mean, there's a reason
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:01.240]  they hate Trump. If he wasn't absolutely on target like he is, I wouldn't support him.
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:05.640]  But I'll tell you this, I apologize to the audience that I've not been more supportive
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.920]  of Trump and I've been supportive, but it's just so easy to get into this internet thing
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:15.120]  of, oh yeah, he didn't do perfect on this or that. He's under total siege. They're trying
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:20.720]  to overthrow him. I'm surprised he's getting anything done. And if we have this attitude,
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:27.120]  we're going to lose, okay? But we're in a very exciting time right now because some
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:31.240]  people also say we're going to cover this topic. Oh, Alex, you used to expose false
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:35.400]  flags and now you're not. These are clearly false flags in England. Yeah, the false flags
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:38.680]  bringing in 5 million military engagement into Europe and England. Yeah, the false flags
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:42.440]  letting them travel back and forth and in my five and in my six ordered not to stop them.
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  Yes, the higher ups are protecting them. They are letting them happen. Why? Because they're
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:50.480]  going to take your freedom and take internet freedom, as I keep saying, from everybody.
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:55.600]  So the answer is deport the Islamists, the folks that have ISIS flags on their Facebook.
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:59.680]  You go to their house, they got an ISIS flag. They're not a British citizen. Deport their
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:06.280]  ass. I mean, this is simple. Paul Watson had kind of a chilling end of his four minute
[2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:12.680]  report on this that I agree with in part. I mean, it's spirit, but here's the problem.
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:16.000]  It's got to be for folks that have proven they've done something wrong. But again, that's why
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:22.680]  our governments won't do anything. They're bringing in incompatible day of the dead meets
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:28.040]  Fred Flintstone who have this obsession with killing women. They were showing the guys
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:32.160]  that got killed in the terror attack at London Bridge. Just look like Charlie Manson, you
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:39.080]  know, wishes he looked like those lunatics. I mean, these people are just cavemen. Okay.
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:42.600]  And I mean, I've been in the mall, man, with the guys you know, just got off a plane a
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:46.720]  month ago, women in full burkas staring at my daughter's like, they can't believe little
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:50.840]  girls are walking around with open and the men are like a block. And then I watched the
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:56.600]  videos, they go, they are weak. They're women are ours. We take it from the man. We destroy
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:01.560]  Russia. We destroy Europe and America. And then Russia there fights back. So Russia is
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:05.560]  the enemy as our government's allied with it. It's the Bilderberg. It's the globalist
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:10.440]  confab. It's the example of the big roundtable group. It's the enemy and it's on its heels
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:15.440]  now, but it's trying to strike back with a summer of rage, economic implosion and more.
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:18.560]  So let's go to David and the no insurer for the balance of the segment each with about
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:21.520]  a three, four minute statement on what you witnessed, what you saw, then we'll get into
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:25.400]  the meat and potatoes as we move forward. Alex, you know, the reason we're talking about
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:28.880]  playing these clips of Trump is because I said the thing that was different this year
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:35.960]  was as it was beginning, Donald Trump ended their climate treaty agreement out of Paris.
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:40.600]  And one of the things that was on their public agenda, and of course they never even admitted
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:43.920]  that they existed, let alone that they were meeting, they wouldn't give us a list of who
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:48.920]  was there until you started covering it for a number of years. And then after the, I think
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:53.560]  it was after what, 2013, where it was so big at that point, and they started releasing
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:56.280]  the names of people they said were going to be there. But of course we see that there
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:00.760]  are other people who did go besides those. We've got pictures of that. But what they
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:06.840]  said was, will globalization be slowed? Well, the day that the convention began, their Bilderberg
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:11.680]  meeting began, he put a massive pothole in front of them. But they're not going to say
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:14.880]  it's going to be stopped. They're not going to say it's going to be reversed. Their thing
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:18.560]  is, will globalization be slowed? Yeah, it has been slowed. It has been slowed to the
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:22.440]  Paris Agreement. And as you were talking about the different people in his cabinet, and I'm
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:26.760]  very concerned, as I said from the very beginning, people like Rex Tillerson, others, the influence
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:32.560]  of Jared and Ivanka, and the three of them were saying, stay in the, the Paris Agreement.
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:36.880]  You had other people who were pushing to get out of it, like Scott Pruitt, the EPA, and
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:41.160]  a brave lawyer who made the case to them that if you don't end this, even though it was
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:46.480]  not ratified by the Senate, you would have lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit to try
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:51.560]  to force you to do things that are in that Paris climate. And then the left was all howling
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  and saying, getting, killing. Oh, he wants to kill the earth. All it is is a carbon tax
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:00.080]  that everybody else is exempt from. The lawyer, I think that had the most effective statement
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:05.320]  was the one who put this to Trump and said, you're about putting America first. The Paris
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:10.760]  Climate Agreement puts America last, dead last behind the people that they say are causing
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:15.000]  the problem like China. They're allowed to continue to grow 2030. Yeah, exactly. They're
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:18.600]  continued to allow to grow to 2030. Then they cap it. Then they start to put some reductions
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:23.240]  on. No, they're taking this out of America. It's an obvious, ridiculous, insane screw
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:28.720]  job. And the best line was, I represent Pittsburgh, not Paris. That's right. Absolutely. And
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:32.360]  so I think it was very important to see that. And as they were going back and forth saying,
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:36.000]  how did we lose this fight? We had this debate that was going on. And then he had somebody
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.720]  who was one of the losers came out and said, well, Trump was never debating this. He never
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:44.600]  had anything good to say about the plant, the Paris Agreement. And that's because it's
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:49.800]  always a giant. Exactly. He's real. Yeah. And he's proving it. So now I know you didn't
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:52.880]  like him at first. You had reservations, but you liked him because you saw the big pillars.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:56.640]  He was against, you know, a man by his enemies, but now it's Trump. Not amazing. Yeah, we've
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:00.880]  had a lot of really good things. This is he needs to be very big thing. I know we don't
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:04.800]  just give people praise, but he's under attack. He I think he really needs it. Yeah, absolutely.
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:08.800]  Look, he stood up to these people, even the people that he appointed. He stood up to these
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.920]  people at the G seven and Merkel. I thought he was going to do this because Merkel was
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:18.000]  apoplectic after this. She said it was six against one. And this guy is going to burn
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.840]  everything down. Yeah, he destroyed their agreement because their agreement was to destroy
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:26.400]  America. And they admit that and they admit that. And then all he's doing is trying to
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.000]  help the average American or global worker. It's going to shut all them down too. It wasn't
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:35.400]  even about the climate. We don't even have to talk about the global tax that controls
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:40.320]  who can work and live. Oh, and Shroyer. Well, and I asked the people on the streets that
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:45.200]  didn't like Trump, why they liked the Paris Climate Agreement or why they think it was
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:48.880]  such a good thing. And they didn't have any answers. They couldn't tell you any details
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:52.240]  about it. They couldn't tell you. No, just I'm saving the earth. I'm good. You're a
[2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:58.440]  Nazi murderer. Carbon dioxide is pure poison. And if they would actually read the document
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:02.800]  and look into it for themselves, if you were actually concerned about climate change or
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:06.520]  may make global warming or whatever nonsense it is that they're trying to push with this
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:09.880]  Paris Climate Agreement, you would read it and you would say, well, wait a second, this
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:13.960]  doesn't actually address that. This doesn't actually help that. All this does is handy.
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:20.280]  It ups toxic waste output by moving it to 167 dirty countries. So it doesn't even do
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:23.400]  what they're claiming they want it to do. And then you can go beyond that. If they have
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:29.080]  smoke stacks like the old ones, spewing mercury in particular, I'd be suing them myself. Our
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:34.680]  coal plants have scrubber analysis and planes that fly over. Zero comes out with carbon
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:38.480]  dioxide and water. And that's what makes you believe in God. You have the ancient history
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:42.760]  of this planet. You have obviously our modern creation by God, but you're looking at I'm
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:46.520]  not going to debate its age. It's been proven by the carbon dating on the rest of it. Regardless,
[2:16:46.520 --> 2:16:51.800]  the planet has much larger carbon dioxide, much lower carbon dioxide than it did previously.
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:56.480]  Hundreds of times higher. We're losing our atmosphere like Mars. It's like we came along
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:01.080]  right on time to take the oil out of the earth, which the science is showing isn't is an animal
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:07.320]  based and are now terraforming the planet to keep it alive. We need more carbon dioxide.
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:10.560]  And I'm saying that as someone who's researched the chemistry. Yeah, well, it's going to make
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:14.120]  the plants grow. But look, you're an engineer. You want to speak to that briefly? Yeah, well,
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:17.680]  you know, we know that it's a closed system. We know that you have an increase in carbon
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:24.400]  dioxide is going to cause the plants to take that in, put out more oxygen, grow more rapidly.
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:28.680]  And it's where our atmosphere comes from. Dumbasses. It's called a closed system. It's
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.060]  evidence of design. But Alex, when you're talking about this, you're, you're, you're
[2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:36.360]  pointing out that this is actually going to make things worse. You're exactly right
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:39.880]  because what's going to happen? You put these kind of controls in American industry on American
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:44.360]  energy production. People are going to move their plants more to China is going to be
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.120]  more outsourced like they already did. Exactly. And so that's going to continue to increase
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:52.440]  for another 13, 15 years before they even cap it. Oh, and I interrupt you. I'm sorry.
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:55.600]  Well, actually, I just wanted to get back to Bilderberg and just get off the climate
[2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:59.840]  agreement for a second. You know, I didn't see anybody from mainstream media out there
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:04.060]  the entire weekend. Now, this is something that we would say, okay, we're not shocked
[2:18:04.060 --> 2:18:07.200]  by that. The mainstream media has been ignoring Bilderberg for years. They would tell you
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:11.440]  that it didn't exist just 10 years ago. Okay. So wow, the mainstream media ignores Bilderberg.
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:16.160]  Not shocked there. But here's why it's a big story because this is a Pandora's box now,
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:21.600]  Bilderberg that people I think can start to see and wake up to. Some people say, oh, wow,
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:25.800]  a secret meeting of people, world elites. Oh, okay, that's not the worst thing in the world.
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:29.320]  And then they look into it and they see that they hire security to outnumber anybody on
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:33.080]  the streets, 10 to one. They see that they hide themselves behind fences, yet say that
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:38.880]  you can't have a border on your on your country wall. So it's just all of this nonsense hypocritical
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:44.000]  BS. But think about it like this, Alex. Okay, so you've got a meeting of world elites. They
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:49.360]  put out their agenda. It's bigger than G 20. And imagine G 20 isn't covered. And Trump
[2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:54.200]  is at the top of the agenda. Okay, so you're telling me that we've got American world leaders
[2:18:54.200 --> 2:18:59.520]  meeting in secret with Trump top of the agenda. They admit no US media. How do you not report
[2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:05.080]  on that? Whether you like Donald Trump or not. How do you not report on this meeting of
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:10.280]  because you have to admit that that info wars and everybody was right. So well, and that's
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:13.840]  I guess the case and they just don't want to draw attention to it. So you know, Bilderberg
[2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:18.640]  wants to push it out like, oh, we're going public. Here's our manifesto. Here's our talking
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:21.760]  point. But really, that's the cover of acting like there's nothing there. And then the and
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:25.920]  then the silence is even greater, except for international media. And you can look at their
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:29.400]  talking points and you can pretty much break them down. Actually, our new cameraman who
[2:19:29.400 --> 2:19:33.960]  went out on his first trip with us to Bilderberg did a great job. He actually shot a report
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:37.600]  with you, Harrison. Oh, Harrison's awesome. Yeah, he went on his first road trip this
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:44.240]  weekend. And he even shot a report breaking down the propaganda bit by bit, all 13 talking
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:48.000]  points. They want to act like they've got everything cool under control. They are under
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:52.640]  crisis management right now, Alex. They are seriously under crisis management. Trump has
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:56.600]  not quite been the wrecking ball. But that what he did to the Paris climate agreement,
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:00.800]  the TPP NATO, that's the President Trump we want. That was a big strike. That was a big
[2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:06.080]  of yeah, this is Michael David from Seattle. I'm 51 years old. And six months ago, I started
[2:20:06.080 --> 2:20:11.600]  taking Andrew 400 to increase my testosterone. Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat. My
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:17.440]  waist went from size 38 to size 32. I have more energy, and I looked and feel 20 years
[2:20:17.440 --> 2:20:22.880]  younger. And now my wife tells me I have to take Andrew 400. Hi, this is Ron Johnson from
[2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:28.200]  Utah. After 10 weeks of taking Andrew 400, I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36
[2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:32.920]  to 33. That was eight years ago. I continue to take Andrew 400 and I've maintained my
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:40.360]  weight at 172 gained muscle and energy. I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.

[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:21.760]  David Knight is going to be doing the fourth hour today in about 35 minutes. He's going
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:25.040]  to leave us at the end of this segment. And one of our great researchers and writers,
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:29.200]  Kit Daniels, the story was up on DrudgeReport.com today. Bill LaBeurre is going to be popping
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:33.800]  in with Owen Schreuer. I also intend to play a few clips here of Trump's speech. We will
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:36.960]  be taking more calls throughout the week. I took a lot of calls yesterday, but I saw
[2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:41.240]  people get really energized by Trump the first 70 days. Then he made some bad decisions.
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:47.200]  The first big one was going for Obamacare light. Then when people saw a better version come
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:50.240]  through, they got happier. But when they saw him kill the climate accord, when they saw
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:55.200]  him stand up to globalists to start getting more hardcore again, when they saw him continue
[2:24:55.200 --> 2:25:01.680]  the travel ban, it's a gauge. I mean, Trump t-shirts were selling 500 a day until about
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:07.040]  day 70. Then we were selling like 50 a day. Now they're back up to, you know, 500 a day.
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:11.120]  People say, oh, we must make a lot of money. No, we're selling them at cost. So the point
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:16.120]  is, is that people are really behind Trump and he needs to know that. Go with us. We're
[2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:20.080]  backing you, but he's got to know that. I think we should all target Trump and let him know
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:25.620]  fireside chat, fireside chat, fireside chat, fireside chat. Do it. Do it. Don't let producers
[2:25:25.620 --> 2:25:30.720]  come in. Don't make it too complex. Do it clean. Do it. Do it now. Take action. Donald
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.640]  Trump. I agree. And I think what he ought to do, Alex, is use it as a bully pulpit. He
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:38.960]  has these, the ability to talk directly to people that Ronald Reagan always said he's
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:42.520]  going to go over the heads of Congress and the press, but he never had the tools to do
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:48.080]  that. Ronald, uh, Donald Trump can Ronald Trump. Yeah, Ronald Trump, he can get the crowds
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:52.920]  and he has Twitter. And what he should do is use that, not to fight with the press,
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  but to fight for the agenda that he got elected for and to get people to fight with him against
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:02.720]  and pick one narrowly focus on one issue at a time and then go for it. And of course,
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:06.680]  when we see this, that's a big win when he does that type of thing. So already he's
[2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:11.720]  got out, gotten out of TPP. He's gotten out of the Paris climate agreement, which was
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.580]  not a treaty. It was self ratified by Obama. That was very important. Now we've got other
[2:26:16.580 --> 2:26:21.040]  people like Wilbur Ross, who was at, uh, Bilderberg saying, well, we're not out of TTIP, the trans
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:25.520]  Atlantic partnership. I think that Trump is going to shut that down as well. But what
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.680]  we've seen though is he keeps their people in. We now learn to keep the enemies closer.
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:33.240]  That's right. By the way, I've told you this, you may have been told, Megan Kelly wants
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:36.480]  to interview you tomorrow. Okay. That's a problem. You're going to sit your way right
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.240]  now. You might want to change out of it. I don't know. No, I mean, she wants to get
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:45.080]  a few of the other crew and she wants to interview me like eight 30 at night. You know, obviously
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:49.160]  things all be exhausted, uh, which I will be, but I don't care. Uh, but what do you think
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:53.120]  about that? It's like, she goes, I've got Putin, you and then Trump. So I'm kind of
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:57.160]  impressed. We were just, uh, outside reporting on the ambush predators at Bilderberg because
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:00.480]  that's the way they operate. They, they stealthily get in. They move very slowly and then all
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:04.000]  of a sudden they strike. And that's what we see with these jihadis in London. You know,
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.960]  I did a report, Alex, uh, we were, everybody was talking about CNN as ISIS because Kathy
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:14.080]  Griffin is holding up this icon of the jihadis. The, that, that was the symbolism that she
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.840]  was doing, but it's really Bilderberg that is ISIS because Bilderberg are the ones.
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:22.240]  They're fighting the EU program with Peter Sutherland, the open borders. They're behind
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:27.080]  it all. We don't just say, Oh, they're ISIS CNN supported the Arab spring supported al-Qaeda
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:34.280]  and ISIS. They support them in Syria, the white helmets. CNN is ISIS. Theresa May says
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:39.640]  the internet is the breeding ground of terrorism. No open borders allow them to get onto your
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:44.720]  ground. Don't take all our internet freedom away. They already use, we'll criticize ISIS
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:48.600]  and they'll suspend our Twitter or Facebook saying, Oh, we don't promote hate. I have
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:51.600]  a right to expose these people. I'm not even showing their head shopping.
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:55.920]  The real breeding grounds of terrorism, as I pointed out, were Syria and, and Libya before
[2:27:55.920 --> 2:27:59.920]  that. And before that, it was Bilderberg that created all of these conflicts that created
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:03.920]  the regime change. They created the chaos and civil war and they're working with us
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:10.400]  to bring the people into our countries, create chaos and civil war, use this to enact controls.
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:14.400]  And that's what she's now moving towards. So in that sense, yes, it is a false flag,
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:17.520]  a false flag from Bilderberg, but they're not necessarily directly controlling these
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:21.560]  guys. As these guys are out there, the government didn't want them named. Why? Because it probably
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:24.960]  be embarrassed and then they are going to be embarrassed and they should be embarrassed.
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:29.240]  They had BBC doing a documentary on the jihadi next door. And at the same time, as you've
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:34.600]  talked about, they're this, the same guy is in a park. They unfurl an ISIS flag and they're
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:37.880]  all sitting there bowing down and worshiping it. Were they arrested? Were they deported?
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:41.080]  No, they were quote, had an altercation with the police. The police didn't do anything
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:43.840]  about it. That's right. If you or I put a manifesto out that we want to murder innocent
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:48.040]  people, we can be arrested. It's premeditated. When you're bowing to an ISIS flag and in
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:52.480]  documentary saying jihad, you just admitted you don't want to be an open free society
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:56.640]  and you're planning on killing people. Bye bye. And if you resist, we come to deport you.
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:00.520]  The cops are going to machine gun your ass. And it's not that we're looking for violence
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:04.840]  here. You're calling for it. You want to wear a uniform. You want to run a military flag
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:10.240]  up and then dance around and kill little girls at a concert. We're going to kill you.
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:13.960]  And he was filmed at an event, Alex. And this is what the guy that he was standing next to
[2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:18.840]  said. The Sharia is coming to the UK. This black flag you see here one day is going to
[2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:24.360]  be on 10 Downing Street. They have declared their intentions. They have flown their body
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:28.760]  got a Muslim mayor. They've already got a Muslim mayor bringing in Sharia law and saying
[2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:31.840]  don't worry about terror. This is the way it's going to be. This is the way it's going
[2:29:31.840 --> 2:29:35.880]  to be. Yeah, well, you know, con, listen, if you love Islam so much, go back to an Islamic
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:40.640]  dirt bag country. And again, I was against all these wars. We were taking out secular
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:45.080]  countries, but now the war is here on us. I'm not losing my liberties and I'm not putting
[2:29:45.080 --> 2:29:48.840]  up with your crap. All right. Thank you, David Knight. I want you to stay with us. Tons
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:53.080]  of news. Donald Trump and Kit Daniels straight ahead. We're on the march. The empire's on
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:30:05.880]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. The collapse of the left continues after Kathy
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:10.200]  Griffin's epic meltdown. Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public statement.
[2:30:10.200 --> 2:30:14.240]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sasse. You're welcome. We'd love to have
[2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:20.600]  you work in the fields with us. Work in the fields. That's part of that. Senate. I'm
[2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:29.080]  a house. So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember,
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:33.600]  the left does eat its own and liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher,
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:38.200]  who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of
[2:30:38.200 --> 2:30:42.320]  the insane left. While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't
[2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:46.520]  cost him his job. I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing
[2:30:46.520 --> 2:30:50.960]  and burning, which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This
[2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:56.920]  is Owen Schreuer for info wars.com. Are you tired of winning yet?

[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:41.720]  front lines of the info war. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're here week
[2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:49.200]  days 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. We're trying to add more broadcast. Not just the nightliness.
[2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:54.680]  We appreciate all your support. You know, I grew up and as a child, you know, you tend
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:57.560]  to listen to your parents, but as you get a little bit older, seven, eight, nine years
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:02.520]  old, you get sick of hearing about it. And you know, you hear your grandfather going,
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:07.120]  yeah, we raised Colonel Travis's son and this side of the family launched a whole attack
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:12.480]  and we met with President Jackson. You're, you know, this great, great, great grandfather
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:18.440]  years with the then the special forces of the day to go into Texas and run the operations.
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:25.240]  And then we shipped in 10,000 bibles at Galveston. And then we shipped in the weapons here and
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:29.920]  you're hearing about preparations to start war with Mexico 10 years before. Make no mistake.
[2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:37.280]  It was all a setup. The United States took, took, took Texas from Mexico, but just didn't
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:41.760]  want to look bad doing it. So set it up. And the argument was, you know, it was run by
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:47.200]  a bunch of dictators and the rest of it, but I would hear all that. And I would just think,
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:52.040]  you know, this is ridiculous. This is just arrogance. I'm sick of Texas. I'm sick of
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:55.640]  America. I'm sick of, because you just think this is a bunch of propaganda. Then you grow
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:34:58.640]  up, you travel the world, you think God is for who your family is. And I'm not bragging.
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:02.240]  It's like you're going to a lot of other stuff that he's even more off the chart that I'm
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:05.000]  not even going to get into on air because someday I think I'm going to get into some
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:10.880]  of it with the founding of the stock exchange in England and the tutors and the stewards
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:14.760]  and the, and the, and the founding of the country and the Mayflower and all the rest
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:23.720]  of it. But the point is that then I think about the Muslims whose population has doubled
[2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:34.120]  the last 25, 30 years to 1.4, 1.5 billion. It's set to double again by 2030, 3 billion
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:40.760]  plus. And they're getting the same stories about your granddaddy blew these people up
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:45.360]  and this person did that. And these are men. These aren't wimps. They go target wimpy
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:48.160]  targets because under Islam, they're taught that makes everybody run away and you take
[2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:52.200]  the village over. You blow people's women and kids up. They tend to, you know, leave
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:57.120]  and they got these latest guys and it's just like, I mean, I, I see these guys in Austin
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:02.040]  now bugging their eyes out at me like they want to kill me and women and burkas, man,
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:07.280]  I'm not just talking about the jibs and I am offended. Just like I would hear the KKK
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:11.440]  was coming to town and I'd go protest them 15 times. I didn't do that to virtue signal.
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:14.960]  I did that because I heard about all the horrible stuff they did back when my dad was a kid.
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:21.760]  Now my grandfather stood up against them because there might be some racist black people are
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:25.480]  Hispanic people, but he wasn't going to get on that level of the KKK. He was going to
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:30.680]  go out and stand up against it and he was going to cut, you know, cut the taxes of black
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:36.080]  people and white people in state government. But, but that's a whole another story. That's
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:40.520]  called pride. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't need you to be low for me to feel big and
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:48.160]  Islam, the orthodoxy of it, this is their reformation is exploding and our elites have
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:55.600]  decided to team up with it. We have this clip. Let's play it from Fox of identifying some
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:01.440]  of these guys. And it's always the same thing. Pakistan, Morocco, Syria, Libya and who is
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:05.160]  our government in Europe backed? I'll give England this credit. England's done a lot
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:09.640]  of bad stuff. Six years ago and five years ago, England finally said, we're not backing
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:13.280]  you in Syria. We don't like what you did in Libya and we're going to sit out and France
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:20.560]  quarterbacked all this to their shame. And I'm not some anti-Frank file here. They quarterback
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:28.000]  putting the most radical, horrible, Wahhabist Muslims in and they want you to know when
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:31.520]  you're at the mall and your daughters don't have, they've pointed your daughters in front
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:37.200]  of you and, and, and, and you're sitting there as a man just literally got stuff, you know,
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:41.600]  what I mean, scenarios runs your head. You're just sitting back going, man, what the hell's
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:46.160]  wrong with our government? And you get fundamentally pissed off and then you stop going to the
[2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:54.200]  mall. Then you stop going out because it's just like, what in the world is this? I am
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:38:01.160]  offended. Like if I saw some black guy pulling a plow with a ring through his nose, man,
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:05.840]  I would like kick the ass of the person driving the black guy. Not because I'm some goody
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:12.100]  tissue. I fundamentally get pissed and I see some, you know, the Muslims in their track
[2:38:12.100 --> 2:38:18.360]  suits and their women are all scared wearing Jawa outfits, man. I get pissed. I'll be honest
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:25.640]  with you. We spoil our women in America. They get so spoiled, they run around and want to
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:30.680]  be under her jibs now. I don't know what to do anymore at this point. I just, it's getting
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:35.040]  crazy. People are going crazy and it's not just some passing fab with liberals that love
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:39.680]  Islam. They hate this country so much. They're just such trash. They're social envy people
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:42.680]  and most of them are white. And I don't want to just have to be a virtue singular. It's
[2:38:42.680 --> 2:38:46.560]  true. Our problem is liberal white people. They're the leaders of turning the blacks
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:50.600]  into racists. They're the leaders of trying to lead the Hispanics into crap. The Asians
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:54.400]  are too busy working and getting jobs, being smart, being the richest people. The top six
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:58.000]  slots, the richest groups, those couple of Asians, they're like, you're going to go kill
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.880]  each other neck like assholes. Excuse me for that. We're going to go make money. I am
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:08.200]  just, I am so fed up with this at this point and I am so angry. And you were making a great
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.760]  point earlier before we went to break or during the break about people not getting three,
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:18.240]  four dimensional chess. They think it's checkers explaining the process. You had a great allegory
[2:39:18.240 --> 2:39:22.040]  for it. Oh, and Shroyer, well, and let's keep in mind too, these are the same white liberals
[2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:26.960]  that will complain when a cat cafe moves into a neighborhood that it's gentrifying it.
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:31.280]  So it's bad if white culture tries to infiltrate anywhere, but, but if there's an empty, if
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:36.120]  there's an empty asphalt drive thing and people put in a cat sanctuary and bring value to
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:37.120]  the area, God forbid.
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:41.240]  But, and it's also okay if, you know, you want to force Sharia law and, you know, Islamic
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:44.680]  culture here in America. That's okay. They want to force that on you. But the point that
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:49.200]  you were making at the end of the point you made, yeah, well, I think that it needs to
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:53.360]  be talked about more because like you said, people don't understand how this, this whole
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:58.640]  thing has evolved. Alex, you covered for years at nauseam, what the United States government
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:03.920]  was doing to fund proxy wars, to destabilize the Middle East, to force regime change. Hillary
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:08.920]  Clinton brags about it in Libya. Yes, you reported on that. You called that out. Now
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:13.160]  they act like that's our weakness. Oh, you were against the wars. Yeah, blowing up countries
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:18.000]  where rock and roll music was on and 60% of the graduates were women like Libya and Iraq.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:19.400]  Yeah, we're against that.
[2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:25.240]  So now we're sitting here in the aftermath of all of that. They're trying to clash civilizations
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:29.400]  in the West. They've already done it in Europe. Yes, this is the aftermath of the news that
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:33.480]  you and we already reported on for years. But then they get mad at us for reporting
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:37.860]  on it now, complaining about it. And it's like, well, hold on, I'm allowed to protect
[2:40:37.860 --> 2:40:42.080]  myself interest. Okay, I'm allowed to protect. Yeah, we didn't want to blow the radical Muslim
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:47.160]  dam open, stir them up and bring them here. Now the globalists did it. Now we're not
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:51.040]  going to go along with it. So we're not going to cook. See, we lost that last war. We're
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.200]  not losing this one. Exactly, Alex. And I think that I have, uh, and we were in
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:41:00.440]  the right then and we're in the right now. I think that I have an idea here for what
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:04.760]  President Trump can do with this travel ban because they keep trying to shut it down.
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:08.680]  Uh, now they're admitting, okay, yes, the president does have the state department's
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:12.920]  just ignoring him. Well, and so what they're saying is, hey, hey, when states would desegregate
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:17.080]  like Arkansas, Eisenhower, Marcy army and Trump are the Marcy army in the State Department
[2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:21.240]  and throw all those people out on their asses, they're involved in espionage for the globalist.
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:25.040]  Their computers should be searched. They should be shown being run by Soros. They should be
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:29.840]  arrested. They want war. They want death. They want it. Well, and I think, and by the
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:34.720]  way, we just took the White House. Okay. Don't think we're playing games, jackasses. We want
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:38.600]  to fix things peacefully. So here's what I think President Trump can do because they're
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:43.440]  trying to say, well, these courts, these judges are shutting down the travel ban because it's
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:48.720]  it's segregation. Okay. He's discriminatory. That's what they're trying to say, uh, why
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:52.880]  they have this precedent to stop the elected president, these unelected judges. So here's
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:58.600]  what I think President Trump can do. President Trump, please get this message. Trump's advisors,
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:04.240]  please get this message. This is how we can beat them. Okay. You have to play, just twist
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:07.520]  their minds with this stuff. This is what President Trump needs to do with the travel
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:11.320]  ban. Instead of calling it a travel ban or, or whatever he wants to call it, this is what
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:16.400]  he needs to do, Alex. And this will completely defeat the entire agenda against it. Here's
[2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:19.040]  what he comes out and he says, all right, we're eliminating the travel ban. We're done
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:23.160]  with that. We're going to come out with a new thing. This new bill is called, we are
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:27.520]  banning countries that we've bombed for the last eight years. This is countries we've
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:31.760]  bombed for the last time in the ban. Boom. Oh, the countries we've bombed for the last
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:36.160]  eight years ban. Oh, wait, that makes sense. That's not a religious thing. Let me go further.
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:41.800]  Let me go further. We're going to ban countries that execute gays and enslave women. And then
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.400]  that's those countries. There you go. Oh, oh, we're going to boycott people that kill
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:49.920]  gays. So that's what I'm saying. Yeah. You put that in the bill. You put that in the
[2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:55.040]  bill. And then if you have, what is the liberal response going to be? Think about it, Alex.
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:42:58.520]  They're trapped. They're complaints of Trump card. They can't do anything because what are
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.400]  they going to deny? They can't deny that Obama bombed these countries. No, it's all genius.
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:09.040]  We should go with my point too. Kit. Yeah, it's like, we should just call it the blowback
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:14.200]  ban. That's what it is. You know, it's going back to what Owen just said about Trump is
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:17.760]  cleaning up their mess. Yeah, exactly. It's like we're, it's almost like we're pulling
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:22.320]  a judo move on to the masters of judo moves, but we're not even doing that. All we're doing
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.440]  is realizing the truth of it. Yeah, we are banning countries that are throwing gays off
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:32.040]  of rooftops, but we won't hear that in Western media. Yeah, exactly. Your country says stone
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:36.560]  gays, you're banned. It's always, and I don't do that to patronize the gays. I don't want
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:41.120]  to kill you. Yeah, just don't try to teach five year olds how to get blowjobs. Yeah,
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:44.200]  going back to, and this ties into what Owen just said about the cat cafe. It's always
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:49.880]  about redirecting the left's anger at complete nonsense. The same thing with Bilderberg.
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:53.280]  Everything Bilderberg represents was what Bernie Sanders was speaking out against during
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:58.000]  the campaign and Antifa. Yeah, but you don't see anybody there from Antifa. You, I don't,
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.520]  I don't remember seeing anyone who voted for fascist, literal global fascist meeting zero
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:06.240]  anti you got a bunch of and political. That's another great point. Why does the left never
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:11.440]  protest Bilderberg? Yeah, they're total hearsay mafia. You know, over the weekend, no individual
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:15.920]  thought over the weekend, Politico put out this article on how Trump was, everybody that
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:19.800]  Trump invited to the White House was old, rich white men. So I tweeted back. I was like,
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:23.440]  so why aren't you reporting on Bilderberg? Because that's the same thing. Yeah, but then
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.920]  they, here's the thing. They always prop those photos. He's bringing in record. Now it doesn't
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:32.520]  matter. He's delivering lower taxes, good things for everybody and actually trying to
[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:37.880]  make it about sovereignty and wealth, not about what racial group you're in. Yeah. And
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:41.000]  that's what he says. He says, I think that the answer to all these questions, you know,
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:44.480]  if you, they want to bring up racism, they want to bring up this, he says jobs, we're
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:47.120]  going to get you a job. We're going to get you a career. You know, we're going to get
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:50.840]  you a job that provides for your family. You know, and the elites already decided we need
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.320]  a future without humans. I want to shift gears now into some other clips. I said, I have
[2:44:55.320 --> 2:44:58.120]  some of these clips and there's a bunch of them. We have clip number three from last
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:03.000]  week and the four clips of Trump is historic space. I want to play that Trump, you know,
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:09.280]  killing this America, destroying carbon tax. Here it is. I'm willing to immediately work
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:17.960]  with democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that
[2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:26.720]  are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal that protects our
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:35.240]  country and its taxpayers. He's so classy. That's exactly what they don't like about
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:40.880]  him. So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non obstructionists.
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:45.920]  We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:49.720]  be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our secret ribs when we're making
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:54.720]  the deal with the Democrats. That obstructionist term he's using is brilliant to represent
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:58.480]  either the Paris, that's what Obama tried to say, that we can do that's much better
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:04.040]  than the Paris Accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled and I think
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:09.480]  then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we're out of the agreement.
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:15.960]  Boom. I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:23.920]  issues. But under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:34.720]  are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. No responsible leader
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:43.960]  can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:54.880]  decision. I'm going to tell you the Trump secret. He's super alpha OCD about things working,
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:56.640]  he hates seeing the country fall apart. For 10 years they can't make the new digital catapults
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:00.960]  work for aircraft when aircraft carriers and the military doesn't want them, the Navy doesn't
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:07.440]  want them. And he didn't start screaming, get rid of the GD electronic, we're going
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:10.720]  back to steam because he'd already seen the reports and they're telling him, no sir, it
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:15.520]  doesn't work. He goes, go back to steam. They act like he's an idiot who's against technology.
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:19.080]  No, he's not. He just knows if it isn't working, go back to what works. Well, there's this
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:24.440]  new crime in liberal minds that it's a crime to be wealthy or it's a crime to have a lot
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:28.840]  of money. But his economy is based on service. Let's finish the clip. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:35.880]  Here's the president. Listen, why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:43.120]  up and bound down huge, huge, huge thing you kept. It's to give their country an economic
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:47.320]  edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm global is a mess. That's
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:51.600]  just truth, man. That is the truth. To do everything within my power to give America
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:58.040]  a level playing field. And to create. Oh my God, how dare you this Russian regulatory
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:03.960]  see if this is dirty Russian, this Russian agent, America, America, that's Russia and
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:07.040]  productive. Did you hear George Washington was a Russian? Russia has been ruling the
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:15.600]  planet for 500 years with the reptilian standard of living. The highest standard of environmental
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:29.080]  is moving along in Congress. And I believe this was really about manmade climate change.
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:32.840]  It'd be happy to negotiate this with him, but they're not going to do that. It's a carbon
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:37.560]  tax. No, it's let's shut the president down. Go ahead. Make your point. It's all about
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:41.240]  economic terms of surrender. That's exactly how they're proposing to this is like the
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:46.560]  Soviets Algor to giving it's naked. It's ridiculous. We have to make the cuts Europe
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:53.600]  does nobody else, which by the way, no, this is the biggest story. I think in this whole
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:59.240]  climate change thing is that still to this day, no matter how many times I beat my head
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:05.080]  making this point, they will not address chemtrails. They want to say manmade climate change, manmade
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:09.120]  global massive geoengineering while they're literally spraying chemicals all over the
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:13.840]  air. They completely ignore that. By the way, it's cut way back to Trump. And so, and so
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:20.280]  but get this CNN and kit shot this report. I shot this report yesterday. CNN puts out
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:25.000]  an article admitting that, Oh, here's all that we're going to come back from break with CNN
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:29.440]  amidst weather engineering and chemtrails. Let me just say this briefly. What? Folks,
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:33.240]  I want to hire a bunch of reporters. I want to launch a bunch of new shows. Hillary says
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:37.240]  that in fours lost for the election. Well, we were part of it. You really lost the election.
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:42.440]  You did that. So bang for your buck. We have great non GMO heirloom seeds, great water

[2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:10.760]  may be near. Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions
[2:51:10.760 --> 2:51:15.320]  from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:19.600]  looting of stores and city shutdowns and our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:24.320]  grid vulnerable to long term outages from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from
[2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:28.720]  any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:33.560]  national emergency. That's why you need your own plan for self reliance. That's where

[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:17.520]  all the MSN, but here's the New York Times. Drug deaths in America are rising faster than
[2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:21.760]  ever. They were like, how dare you want kids to die from guns and I'm sad it happens, but
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:26.640]  it's a couple thousand a year. Most of it, you know, in crime and I'm like, there's hundreds
[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:31.040]  of thousands of drug deaths a year from prescription drugs. That's your main sponsors. And now
[2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:32.040]  there it is.
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:36.440]  Before I go any further, this isn't about worshiping a personality. It's not about
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:42.000]  doing that because I don't care about Hollywood. I don't care about George Bush or Obama.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  Trump is under such attack. He's delivered so good under such attack that I just think
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:51.440]  we he's not going to be perfect, but he's proven himself so good. The enemy hates him
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:56.760]  so bad. He's done so much good. I think we really ought to all really thank God for
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:54:57.760]  Donald Trump.
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:01.360]  I just just brief comments for both of them because I want to get into Hillary claims.
[2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:05.000]  She's not turning to prayer. I just I was praying against her last week on air.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:08.760]  Yeah. Well, is she praying to Satan again? Yeah, go to head. But yeah, about Trump, it's
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:12.800]  like, yeah, I don't agree with everything he's done, but he is trying. He is trying.
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:17.160]  That is a big, big plus and he's an American president. What I'm saying, don't have instant
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:23.080]  gratification. I mean, it's like they hating. He's so good. Yeah. Forget Trump. We should
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:26.300]  be thanking God for Donald Trump.
[2:55:26.300 --> 2:55:30.360]  And like you said, we're not in a cult ritual here of praising Donald Trump and anything
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:35.280]  he does. We'll have things we disagree with Trump about. But the main point is more praise.
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:41.480]  The more he is our guy, when he has our support, he responds and we if he fails, it's our fault.
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:45.840]  But that's the thing, Alex. You never had a feeling that Barack Obama was ever the president
[2:55:45.840 --> 2:55:46.840]  of the United States.
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:50.560]  This is, this is it. You know, this is America fighting for its life. I can feel it. So,
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:54.760]  so that's the support. That's why we get behind Donald Trump, because at the end of the day,
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:59.280]  he represents us. He doesn't have foreign interests in mind. He doesn't have lobbyists
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:03.120]  in mind. He doesn't have anything else. He has prosperity. America. He didn't just represent
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:07.000]  us. He fought for us. He stood up. He didn't have to do this. He took the slings and arrows.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.280]  He probably lost what billions of dollars standing up for us. He has the whole elite.
[2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:14.680]  Oh, he lost billions in his companies. His golf courses are close to shutting down. Yeah.
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:17.840]  But he did this for us. So it's like, we, we got to return the favor. We got to stand
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:21.640]  up for him because he said America gave him everything. He loves it. Yeah. He's well known
[2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:24.760]  for hanging around with the blue collar workers. Not as some stunt. He really does it. He doesn't
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:30.000]  like elites. He will, he buys golf courses all over the world that are, that are racist
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:35.320]  and opens them to everybody. Yeah. How dare he? He opened up his companies, the gay employees
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:40.280]  in management 30 years ago. It's just, the point is, is that it's not that he's even
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:44.120]  pushing that agenda that he believes Christians should be able to live like they want. He's
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  for freedom, ladies and gentlemen. And he's under attack and he needs your support. And
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:52.080]  so do we. I'll just tell you closing before David Knight comes up. I just sent four people
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:55.640]  to Bilderberg. That is expensive. I want to send reporters everywhere. I want to hire
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:57:02.160]  more reporters. I want to do more. I want to pay our crew better. So info or store.com

[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:42.600]  60 years ago, 70 years ago. Now it's bearing fruit. We're winning on every front. And when
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:46.280]  you videotaped seeing into an effect report in London, are you videotaped something local?
[2:57:46.280 --> 2:57:51.080]  Are you speak out? Are you put out the Intel or are you calling the C span? All of it together
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:55.080]  is wrecking the enemy. There's a war and we need your support.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:59.320]  What amazed me about being at Bilderberg this weekend was the fact that yeah, we're getting
[2:57:59.320 --> 2:58:04.200]  way more pet press coverage, the highest ever on Bilderberg. But what amazed me was the fact
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:09.120]  that people showing up to the rally that Owen and I and others put together pulling people
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:12.640]  away from the Trump White House rally after it was over to come to Bilderberg. All the
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:16.480]  people that showed up were mainstream people. These were people that were watching Fox News
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:20.600]  like five years ago and then pay attention to Info Wars. Now they're going to, then they're
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:25.120]  caring about Bilderberg. So we're winning. We're taking over the Republicans. We're
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:29.080]  taking over the Democrats. Humanity is rising and we're having a huge effect because our
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:34.040]  listeners are the heart of this and have supported us. And that's absolutely right. Yeah. We're
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:37.960]  on the march. Different backgrounds are standing up and standing together. And think of all
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:42.560]  the money Bilderberg spent to make sure no media covered it. We are there saying no. There
[2:58:42.560 --> 2:58:46.240]  are people that aren't bought and paid for five more minutes than David Knights coming
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:51.760]  in. Stay with us. Spread the word info wars.com. It's an act of resistance.
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:56.280]  Info Wars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state of the art line of
[2:58:56.280 --> 2:59:01.200]  advanced highly tested body armor from info wars store.com. Defender Body Armor is certified
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:06.800]  of protecting into all handgun rounds, even armor piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds. The secret
[2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:11.440]  to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary process and technology that disperses more
[2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:15.920]  kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor using one of the strongest
[2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:21.120]  synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight, Ali et al. Defender
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:25.720]  Armor is also super compact and lightweight. There's a reason the department of defense
[2:59:25.720 --> 2:59:31.120]  chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works. Defender
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:35.240]  Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic
[2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:40.240]  resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory. Defender Body Armor
[2:59:40.240 --> 2:59:45.260]  is now available through info wars store.com so you can defend yourself, your family and
[2:59:45.260 --> 3:00:13.120]  finance the info war against the globalist all at the same time. A total 360 win.
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:20.580]  America can be great again. She must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[3:00:20.580 --> 3:00:21.580]  show.
[3:00:21.580 --> 3:00:27.620]  Alright, I've been a ranting kid and cutting into your time. I appreciate the great work
[3:00:27.620 --> 3:00:30.420]  you did. Go ahead and make some points in closing that I want to destroy your will and
[3:00:30.420 --> 3:00:31.420]  have a nice taking over.
[3:00:31.420 --> 3:00:38.420]  Well, like I said earlier, the fact is that the left is always controlled by Bilderberg
[3:00:38.420 --> 3:00:43.780]  and these other global bodies and they have this legitimate frustration at the establishment
[3:00:43.780 --> 3:00:47.900]  but they're always steered towards using that frustration onto nonsense issues.
[3:00:47.900 --> 3:00:52.740]  They advertise being leftism as the way you're rebellious. No, free markets, the ultimate
[3:00:52.740 --> 3:00:55.460]  rebellion because it puts you in charge.
[3:00:55.460 --> 3:01:00.500]  And Bilderberg represents everything that the left stood against. You got Bilderberg
[3:01:00.500 --> 3:01:08.220]  just like 0.0001% of the population in control. It's like a bunch of old rich white guys that
[3:01:08.220 --> 3:01:14.240]  have been like 10, 10, 12 generations. People give Trump crap for, you know, getting a million
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:18.860]  dollar loan and making it into a billion dollars yet you got the Bilderberg elite that are
[3:01:18.860 --> 3:01:19.860]  what?
[3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:20.860]  Just trillions of your tax money.
[3:01:20.860 --> 3:01:24.140]  Yeah, they've been rich. They're old money rich families. They've been around for like
[3:01:24.140 --> 3:01:25.260]  five, 600 years.
[3:01:25.260 --> 3:01:28.980]  And we're not class envy. Just stop trying to get rid of the class altogether so we
[3:01:28.980 --> 3:01:30.500]  can't be part of the middle class.
[3:01:30.500 --> 3:01:34.260]  Just get rid of the elitism that is controlling everything and funneling all the wealth and
[3:01:34.260 --> 3:01:36.380]  resources to a handful of families.
[3:01:36.380 --> 3:01:37.380]  Vertical integration.
[3:01:37.380 --> 3:01:38.380]  Yeah, it's not free market.
[3:01:38.380 --> 3:01:40.460]  That's their admitted plan to total consolidation.
[3:01:40.460 --> 3:01:45.260]  Yeah. And then the left is always against war. But then Bilderberg, it's been documented
[3:01:45.260 --> 3:01:48.980]  that they have fueled every single major conflict that's been around for the past 50, 60 years.
[3:01:48.980 --> 3:01:53.540]  Oh, yeah, I was there like, it was like eight years ago that was in Chantilly.
[3:01:53.540 --> 3:01:57.780]  And the left is always about inclusiveness. Yet Bilderberg, there's like what less than
[3:01:57.780 --> 3:02:01.700]  25% of the attendees at Bilderberg this year were women. Even less than that were minorities.
[3:02:01.700 --> 3:02:06.140]  Oh, I was at Chantilly. I mean, they're three times at Bilderberg there. I mean, they're
[3:02:06.140 --> 3:02:09.980]  twice. You guys have been there the third time. And this guy pulls up, works for the
[3:02:09.980 --> 3:02:14.620]  State Department. He gave me his car. He said, I trust you don't burn me. He goes, there's
[3:02:14.620 --> 3:02:18.780]  all these documents. This is Bilderberg with the CIA State Department, how they were overthrowing
[3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:23.940]  the unions, jobs, but then turn the unions into bad things. And it was all the documents,
[3:02:23.940 --> 3:02:24.940]  how they did it. It was incredible.
[3:02:24.940 --> 3:02:28.340]  Yeah, because even some of the people that go to Bilderberg, they don't agree with, necessarily
[3:02:28.340 --> 3:02:33.180]  agree with all of the worst policies of Bill Peter, Peter Thildos. I'm not lionizing him.
[3:02:33.180 --> 3:02:36.620]  Three points, Kit. Well, and Alex, there were a lot of the police officers that were on
[3:02:36.620 --> 3:02:40.500]  the scene that were listeners of yours as well. They've talked to me a lot of our listeners.
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:45.300]  And I think that there's a new momentum. And I think the Bilderbergers are starting to feel
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:49.140]  the heat. Well, here's what happened when I was first there. I guess it was like more
[3:02:49.140 --> 3:02:52.900]  than say every four years they're there. So it was how many years would four, four, four
[3:02:52.900 --> 3:02:57.780]  be 12 years ago? Wow, I'm getting old. I was first in Chantilly 12 years ago. The cops
[3:02:57.780 --> 3:03:01.660]  had known we were and they've been told we're playing violence. A few of them are listeners.
[3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:04.740]  And they kind of left us alone by day two. The next time, hey, Alex, how's it going?
[3:03:04.740 --> 3:03:08.260]  Hey, what's some Gatorade? Oh, yeah, well, this guy's your camera off F them. I know
[3:03:08.260 --> 3:03:11.780]  the blah, blah, blah, we're going to win. And then I guess by this time it was the same
[3:03:11.780 --> 3:03:14.940]  cops in Chantilly. How are they? Well, the cops were fine. And I think that they were
[3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:20.380]  a little upset that they basically got had to get public funds to basically do nothing
[3:03:20.380 --> 3:03:25.380]  and protect these rich elites with public money. This is a good point. There was a festival
[3:03:25.380 --> 3:03:30.100]  in Fairfax County, I believe, down the street from Chantilly. And there was hardly any cops
[3:03:30.100 --> 3:03:33.780]  there because all the cops, the county cops got pulled on to Bilderberg. Sure. But I just
[3:03:33.780 --> 3:03:36.940]  said the cops liked us by the second time I was there. It's not it's not just the cops.
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:40.020]  How are they by the third time? They were they were very nice. Like I said, they were
[3:03:40.020 --> 3:03:45.220]  smiling. They said to say hi, you know, give Alex our shout out, you know, and I will
[3:03:45.220 --> 3:03:48.780]  also say this, I'm going to see that's victory. I'm going to look into this a little bit more.
[3:03:48.780 --> 3:03:52.740]  But and I don't want to throw throw this source under the bus because they shared with me
[3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:58.220]  some private information. But it's more than just the cops, the other people that are involved,
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:02.140]  the other people providing security and other things for this event. They also, I think
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:06.180]  are more they are the Marines and everybody hates. And so so but because they all know
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:10.940]  Trump's in, they get like Trump's at the White House. We're protesting this. This is the enemy.
[3:04:10.940 --> 3:04:13.740]  And this is the winning team. And that's what happens. People want to be on the winning
[3:04:13.740 --> 3:04:17.420]  team. We're the winning team. So join the winning team. I want to put out a few facts
[3:04:17.420 --> 3:04:21.700]  here before I get off, Alex, just to point out the modern day craziness that we're living
[3:04:21.700 --> 3:04:25.780]  in with the Overton window. Liberals, this just shows you the mindset of liberals right
[3:04:25.780 --> 3:04:30.980]  now. They're more upset. They were more furious over Donald Trump removing the United States
[3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:36.020]  from the Paris Climate Accord. Then they were over the terrorist attack in London. And then
[3:04:36.020 --> 3:04:40.260]  they are over. David Knight's not going to mind you guys. He was part of the show. He'll
[3:04:40.260 --> 3:04:42.540]  be happy to do one more segment with David. I'm going to get out. He'll come sit in this
[3:04:42.540 --> 3:04:46.340]  chair. You come make your points for the one more segment. And then David will host the
[3:04:46.340 --> 3:04:50.140]  rest of show. So David Knight's coming in right now. He'll have his own show soon. So
[3:04:50.140 --> 3:04:54.860]  he'll have more time than he wants. And he always does a great job. And I'll have David
[3:04:54.860 --> 3:04:58.420]  come in and take over. Please don't forget, folks, the big specials, the biggest ever,
[3:04:58.420 --> 3:05:05.660]  really on several products in the day. The collapse of the left continues. After Kathy
[3:05:05.660 --> 3:05:09.980]  Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public statement.
[3:05:09.980 --> 3:05:14.020]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sasse. You're welcome. We'd love to have
[3:05:14.020 --> 3:05:20.340]  you work in the fields with us. Work in the fields. That's part of that. Senator. I'm
[3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:28.860]  my house. So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator. But remember,
[3:05:28.860 --> 3:05:33.420]  the left does eat its own and liberals are now calling for his firing. Perhaps Bill Maher,
[3:05:33.420 --> 3:05:37.980]  who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of
[3:05:37.980 --> 3:05:42.140]  the insane left. While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't
[3:05:42.140 --> 3:05:46.300]  cost him his job. I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing
[3:05:46.300 --> 3:05:50.740]  and burning, which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections. This
[3:05:50.740 --> 3:06:05.180]  is Owen Troyer for info wars.com. Are you tired of winning yet? Let's go to debit in

[3:08:11.380 --> 3:08:22.380]  the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:22.380 --> 3:08:26.940]  I'm David Knight here with Kit Daniels and Owen Schwerer, first we were at Goldberg this
[3:08:26.940 --> 3:08:32.340]  last week. Owen was just making a point before we went to break the last segment. Owen, finish
[3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:35.540]  up with the point that you were just about to get to before you ran out of time.
[3:08:35.540 --> 3:08:40.140]  Well, one thing that I at least hope for people that are in the middle ground right now as
[3:08:40.140 --> 3:08:44.380]  politics seems to have so much gravity, everybody is starting to become interested in politics
[3:08:44.380 --> 3:08:48.700]  is trying to expose the double think mindset of the left. What I was saying before the
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:53.900]  break is just look at the liberals, look at the Democrats. They're more upset over a Paris
[3:08:53.900 --> 3:08:57.700]  climate agreement that they've never read. They don't know any details of they're more
[3:08:57.700 --> 3:09:01.340]  upset with the United States getting removed from that than they are over millions of aborted
[3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:05.260]  babies than they are over radical terrorist attacks. I mean, that's just the fact you
[3:09:05.260 --> 3:09:08.380]  can look at their reactions and how they respond to it.
[3:09:08.380 --> 3:09:14.020]  Another thing, you know, we we just report on the truth about radical Islamic tear. Okay,
[3:09:14.020 --> 3:09:18.260]  I've never said that every Muslim is an evil person. I've even said many times I've met
[3:09:18.260 --> 3:09:23.140]  many peaceful Muslims. Okay, so I will sit here and say that there are peaceful Muslims,
[3:09:23.140 --> 3:09:27.220]  not every Muslim is a peaceful or somebody that wants to kill you or stab you or throw
[3:09:27.220 --> 3:09:34.260]  gays off a roof. Okay, those are heretics, but you don't have people on the left admitting
[3:09:34.260 --> 3:09:38.460]  that there are violent Muslims. They just completely ignore that even though there's
[3:09:38.460 --> 3:09:43.660]  video in the streets again now after the London attack, there's videos of Muslim people getting
[3:09:43.660 --> 3:09:48.780]  out of their cars celebrating in the streets after the most recent attack in London. So
[3:09:48.780 --> 3:09:53.100]  the Liberals will just completely ignore that. And then another thing that we briefly talked
[3:09:53.100 --> 3:09:56.020]  about earlier, we didn't make to the story, but we followed the report. You can see it
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:10:02.500]  on the Alex Jones YouTube channel. CNN admits manmade climate change. They write a story
[3:10:02.500 --> 3:10:08.860]  about how NASA is sending up chemicals into the sky, strontium, barium, chemical mixtures
[3:10:08.860 --> 3:10:11.940]  into the sky. They're going to blow them up in the sky. And then they're saying it's
[3:10:11.940 --> 3:10:15.740]  a magic light show and you get to see the new clouds being made and it's going to look
[3:10:15.740 --> 3:10:22.260]  cool and even though they've had to now delay the launch of this because the chemicals were
[3:10:22.260 --> 3:10:28.020]  going to fall back down to the earth and harm humans, it's okay to put in the sky though.
[3:10:28.020 --> 3:10:33.140]  So thank you CNN for covering that as you report on manmade global climate change, but ignore
[3:10:33.140 --> 3:10:38.420]  the actual manmade climate change. And then the final thing I wanted to say too was front
[3:10:38.420 --> 3:10:44.180]  page of the Wall Street Journal, jobless rate lowest in years, okay? And that's what Donald
[3:10:44.180 --> 3:10:48.460]  Trump thinks is going to rejuvenate this country, getting people back to work. So he is coming
[3:10:48.460 --> 3:10:53.620]  through there. Jobless rate is now at historic lows in recent years.
[3:10:53.620 --> 3:10:59.020]  Spot on, spot on. I would disagree with one thing you said Owen and that would be who
[3:10:59.020 --> 3:11:04.340]  the heretics and Islam are. Are the heretics the people that are peaceful or the heretics
[3:11:04.340 --> 3:11:07.980]  the jihadis? I would say that the heretics are the people who are peaceful. I would say
[3:11:07.980 --> 3:11:10.300]  that they're the ones who don't know what the ancient techs are.
[3:11:10.300 --> 3:11:12.020]  That's what I meant. Thank you for clarifying that.
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:16.660]  And exactly. I know that that's what you think. And so we have to understand that. And I think
[3:11:16.660 --> 3:11:22.780]  the CNN photo op, Owen, that we saw is evidence of that because why don't we see this massive
[3:11:22.780 --> 3:11:28.780]  pushback from true Islam against the jihadis? Well, of course, we don't see that. So CNN
[3:11:28.780 --> 3:11:33.140]  has to manufacture it. And as I tweeted up, here's the steps for CNN. Number one, call
[3:11:33.140 --> 3:11:38.300]  central casting. Number two, get some Muslim women. Number three, as you can see in that
[3:11:38.300 --> 3:11:42.380]  video, position them carefully into a photo op and then give them your scripted narrative
[3:11:42.380 --> 3:11:47.300]  about how this is not true Islam. No, it is true Islam. It is true Islam. You have to
[3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:51.260]  understand, I got into this immediately when I put out this, when this first came out,
[3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:55.020]  I said, unconfirmed report, car drove into crowd, three men jumped out with knives, slitting
[3:11:55.020 --> 3:11:59.140]  throats, stabbing a girl in the chest, so forth. I said, religion of peace. And this
[3:11:59.140 --> 3:12:02.820]  woman came back to me and said, very Christian of you. What would Jesus say? And I said,
[3:12:02.820 --> 3:12:07.540]  well, what Jesus would say and do is that we have to defend innocent life. And of course,
[3:12:07.540 --> 3:12:11.280]  we know that Jesus went after the bankers. The bankers are the ones who are ultimately
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:14.700]  behind this. They're the ones who started these wars. They're the ones who are sending
[3:12:14.700 --> 3:12:19.340]  our troops abroad and then bringing the jihadis into our country. That's kind of a foreign
[3:12:19.340 --> 3:12:23.620]  exchange student program that they've got going from Bilderberg, from the bankers, from
[3:12:23.620 --> 3:12:28.700]  the globalists. And so I said, well, you know, why don't you just read what Jesus said and
[3:12:28.700 --> 3:12:33.060]  read it? She said, why don't you think for yourself and stop reading these ancient texts?
[3:12:33.060 --> 3:12:37.700]  Well, you need to read the ancient texts to understand the foundations of our Western
[3:12:37.700 --> 3:12:42.580]  society. They're Christian. And you need to read the ancient texts to understand the
[3:12:42.580 --> 3:12:48.060]  foundations of Islam. It is anti-Christian. It is the cult of death that you see on the
[3:12:48.060 --> 3:12:52.300]  streets here. So we have people who are cultural Muslims who don't do any of this. And of course,
[3:12:52.300 --> 3:12:55.860]  you see this unfolding in the Philippines. You've had a large area there that has been
[3:12:55.860 --> 3:13:00.020]  Muslim since the 1300s. But you didn't have this kind of conflict that they're having
[3:13:00.020 --> 3:13:05.620]  now in the Philippines until just recently. It began to build. First, they demanded that
[3:13:05.620 --> 3:13:11.700]  they have a separate government. So they created Muslim Mindanao as an autonomous region.
[3:13:11.700 --> 3:13:16.820]  And so they got their autonomous government. And then they got the lowest per capita income
[3:13:16.820 --> 3:13:21.220]  of any part of the Philippines because they isolate and ghettoize themselves. And then
[3:13:21.220 --> 3:13:26.180]  they had this massive influx in recent years of foreign Muslims coming in who are pushing
[3:13:26.180 --> 3:13:28.180]  true Islam, I would say, who are pushing fundamentalism.
[3:13:28.180 --> 3:13:29.180]  Real hardcore Wahhabis.
[3:13:29.180 --> 3:13:33.700]  And when we talk about fundamentalism, what that means is that you go back to the core
[3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:38.180]  beliefs of your religion. That is what is fundamental to it. So we're talking about fundamentalist
[3:13:38.180 --> 3:13:44.420]  Islamists, the jihadis. That is true Islam. And so these true Islamists come in and it's
[3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:48.100]  like, no, no, no, no. You don't want to have anything to do with the kafir. You must kill
[3:13:48.100 --> 3:13:51.220]  them wherever you see them. You must do it for Allah. And the next thing you see,
[3:13:51.220 --> 3:13:52.340]  they're slitting throats.
[3:13:52.340 --> 3:13:56.180]  Well, the people, the mainstream media is always claiming is so-called moderate Muslims.
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:13:59.620]  They're the ones cheering on these terrorist attacks. Yeah, they're peaceful, but they're
[3:14:00.900 --> 3:14:04.580]  cheerleading on, you know, London attack and all these truck attacks.
[3:14:04.580 --> 3:14:06.580]  And like the mayor, don't worry about it.
[3:14:06.580 --> 3:14:12.100]  This isn't even an attack on Islam, but the problem is that now the orthodoxy is like you
[3:14:12.100 --> 3:14:15.220]  said, it's Wahhabism. It's the fundamental violent Islam.
[3:14:15.220 --> 3:14:19.940]  Yeah. Well, and think about this, too. Remember, after a terror attack happens,
[3:14:19.940 --> 3:14:23.380]  Trump says, this is why we need the travel ban. This is why we need the border wall.
[3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:28.340]  And then the entire left media says, Oh my gosh, look at evil Donald Trump trying to politicize
[3:14:28.340 --> 3:14:35.620]  a terror attack. Oh, really? Oh, really? CNN? You literally staged an event to politicize
[3:14:35.620 --> 3:14:40.580]  a terror attack. Nope, they don't fall in under any attack for that, though. They get to politicize
[3:14:40.580 --> 3:14:44.580]  it to however extent they want, not President Trump. He doesn't get to touch it.
[3:14:44.580 --> 3:14:47.700]  You know, one of the reports that I did when we were there was he was so nice.
[3:14:47.700 --> 3:14:50.740]  He was just such a nice guy. And that's what his neighbors were saying about him.
[3:14:51.300 --> 3:14:57.220]  And of course, this is a guy who the neighbors, even though he had been the star of a documentary
[3:14:57.220 --> 3:15:02.500]  done by the BBC called the jihadis next door that came out last year, his neighbors still
[3:15:02.500 --> 3:15:07.140]  didn't know that they had a jihadi in their midst. This is a guy who with a bunch of other people
[3:15:07.140 --> 3:15:12.900]  went down and then for old a flag, they worshiped an ISIS flag. And then they got into an altercation
[3:15:12.900 --> 3:15:15.700]  with the police. The police didn't arrest them. They didn't deport them.
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:19.780]  I wonder, guys, what do you think would have happened in 1940 when the British
[3:15:19.780 --> 3:15:25.460]  were fighting the Nazis? If they had a guy parading around in a Nazi uniform with a Nazi
[3:15:25.460 --> 3:15:29.140]  flag holding Nazi rallies in the middle of London, I think something would have happened to them
[3:15:29.140 --> 3:15:32.740]  by the people. They would not have been that much asleep. That actually did happen. You remember
[3:15:32.740 --> 3:15:37.140]  you had the American Bun Society, which is basically an unofficial Nazi party in America.
[3:15:37.140 --> 3:15:41.140]  They were shut down by like 38, 39, because they couldn't go out on the street. I think their
[3:15:41.140 --> 3:15:46.980]  leader even got arrested at one point. But today, that doesn't happen. Why? Because they've been
[3:15:46.980 --> 3:15:52.180]  thoroughly indoctrinated in the government schools to say, don't criticize these people.
[3:15:52.180 --> 3:15:56.500]  And as I pointed out to this woman, I said, so you don't have a problem attacking Christians.
[3:15:56.500 --> 3:16:00.580]  You will not defend them. You'll verbally attack them as you're being physically
[3:16:00.580 --> 3:16:04.180]  attacked by the people that you defend. This is the ultimate in political correctness.
[3:16:04.180 --> 3:16:08.900]  And it was absolute political correctness for the government. The BBC is documenting this guy.
[3:16:08.900 --> 3:16:14.340]  The British police see this guy here. He's known individual. And yet what they're telling us today
[3:16:14.340 --> 3:16:18.580]  is like, yeah, we knew he was a jihadi. We knew he loved ISIS, but we didn't know that he was
[3:16:18.580 --> 3:16:22.900]  planning anything. Dave, this reminds me of the whole clock kid thing from about two years ago
[3:16:22.900 --> 3:16:27.860]  in his family. The Obama administration, the mainstream media were trying to create this
[3:16:28.660 --> 3:16:33.860]  appearance of this family as being, you know, moderate Muslims. And this kid was just a tinker,
[3:16:33.860 --> 3:16:38.820]  you know, a dinner kid and this and that. It was just this whole fake narrative to make this family
[3:16:38.820 --> 3:16:41.940]  look like, you know, the peaceful Muslims down the street that you don't have to worry about.
[3:16:41.940 --> 3:16:46.100]  And that's why we need to bring more of them in. But it was a complete fabrication. As I said,
[3:16:46.100 --> 3:16:49.700]  as I exposed in a video, this kid, all he did was take apart a clock and throw in a suitcase.
[3:16:49.700 --> 3:16:54.980]  And it was actually his dad that did it. And his dad turned out to be this huge activist who was
[3:16:54.980 --> 3:16:59.540]  pulling off stunts like this. They want to pin us down, though. And because
[3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:04.180]  we didn't like George Bush bombing in the Middle East, forcing regime change. We didn't like Obama
[3:17:04.180 --> 3:17:08.180]  doing that. But that doesn't mean that we have to take all these people in. They try to say,
[3:17:08.180 --> 3:17:12.020]  oh, but look at all the bad things the United States has done in the Middle East. Yeah, we reported
[3:17:12.020 --> 3:17:15.940]  on it. We didn't like that. But I still want to protect my self interest. I still want to protect
[3:17:15.940 --> 3:17:19.620]  my country. Well, the issue is that they use that as an excuse to bring these people in. And going
[3:17:19.620 --> 3:17:23.860]  back to my analogy of a guy parading around in a Nazi uniform in the height of World War II in
[3:17:23.860 --> 3:17:28.660]  London, what would people have done that would have attacked him, of course. And that's precisely
[3:17:28.660 --> 3:17:32.980]  what they want to do. The people today that are there, the jihadis that are brought in,
[3:17:33.700 --> 3:17:38.020]  they don't wear a uniform, do they? They don't self identify, except sometimes when they unfurl
[3:17:38.020 --> 3:17:44.020]  the ISIS flag, they don't self identify. So they want to get to the situation where, because somebody
[3:17:44.020 --> 3:17:48.340]  looks Middle Eastern, or because somebody is, let's say, maybe wearing a turban. And they might be
[3:17:48.340 --> 3:17:52.980]  a Sikh who has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. But then they get attacked by skinheads,
[3:17:52.980 --> 3:17:59.060]  for example. They want to create this division, this chaos, which will lead to a civil war. You
[3:17:59.060 --> 3:18:05.780]  have to understand the Bilderberg individuals have plotted out this consolidation, this destruction
[3:18:05.780 --> 3:18:10.020]  of national sovereignty for a very long time. They're the ones who are behind the regime change
[3:18:10.020 --> 3:18:14.740]  in Libya in Syria that has fermented ISIS, that created ISIS, that is now bringing this into
[3:18:14.740 --> 3:18:19.060]  our country. And they want to create regime change, chaos and civil war in the West. They're doing it
[3:18:19.060 --> 3:18:24.020]  very gradually. This is how it is escalating. Believe me, it's not going to be that much longer
[3:18:24.020 --> 3:18:28.260]  before even in London, you're going to have people being attacked because they look like
[3:18:28.260 --> 3:18:32.180]  they're Middle East. If this continues, that is precisely what they want.
[3:18:32.180 --> 3:18:39.060]  Yeah, exactly. It's about turning over this whole thing against radical Islam back into
[3:18:39.060 --> 3:18:43.380]  this race war narrative that they control. It's just manufactured chaos.
[3:18:43.380 --> 3:18:43.940]  Yes.
[3:18:43.940 --> 3:18:48.660]  Well, it's amazing too how you can have such a radical difference just in a short time span
[3:18:48.660 --> 3:18:56.020]  of 16 years where you go from literally saying you're launching a war against Islamic terror,
[3:18:56.020 --> 3:19:00.660]  blaming Islamic terror for the biggest terror event in United States history on 9-11,
[3:19:00.660 --> 3:19:03.940]  to now saying, oh, these are peaceful people. We need to let them in.
[3:19:03.940 --> 3:19:04.980]  That's an excellent point.
[3:19:04.980 --> 3:19:10.820]  So it's just like, how do we go from that narrative to the complete opposite in 16 years
[3:19:10.820 --> 3:19:13.700]  and the entire public just remaining asleep on the whole deal?
[3:19:13.700 --> 3:19:17.220]  If you go with the official story on 9-11, it's like we're supposed to go into Iraq,
[3:19:17.220 --> 3:19:20.260]  which is the most secular country in the region because...
[3:19:20.260 --> 3:19:21.300]  That's where they went first.
[3:19:21.300 --> 3:19:22.900]  Yeah. Supposed to Cai's 9-11.
[3:19:22.900 --> 3:19:23.700]  Total non-sequitur.
[3:19:23.700 --> 3:19:25.300]  Just like now they want to.
[3:19:25.300 --> 3:19:32.340]  But now it's like, not only is Iraq a mess, but the whole al-Qaeda, ISIS, whatever name it is now,
[3:19:32.340 --> 3:19:33.620]  is now in the West.
[3:19:33.620 --> 3:19:39.060]  So after 9-11, they invade Iraq, and now they're going to invade the internet
[3:19:39.060 --> 3:19:41.140]  because it's free speech. That's the problem.
[3:19:41.140 --> 3:19:45.940]  Meanwhile, the very Islamic extremists that we launched the war on terror against under George
[3:19:45.940 --> 3:19:48.020]  Bush are invading us in Europe.
[3:19:48.660 --> 3:19:49.620]  All right, thank you guys.
[3:19:49.620 --> 3:19:50.660]  Great job in Bilderberg.
[3:19:50.660 --> 3:19:51.860]  We're going to be right back.
[3:19:51.860 --> 3:19:52.500]  I'm David Knight.
[3:19:52.500 --> 3:19:52.980]  Stay with me.
[3:20:01.300 --> 3:20:05.780]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[3:20:05.780 --> 3:20:07.380]  Those times may be near.
[3:20:07.380 --> 3:20:08.180]  Think about it.
[3:20:08.180 --> 3:20:12.820]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[3:20:12.820 --> 3:20:17.780]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[3:20:17.780 --> 3:20:21.380]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term
[3:20:21.380 --> 3:20:23.620]  allergies from a single cyber attack.
[3:20:23.620 --> 3:20:28.020]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[3:20:28.020 --> 3:20:30.340]  during a widespread national emergency.
[3:20:30.340 --> 3:20:33.380]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[3:20:33.380 --> 3:20:36.100]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[3:21:10.020 --> 3:21:11.300]  to detoxify the body.
[3:21:11.300 --> 3:21:13.380]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[3:21:13.380 --> 3:21:16.180]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[3:21:16.180 --> 3:21:17.620]  It's made in the USA.
[3:21:17.620 --> 3:21:22.740]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:21:22.740 --> 3:21:24.420]  the body and it supports the infor.
[3:21:24.420 --> 3:21:26.580]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:21:26.580 --> 3:21:30.180]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[3:21:30.180 --> 3:21:35.220]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[3:21:35.220 --> 3:21:36.180]  you can possibly get.

[3:22:28.500 --> 3:22:32.100]  now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[3:22:32.100 --> 3:22:34.340]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[3:24:10.660 --> 3:24:12.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:24:12.100 --> 3:24:13.300]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[3:24:14.100 --> 3:24:17.460]  We're just talking to Kit Daniels and Owen Shorter, who were with me at
[3:24:17.460 --> 3:24:19.860]  Bilderberg in Chantilly, Virginia this last week.
[3:24:19.860 --> 3:24:24.660]  We had a lot of press coverage this year from the European press, not from the American press.
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:27.140]  But a lot of press coverage from the European press.
[3:24:27.140 --> 3:24:33.140]  But most of it was of the don't worry, there's nothing to see, move a long variety.
[3:24:33.140 --> 3:24:37.220]  And I want to give you two articles from The Guardian, I think, that illustrate the
[3:24:38.420 --> 3:24:44.180]  smoke screen that most of the mainstream media does out there, and then a cutting satire that
[3:24:44.180 --> 3:24:49.380]  gets directly to the heart of it from Charlie Skelton, who has been a reporter for The Guardian,
[3:24:49.380 --> 3:24:50.980]  mainly for Bilderberg.
[3:24:50.980 --> 3:24:55.380]  He's been a comedian in the past, and he has biting satire to get to the heart of this.
[3:24:55.380 --> 3:25:00.340]  But first, let's talk about the guy who tries so desperately to be funny about this.
[3:25:00.340 --> 3:25:02.420]  This is Phil Hode from The Guardian.
[3:25:02.420 --> 3:25:08.900]  He says, Chantilly is in the spotlight, inside the secretive Bilderberg's home away from home,
[3:25:08.900 --> 3:25:10.340]  because it was the fourth time that they were there.
[3:25:10.340 --> 3:25:13.940]  So he says, why would they be in Chantilly, Virginia, for the fourth time?
[3:25:13.940 --> 3:25:16.900]  And you know, it's interesting, because even though they were there for the fourth time,
[3:25:16.900 --> 3:25:20.420]  the people who lived there had no idea what Bilderberg was.
[3:25:20.420 --> 3:25:22.820]  They had no idea that Bilderberg was going on.
[3:25:22.820 --> 3:25:27.620]  They had a festival in the area that was going from the first to the fourth.
[3:25:27.620 --> 3:25:31.140]  Actually, I think it hung over a little bit to the fifth, but covering the first to the fourth
[3:25:31.140 --> 3:25:32.900]  Bilderberg meeting.
[3:25:32.900 --> 3:25:38.660]  So it completely moved everybody away from Bilderberg, away from any concern, over to the
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:40.260]  street, bread, and circuses.
[3:25:40.260 --> 3:25:42.340]  Don't worry, there's nothing happening here.
[3:25:42.340 --> 3:25:48.580]  And then to help that, we have this puff piece from The Guardian, presumably about Bilderberg.
[3:25:48.580 --> 3:25:49.860]  But then he talks about Chantilly.
[3:25:49.860 --> 3:25:51.460]  He talks about the demographics of it.
[3:25:51.460 --> 3:25:54.460]  He talks about the fact that it's a small community.
[3:25:54.460 --> 3:25:57.900]  And one of the things that he doesn't talk about is the fact that the small community,
[3:25:57.900 --> 3:26:01.460]  even though they're not aware of it, like all the other small communities or towns where
[3:26:01.460 --> 3:26:05.140]  this is held, they're going to be paying the security bill.
[3:26:05.140 --> 3:26:08.740]  And of course, they will not have it part of that town.
[3:26:08.740 --> 3:26:11.500]  They will move it into Fairfax County, Virginia in general.
[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:16.620]  So much larger jurisdiction, so that people don't notice the additional security costs.
[3:26:16.620 --> 3:26:21.980]  And some of the people that were there that we talked to said he overheard one of the policemen
[3:26:21.980 --> 3:26:25.540]  say, can we pull back some of the police officers that we've got here?
[3:26:25.540 --> 3:26:28.140]  Because the crowds are not as big as you guys thought they might be.
[3:26:28.140 --> 3:26:30.300]  They said, no, no, we want to keep you guys all there.
[3:26:30.300 --> 3:26:33.540]  And they were frustrated because they knew that was coming out of their budget.
[3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:38.340]  But here's what the guy who was covering what was happening there at Bilderberg as a smoke
[3:26:38.340 --> 3:26:39.340]  screen says.
[3:26:39.340 --> 3:26:43.100]  Bilderberg has become, or Chantilly has become Bilderberg's home, away from home in recent
[3:26:43.100 --> 3:26:48.100]  times, having served as a conference venue in 2002, 2008, 2012.
[3:26:48.100 --> 3:26:56.020]  Sure to be in attendance are the scrum of protesters, alt media, conspiracy theorists,
[3:26:56.020 --> 3:27:02.740]  Illuminati watchers, and anyone else keen to see the world elite turn into lizards after
[3:27:02.740 --> 3:27:06.060]  supping blood out of the Holy Grail at midnight.
[3:27:06.060 --> 3:27:09.180]  But this is what Charlie Skelton has to say.
[3:27:09.180 --> 3:27:11.660]  Also from The Guardian, he really understands what's going on.
[3:27:11.660 --> 3:27:15.060]  If you look at his article, it starts with a picture of two individuals.
[3:27:15.060 --> 3:27:17.820]  One of those individuals is not on the official attendee list.
[3:27:17.820 --> 3:27:20.020]  See, now they're all out in the open, aren't they?
[3:27:20.020 --> 3:27:21.020]  A little bit.
[3:27:21.020 --> 3:27:23.860]  They tell us what their agenda is, or what they want us to think their agenda is.
[3:27:23.860 --> 3:27:27.860]  They tell us what their attendee list is, or what they want us to think their attendee
[3:27:27.860 --> 3:27:28.860]  list is.
[3:27:28.860 --> 3:27:32.820]  And then you stand there and you take pictures and you see these two individuals that he's
[3:27:32.820 --> 3:27:33.820]  got right there.
[3:27:33.820 --> 3:27:39.980]  Spanish economy minister, and then a man from the World Bank that was not on the official
[3:27:39.980 --> 3:27:40.980]  agenda.
[3:27:40.980 --> 3:27:42.580]  And this is what Charlie says.
[3:27:42.580 --> 3:27:46.540]  He says they like to put jokes out.
[3:27:46.540 --> 3:27:47.980]  They're very big about jokes.
[3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:52.220]  They like to describe themselves as, quote, a diverse group of political leaders and experts.
[3:27:52.220 --> 3:27:54.580]  And he says, well, that looks very sarcastic.
[3:27:54.580 --> 3:28:00.380]  He says they're trumpeting the diversity of a conference where less than 25% of the participants
[3:28:00.380 --> 3:28:04.180]  are female, which would be a huge step forward, he says, if it was 1963.
[3:28:04.180 --> 3:28:07.860]  But he said, perhaps by diverse, what they mean is that some of the participants own
[3:28:07.860 --> 3:28:11.900]  hedge funds, whereas others own vast industrial conglomerates.
[3:28:11.900 --> 3:28:13.380]  That's kind of diverse, right?
[3:28:13.380 --> 3:28:16.260]  Some are on the board of HSBC.
[3:28:16.260 --> 3:28:18.380]  Others are on the board of BP.
[3:28:18.380 --> 3:28:19.500]  Some are lobbyists.
[3:28:19.500 --> 3:28:20.940]  Others are being lobbied.
[3:28:20.940 --> 3:28:24.540]  That's the diversity that you see at Bilderberg, and then he goes on.
[3:28:24.540 --> 3:28:27.900]  But my favorite joke of the year from their agenda is this.
[3:28:27.900 --> 3:28:32.980]  The war on information, as if they're concerned about fake news.
[3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:38.780]  The people who, for 20-plus years, got away with pretending that they didn't even exist.
[3:28:38.780 --> 3:28:43.620]  And it was after 21 years that Jim Tucker started covering them in 1975.
[3:28:43.620 --> 3:28:48.260]  And gradually, as we had the internet and we had Alex Jones come along with documentaries
[3:28:48.260 --> 3:28:49.540]  with Jim Tucker and other things.
[3:28:49.540 --> 3:28:54.660]  We gradually began to understand, and we just talked to Daniel Estolin a couple of weeks
[3:28:54.660 --> 3:28:57.860]  ago talking about his new movie, The Bilderberg Movie.
[3:28:57.860 --> 3:29:00.660]  You can see that at thebilderbergmovie.com.
[3:29:00.660 --> 3:29:01.660]  We've had books written.
[3:29:01.660 --> 3:29:03.420]  We've had documentaries done about it.
[3:29:03.420 --> 3:29:08.100]  But so now they're trying to pretend that they are talking about something completely
[3:29:08.100 --> 3:29:09.100]  different.
[3:29:09.100 --> 3:29:11.860]  And as you see these people, and you try to pin them down, they say, well, we can't talk
[3:29:11.860 --> 3:29:12.860]  to you.
[3:29:12.860 --> 3:29:13.860]  You know, Chatham House rules.
[3:29:13.860 --> 3:29:15.580]  Well, we've got our own rules, don't we?
[3:29:15.580 --> 3:29:16.580]  We have laws.
[3:29:16.580 --> 3:29:18.700]  We have constitutions in all these different countries.
[3:29:18.700 --> 3:29:23.740]  We've had situations where, remember when Senator Tom Cotton, who was there, remember
[3:29:23.740 --> 3:29:27.980]  when he wrote that letter to Iran saying, we're not going to have the next president
[3:29:27.980 --> 3:29:31.860]  if it's not a Democrat, is not going to abide by this agreement, just so that you know.
[3:29:31.860 --> 3:29:36.860]  They accused him of violating the Logan Act, jumping in unauthorized into foreign policy
[3:29:36.860 --> 3:29:37.860]  issues.
[3:29:37.860 --> 3:29:38.860]  What do you think is happening at Bilderberg?
[3:29:38.860 --> 3:29:39.860]  We've said that every year.
[3:29:39.860 --> 3:29:43.260]  Ron Paul has said they need to prosecute these people under the Logan Act.
[3:29:43.260 --> 3:29:47.580]  Nobody from the press is there making that claim now about that same senator.
[3:29:47.580 --> 3:29:49.580]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[3:29:49.580 --> 3:29:52.100]  We're on the march.
[3:29:52.100 --> 3:29:54.540]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:54.540 --> 3:30:03.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:03.380 --> 3:30:05.340]  The collapse of the left continues.
[3:30:05.340 --> 3:30:09.540]  After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public
[3:30:09.540 --> 3:30:10.540]  statement.
[3:30:10.540 --> 3:30:12.860]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sass.
[3:30:12.860 --> 3:30:13.860]  You're welcome.
[3:30:13.860 --> 3:30:15.660]  We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.
[3:30:15.660 --> 3:30:17.660]  We'll work in the fields.
[3:30:17.660 --> 3:30:19.660]  That's part of that.
[3:30:19.660 --> 3:30:20.660]  Senator.
[3:30:20.660 --> 3:30:21.660]  I'm a house ******.
[3:30:21.660 --> 3:30:22.660]  No, it's...
[3:30:22.660 --> 3:30:24.660]  It's like a show.
[3:30:24.660 --> 3:30:29.820]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator, but remember, the left does eat
[3:30:29.820 --> 3:30:32.660]  its own and liberals are now calling for his firing.
[3:30:32.660 --> 3:30:37.060]  Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize
[3:30:37.060 --> 3:30:39.260]  the reality of the insane left.
[3:30:39.260 --> 3:30:42.620]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost him
[3:30:42.620 --> 3:30:45.620]  his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left.
[3:30:45.620 --> 3:30:49.980]  The left crashing and burning, which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round
[3:30:49.980 --> 3:30:50.980]  of elections.
[3:30:50.980 --> 3:30:53.020]  This is Owen Troyer for Infowars.com.
[3:30:53.020 --> 3:31:01.540]  Are you tired of winning yet?
[3:31:01.540 --> 3:31:05.500]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[3:31:05.500 --> 3:31:10.620]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[3:31:10.620 --> 3:31:14.660]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[3:31:14.660 --> 3:31:18.980]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[3:31:18.980 --> 3:31:24.300]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[3:31:24.300 --> 3:31:30.700]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:30.700 --> 3:31:35.820]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[3:31:35.820 --> 3:31:37.940]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:31:37.940 --> 3:31:42.220]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[3:31:42.220 --> 3:31:44.900]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:31:44.900 --> 3:31:48.660]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be
[3:31:48.660 --> 3:31:49.660]  disappointed.
[3:31:49.660 --> 3:31:52.740]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[3:31:52.740 --> 3:31:57.540]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[3:31:57.540 --> 3:32:02.660]  of my favorite coffee, available at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:32:02.660 --> 3:32:06.540]  The reason InfowarsLife has five star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want
[3:32:06.540 --> 3:32:08.020]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:09.020]  I take this.
[3:32:09.020 --> 3:32:12.860]  My family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful
[3:32:12.860 --> 3:32:14.420]  information you're going to find anywhere.
[3:32:14.420 --> 3:32:19.020]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:32:19.020 --> 3:32:23.580]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[3:32:23.580 --> 3:32:24.780]  I don't feel good.
[3:32:24.780 --> 3:32:28.380]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[3:32:28.380 --> 3:32:31.140]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super-female.
[3:32:31.140 --> 3:32:35.980]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once
[3:32:35.980 --> 3:32:43.060]  again, very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once
[3:32:43.060 --> 3:32:44.060]  again.
[3:32:44.060 --> 3:32:45.660]  So obviously, a super-female is amazing.
[3:32:45.660 --> 3:32:46.660]  I love it.
[3:32:46.660 --> 3:32:49.380]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[3:32:49.380 --> 3:32:50.380]  Survival Shield X2.
[3:32:50.380 --> 3:32:53.740]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[3:32:53.740 --> 3:32:57.940]  iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[3:32:57.940 --> 3:33:09.780]  So win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[3:33:09.780 --> 3:33:12.980]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[3:33:12.980 --> 3:33:18.140]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[3:33:18.140 --> 3:33:21.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:21.780 --> 3:33:22.780]  I'm David Knight.
[3:33:22.780 --> 3:33:25.660]  I want to talk a little bit about Bilderberg here.
[3:33:25.660 --> 3:33:30.300]  One of the key things I think this year about Bilderberg that really made it incredibly relevant
[3:33:30.300 --> 3:33:34.940]  for people were withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and this terrorist attack
[3:33:34.940 --> 3:33:37.060]  that we saw in London.
[3:33:37.060 --> 3:33:41.700]  Both of those things were intricately tied to Bilderberg, and as I said, most of the
[3:33:41.700 --> 3:33:45.660]  people in Herndon, Virginia, really didn't know what was going on, and they would pull
[3:33:45.660 --> 3:33:48.820]  up and they would say, why are all these people gathered out here?
[3:33:48.820 --> 3:33:51.900]  And we would say Bilderberg, and you would see them like, what?
[3:33:51.900 --> 3:33:52.900]  What's that?
[3:33:52.900 --> 3:33:54.580]  And they'd say, we don't have time to tell you.
[3:33:54.580 --> 3:33:59.100]  So I shot four short videos, three to five minutes long, put them up there.
[3:33:59.100 --> 3:34:00.540]  This is what Bilderberg is.
[3:34:00.540 --> 3:34:01.700]  This is how it started.
[3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:06.260]  This is the framework of world government that they're trying to lay with their tactics
[3:34:06.260 --> 3:34:07.260]  and so forth.
[3:34:07.260 --> 3:34:08.260]  And here's where we are.
[3:34:08.260 --> 3:34:11.740]  Here's how people uncovered it, how it was hidden for a number of years, and now it's
[3:34:11.740 --> 3:34:17.380]  somewhat known in some circles of people who are looking at it, hoping that we can light
[3:34:17.380 --> 3:34:22.060]  a fire in people's curiosity so they can then go do their full research.
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:24.940]  As I said before, there's been a lot of books, there's been documentaries done on it.
[3:34:24.940 --> 3:34:26.780]  I can't lay all this out.
[3:34:26.780 --> 3:34:31.780]  Nobody can in a single video, in a single documentary or a single book.
[3:34:31.780 --> 3:34:35.220]  But if you are interested, that's what education truly is.
[3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:36.580]  You're not filling a bucket.
[3:34:36.580 --> 3:34:39.660]  You're not stuffing information to people that don't want it.
[3:34:39.660 --> 3:34:41.040]  They have to want to know.
[3:34:41.040 --> 3:34:42.740]  If they want to know, they can wake themselves up.
[3:34:42.740 --> 3:34:44.820]  They can do their own research now on the internet.
[3:34:44.820 --> 3:34:49.500]  When I first heard of Bilderberg, I scoffed at it, just like these people who most of
[3:34:49.500 --> 3:34:52.100]  them drove off, it's like, oh, that's kind of strange, it's weird.
[3:34:52.100 --> 3:34:53.100]  These people are crazy.
[3:34:53.100 --> 3:34:56.020]  Maybe they think that they're going to drink blood and turn into lizards at night.
[3:34:56.020 --> 3:34:57.540]  No, that was the guardian putting that out.
[3:34:57.540 --> 3:35:01.940]  But I was skeptical of it because I hadn't heard of it.
[3:35:01.940 --> 3:35:05.060]  And at the time I heard of it, there was no internet to do that kind of investigation.
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:07.900]  So gradually that information came in.
[3:35:07.900 --> 3:35:10.380]  So we just want to get people interested in that.
[3:35:10.380 --> 3:35:15.860]  Before I get back to these two issues and how they play into Bilderberg this year, I
[3:35:15.860 --> 3:35:19.580]  just want to remind you of the specials that we have, one of them ending.
[3:35:19.580 --> 3:35:24.460]  It's the last chance for the support, Patriot media beginning summer sale that we have at
[3:35:24.460 --> 3:35:25.460]  infowarstore.com.
[3:35:25.460 --> 3:35:27.540]  That's going to end tonight.
[3:35:27.540 --> 3:35:30.820]  Things like silver bullet, 65% off retail.
[3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:32.580]  And let me tell you something.
[3:35:32.580 --> 3:35:34.300]  This is something I'll always travel with.
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:37.740]  We're out there in Virginia going around the woods and the trees and stuff.
[3:35:37.740 --> 3:35:39.900]  I got a deer tick on me, pulled it off.
[3:35:39.900 --> 3:35:43.780]  The first thing I do is I put, even though this is not like a lotion or something, I
[3:35:43.780 --> 3:35:47.500]  have found that if I get a cut or something that is going to turn into an infection like
[3:35:47.500 --> 3:35:50.260]  a tick bite, I always put silver bullet on it.
[3:35:50.260 --> 3:35:54.620]  And lately, every time I've used it, I'm not saying lately, but every time I have used
[3:35:54.620 --> 3:35:57.220]  it, it has kept it from getting infected.
[3:35:57.220 --> 3:36:00.860]  So I'm hoping that's going to be the situation with this deer tick bite as well because Lyme
[3:36:00.860 --> 3:36:03.860]  disease, we can talk about that someday, where that came from.
[3:36:03.860 --> 3:36:09.420]  Nevertheless, silver bullet, I always travel with it, 65% off retail, super male vitality
[3:36:09.420 --> 3:36:17.060]  back in stock, 30% off, survival shield, that's our X2 nascent iodine, 40% off, brain force,
[3:36:17.060 --> 3:36:18.580]  47% off retail.
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:22.780]  I had a guy come over to me, he was a programmer, he said, hey, I've been listening to you on
[3:36:22.780 --> 3:36:23.780]  the radio.
[3:36:23.780 --> 3:36:24.780]  I want to come over and shake your hand.
[3:36:24.780 --> 3:36:25.780]  I hear you all the time.
[3:36:25.780 --> 3:36:26.780]  I knew you were here.
[3:36:26.780 --> 3:36:27.780]  And he pulls out of his pocket.
[3:36:27.780 --> 3:36:29.420]  He pulls, I said, look, I got brain force.
[3:36:29.420 --> 3:36:32.340]  I said, yeah, that's exactly what you need.
[3:36:32.340 --> 3:36:36.740]  If you're doing brain work, or if you just want to make sure that you can recall things,
[3:36:36.740 --> 3:36:41.820]  brain force is my favorite supplement, 47% off, knockout, 50% off.
[3:36:41.820 --> 3:36:45.740]  If you're having trouble sleeping, if you're traveling and you've got a change in your
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:49.380]  schedule or jet lag, knockout is perfect for that.
[3:36:49.380 --> 3:36:52.980]  It's not only does it have melatonin, but it's got a lot of other natural things like
[3:36:52.980 --> 3:36:58.260]  L-tryptophan, which is in Turkey.
[3:36:58.260 --> 3:37:03.300]  And so you always get sleepy after a big meal, but especially when you have Turkey.
[3:37:03.300 --> 3:37:07.100]  So it's got a lot of natural ingredients, and there are a lot of herbs that are very
[3:37:07.100 --> 3:37:08.700]  mild but effective.
[3:37:08.700 --> 3:37:11.980]  You find that natural ingredients to help make you sleep and knockout.
[3:37:11.980 --> 3:37:15.380]  All Infowars Trump t-shirts, 75% off retail.
[3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:18.420]  This is while supplies last, but the sale will not last.
[3:37:18.420 --> 3:37:19.940]  It is going to end tonight.
[3:37:19.940 --> 3:37:22.380]  So take advantage of those massive discounts.
[3:37:22.380 --> 3:37:28.500]  This is from 30, 40, 47, 50%, 65%, 75% off those items I just told you about.
[3:37:28.500 --> 3:37:29.740]  All right, let's go back to this.
[3:37:29.740 --> 3:37:36.860]  You know, one of the things when we were flying back last night on the plane, they had the
[3:37:36.860 --> 3:37:39.980]  ability to watch movies, it was in the back of the seat.
[3:37:39.980 --> 3:37:41.140]  You could pick your movie that you want to watch.
[3:37:41.140 --> 3:37:44.300]  I watched Harry Benson shoot first.
[3:37:44.300 --> 3:37:45.780]  Now maybe you know who Harry Benson is.
[3:37:45.780 --> 3:37:49.460]  He's an iconic photographer, especially the middle of the 20th century.
[3:37:49.460 --> 3:37:53.060]  The first time people really noticed him was when he was documenting the Beatles trip to
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:54.060]  America.
[3:37:54.060 --> 3:38:01.260]  But this guy has filmed politicians, celebrities, or he gets these very wonderful candid shots.
[3:38:01.260 --> 3:38:06.100]  And so they did a very interesting documentary with him, and he was at the center of everything
[3:38:06.100 --> 3:38:11.500]  for Life Magazine, other magazines that he did contract work for, especially in the 60s,
[3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:13.300]  70s, even into the 80s.
[3:38:13.300 --> 3:38:19.300]  He still does a lot of work, but he was getting the biggest stars at those period of time.
[3:38:19.300 --> 3:38:24.660]  And the idea shoot first was that wherever he was, he had to take a picture, there you
[3:38:24.660 --> 3:38:25.660]  go.
[3:38:25.660 --> 3:38:26.660]  There's some of his iconic pictures.
[3:38:26.660 --> 3:38:30.060]  And of course, one of those is the picture, that one, go back one, go back one, where
[3:38:30.060 --> 3:38:35.340]  you've got the Frank Sinatra in the mask with Mia Farah going to this costume ball.
[3:38:35.340 --> 3:38:37.060]  And of course, the picture is of Muhammad Ali.
[3:38:37.060 --> 3:38:40.860]  The picture of Muhammad Ali standing next to the four Beatles, dwarfing them.
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:44.940]  You don't realize just how big Muhammad Ali was until you see them standing next to the
[3:38:44.940 --> 3:38:47.340]  Beatles, and he's got his arm outstretched to the right.
[3:38:47.340 --> 3:38:52.540]  Here's the one with Frank Sinatra and Mia Farah, which was kind of strange.
[3:38:52.540 --> 3:38:56.140]  But that was a big ball that was done by Truman Capote.
[3:38:56.140 --> 3:38:59.500]  Anyway, it was a very interesting documentary, but one of the things that was most interesting
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:05.140]  about it, I thought, was the controversy about the fact that he took pictures of Bobby Kennedy
[3:39:05.140 --> 3:39:09.420]  as he lay dying in that hotel room as he was assassinated.
[3:39:09.420 --> 3:39:13.580]  And I've talked to Dr. Pepper, I'll talk about that just a minute, but he got into a lot
[3:39:13.580 --> 3:39:21.340]  of, he got into a lot of criticism because he was right on top.
[3:39:21.340 --> 3:39:25.620]  They're taking pictures at one point, Bobby Kennedy's wife looked up at the camera and
[3:39:25.620 --> 3:39:29.740]  put her hand up like that in desperation, like, no, don't do it.
[3:39:29.740 --> 3:39:32.700]  And he said, my job is to show what is happening.
[3:39:32.700 --> 3:39:33.700]  He was not happy.
[3:39:33.700 --> 3:39:35.620]  He liked, he was a left-leaning guy.
[3:39:35.620 --> 3:39:37.860]  He liked Bobby Kennedy, he was friends with Bobby Kennedy.
[3:39:37.860 --> 3:39:38.860]  He liked his politics.
[3:39:38.860 --> 3:39:41.740]  He was not happy to see Bobby Kennedy dying.
[3:39:41.740 --> 3:39:43.380]  There wasn't anything that he could do.
[3:39:43.380 --> 3:39:48.820]  He wasn't a medical doctor, but he was there to document what was happening.
[3:39:48.820 --> 3:39:53.100]  And he would take the pictures and he would turn them over to his editors and his editors,
[3:39:53.100 --> 3:39:55.060]  he said, would then decide if they were going to use it or not.
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:39:58.180]  He was just there to show people what the reality was.
[3:39:58.180 --> 3:40:02.460]  And there's, that's the two different levels, you understand, of information.
[3:40:02.460 --> 3:40:04.580]  We talk about fake news and real news.
[3:40:04.580 --> 3:40:09.180]  One of it is just to clearly document what is happening there, to show people what is
[3:40:09.180 --> 3:40:10.180]  happening.
[3:40:10.180 --> 3:40:11.180]  That's really kind of pure journalism.
[3:40:11.180 --> 3:40:13.940]  The other part of it is the analysis.
[3:40:13.940 --> 3:40:20.220]  So when we see the tragedy of a man dying on the floor, Bobby Kennedy dying on the floor,
[3:40:20.220 --> 3:40:21.660]  what is behind it?
[3:40:21.660 --> 3:40:23.180]  Why did the man kill him?
[3:40:23.180 --> 3:40:24.860]  Who killed him?
[3:40:24.860 --> 3:40:27.980]  Was it Sir Hans, or was it other individuals?
[3:40:27.980 --> 3:40:30.980]  And I interviewed Dr. Pepper, you should go back and look at that interview.
[3:40:30.980 --> 3:40:35.060]  He did a lot of investigation into that, a lot of investigation into the Martin Luther
[3:40:35.060 --> 3:40:36.560]  King assassination.
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:41.060]  It's not as clear-cut, lone killer as they always like us to say.
[3:40:41.060 --> 3:40:45.140]  They always come up with a conspiracy theory, usually it's not a conspiracy, it's a lone
[3:40:45.140 --> 3:40:46.140]  wolf killer.
[3:40:46.140 --> 3:40:51.020]  One man acted alone, nothing else to see here, go on, let's forget about it.
[3:40:51.020 --> 3:40:55.340]  We want to investigate the deaths, there he is laying dying, and that's probably one
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:40:58.900]  of the pictures that was taken by Harry Benson.
[3:40:58.900 --> 3:41:02.500]  We want to know why he's been shot.
[3:41:02.500 --> 3:41:05.300]  We want to know who shot him.
[3:41:05.300 --> 3:41:10.140]  And as I was flying back, I thought, this is the essence of what we have today.
[3:41:10.140 --> 3:41:15.580]  In most cases, we have the mainstream media that doesn't even want to show Bilderberg.
[3:41:15.580 --> 3:41:20.940]  We show up and we say, look, our society is bleeding out.
[3:41:20.940 --> 3:41:23.100]  Our society has been shot.
[3:41:23.100 --> 3:41:24.860]  We know who did it.
[3:41:24.860 --> 3:41:27.020]  We want to investigate who did it.
[3:41:27.020 --> 3:41:32.060]  It's these people back here, behind these trees in this suburban hotel.
[3:41:32.060 --> 3:41:33.960]  They've taken over this private hotel.
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.780]  They want to take over our private lives.
[3:41:35.780 --> 3:41:37.060]  They want to take over our countries.
[3:41:37.060 --> 3:41:43.180]  They want to shut down our nations and create a supranational organization that answers
[3:41:43.180 --> 3:41:46.780]  to them, that makes them rulers of the world.
[3:41:46.780 --> 3:41:50.700]  They want to meet together secretly, and this is what they've been doing for decades.
[3:41:50.700 --> 3:41:52.300]  We want to do the analysis.
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:41:58.140]  We want to not only show what is happening, we not only want to show the bleeding corpse
[3:41:58.140 --> 3:42:01.660]  of Western civilization that is lying there bleeding on the floor, but we want you to
[3:42:01.660 --> 3:42:06.300]  understand who pulled the trigger, and we want to stop it.
[3:42:06.300 --> 3:42:09.340]  We want to do something about it.
[3:42:09.340 --> 3:42:13.340]  We can show you that, but you're going to have to be the doctors to do something about
[3:42:13.340 --> 3:42:14.340]  it.
[3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:17.060]  You're going to have to get upset enough that you will change things.
[3:42:17.060 --> 3:42:20.580]  You know one of the articles that was sent to me while I was gone by Darren McBrain,
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:25.300]  self-driving cars will double as security cameras, says the Intel CEO.
[3:42:25.300 --> 3:42:27.220]  I've told you this many times, haven't I?
[3:42:27.220 --> 3:42:28.220]  We've all have.
[3:42:28.220 --> 3:42:29.220]  Alex has said it as well.
[3:42:29.220 --> 3:42:33.740]  They're going to use these things to track and to tax you everywhere you go.
[3:42:33.740 --> 3:42:36.500]  They're going to know everything about you, but of course they will also use it as a
[3:42:36.500 --> 3:42:39.540]  surveillance device against everyone.
[3:42:39.540 --> 3:42:44.300]  They're putting devices in our cars that will constantly talk to our insurance company,
[3:42:44.300 --> 3:42:45.300]  talk to the government.
[3:42:45.300 --> 3:42:50.020]  They're going to have not only talking cars that are talking about us, but they're also
[3:42:50.020 --> 3:42:54.460]  going to have talking cars that are talking to the road, to the infrastructure, telling
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:42:57.100]  it what we were doing at any given time.
[3:42:57.100 --> 3:42:59.980]  He went two miles over the speed limit, sent him a ticket right away.
[3:42:59.980 --> 3:43:01.700]  So he just said, maybe a little ping.
[3:43:01.700 --> 3:43:03.100]  You just got ticketed.
[3:43:03.100 --> 3:43:05.220]  You've been noticed, citizen.
[3:43:05.220 --> 3:43:10.100]  You will get the increase in your insurance rate and a fine that will be in the mail.
[3:43:10.100 --> 3:43:15.540]  Or maybe they'll just debit it from your cashless bank account.
[3:43:15.540 --> 3:43:16.540]  That's what is coming.
[3:43:16.540 --> 3:43:20.580]  That's how they will take over our society, but he says, hey, the benefits and this is
[3:43:20.580 --> 3:43:26.740]  the way CNBC covers for this Orwellian dystopian future that they're creating.
[3:43:26.740 --> 3:43:32.060]  People like the people that we see at Bilderberg, CNBC says, the benefits of having self-driving
[3:43:32.060 --> 3:43:35.660]  cars go far beyond automatic parking or fewer accidents.
[3:43:35.660 --> 3:43:40.660]  I don't need a complicated, expensive computer program to park my car.
[3:43:40.660 --> 3:43:41.660]  I'm sorry.
[3:43:41.660 --> 3:43:47.300]  It's a skill that anybody can learn in spite of the fact that we've got all these comical
[3:43:47.300 --> 3:43:51.500]  videos on the internet of you can see people trying to park and having a big time.
[3:43:51.500 --> 3:43:52.660]  You can't actually learn it.
[3:43:52.660 --> 3:43:53.660]  Most people do this.
[3:43:53.660 --> 3:43:55.060]  There's a few people who can't.
[3:43:55.060 --> 3:43:59.180]  It will always be the situation, just like you will always have bugs.
[3:43:59.180 --> 3:44:04.660]  You will have these computer programs that are created by human programmers and they
[3:44:04.660 --> 3:44:06.140]  will have problems.
[3:44:06.140 --> 3:44:07.380]  Believe me, they will have problems.
[3:44:07.380 --> 3:44:08.820]  So you will still have failures.
[3:44:08.820 --> 3:44:10.620]  They just won't blame the computers.
[3:44:10.620 --> 3:44:12.460]  They'll blame you or something else.
[3:44:12.460 --> 3:44:17.220]  But the Intel CEO says, driverless cars will double as security cameras.
[3:44:17.220 --> 3:44:19.420]  And he said this at the code conference in California.
[3:44:19.420 --> 3:44:22.020]  He said, cars are going to be out there looking.
[3:44:22.020 --> 3:44:27.100]  So the next time an Amber Alert comes up and they're looking for a license plate, the cars
[3:44:27.100 --> 3:44:30.380]  should be able to find that license plate quite rapidly.
[3:44:30.380 --> 3:44:33.900]  And they say, well, and here's CNBC covering for this.
[3:44:33.900 --> 3:44:35.220]  They just throw this out there.
[3:44:35.220 --> 3:44:36.780]  It's going to be great.
[3:44:36.780 --> 3:44:41.100]  We'll be able to find missing children as if.
[3:44:41.100 --> 3:44:42.100]  As if.
[3:44:42.100 --> 3:44:51.220]  We see these dystopian robots that are walking and running and climbing and relentlessly coming.
[3:44:51.220 --> 3:44:52.940]  Some of them are humanoid.
[3:44:52.940 --> 3:44:57.220]  Some of them look like insects and they tell us, well, we're going to use them to go into
[3:44:57.220 --> 3:45:00.100]  places like Fukushima that we don't want to send humans.
[3:45:00.100 --> 3:45:02.980]  Or we're going to use them to deliver medical care to people.
[3:45:02.980 --> 3:45:07.700]  And it's like, you're going to use them to hunt people down just as you showed us in
[3:45:07.700 --> 3:45:08.700]  the Terminator.
[3:45:08.700 --> 3:45:11.340]  You can see the arms that are already as cylinders.
[3:45:11.340 --> 3:45:13.340]  They just put the weapons in them anyway.
[3:45:13.340 --> 3:45:19.780]  They say, the idea could bring up concerns about privacy, but the CEO has already thought
[3:45:19.780 --> 3:45:21.540]  of how to minimize those worries.
[3:45:21.540 --> 3:45:23.460]  He said, we'll have to put limitations on it.
[3:45:23.460 --> 3:45:24.980]  We'll have to encrypt that data.
[3:45:24.980 --> 3:45:26.420]  We'll have to make sure.
[3:45:26.420 --> 3:45:29.340]  I can't tell that it's John's car necessarily.
[3:45:29.340 --> 3:45:30.740]  Yeah, right.
[3:45:30.740 --> 3:45:34.260]  How are our privacy protections working out for us right now?
[3:45:34.260 --> 3:45:37.740]  You feeling like your privacy is being protected?
[3:45:37.740 --> 3:45:43.740]  Is our privacy being honored by the NSA, by the FISA rules?
[3:45:43.740 --> 3:45:44.740]  He goes on.
[3:45:44.740 --> 3:45:45.740]  He says, I think there'll be rules.
[3:45:45.740 --> 3:45:47.740]  There'll be new areas that we'll have to explore, but the amount of social good that
[3:45:47.740 --> 3:45:51.100]  can come from that far outweighs those concerns, we'll just have to deal with them.
[3:45:51.100 --> 3:45:53.140]  Yeah, we do have to deal with it.
[3:45:53.140 --> 3:45:57.980]  We have to get a populace that demands a new privacy bill of rights.
[3:45:57.980 --> 3:46:01.020]  We need to do it as soon as possible.
[3:46:01.020 --> 3:46:05.540]  We need to lay down what these issues are and say, you will not do this.
[3:46:05.540 --> 3:46:09.660]  And then we need to have the guts to enforce that as well, because we already have a wonderful
[3:46:09.660 --> 3:46:10.660]  bill of rights.
[3:46:10.660 --> 3:46:14.380]  We have a wonderful constitution that is totally, totally dead.
[3:46:14.380 --> 3:46:19.340]  Contradicted by things like the Patriot Act that they don't even bother to pretend to
[3:46:19.340 --> 3:46:20.460]  obey anymore.
[3:46:20.460 --> 3:46:23.580]  We just had, and here's the big story, folks.
[3:46:23.580 --> 3:46:30.780]  The big story is that the Obama administration used our surveillance state like Watergate
[3:46:30.780 --> 3:46:31.780]  burglars.
[3:46:31.780 --> 3:46:36.180]  That's the big story that nobody in the mainstream media wants to talk about.
[3:46:36.180 --> 3:46:40.860]  They talk about their Russian fantasy, their Russian red herring conspiracy, dragging that
[3:46:40.860 --> 3:46:46.220]  smelly fish across the trail so the hounds can't track down the fox.
[3:46:46.220 --> 3:46:50.220]  But what they don't want to talk about is the fact that we had the FISA court itself.
[3:46:50.220 --> 3:46:54.660]  This is not an anonymous political operative talking through the Washington Post or through
[3:46:54.660 --> 3:46:56.380]  Fox News or whatever.
[3:46:56.380 --> 3:47:04.180]  This is the FISA court itself saying that the Obama administration's surveillance state
[3:47:04.180 --> 3:47:07.260]  broke the FISA Act.
[3:47:07.260 --> 3:47:10.340]  They also say that the FBI violated the law.
[3:47:10.340 --> 3:47:14.060]  So the Obama administration violated the law, the FBI violated the law, but don't worry
[3:47:14.060 --> 3:47:15.060]  about that.
[3:47:15.060 --> 3:47:18.900]  We're going to take a look at the last meeting that Jeff Sessions had, and we're going to
[3:47:18.900 --> 3:47:24.700]  try to entrap him with some kind of a process crime saying, oh, well, he didn't recall
[3:47:24.700 --> 3:47:28.300]  every single meeting every time he shook the hand of the Russian ambassador, so now we've
[3:47:28.300 --> 3:47:30.220]  got him on perjury charges.
[3:47:30.220 --> 3:47:34.300]  Remember that it wasn't rape that they came after Bill Clinton for.
[3:47:34.300 --> 3:47:37.500]  It wasn't sexual assault that they came after Bill Clinton for.
[3:47:37.500 --> 3:47:42.940]  They came after him for perjury for a consensual relationship that was not a crime, but he
[3:47:42.940 --> 3:47:43.940]  committed perjury.
[3:47:43.940 --> 3:47:46.020]  It was process crime.
[3:47:46.020 --> 3:47:48.740]  That's the game that they're trying to play with the Trump administration.
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:54.540]  And yet, as they're talking about Senator Sessions, did he meet a Russian ambassador?
[3:47:54.540 --> 3:48:00.860]  The same day that you have the most powerful people in governments across America as well
[3:48:00.860 --> 3:48:05.820]  as Western Europe meeting with the captains of industry and others privately, secretly,
[3:48:05.820 --> 3:48:07.060]  and there is no control.
[3:48:07.060 --> 3:48:10.180]  No investigation, no interest in the fact that they're meeting.
[3:48:10.180 --> 3:48:13.940]  That is the hypocrisy that we're seeing here.
[3:48:13.940 --> 3:48:16.260]  So we have to understand where this is headed.
[3:48:16.260 --> 3:48:20.340]  We have to look at, because now they're trying to get Jeff Sessions new demands as Daily
[3:48:20.340 --> 3:48:27.620]  Mail, new demand that FBI investigate Sessions for perjury as the Bilderberg group was opening.
[3:48:27.620 --> 3:48:28.620]  That is the key.
[3:48:28.620 --> 3:48:33.940]  But as I said before, there were a couple of issues that made this very, very timely.
[3:48:33.940 --> 3:48:38.620]  Number one, as they began this meeting, and on their agenda, as I pointed out, Charlie
[3:48:38.620 --> 3:48:43.180]  Skelton, great reporter from The Guardian, saying they like to make jokes about things
[3:48:43.180 --> 3:48:45.300]  and say we have a diverse group.
[3:48:45.300 --> 3:48:46.620]  This guy is from HSBC.
[3:48:46.620 --> 3:48:49.580]  This guy is from BP and so forth and so on.
[3:48:49.580 --> 3:48:52.220]  They were also saying, will globalization be slowed?
[3:48:52.220 --> 3:48:56.260]  They didn't say, will globalization be stopped?
[3:48:56.260 --> 3:48:57.740]  Will globalization be reversed?
[3:48:57.740 --> 3:49:03.100]  You see, it's groups like the Council on Formulations, by the way, the people who were with the Trump
[3:49:03.100 --> 3:49:07.140]  administration who attended this were with the only one exception.
[3:49:07.140 --> 3:49:11.580]  I'm not sure if Wilbur Ross is a member of CFR, the rest of them were part of the Council
[3:49:11.580 --> 3:49:12.580]  on Foreign Relations.
[3:49:12.580 --> 3:49:16.300]  Council on Foreign Relations has been dedicated to destroying American sovereignty and establishing
[3:49:16.300 --> 3:49:22.140]  a global governance since its inception, going back to Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations
[3:49:22.140 --> 3:49:23.140]  and so forth.
[3:49:23.140 --> 3:49:26.580]  And they've had an outsized influence in the State Department.
[3:49:26.580 --> 3:49:27.580]  We need to understand that.
[3:49:27.580 --> 3:49:29.180]  We need to recognize it.
[3:49:29.180 --> 3:49:31.100]  And we need to counter that.
[3:49:31.100 --> 3:49:36.180]  Ronald Reagan was not a member of the CFR, but then when he became president, he appointed
[3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:40.500]  300-plus CFR members into the State Department.
[3:49:40.500 --> 3:49:44.020]  What difference does it make if they're the ones who are creating and crafting this and
[3:49:44.020 --> 3:49:46.260]  you can't follow everything these people are doing?
[3:49:46.260 --> 3:49:51.260]  If you don't, that's my big concern with Donald Trump, is that I'm afraid that because he
[3:49:51.260 --> 3:49:56.220]  doesn't put like-minded people in these positions, that his own people are going to be subverting
[3:49:56.220 --> 3:49:57.220]  him.
[3:49:57.220 --> 3:49:59.980]  We know that the Republican establishment is going to be working hard to do that.
[3:49:59.980 --> 3:50:05.340]  But as they're creating, as they're beginning their Bilderberg conference, saying, well,
[3:50:05.340 --> 3:50:11.540]  globalization be slowed, he not only put up a big stop sign, he dug a pothole in front
[3:50:11.540 --> 3:50:15.100]  of their parade that they can't get around for a while.
[3:50:15.100 --> 3:50:19.180]  And so this is the arrogance of these people, thinking that they're going to win on this.
[3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:23.020]  And then we see the other aspect of this, and that is the Islamic attack attacks that
[3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:24.580]  we saw in London.
[3:50:24.580 --> 3:50:31.860]  I did a report, CNN is ISIS, yeah, okay, but Bilderberg truly is ISIS.
[3:50:31.860 --> 3:50:34.180]  That is where this all began.
[3:50:34.180 --> 3:50:38.220]  The regime changed programs that we saw in Libya, creating chaos, turning it into an
[3:50:38.220 --> 3:50:43.660]  arms bizarre, funding, creating, training ISIS, then bringing them over here from Syria
[3:50:43.660 --> 3:50:50.020]  as we create chaos and civil war in that country, then doing it here in Western countries.
[3:50:50.020 --> 3:50:51.020]  That's what we need to understand.
[3:50:51.020 --> 3:50:54.260]  And we need to understand and we're going to talk about false flags when I come back
[3:50:54.260 --> 3:50:55.260]  so stay with me.
[3:50:55.260 --> 3:51:24.740]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:24.740 --> 3:51:54.300]  That's what we need to understand.
[3:51:54.300 --> 3:52:23.860]  That's what we need to understand.
[3:52:23.860 --> 3:52:52.820]  That's what we need to understand.
[3:52:52.820 --> 3:53:22.660]  We need to understand and we're going to talk about false flags when I come back, and we
[3:53:22.660 --> 3:53:52.500]  need to understand and we're going to talk about false flags when I come back, and we
[3:53:52.500 --> 3:54:19.780]  need to understand and we're going to talk about false flags when I come back, and we
[3:54:19.780 --> 3:54:45.260]  need to understand and we need to understand and we need to understand and we need to understand
[3:54:45.260 --> 3:54:48.860]  of you who stand with us, who support us, who buy our products, it's one of the reasons
[3:54:48.860 --> 3:54:52.560]  that we have put this sale that's ending tonight together.
[3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:57.740]  And if you take a look at the massive discounts that Alex has put there that we've got up
[3:54:57.740 --> 3:55:03.080]  to 75% off some of these products, the Trump t-shirts are 75% off, silver bullet, colloidal
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:07.480]  silver is 65% off, things like brain force, 47% off.
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:10.640]  So take a look at these sales that are ending tonight.
[3:55:10.640 --> 3:55:12.200]  We really do appreciate your support.
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:14.920]  Thank you so much for standing with us in so many different ways.
[3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:19.740]  If you who couldn't be there, you have stood with us in supporting us over the years, listening,
[3:55:19.740 --> 3:55:22.620]  buying our products, and we want it to be a win-win situation.
[3:55:22.620 --> 3:55:27.620]  You know, one of the things that we've added recently is a new line of household products.
[3:55:27.620 --> 3:55:32.220]  Now take a look at Emmerich's Essentials line of products at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:55:32.220 --> 3:55:37.580]  These are things that are suntan, lotion, sunscreen, bug spray, mouthwash, body wash,
[3:55:37.580 --> 3:55:41.500]  shampoo, natural deodorant, things that we wanted to cover in the past, but we didn't
[3:55:41.500 --> 3:55:46.300]  have a good source that did not have hidden toxic ingredients.
[3:55:46.300 --> 3:55:55.260]  So we found somebody who's a patriot, and we did a deal for a private label of these products,
[3:55:55.260 --> 3:56:01.660]  and now we've got them at a significant discount over what you would pay at health food stores,
[3:56:01.660 --> 3:56:06.100]  at grocery stores that would carry this, major stores that would carry it, all natural ingredients,
[3:56:06.100 --> 3:56:07.100]  basic household products.
[3:56:07.100 --> 3:56:08.100]  So take a look at that too.
[3:56:08.100 --> 3:56:11.740]  I think the many people who showed up there, a lot of them were very excited about the
[3:56:11.740 --> 3:56:15.620]  products and what they had done for them in their life, so we're happy that we're having
[3:56:15.620 --> 3:56:19.700]  a positive influence on people in many different ways, and believe me, we really do appreciate
[3:56:19.700 --> 3:56:20.700]  your support.
[3:56:20.700 --> 3:56:25.180]  Now I want to throw this out there for people in a little bit of time that we got left.
[3:56:25.180 --> 3:56:31.540]  As I saw Prime Minister May come out and say that the Internet is a breeding ground for
[3:56:31.540 --> 3:56:36.420]  terrorism, I thought, really, really, isn't this interesting?
[3:56:36.420 --> 3:56:41.500]  This is we would always see Barack Obama pushing gun control after a shooting.
[3:56:41.500 --> 3:56:46.580]  Now Theresa May is pushing for Internet control after this killing, because I've already got
[3:56:46.580 --> 3:56:47.580]  gun control.
[3:56:47.580 --> 3:56:52.420]  Now they're coming for your free speech, and so we understand what is behind this, and
[3:56:52.420 --> 3:56:57.820]  I want to point out that when we talk about a false flag, there's a couple of different
[3:56:57.820 --> 3:56:58.820]  false flags.
[3:56:58.820 --> 3:56:59.820]  Let's talk about it.
[3:56:59.820 --> 3:57:01.700]  There's at least three that I can think of.
[3:57:01.700 --> 3:57:08.340]  One is where you've got a real event, but it gets co-opted for their legislative agenda,
[3:57:08.340 --> 3:57:09.900]  so they kind of use it as a false flag.
[3:57:09.900 --> 3:57:10.900]  That's one of them.
[3:57:10.900 --> 3:57:13.220]  Think about this, and maybe you can send this suggestion to me.
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:17.780]  I think we need to unpack this instead of using one word to describe all these different
[3:57:17.780 --> 3:57:18.940]  types of false flags.
[3:57:18.940 --> 3:57:23.380]  Maybe we need to have some way to redefine this, so if you've got a good idea of what
[3:57:23.380 --> 3:57:30.020]  we could call this, tweet this to me at LibertyTarian on Twitter, let me know what you would
[3:57:30.020 --> 3:57:31.020]  call this.
[3:57:31.020 --> 3:57:34.460]  Let's come up with a name the baby, because we've got three different levels of deception
[3:57:34.460 --> 3:57:35.620]  that the government uses.
[3:57:35.620 --> 3:57:39.780]  One, they can take a real event, and they can use it for some phony solution like Theresa
[3:57:39.780 --> 3:57:40.940]  May is trying to do here.
[3:57:40.940 --> 3:57:42.060]  That's what I believe is happening.
[3:57:42.060 --> 3:57:47.820]  Or you can take a situation where, let's say like Pearl Harbor, you know that they're
[3:57:47.820 --> 3:57:52.220]  coming, but you shut down the advanced warning systems, and you make sure that that's allowed
[3:57:52.220 --> 3:57:53.220]  to happen.
[3:57:53.220 --> 3:57:57.860]  So it's a real attack, but because you've got an agenda here, a purpose, you want them
[3:57:57.860 --> 3:58:00.700]  to be able to attack, so you shut down the warning systems.
[3:58:00.700 --> 3:58:02.340]  It's also in place here.
[3:58:02.340 --> 3:58:07.340]  We also knew that they brought them in, they invited these people in, they documented that
[3:58:07.340 --> 3:58:10.140]  they were jihadis next door, so forth and so on.
[3:58:10.140 --> 3:58:14.180]  And then there's the false flag where it's all totally baloney.
[3:58:14.180 --> 3:58:19.020]  So they are the actors, the government agents are the actors, they pretend that they're
[3:58:19.020 --> 3:58:24.420]  somebody else, they create an event, and then blame it on this other group.
[3:58:24.420 --> 3:58:26.860]  So we've got three types of false flags as I see it.
[3:58:26.860 --> 3:58:28.700]  Let's come up with some different names on that.
[3:58:28.700 --> 3:58:31.580]  Join that to me at Liberty Tarion on Twitter.
[3:58:31.580 --> 3:58:49.820]  Join me tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News, 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
