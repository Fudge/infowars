[01:07.720 --> 01:11.800]  know basically everything that he's always loved but now he's fully turning over to
[01:11.800 --> 01:19.240]  them as the fact that the criminal attorney general the fast and furious crime syndicate
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.520]  can arrest the head of news corps basically whenever they want to understand there is
[01:23.520 --> 01:28.280]  major blackmail going on there and it looks like news corps is completely rolled over
[01:28.280 --> 01:35.720]  into obama noid worship session as the blackmail game accelerates we're going to be breaking
[01:35.720 --> 01:43.320]  all of this down Syria confirms chemical weapons reserved for attack from abroad which is exactly

[01:53.280 --> 02:00.320]  of the same news but also a lot of in-depth analysis of globalist crime syndicate operations
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.680]  yesterday the Associated Press had an article about Marines shifting to police work because
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.320]  it's about being an occupying army not just going in and knocking a government out but
[02:11.320 --> 02:15.560]  putting in the new globalist military and it's always been about that since the days
[02:15.560 --> 02:24.880]  of smidley butler but there is a article that details this out by Steve Watson at info wars
[02:24.880 --> 02:31.120]  dot com and it gets into concerns about Marines and it's a good article it's just that Marines
[02:31.120 --> 02:35.240]  have already had DWI checkpoints all over the country totally illegal they've responded
[02:35.240 --> 02:40.480]  to shootings all over the country the secretary of defense secretary of the army have also
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.560]  said they're going to put troops in every US city they're just announcing this to sell
[02:45.560 --> 02:50.480]  you on the idea that it's for overseas because it is dual use but why are they getting ready
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.480]  for martial law well they say it's for collapse but I thought we were out of the recession
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.120]  three and a half years ago I mean they don't lie to us these are no good people running
[02:58.120 --> 03:04.720]  our running our country so we're going to be going over all that and the public is really
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.960]  noticing that Mr. Holmes the supposed shooter I mean they all over the news they just say
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.160]  it's him he did it he can't talk though he's obviously drugged out of his mind on psychotropics
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.720]  and other anti-psychotics but no one's saying he's drugged it's just here's a guy that can't
[03:19.720 --> 03:27.560]  talk and he did it and by the way his mother and father have come out this is an ABC news
[03:27.560 --> 03:33.080]  alleged Colorado government's family stands by son and she says I didn't say you've got
[03:33.080 --> 03:38.800]  your man in the shooting as the police put out they haven't been talking to us they haven't
[03:38.800 --> 03:47.840]  been asking for help talking to him all they did was call up and say use your son James
[03:47.840 --> 03:56.440]  Holmes and she said yeah that's him they said you know guy with red hair James Holmes I
[03:56.440 --> 04:00.800]  lives here at this yeah yeah you've got your man that's him why what's going on she said
[04:00.800 --> 04:07.800]  she didn't know that he'd been accused of these shootings but see they sold it like mommy said

[04:29.840 --> 04:34.920]  area see how this whole thing's mischaracterized just like when Breitbart died within an hour

[04:40.280 --> 04:44.840]  said he died of natural causes go to sleep no big deal coroner says he died of natural
[04:44.840 --> 04:54.160]  causes the coroner hadn't even been called into the next day see I mean again the evidence
[04:54.160 --> 05:00.600]  of it being a black op is the fact that everything's so scripted day one we'll be right back let

[11:25.040 --> 11:31.240]  cons i had my stack in here from a newscast i shot last night and i have the the the stack
[11:31.240 --> 11:34.560]  that was left in here not the big stack from the radio yesterday that was already out of
[11:34.560 --> 11:41.240]  here but the other big stack it was it was all of a bunch of neo cons on fox news are
[11:41.240 --> 11:47.360]  saying no no no we should restrict guns we should ban semi auto we should it was a bunch
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.600]  of shows erin printed me a whole stack of suddenly they're on fox news going ban semi
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.880]  auto ban them you shouldn't be able to own them it's only for hunting you should only
[11:55.880 --> 12:01.000]  be able to have bolt action now there is the stack i'm gonna find this folks this is there's
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.760]  just so much i mean that's a whole article right there of just the fact that they clearly
[12:05.760 --> 12:11.280]  are blackmailing news corps and i've been saying this for about a year i mean they're
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.080]  arresting the heads of news corps in england i mean there a lot of them are still in jail
[12:16.080 --> 12:28.960]  there's more rest today and i'm not seeing news corps good but they're not msnbc who
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.000]  openly meets with george soros and media matters and their memos have gone public and politicos
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.120]  defended them saying we're going to infiltrate news organizations and destroy them and sabotage
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.040]  them from within i mean that's racketeering and they're tax exempt can you imagine if
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.040]  i tried to be tax exempt and just stand up for liberty when we really are nonpartisan
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.760]  and just stand up for what's right but i've got to tell you i mean i'm agree with a lot
[12:53.760 --> 12:57.280]  of what rush limbaugh does they've been trying to destroy him this year they're trying to
[12:57.280 --> 13:04.200]  destroy news corps right now news corps has just rolled over belly up to this and because
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.160]  the system sees it as a threat because it at least posed as patriot to get that giant
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.680]  audience because that is the most popular idea out there is basic liberty and so fox
[13:14.680 --> 13:21.320]  news tries to pose as anti-neural order enough to get that audience i mean look at info wars
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.560]  dot com we've come from nowhere in the last 17 years just it looks like nowhere but incrementally
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.720]  building up to the point now where we're as the biggest thing i'll turn to the media period
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.480]  bar none and that's not bragging by the way that freaks me out quite a lot because it's
[13:38.480 --> 13:47.920]  an incredible responsibility and white house groups like think progress run by the white
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.240]  house publicly are calling for us to be shut down they're calling for drudge to be destroyed
[13:54.240 --> 14:00.320]  basically and it's very creepy so pray for us folks this is not a joke this is not a
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.640]  game my spidey sense has been really tingling they're getting ready to launch new wars obviously
[14:06.640 --> 14:13.760]  not just proxy wars against syria and libya but i ran all hades is getting ready to break
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.880]  loose they're telling police nationwide get ready for total disaster and martial law in
[14:18.880 --> 14:25.360]  october i'm not saying that's going to happen but that is going on israel saying they're
[14:25.360 --> 14:28.920]  going to attack iran because iran's playing to attack the olympics does anyone really
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.440]  buy that and again i'm not for iran either it's just that israel's line ladies and gentlemen
[14:34.440 --> 14:40.000]  israel's been caught staging terror attacks before jerusalem post harats uh... why net
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.520]  news it's it's not that they're doing it and all these governments do it they want wars
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.680]  so they can stay in office and get no bid contracts and take people's rights during a giant war
[14:50.680 --> 14:54.520]  let me tell you they start a war with iran and the russians get involved everybody's
[14:54.520 --> 14:57.960]  going to line up and do what they're told they got the checkpoints ready the marines
[14:57.960 --> 15:01.720]  the army all of it i'm going to shut up right there once it calls for the rest of this segment

[24:51.360 --> 24:57.640]  fights look like it was the scene with Captain Kirk fighting the lizard where it means like
[24:57.640 --> 25:03.460]  slow motion it was horrible it was a horrible movie nothing but a mindless vehicle to deliver
[25:03.460 --> 25:08.600]  the idea of martial law and checkpoints and the police are a gang that are going to riot
[25:08.600 --> 25:13.600]  and defeat the Occupy Wall Street people who were aka the second French Revolution and
[25:13.600 --> 25:24.080]  the idea that any protest is terrorism I mean it was just so ridiculous and the cops are
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.840]  rushing up on Bane and they're firing hundreds of machine guns at them and like one cop gets
[25:28.840 --> 25:34.040]  shot and the bullets all hit the ground and spark it's just it's just it's just total
[25:34.040 --> 25:45.840]  there you go haha they are if you're not watching this I guess radio listeners haha that's enough
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.000]  actually that's a better fight scene than the movie I mean it was horrible alright I'm
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.400]  gonna shut up I said we're taking calls from Denver Julian Joe Mike we'll get to all of
[25:54.400 --> 25:57.720]  you here we'll even take some of you while Wayne Madsen's on he's coming on to give us
[25:57.720 --> 26:04.640]  his take on it by the way I keep getting questions about a couple shirts my wife got me that
[26:04.640 --> 26:12.040]  are recreations of mountain climbing dress shirts from the 60s and so that's what these
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.320]  shirts are I'm wearing they're not Boy Scout shirts but I like them and that's what I'm
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.960]  wearing in the summer I have two shirts with them and that's that's what I'm side issue
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.040]  but it's become quite a big debate whenever I wear one of these shirts what are they is
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.520]  it a military shirt no it's not it's a rock climbing shirt not that I'm really a rock
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.280]  climber but I do like to hike so I what do they call it an alpiner okay let's go ahead
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.240]  and take a call shut up Jones and go to the calls Joe in Colorado what's your take on
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.360]  all this them saying mommy says he did it basically but she never said that what do
[26:45.360 --> 26:53.280]  you think of all this yeah first my heart goes out to the family yes I just think that
[26:53.280 --> 27:01.440]  you know if this is blatant the dude's not talking you know looking crazy in court you
[27:01.440 --> 27:08.400]  know bulletproof best all this stuff doesn't shoot back at the cops you know I'm a veteran
[27:08.400 --> 27:14.040]  so you know I've been awake for a minute listening to you for a while my first time calling and
[27:14.040 --> 27:19.400]  getting through but you know it's crazy I just can't believe it well what about the
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.760]  fact now that they admit he was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs which can naturally
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.560]  make you go crazy and do stuff like this like Sergeant Bales why are they even charging him
[27:28.560 --> 27:35.360]  he was clearly completely insane but but the issue is this guy's totally covered up everybody
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.880]  says they're multiple shooters but within minutes I know we caught him here he is we're
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.220]  not gonna give you any details and they call the mother up and say yeah your son got red
[27:44.220 --> 27:47.880]  hair is this his name yeah yeah that's him you got your guy well why and then they hang
[27:47.880 --> 27:51.800]  up the phone on her and announced she said he did it basically and she's coming out going
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.040]  I've been telling him for days I didn't say that she's having to press conferences now
[27:56.040 --> 28:00.560]  why would they want to say yeah his mama says he's the guy that did it when she didn't say
[28:00.560 --> 28:06.160]  that I mean boy isn't that strong evidence right there and exactly because my friend
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.320]  of mine he's the one that first told me about it before I heard about it he said yeah the
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.280]  mom you know actually a couple people told me that while the mom said that uh you know
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.280]  yeah you got the right one because they wanted to get everybody's first jump on it but not
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.120]  anything to hear after that it's crazy well again that's the telltale sign is when it's
[28:24.120 --> 28:30.160]  scripted listen they also jumped the gun on scripting on 9-11 an hour before on CNN they
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.080]  go building 7 the 47 story building is falling and Aaron Brown was on it and he lived in
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.440]  New York and turned around he went I'm not sure that's right though because it's right
[28:38.440 --> 28:43.880]  behind him and then BBC on two channels the exact same thing said it's falling in its
[28:43.880 --> 28:50.480]  own footprint from fires what a you know beautiful collapse and I said BBC first said those weren't
[28:50.480 --> 28:53.680]  real videos and they said okay they are real but we lost the tape and I said I know who
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.640]  did it I know you get your feed you got an internal Reuters feed and years later they
[28:57.640 --> 29:05.040]  admitted yes Reuters had reported it fell perfectly as it did with the cover story an hour before
[29:05.040 --> 29:10.240]  it did and then they tried to cover that up just like they said Lee Harvey Oswald had
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.040]  been captured before he'd even been arrested no one knew his name they printed that all
[29:15.040 --> 29:20.360]  over a certain time zone Australia New Zealand and some other areas again it's scripted and
[29:20.360 --> 29:29.760]  they get caught scripting anything else sir I'll tell you what stay there I got Wayne
[29:29.760 --> 29:33.360]  Madsen coming up but he'll only talk about five minutes or so before we start going

[34:30.080 --> 34:34.880]  with him we have video clips of this from even hardball a few months ago the memos
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.640]  Glenn Beck coming out and saying they want to stage a new Oklahoma and blaming on me
[34:38.640 --> 34:43.160]  people are finally starting to get this we'll get Wayne's take in just one moment here's
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.680]  iced tea on Denver TV and as usual it's not an American doing the interview I think it's
[34:48.680 --> 34:53.000]  people of British accents it's just why are all the newscasters now from England or Europe
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.960]  or something telling us like you know Pierce Morgan turn our guns in or Felipe Calderon
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.640]  saying turn our guns in and I love what ice tea says he says yeah I'll give up my guns
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.600]  when you give yours up the government's going to have guns you know when other people have
[35:06.600 --> 35:10.840]  the guns and you don't you're in trouble that's why gun cells have exploded people get it folks
[35:10.840 --> 35:18.560]  they know we did the math Kurt Nemo show the statistics I mean it is one of the rarest
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.120]  things on average is about 15 people killed a year in mass shootings in groups of five
[35:24.120 --> 35:28.640]  or more there's quite a few two or three getting shot me and it's mainly gang related you
[35:28.640 --> 35:33.920]  see that stuff almost every day in Chicago and you know that's their problem that's that's
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.600]  that's nature's way of people I'm sad it's happening it's a very corrupt drug culture
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.440]  people should get away from it but the point is I don't lose my guns because a bunch of
[35:42.440 --> 35:50.000]  thugs kill themselves or or or but I'm ranting let's go to this quick clip of ice tea telling
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.720]  it like it is and I just love it here it is well I give up my gun when everybody else
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.960]  does and is that makes sense well doesn't that make sense I mean if you were to if there
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.520]  were guns here would you be on to be the only person without one so you said so do you carry
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.600]  guns no I mean you have got you haven't got a home yeah it's legal in the United States
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.120]  it's part of our Constitution you know the right to bear arms is because that's the last
[36:17.120 --> 36:25.520]  form of defense against tyranny not to hunt to hunt is to protect yourself from the police
[36:25.520 --> 36:33.280]  and do you see any link between that and the source of incidents no not not really you
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.680]  know I'm saying if somebody wants to kill people you know they don't need a gun to do it makes
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.560]  it easier though doesn't not really you can use a you can strap explosives on your body
[36:42.560 --> 36:49.960]  they do that all the time so when there's the inevitable backlash of the anti-gun lobby
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.600]  as a result of this incident as it always is well that's not going to change anything
[36:53.600 --> 36:59.520]  it's not going to change the United States is based on guns you know like care rest says
[36:59.520 --> 37:06.280]  you'll never have justice on stolen land so it's not going to change KRS one he's a
[37:06.280 --> 37:09.960]  listener of the show he's in the Obama deception and and we've got to be honest about that
[37:09.960 --> 37:14.600]  this is a warlike culture the most warlike in history quite frankly and you're not getting
[37:14.600 --> 37:21.520]  our guns okay that's the end of it and I totally agree with iced tea right there but I mean
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.880]  he says cops that's for the general public you know to get it he means corrupt tyrannical
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.840]  government let's go to Wayne Madsen author researcher Wayne Madsen report.com he's got
[37:31.840 --> 37:37.160]  a new book out on Obama that's excellent they're on the side he is Washington DC based investigative
[37:37.160 --> 37:40.640]  journalist author syndicated columnist he's written for the Village Voice the progressive
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.280]  counter punch online journal and more his columns appear in the Miami Herald Houston
[37:44.280 --> 37:49.040]  Chronicle Philadelphia Inquirer amongst others he's been on all the major TV reports on national
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.880]  security issues I wanted to get his take briefly today to on the fact that NSA suddenly it's
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.600]  like okay we spy on you in real time no warrants you're all being spied on it's totally illegal
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.840]  we just do it sit down shut up by the way there was a drill running of course the exact
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.320]  stuff happening in Denver you know the at the same university he attended of the movie
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.200]  theater being attacked and a guy using bombs to divert people as he shoots them wow Wayne
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.920]  Madsen again formerly in submarine warfare then was in the national security agency worked
[38:18.920 --> 38:23.760]  for a lot of big telecommunication corporations as well he joins us right now he's a member
[38:23.760 --> 38:27.800]  of the society professional journalist in the national press club Wayne I don't know
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.280]  your view on this whole thing but I've got a sneak and suspicion because I know you're
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.920]  always out there investigating the same info I am Wayne Madsen what do you say about what's
[38:37.920 --> 38:39.880]  happened in Denver.
[38:39.880 --> 38:47.240]  Okay let's take a look at Mr. Holmes where he was back in May he was on a one of six
[38:47.240 --> 38:53.640]  individuals who received the national institutes of health grant for neuroscience training
[38:53.640 --> 38:59.520]  at the University of Colorado at the Anschutz medical campus that used to be the Fitzsimmons
[38:59.520 --> 39:08.160]  Army Medical Center before the base realignment and closure commission had it privatized
[39:08.160 --> 39:15.360]  and in May Mr. Holmes presented a paper at the at the university at the medical school
[39:15.360 --> 39:25.640]  and get the name it was on micro DNA biomarkers in a class titled biological basis of psychiatric
[39:25.640 --> 39:32.560]  and neurological disorders that's kind of strange since we're now told that you know
[39:32.560 --> 39:40.680]  this guy's crazed lunatic but it gets even more interesting he did a summer internship
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.960]  at the Salk Institute which is part of the University of California at San Diego and
[39:45.960 --> 39:50.520]  La Jolla and the Salk Institute I mean they've done great things I mean Jonah Salk the pioneer
[39:50.520 --> 40:00.240]  on the anti polio they also the Salk Institute back about the same time frame was involved
[40:00.240 --> 40:11.240]  in research to create basically peak soldier peak soldiers for the battlefield where they
[40:11.240 --> 40:18.120]  were investigating sleep deprivation getting soldiers to stay up not get tired and they
[40:18.120 --> 40:34.000]  were using something that actually comes from Coco Flavanol that was this project was conducted
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.360]  with the defense advanced research projects agency and the Salk Institute and the Mars
[40:40.360 --> 40:46.040]  company that makes Snickers and Milky Way bars okay so you know this this is just another
[40:46.040 --> 40:52.880]  example some weird science being well they're looking to put regular additives in things
[40:52.880 --> 40:58.840]  tweak them slightly and manipulate the public they now admit that all these DARPA programs
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.640]  are looking at manipulating and creating super soldiers they're testing it on them we've
[41:02.640 --> 41:06.160]  seen that happen with Delta Force and they kill their whole families remember that event
[41:06.160 --> 41:11.320]  five six years ago at Fort Bragg where four groups came back and killed their whole families
[41:11.320 --> 41:15.480]  well one guy didn't he beat the program but the police said he was flopping around and
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.040]  yelling when they pulled up from the burning house exactly what this guy is doing he now
[41:20.040 --> 41:26.440]  looks all drugged up please continue well it's interesting I found a quote from Terence
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.000]  Sejnowski who's with the Salk Institute for biological studies and the director of the
[41:32.000 --> 41:40.080]  computational neurobiology laboratory and he commented that a lot has changed in their
[41:40.080 --> 41:49.200]  study of the brain and he says since the early 80s we now know a lot more about the brain
[41:49.200 --> 41:55.160]  and then he added this perhaps more than we need to know now that's pretty strange comment
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.400]  that's sort of like the guy where they were running the drill the training drill in Douglas
[42:00.400 --> 42:06.400]  County near Aurora who said yeah this is a very strange coincidence we happen to be
[42:06.400 --> 42:12.760]  running a drill on a shooter shooting people in a movie theater at the same time the actual
[42:12.760 --> 42:19.880]  event was taking place and throwing smug bombs yeah so you know so I'm looking at this like
[42:19.880 --> 42:28.520]  I looked at the Jared Loftner case killed judge federal judge role and and and and disabled
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.080]  congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords I mean I was told by people in Arizona who worked with
[42:34.080 --> 42:42.840]  the FBI that he was an MK ultra product and I am firmly convinced that Mr. Holmes James
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.840]  Holmes was also involved in some experiment now was he involved willingly or unwillingly
[42:48.840 --> 42:55.280]  isn't it funny the and shoots medical campus will not release any records of his time at
[42:55.280 --> 43:01.240]  that medical school nor will other universities he was associated with in the past release
[43:01.240 --> 43:05.960]  and we know what they do now the cutting edge is what they call vaccines but they're really
[43:05.960 --> 43:12.120]  live viruses that are really nanotech they're programmed to go in and eat certain ganglia
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.840]  in the brain in certain nerve centers and the reason they know where to attack is it
[43:16.840 --> 43:24.080]  has to be ganglia I in absorbing a certain chemical or endorphin or hormone so they go
[43:24.080 --> 43:31.080]  where those are available and destroy them then drugs can be added to manipulate the
[43:31.080 --> 43:35.440]  interfaces it's very sophisticated but I've read the papers on it and that's what they're
[43:35.440 --> 43:43.360]  moving to in pharmacological crops to basically without people understanding it phasing it
[43:43.360 --> 43:50.200]  in where the general public just incrementally are turned into biological androids right
[43:50.200 --> 43:57.200]  and it's also interesting that Holmes's father Dr. Robert Holmes worked with a company that
[43:57.200 --> 44:02.680]  was a partner of DARPA Defense Advanced Research Project Agency now this DARPA outfit does
[44:02.680 --> 44:09.800]  a lot of this weird science okay they they spend all this taxpayer money research futuristic
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.840]  research it's actually I've been told by people in the Pentagon it's a huge washing machine
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.640]  where they launder intelligence agency money through DARPA to come up with a lot of strange
[44:20.640 --> 44:28.080]  things that Congress would never in its right mind approve of on a you know line item budget
[44:28.080 --> 44:32.440]  thing what do you make of the timing we're obviously going to have to hold you a little
[44:32.440 --> 44:35.360]  bit in the next hour so move Joel Gilbert he'll be alright because I want to get to
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.800]  these calls from people in Colorado for you folks stay there we want to hear from you
[44:38.800 --> 44:45.400]  800 at 25 at 9 9 2 3 1 what do you make of the timing you know Obama says the next two
[44:45.400 --> 44:49.960]  weeks he's going to sign the UN treaty then he just a few votes in the Senate didn't have
[44:49.960 --> 44:56.320]  them you know this push for restricting guns what do you make of the timing of this well
[44:56.320 --> 45:03.520]  sure took a lot of other stories off the front pages that's for sure including all the investigation
[45:03.520 --> 45:12.040]  of Mr. Romney's money offshore with Bain Capital he's got to be really happy about this because
[45:12.040 --> 45:16.760]  that was really starting to hurt him the whole main capital thing and he wouldn't stand up
[45:16.760 --> 45:22.680]  for himself and stuff yeah that's interesting absolutely also Dr. Robert Holmes the father
[45:22.680 --> 45:28.560]  of James Holmes that the company worked for was called HNC software it was in San Diego
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.080]  and and they merged later with a company called FICO now they say he now works at FICO which
[45:34.080 --> 45:40.520]  does a lot of predictive programming for people and for the credit industry you know to make
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.920]  sure that people who are using credit cards it's actually them but they use the neural
[45:45.920 --> 45:52.480]  networking to do this so he was involved in a lot of this neural networking research himself
[45:52.480 --> 45:58.320]  and so was that company and they had contracts with DARPA you know what else is funny I want
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.040]  you to get to that but I want your take on this I'm sure you'll know this most people
[46:02.040 --> 46:07.440]  don't Theodore Kaczynski volunteered for the MKUltra program we didn't find out till a
[46:07.440 --> 46:12.640]  lot later when they declassified some of that but he was a volunteer so you volunteer but
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.680]  you don't know what you're volunteering for and of course he was the unabomber well sure
[46:16.680 --> 46:21.960]  and you look at the whole history of MKUltra what do you find you find Timothy Leary you
[46:21.960 --> 46:28.480]  know who promoted the use of LSD was part of that as was JD Salinger the author of Catcher
[46:28.480 --> 46:33.240]  in the Rye and remember how many presidential assassins where they would go into their apartment
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.200]  and they'd find they only had a couple of books but one of them was always Catcher in
[46:37.200 --> 46:44.320]  the Rye I mean this was the case with Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon it was the
[46:44.320 --> 46:50.840]  case with Arthur Bremer who shot George Wallace it was the case with a lot of these presidential
[46:50.840 --> 47:00.560]  assassins so I think they also found a copy in Timothy McBae's place so has Batman replaced
[47:00.560 --> 47:05.920]  you know nobody's reading anymore they're going to movies so has Batman replaced Catcher
[47:05.920 --> 47:10.400]  in the Rye as the triggering mechanism yeah and to explain that I made a video a month
[47:10.400 --> 47:15.200]  ago saying this film has triggers in it for violence because I could just watch it and
[47:15.200 --> 47:23.040]  see that it's just incredible that these films are just backdrops for brainwashing I want
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.960]  to go back to some calls now and I want to get deeper into your views on this and then
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.040]  the big NSA scandal that's coming out we're going to go to Julian and Greg in a moment
[47:31.040 --> 47:36.480]  but Joe in Colorado you were on earlier but we had to go to break so I hold you over you're
[47:36.480 --> 47:40.660]  a veteran you're there in the area you're saying you're not buying it what do you make
[47:40.660 --> 47:45.440]  of what Wayne Madsen's been saying and then go ahead and make your other point yeah you
[47:45.440 --> 47:51.040]  know you know leads all back you know you just follow you know who's involved and you
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.800]  know you go deeper into it than what the media is telling you and you always want to find
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.680]  you know some things that you need to ask more questions about so I agree with them
[48:00.680 --> 48:07.520]  on that about the culture you know like I said in the military we would see a lot of
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.440]  things and guys would giggle and think it's funny and I was the one that was kind of thinking
[48:12.440 --> 48:16.400]  you know what's going on that's kind of the reason why I got out and you know that's what's
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.920]  going on with society you know they think those things is funny you know and it's just
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.000]  kind of sad man you know but you know the people that are waking up they're going to
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.840]  do us right and you know I just pray for everybody because things are about to get out of hand
[48:31.840 --> 48:32.840]  you know.
[48:32.840 --> 48:37.040]  God bless you sir I appreciate your fine points yeah that's what I took away from watching
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.400]  Batman last night is I don't think of myself as some really smart hot shot and I talk to
[48:42.400 --> 48:48.760]  adults and people and they're like children and I guess it's television Wayne do you get
[48:48.760 --> 48:52.360]  the point I'm making about more and more either people are awake or they're getting
[48:52.360 --> 48:57.280]  more and more dumbed down whether where they're like children and they have this Pavlovian
[48:57.280 --> 49:03.240]  precondition response to just giggle about everything yeah and I you know you have to
[49:03.240 --> 49:08.400]  wonder about predictive programming techniques in Hollywood I would note that on August the
[49:08.400 --> 49:15.760]  10th we're going to see the premiere of the new born legacy movie the newest in the series
[49:15.760 --> 49:23.480]  by Robert Ludlam and although it's like a super version of Jason Bourne the Treadstone
[49:23.480 --> 49:31.680]  was actually that it's fictitious a CIA assassination program but Treadstone is absolutely MK Ultra
[49:31.680 --> 49:38.600]  if anyone has seen the the Bourne movies you'll know that and Ludlam it's incredibly accurate
[49:38.600 --> 49:45.080]  from what he classified they really did that that's right I also note that James Holmes
[49:45.080 --> 49:49.480]  is the grandson of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Holmes who was one of the first graduates
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.600]  at the army language school now the defense language institute in Monterey California
[49:54.600 --> 50:02.600]  one of the first graduates in the Turkish language there in 19 about 1948 so we now have a link
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.800]  between Holmes and Lisa's grandfather because once you graduate from that school and one
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.160]  of those languages you're obviously going to go work on a fish under official cover
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.960]  for the CIA or the Defense Intelligence Agency in this case it would have been obviously
[50:18.960 --> 50:24.000]  would have been Turkey so there's a link there the other thing I would note it's very strange
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.800]  is the car that Holmes drove to the theater and had Tennessee plates now what is the link
[50:31.800 --> 50:37.200]  to Tennessee we're told he was from San Diego he went to University of California at Riverside
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.680]  what's the what's the link to Tennessee I haven't seen anything more on that that that's
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.640]  the witnesses are saying multiple shooters stay there Wayne great points a lot of other
[50:47.640 --> 50:53.120]  points on this why would they do this now and then we're going to go to Julian and Greg
[50:53.120 --> 50:56.680]  straight ahead we just we're going to go to you right after this break with Wayne mad
[50:56.680 --> 51:02.160]  someone keep him about 15 minutes and then get our next cast on let me ask you a question
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.480]  what does freedom mean to you freedom to choose the freedom to vote and freedom to worship
[51:06.480 --> 51:10.360]  how about the freedom to take control of your own future my friends the foods director celebrating

[54:34.840 --> 54:42.360]  shootings are for obama a whole article is there right there and i hope that everybody

[54:52.000 --> 54:55.320]  in fact i'm going to get him to add the part about oklahoma city i mean he's got it in
[54:55.320 --> 54:58.760]  there but even glenn beck shing they're getting ready to stage it and blame it on us because
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.040]  they say that boy we're going to have an oklahoma we're going to blame it on them they don't
[55:02.040 --> 55:04.160]  say they're going to do it they say we're going to have one we're going to blame it
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.920]  on like saying that banks going to get robbed next week we're going to blame it on this
[55:10.920 --> 55:14.960]  guy who's the first person you go to hey you said that bank was going to get robbed it
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.720]  got robbed once you get up against the car we're putting handcuffs on you instead it's
[55:18.720 --> 55:24.480]  like oh yeah so uh wane madson you pointed at romney though saying it's got a lot of
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.640]  stuff out of the news i mean romney's not in control the justice department stuff that
[55:28.640 --> 55:34.880]  ran fast and furious i mean isn't this their mo holder and people from oklahoma city well
[55:34.880 --> 55:40.080]  yeah you know i mean it's all fast and furious thing you know at which i still also think
[55:40.080 --> 55:47.160]  was uh to destabilize mexico to get this guy this new world order guy uh the new president
[55:47.160 --> 55:52.000]  uh installed down there it looks like they stole that election uh the two opposition
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.240]  parties anywhere claiming it uh it happened and um uh but uh yeah i mean there's a lot
[55:59.240 --> 56:04.440]  of cheap political uh shots being made right now i i don't often listen to serious radio
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.400]  but i was listening to tom hartman's program yesterday where he brought your name up uh
[56:09.400 --> 56:15.400]  he started talking about the you know the right wing uh fringe that wants guns and uh uh and
[56:15.400 --> 56:22.120]  uh mentioned you in particular and and and debunked all these conspiracy notions about
[56:22.120 --> 56:28.120]  colorado and and i think he mentioned you in the same sentence with david koresh uh
[56:28.120 --> 56:33.000]  it's amazing he's he's got a program on rt i don't know what happened to that network
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.840]  but uh he's clearly funded by the center for american progress which is the soros george
[56:38.840 --> 56:45.320]  soros uh finance think tank that basically acts as a policy totes for the white house well
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.120]  there you go there you go think progress is run by soros in the white house it's on record
[56:50.120 --> 56:55.720]  they have meetings weekly there and they basically called for us to be shut down uh last week
[56:55.720 --> 57:01.000]  and now you tune into the radio and hartman who who used to be an okay guy you know i i used
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.680]  to get him on the show i i've been on the show before and he just viciously attacks me now
[57:06.680 --> 57:12.360]  and starts making stuff up and it's really creepy to see somebody totally join the dark side
[57:12.360 --> 57:15.880]  because you can be a liberal or conservative and and you know i could disagree with you about
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.760]  something but when you get so so basically just to get this right because i'm going to go find it
[57:20.760 --> 57:24.920]  into a story on it because this is this is a big deal they're trying to blame rush limbaugh too for
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.080]  this and again folks even you don't like rush limbaugh if they can demonize the first amendment
[57:29.080 --> 57:34.760]  and talk show host they can have a chilling effect and go after us all that was on ms nbc uh you're
[57:34.760 --> 57:40.840]  telling me was also on nbc national tv you're telling me that he was saying that basically
[57:40.840 --> 57:47.080]  this culture of guns alex jones implying somehow oh uh you know that we're causing the culture
[57:47.080 --> 57:52.520]  or am i wrong there and then implying i'm a cult leader like david koresh yeah and you know and
[57:52.520 --> 57:57.880]  i'm pulling this uh you know how to making us out a whole cloth about the conspiracy cokes out
[57:57.880 --> 58:04.120]  you know taking advantage of this incident to you know try to put out a lot of various uh
[58:04.120 --> 58:11.000]  conspiracy theories i mean he loves to use that term because remember this term uh became a vogue
[58:11.000 --> 58:17.080]  term after the canady assassination in 63 when people say we're not going to buy this uh this
[58:17.080 --> 58:22.840]  ludicrous notion that this guy was a lone gunman and it's been a use as a pejorative term ever since
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.160]  i stay there we got to go to break but i'm going to go to julian and then gregg from
[58:27.160 --> 58:31.640]  colorado i promise straight ahead this is just i was about to go to you and hit me with that news

[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:21.480]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.640]  former national security agency um
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.440]  operative employee
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.280]  Wayne madson investigative journalist joins us right now i'm going to get his take and
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:42.920]  on exactly what tom hartman uh over on xm and i syndicated radio was saying about me
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.200]  and i'm david correctionalist stuff um i guess i need to be burned up with my family is that
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.480]  what that what happens to heretics like me that don't trust known lying government okay
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.960]  pray for us folks because the white house through its operatives are now attacking us
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.520]  i'm seeing reports every day without looking and it's it's really getting bad and they're saying
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:08.040]  stuff like shut me down shut me up which then they usually carry out so and i've really been
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.680]  feeling creeped out lately but that's just the way it is uh so it's victims of our success here
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.800]  which is on the road i walk it's what i asked for uh julian and colorado you're on the air with
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:26.440]  Wayne madson thanks for holding uh what's your take on all this um i just think it's just another
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:37.640]  distraction for obama to kind of regroup and try and make and make enough of an effort towards
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.640]  bringing everyone back to his side before the election comes up
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.560]  no doubt that it's a distraction from them gearing up to have war with iran and syria
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:57.240]  uh that's huge news where are you in colorado um i'm actually uh i work in a commerce city
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.840]  which is just pretty much due north of uh aurora actually what are your friends and family saying
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.280]  what's your take on this i mean i know your take what's their take yeah well my friends and family
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:14.680]  just pretty much has been following the media and really just believe that he's just the crazy maniac
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:23.000]  that just went off the deep end i guess and but i mean i personally think it's a little
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.240]  funny because uh friday i came in to work around eight o'clock and i didn't know any about the news
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:36.440]  until i was off on my lunch hour and uh right when i was pulling out i saw three uh black
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:45.320]  clock helicopters heading due north from the aurora area over my over where i work in commerce city
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.360]  oh probably miller time after a good mission completed thank you for the call uh let's talk
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.240]  to greg real quick we're going back to uh wane madson greg in colorado you got any questions or
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.200]  comments oh yeah thanks i got some comments um i've seen so many uh documents over the last
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:09.560]  few days from homeland security and different fusion centers i saw one this was literally
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:15.880]  hours after the shooting from new jersey the new jersey fusion center assessment of the mass
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:24.520]  shooting and now they're warning of uh security agents to watch out for people filming photographing
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.760]  or videotaping facilities and security posts yeah they're using this as the as the fear to roll out
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.720]  just like the underwear bomber was a roll out the scanners this is the roll out the on the
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:41.720]  street checkpoints great point wane madson yeah you know the other the other thing that i thought
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.040]  was uh rather interesting was the fact that holmes's father so the research he was involved with was
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:55.400]  called uh courtronic neural networking which would allow machines to interpret oral and um visual
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:03.560]  stimuli to think like humans now uh the and shoots medical campus where um uh the joker was
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:10.040]  supposedly the joker if that's who it it was and you know this thing gets more bizarre
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:17.240]  by the day uh they uh when that was fit simons army army medical center they pioneered in the
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:26.120]  research of of uh ships to uh for prosthetic devices for troops that lost limbs on the battlefield
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:32.920]  so there is a legacy of this type of uh research uh exactly stay stay there greg i want to hear more
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.720]  about obviously working some security function beginning these internal alerts we see a lot
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:44.600]  of the public ones they had said that the theater in colorado would be attacked the month before and
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.840]  the fb i pulled that warning the day after the attack last friday show why would they pull one
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.400]  of their little fear mongering things that they might say hey see we told you uh we're gonna
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.120]  come back to that caller and then come back to Wayne madson straight ahead

[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:05.480]  he's there on capitol hill and uh he's concurring that this has mk ultra mind control written all
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.320]  over it multiple shooters multiples uh smoke bombs from different angles the mother's saying she
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.520]  didn't say he did it they just called him said his issue says he said yeah click and then they
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.160]  wouldn't talk to her i mean the whole thing has the scripting the police chief day one saying don't
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.880]  listen to conspiracy theories uh all of this the timing the un treaty all of it but we just had a
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:33.560]  caller in the last segment who got cut off by the break so i want to go back to which caller was it
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.960]  john so now there's more callers from caller up that's great that's what i thought greg was saying
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:45.320]  he got uh these uh homeland security threat fusion center warrings and again a lot of these uh are
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:52.360]  not public but they're not classified send them to whistleblowers at info wars dot com we got the
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.480]  miac homeland security reports over the years uh we you know publish these where they say veterans
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.160]  are the enemy the founding fathers are trash gun owners are evil america's bad basically the tsa
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.560]  is running promos the last year they will be in shopping malls movie theaters i mean this is the
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.160]  rollout and so we told you it's coming and he was saying that indeed they're saying brace brace and
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.880]  all over the country there's hysteria they're arresting people at newbie theaters that just
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.880]  argue if somebody goes out the back exit uh even near the end of the movie uh they call the police
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.440]  the theater is flushed out kind of like if one person goes through security without being checked
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.800]  at the airport everything's shut down and panicking and fear but 60 000 dead on the u.s mexico border
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.680]  the last five years nobody cares you know hundreds of heads being dropped off every year in south
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:46.920]  texas and arizona nobody cares i mean this is just ridiculous this is the new hype and the make
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:52.280]  believe uh that that you know that men in black uniforms are coming to get you so met so you
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:58.760]  gotta give your rights up to men in black uniforms uh but uh cori i guess she or greg uh got another
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.800]  cori there from colorada i guess you work in security to be getting these uh i mean just to
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.240]  recap you were saying within a matter of hours you were getting all of these messages uh coming in
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.240]  from different threat fusion centers so uh what well what area do you work in without being too
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:23.400]  specific well i i have a friend that's in intelligence and he passes uh information over to me and i
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.560]  have two documents actually one's from new jersey from the new jersey regional operations intelligence
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.320]  center and yeah this is literally hours after the shooting it had the description of james
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:42.520]  egan holmes his birthday his age uh warning people now that there could be more shootings
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  in casinos at malls shopping centers sports and entertainment venues schools including which by
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.840]  the way i've said hundreds of times and we've got to have listeners pull up the videos and audio
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.680]  i said the next thing will be at shopping malls and all this to roll out the tsa and the tsa in
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.960]  the last three months has been getting their teams ready in all 50 states and i said magically this
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:09.560]  is going to happen isn't this unbelievable the great uh here's another this is from the uh document
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:16.280]  the greatest threat facing security officials today is that of loan loan offender or homegrown
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:22.200]  violent extremist so this is why they want to keep this loan gunman story going and here's another
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:28.280]  document i found alex this is literally from homeland security within hours after this event
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:34.840]  took place and the documents performance venues indicator of violence and perspective measures
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:42.040]  and again this document talks about now watching for suspicious reporting people at tsa checkpoints
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.840]  talking about again malls and shopping center that's what they're saying is if you argue or
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.640]  videotape you're a terrorist anywhere so the first amendment's terror and this is the new
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.880]  rollout do me a favor i'm going to put you on hold i'm going to give you one of our uh you know
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:03.160]  secret bat emails will will you send that over right now yes can i can i mention one a few more
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.640]  things i saw batman last night and i did research on christopher gnome and he's probably one of my
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:13.560]  favorite directors and so many of his films i have a suspicious feeling that that he's awake
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.200]  to certain these to certain things last night in batman they talked about training exercises
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.920]  during the scene where they take down uh the football games correct well what happened here
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.560]  with the shooting in colorado there there were training exercises there's a lot of indicators
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.880]  and one more thing wane i followed your work you talked about how we're used in the Mormon
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:38.120]  mafia connections kind of kind of the met romney well christopher no one has a film coming out
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:43.640]  i believe in the next year or the year after that about howard hughes and his connections to the
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.800]  Mormon mafia and his eventual death and one one more thing it's no coincidence but this weekend
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:55.640]  here in aspen i'm about 10 miles from aspen we have the aspen security form taking place
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:02.600]  and the who's too of government intelligence oh yeah the nra was meeting in denver during columbine
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.880]  i mean they scripted they did that there to demonize them it's so obvious thank you so much
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.880]  we've got to move because you only got five six minutes left when wane madson and wane madson
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.720]  the port dot com uh but i mean wane how many times did we talk about the new rollout is going to be
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.280]  a tax and shopping malls and new v theaters because they were scripting it and now we've
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.360]  confirmed the tsa is deploying into all 50 states rolling out uh my goodness could they trigger a
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:35.160]  whole line of sleeper agents well there's there's some countries overseas where if you go into a
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.440]  shopping mall or a restaurant you've got to go through a metal detector and i and i and there's
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:47.400]  a report that michael charitoff was in denver just uh he was before this attack uh he was he was there
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:55.960]  so as so here's we here we have mr rapist scan mr mr pervert uh you know body scan uh out there
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.000]  right before this happens sort of like when rudy juliani happened to be in london with
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.680]  benjamin net yahu during the uh the london transit bombings and there was a drill going on there as
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.280]  well of the exact targets hit at the exact time at the exact locations we did the math it was from
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:18.440]  an actual area uh with a uh insurance company just the basic computer breakdown was something
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:25.560]  like one out of 23 trek to gillian and right right yeah i figured the odds you know and the other
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.800]  the other thing i find interesting is this cortronic neural networking this man machine
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.080]  interface a lot of that work was pioneered by the rand corporation now they're a well-known
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:41.880]  uh intelligence uh operation doing all kinds of wacky uh research and well they're the master
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.160]  planner group well that's right and you know even stanley cooperic made fun of them in the movie
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.360]  dr strange love when he referred to them as the bland corporation so they've had a long history
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:58.600]  of coming up with a really crazy uh r&d project so their their fingerprints are all over this
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:07.240]  uh man machine interface uh cortronic cognitive cognitive neurology uh research as well unbelievable
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.280]  uh listen i want to because you brought this up before the last hour in it can you just recap
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.080]  what you heard tom hartman on a syndicated radio show uh saying uh about me because i mean you
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:25.480]  were moving quick are you saying he was implying somehow that my rhetoric is is is causing this
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:30.440]  stuff to happen yeah this is what you're hearing it's like uh oh yeah there'll be the conspiracy
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  theorists uh the cougs will will now come out and say there's a plan to uh seize weapons he
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.960]  mentioned your name and then he said you know the this is the fringe that represented by uh people
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.760]  like david koresh and the branch devideans and you know it's not just hartman but you hear the
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:52.840]  same stuff from these other obama bots like bill press and uh you know ed schultz and the rest of
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.840]  them uh and it's it's quite clear that all the all there there are only reason for existence
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:06.680]  is to uh you know basically uh grandstand for uh the administration uh otherwise they wouldn't
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.680]  have these corporate jobs that they have uh if they were uh telling the truth they don't have any
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.360]  room and we we see what happens with them when somebody's on msnbc they start telling the truth
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.760]  they get fired immediately uh you know felt down to you one case and point yeah sure uh but i mean
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.560]  it's just so sickening to be funded by george soros i mean i mean think progress that they work
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.720]  for is on record a white house front run by top advisors of obama and i mean if they're worried
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:42.040]  about alex jones they've got bigger problems i would imagine out there i mean people know your
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:47.160]  people know obama's a crook they know holders a crook i mean and it's done and and and and all
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.120]  you do uh is give us credibility when you attack us we only got a minute or two left i want to get
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.600]  you back up soon about this what do you what do you make of the nsa now in court admitting
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.520]  they're spying on all communications real time illegally well i had there were a lot of whistleblowers
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:08.440]  came to me before uh obama started uh you know bringing charges against people to talk to the
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:16.360]  press but i i was told this years ago that nsa was uh doing vacuum cleaner sweeps of communications
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:23.560]  uh not for any sort of plausible uh or a predicate criminal predicate but just to um um
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:31.320]  surf surf the uh the ether trying to find uh what people are thinking uh what their politics are
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:38.120]  and put them obviously in databases uh they're labeled you know uh as threats and this is what's
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:44.680]  going on and they're building this huge uh facility in utah uh where they're going to maintain all this
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:53.960]  data and you work there i i mean this is super super creepy and totally illegal and and now
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:59.080]  cherdoff in denver said we need the nsa to spy on everybody that's the answer because the shooting's
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:06.440]  very disgusting absolutely and you know there's a long history of nsa using dupes like robert
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:12.520]  morris jr and 88 at cornell who released the internet worm program his father was the chief
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:18.280]  scientist for nsa when when that happened then of course now that kind of thing is used in cyber
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:24.920]  warfare strategy uh on a daily basis well it's just like our government with israel released
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.920]  stuxnet and now they're using it as the excuse to try to take over the web and take our freedom on the
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:35.480]  web it's ridiculous absolutely and you know again it's it's uh there is no check and balance the
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:41.880]  congress is not doing its job at uh maintaining supervision over these wacky agencies should
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.440]  i be concerned now that on a daily basis soro fronts are attacking me i mean i used to was
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:52.360]  every few weeks now it's every day should i be worried uh i i don't think so i mean soros uh
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:58.120]  with all his money i i think he's very vulnerable all right thank you so much wane madson report

[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:04.120]  okay coming up ever Joel Gilbert leaves us i'm gonna get into the national hysteria
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:09.880]  where they find a drunk with a backpack and moonshine and it's like batman run for the hills
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.120]  i mean if they see a bump on a log it's just fall to your knees shaking fear
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.760]  veins going to get you a ronald mcdonald joker is going to pop out and kill you
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:25.160]  only obama and tsa and all the uh grocery stores can save you i mean it is so frightening
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.560]  what's happening oh my gosh we need marshal law immediately which is all the new batman
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:36.360]  movie promotes i mean this country is in a fantasy land coma that's what's going on here
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.480]  they've admitted all over the news this real name was buried sataro and no one knows where he
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:47.000]  was really born but he said for 16 and a half years he was born in kenya on his own pr press
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.560]  releases but it looks like he really was born in hawaii but frank marshal davis the film dreams
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:58.760]  of my real father is available at info warshop.com we've had at the last month because they graciously
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:04.120]  let us put it out first today is its official release date and i wanted to get joel gilbert
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:10.760]  on to give us his take on the aftermath of people starting to see the film what he makes
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:17.800]  of obama and the un gun treaty and i want to take calls for joel gilbert of any questions you have
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:28.600]  for him at 800-259-9231 we'll get to quarry from colorado as well but 800-259-9231 questions for
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:35.080]  joel gilbert about the film joel thank you for joining us today good to have you here with us
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:40.440]  out of the gates i've got to ask you we've got an article up at info wars.com with all these top
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.000]  democrats saying in the last two years that a mass shooting would help obama connect with the public
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  but in oklahoma city would be even better and now the mother saying she never said her son did it
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.200]  that they made that up they're reporting multiple shooters i mean if they ran fast and furious which
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.240]  is a false flag attack to blame the second amendment would they do something like this
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.720]  i mean i know there folks that say they want to kill 25 million of us in reeducation camps
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.040]  but i guess they wouldn't they wouldn't do something like stage at theater shooting would they joel
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.760]  well you almost uh i hate to say it but you can't put anything past them because the capitulation
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:26.360]  the lies the dishonesty of the national so-called mainstream media and then some uh becomes more
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.160]  and more disturbing every day i was at the national press club in washington last week
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:38.360]  on thursday and i gave a 30 minute speech and the first thing i said was any journalist in this
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.400]  building in the national press club all they have to do is come down and watch the excerpts from my
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:50.520]  film dreams from my real father and they can win a public surprise all you've got to do is talk about
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:57.800]  the evidence that obama sold himself to america as the multicultural ideal a man who stood above
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:03.640]  politics that was the story because his father was a goat herder from canya and he would bring
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.880]  people together and as a result people perceived him as a nice man and with an inspiring family
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:16.040]  story and the national media went with that but in my film which you have on your on your info
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:22.680]  info war store dreams from my real father i demonstrate that obama actually has a deeply
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:29.960]  disturbing family background which he intentionally hid that his real biological and then ideological
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:36.680]  father was a communist party usa propagandist and soviet agent frank marshall davis now while
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:43.400]  voters will overlook some fudging by politicians uh to create a false background and promote it to
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:51.080]  hide an agenda irreconcilable the american values is totally unacceptable and the only reason he's
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.960]  able to get away with it is because the media will not tell the truth so don't trust him with anything
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:03.000]  that's what i say and now they're having to admit that okay his dad wasn't tortured by the british
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.880]  and ken yet wasn't even his dad they're having to admit it a lot of these photos are photoshopped
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.840]  in things i mean who is this guy i mean i agree frank marshall davis he talks about him like he's
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.720]  his dad he hung out with him as a cat a lot grand paul brought him over there was some weird thing
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.600]  between him obama says you know his grandfather it's some unspoken thing with him and frank marshall
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.040]  davis uh his mother they're posing on the couch naked and then you see davis and other photos on
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:33.400]  that couch he was a secret pornographer publisher of you know all these porno things i mean it's
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:40.680]  just it's just so seedy and so weird but and and then it's the only plausible story the film is
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.800]  bombshell and it's available right now at info warshop.com we're going to get the aftermath of

[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:21.560]  joel just began to investigate obama himself and ran into this information and it turned out
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.200]  separately other investigators had actually talked about this three years ago and it had
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.480]  been on national news joel separately discovered people talked about frank marcel davis being his
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.440]  father let me tell you the voice everything's spitting image he writes about him almost more
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:42.360]  than his mother in his book it just you've got to see the film dreams of my real father available
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.240]  at info warshop dot com or info wars dot com or prison planet dot com will get you there
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:53.240]  because when i was first told about this i don't know like three months ago by dr coursey uh
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.000]  because you know coursey's just like we don't know who he is we know the official story is not true
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.080]  i was like okay well yeah let me see the film so i got one early and i was like wow this is
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:11.240]  really convincing this this really makes sense i'd say i'm about 95 convinced by the film everybody
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.080]  i know that sees it just says oh my gosh i mean you got to see it all the comparisons the photos
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.960]  they visit the house where frank marcel davis lived where obama went every week i mean this is his
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.840]  daddy and then you understand why his wife said he was born in kenya in multiple speeches even
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:32.120]  four years ago there's video of that just pull up michelle obama says that he was born in kenya
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.920]  and and it's put out in all his literature and all of his pr things you know hundreds of
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.160]  publications we're like hey you say you're born in kenya we know these birth certificates are fake
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.920]  and then we but your dad doesn't look anything like you on the state department said it wasn't
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:50.040]  your dad and kicked him out you got a dead person social security number and you know they said he
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:55.160]  wasn't named barry sataro but turned out he was and now they make a joke out of it it turns out
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.840]  most of the stuff in the book isn't true and then you got all these weird cia people i want to go to
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.560]  calls and but first find out the latest you know backlash whatever's you know happened to you jolson
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.440]  she were on with us a few weeks ago on the nightly news and a few months ago on the radio but today's
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:17.080]  the official release date of dreams of my father's well dreams of my i'm i'm thinking of the book
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:24.200]  that you then researched for dreams of my real father but erin dykes who's a host of the nightly
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:31.480]  news here and a researcher he agrees with your analysis that their enforcer level is a communist
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:38.120]  brigade model and they are communist but above that is all the mega rich foundations and ultra
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:43.160]  wealthy funding it i've asked you this question but erin you can just rattle off all the foundation
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:50.200]  names uh so erin dykes pose your question to joel gilbert uh here and then we'll get his take on that
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:55.720]  go ahead uh erin right hi joel yeah first i found your film gripping of course and everything but
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.840]  i was wondering obviously hillary's and olenskiite but at this point the clinton family's very much
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:06.920]  on the globalist agenda stage not trapped within a communist thing and it's the same deal with the
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:12.200]  ayers connections you've got bill ayers a very you know weather underground very violent group
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:18.840]  part of like almost a proto occupy wall street but then conversely his father is a mega rich
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:25.160]  foundation funded he sits on what 1015 boards in chicago he's on the surle board which is
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.520]  what monsanto became later merged their anti free market they want monopolies right i was just
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:36.680]  wondering on his take on the larger agenda beyond kind of the glass ceiling of communism yeah we've
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:42.200]  we found as the the book none their color conspiracy shows there is a mega crony capitalist
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:49.640]  anti free market group well carol quickly wrote about this okay let me let me answer uh i can tell
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:57.720]  you that the style of the socialist and communist is to use anyone and everyone that they can to
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:04.440]  achieve power uh frank marshal davis obama's real father was in charge of bringing blacks into the
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.920]  communist movement in chicago in the 1930s now he ultimately failed because the blacks were religious
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:18.760]  people and communism was atheist obama goes back to chicago follows in his father's footsteps in
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.680]  reverse some years later from hawaii to chicago and he has much more success in recruiting black
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:31.000]  people to the socialist movement to acorn and all the affiliated movements i can tell you that the
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:40.520]  communists consider minorities blacks hispanics rich people oligarchs the middle class simply
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:47.080]  has pawns that will be discarded once they achieve power no i know i understand that why do the mega
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:55.960]  rich in so many cases find a communist i think that they think they can control them and they won't
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.880]  be able to uh uh cut off their funding at any point but i think their interests will ultimately
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:08.920]  collide and those two groups will eventually part and i even have uh new information on obama that
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.880]  we came out with just last week i think we sent it in that we actually discovered on obama's own
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:20.120]  facebook page he has a picture of him at 12 years old with his mother grandfather and half sister
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:27.000]  and we see the hand of frank marshall davis a black man's hand attached to and dunham obviously a
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.400]  photoshop forgery now this is incredibly bad why are always the forgery so bad i think it's because
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.520]  if you're the president united states you can't put an ad in the washington poster on craigslist
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:44.840]  that says if you need i need a forager please contact 1600 pennsylvania avenue you have to
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:50.600]  rely on someone very very close to you that would never testify against you it has to be
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:56.200]  literally a close person or family member who happens to know a little photoshop so that's why
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.160]  i believe he's stuck making bad forgeries and if you look on obama's facebook page or on
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:08.520]  my website obama's realfather.com you can see an obvious forgery uh from obama where he's
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:15.560]  doing a pattern what i say is a pattern of document forgery to hide the role yeah we've got
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.960]  the new video we're rolling it right now in fact i'm gonna have guys ask hurt nemo please
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.000]  to post this in the tiles and in full wars dot com right now thank you so much you're absolutely
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.760]  right i mean this is just crazy but undoubtedly from your own research there are the mega rich
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:35.800]  funding communism and and what they want is a world monopoly where the globalists are exempt
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:41.720]  from the laws but within the country they squeeze and destroy the middle class i think uh the middle
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.120]  class has always been a target of the communists all the way back to bill ares and the weather
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:53.000]  underground they hated the middle class and obama's uh lie of his campaign is to say that he wants to
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.600]  help middle class families in fact socialist economies don't have a middle class they just
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.640]  have one lower class all these policies health care wealth redistribution it's all about eliminating
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:11.480]  the upper and middle class to create a massive lower class with political elites that control the
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.680]  wealth and control the government we've seen it a million times in europe in russia no it creates
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.480]  hell on earth larry larry graphwald as you know you're speaking in a conference with him very soon
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.440]  he was on about a week and a half ago with us and you know we were playing the clips of where
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.760]  they were talking about how they were going to put a hundred million in camps killed 25 million
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:36.280]  and licking their lips i mean mainly these are a bunch of just gibbering demonic psychopath control
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:42.520]  freaks and the disturbing part is no matter how much good information we put out i put out this
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:48.920]  film as a cohesive understanding of obama's life history from his tutelage from his real father
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.200]  frank marshall davis through his relationship with the bill ares and the ares family and we can't get
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:00.040]  the media to cover it so i told you a couple weeks ago that i was going to announce a way to reach
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.720]  everybody in america since they would not cover this important story so now i'm going to tell you
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:12.200]  what it is we are mailing we've secured funding to mail starting it's already in the process starting
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:19.560]  two weeks from today we're going to mail a free copy of a couple hundred thousand dvds to addresses
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.920]  in ohio and virginia that's starting in a few weeks and from there we're going to expand
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:30.600]  across all the united states as much as we can depending on the funding we get and that way
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.640]  there'll be a grassroots knowledge of this story people can really see what obama's real
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.880]  deadly marxist agenda is for america and how it will really affect the middle class and it's nothing
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.240]  about helping them it's about eliminating them hey what about mailing uh ten thousand to congress
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.680]  that would be effective as well well i was on capitol hill last week and i dropped several
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.000]  copies uh amongst sympathetic hopefully members of congress but generally they're afraid to talk
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.600]  about it a lot of the mainstream media say we've seen the film we agree with you this is shocking
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:10.360]  this is blockbuster but we're afraid we're afraid and i said look we're going to send out hundreds
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.800]  of thousands of copies and they said well once people talk about it more then maybe we can talk
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.240]  about it so i appreciate you alex that you're unafraid well it is important for people to hit
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:26.440]  the bar bar first so others can follow the trailblazers like yourself and you know more and more
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.600]  than media is starting to report on a lot of the things that are happening like fast and furious
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:36.920]  in other areas but um you know the fact is obama has been caught lying about his past a bunch
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:42.040]  so no one can then criticize us if we start investigating it uh deeper i want to go to
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.000]  some phone calls but i wanted to ask you what else has come out new other than the uh doctored
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  photos you found on their facebook uh on barry sataro aka barack obama whatever his real name
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:03.160]  is uh i guess maroc uh hussein uh davis uh i mean president davis uh what else have you learned
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:09.000]  what type of backlash have you experienced uh i haven't gotten much uh backlash because mainstream
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.680]  media wants to ignore me though media matters has written a couple of nasty articles the last
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.280]  few days nobody reads george soros's publication yeah i received did receive hundreds of emails
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.720]  from concerned americans one was very touching it was from a uh vietnam veteran he said to me
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:32.120]  we're on the verge of losing the constitution freedom and liberty are in jeopardy as a vietnam
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:39.000]  veteran i ask what did i fight for that's what he emailed me so i'm very encouraged by the a number
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.280]  of people that have written in and said can you please share this with millions so we can get the
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.320]  message out about what's really happening to the government and what obama's real political
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:55.800]  foundation is i think i've proven in my film that his political foundation is an a Stalinist
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.880]  version of marxism and that's why he showed up admittedly at occidental college at 18 years old
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.160]  as a committed revolutionary marxist in his own words and he's been pursuing the dreams
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.760]  from his real father frank marshall davis his entire life now it's great to mail this out to
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:18.680]  200 000 people in key states to get you know coverage but uh if people want to air this on access tv
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:24.360]  i guess they just email you to get permission correct okay uh let's uh go to some calls most
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:31.800]  of them are for you joe collin uh collin uh jesse mark and others but quarry's been holding
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.840]  since the last hour or the start of this hour from colorado on the shooting let's get his take
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:44.680]  real quick on uh that event very fortuitous for obama and we have top obama advisors not one not
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:50.120]  two not three but four in an article titled democratic operatives urge obama to seize on attacks
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.920]  that's a good headline by paul watson alex jones but i i think i may change the headline to
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:00.920]  democratic operatives you know you you know tell obama attacks will help him or something like
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:06.680]  that because that's really what it says it's amazing information uh i'm now talking to journalist
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:12.680]  i've been blamed by tom hartman basically that it's my fault things are happening uh and i guess
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:18.680]  wherever they're on the radio uh and then i guess i've all rushed limbaugh's been blamed what by nbc
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.840]  they say you know talk show hosts like that and they harken back to clinton after oklahoma city
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:28.600]  blaming people so this is very very dangerous uh situation uh quarry in colorado you're on the
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:35.480]  air go ahead hi alex i've been a fan of yours for about eight or nine years i've i've bought
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.720]  all your videos thank you i wanted to tell i wanted to tell you something that i think
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:45.720]  is kind of important years ago in that tech shooting you were gone that day and i drove home
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:51.480]  saw the flags were half staffed and i came my office i turned your show on and the other
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.280]  gentleman was there and you were gone and they put us on the air live and those kids as you
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.280]  know were being shot at they were listening to your show we were telling them that to run from
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:05.560]  the black ops that they were not there to protect them and at that particular time i was a personal
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:11.640]  friend with a black op he was running for his life because he left the black ops and they wanted
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.480]  him to go do a mission and he refused to do it so he was in hiding he was calling me from
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:21.240]  all over the country and all over the world and hiding but right after that tech shooting and i
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:28.440]  was on the on live on the air with on your show exposing that within 45 days a black op helicopter
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:35.000]  came over to my house and flew right above my house and i could see the pilot's face well man a lot
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.800]  of that is they fly around with infrared cameras and grids looking for marijuana growing and it's
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.680]  wrong to have the department of defense doing that but just because a helicopter flies over your house
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:50.840]  does not mean they're coming to get you but i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead and talk
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.760]  to now the first caller holding listening on 90.1 fm in austin texas mark you're on the air with
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:02.600]  the director of dreams of my real father joel gilbert go ahead yes sir well joel let me tell you
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:08.120]  that i uh i ordered your movie uh through uh info wars store dot com or uh would have you with the
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.960]  address and i loved it i was perfect did a very great job and uh i felt like a fat kid trapped in
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.960]  a cake factory you know what i mean it was just one of those things where i couldn't stop watching
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.760]  and i've been working for years on getting my fiance to wake up and she finally woke up after
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:27.160]  this movie yeah it's chillingly convincing to quote my dad because my dad came over and got one
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.920]  like a month ago when we first started selling it you know early before it even came out
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:36.520]  officially and uh he said i want to see this and i saw him a few days later he was out visiting
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.840]  with his grandchildren and i said well what'd you think of it he says chillingly convincing and i
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:46.040]  said oh that's a good good quote chillingly convincing do you have any questions for uh joel
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.960]  gilbert yeah um one thing about the whole uh fake documents issue i think you're just being
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:57.800]  a tad bit naive on that because even the most corrupt president always has very expert you
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:03.000]  know photoshop people at his uh disposal i think the reason they're doing that is because and i
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.320]  would like your comments on this after i uh ask i'll hang up and listen but i think that he's doing
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.960]  it because of the whole we have to show you what we're doing before we do it to you issue
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.280]  you know everything has to be laid out you have to have signed off on all of it and
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:22.040]  they're just making it obvious and the revenue in our faces well i i don't agree i think uh
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:28.520]  it's very hard to uh forge documents and keep the loyalty of a person who would go to jail for
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.880]  forgery uh that has to be someone very close to you so i wouldn't think it's any more complicated
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:39.800]  than simply uh obama puts out these documents like the mysterious hand of frank marshall davis
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:46.680]  that they accidentally left in the photo with and dunham who they photoshopped in uh so i think
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:53.000]  it's a pattern of document forgery to hide frank marshall davis by amateurs well joel let me raise
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.120]  this point i've talked to a lot of retired you know pretty famous intelligence operatives one of them's
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:04.520]  uh dr steve pacenic and he said you don't have to worry too much about him killing you though you've
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.440]  exposed this bin laden hoax and so he said they might come after you for that because he said he
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:14.680]  got a lot of you know current and former british mi6 massade and us intelligence called up basically
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:18.760]  you know get in his face about it when he came on and said that whole thing was fake he said eight
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.400]  years ago on the show and said they would do it later but the point is is he explained they like
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:29.320]  to get big committees in nato and the un to agree so everyone votes and then everybody has plausible
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.760]  deniability for murders and crimes that's why obama wants this authorization to kill us citizens
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:40.920]  from congress secretly he can then say well i have a law you know india and so there's a lot
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.480]  of paperwork involved you don't just go to one of these eight sure they'll create fake documents
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.840]  for agents to infiltrate countries but when it's the president the blackmail power of that
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.760]  and especially when you're not trusted in agencies of government because there's a lot of good people
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.960]  in there you've got to go to your wife you've got to i mean i know course he thinks he knows who's
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:06.440]  doing it do you guys have any idea because course he hasn't said so far i haven't been researching
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:12.520]  that i know that the sheriff's office in phoenix has a person of interest as to who's been forging
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:20.040]  these documents but it's been a pattern of forgery a pattern of intimidation that i see by obama
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:27.320]  intimidating the supreme court trying to engage in all kinds of anti-democratic behavior that's
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:38.600]  typical of the marxist worldview to impose a type of a Stalinist marxist agenda upon the middle class
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.360]  you mean a north korean heaven north korea east germany this is what i mean wait a minute i mean
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.760]  i'm gonna challenge you obama said if you have a business you didn't build it you didn't make your
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:54.680]  film uh joel and i'm not doing this radio show the government's doing this show right now of
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:59.080]  course we shouldn't joke they've got eas taking over radio more and more i mean thank god for

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:33.720]  joel gilbert is our guest joel the way mit romney's acting when obama calls him a criminal
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:42.120]  rom he doesn't respond with hey you ran fast and furious romney is just floundering around
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:48.120]  people say well he's the lesser of two evils more and more i think romney may be a ringer
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  if not consciously his handlers arm now rupert murdoch is endorsing gun control

[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.480]  world you're a liberal if you're not for communism you're a good conservative if you're
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.480]  returning your guns in well it's amazing how you talk about rupert murdoch uh i had my
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:17.800]  run in with newsmax.com uh so some of these news outlets that we think are conservative and we
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:26.120]  look to them to shed some light on things are kind of capitulating to the obama david axelrod agenda
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:33.560]  out of some kind of fear newsmax pulled my ad campaign i had paid for a banner ad campaign
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:39.400]  when my film first came out they pulled it right five minutes before it ran and i said why did you
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:46.520]  pull the ad they said well uh we're trying to move to the center so the amount of fear out there
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:54.040]  is just incredible and the capitulation to the agenda that obama and axelrod are setting
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:56:01.800]  is is just mind boggling i visited russia 25 years ago when i was a student i visited
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:07.160]  uh families of the refuseniks that were trying to leave russia for one week it was an amazing
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:13.240]  experience you would see how there was no food in the stores i would ask people how come there's no
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.960]  food how come there's nothing to buy in the stores and they would say well in communism
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:23.240]  you have to be at work eight hours a day but you don't have to actually work you just have to be at
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:30.440]  work so i saw the economic disaster the physical disaster the heavenly come on are you gonna are
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:36.600]  you a conspiracy theorist are you about to tell me that north korea isn't the heaven of earth this
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:43.400]  was no socialist utopia this was hell on earth was marxism and communism and i experienced it and
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.960]  everybody was afraid to talk i would ask questions they'd say well we have to go over here we can't
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:55.000]  talk in public i am just very disturbed that you gotta have a permit to talk in public come on
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.040]  well this is what's happening here the media is afraid to talk i i'm just shocked at the parallel
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:05.640]  to what i saw in communist russia in the 80s when i was there for a week well you're just a bad person
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.600]  you don't recognize freedom when you see it uh let's talk to jesse in new orleans you're on the

[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:27.640]  by the way coming up in the next segment it's up at info wars dot com
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:37.080]  shooter james homes didn't didn't build his supposed theater attack obama did and in this
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:42.920]  case it's actually true he built it with unemployment checks and welfare 20 000 dollars
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:48.280]  of body armor and all the rest of it of course the guy can't talk his mother says she didn't
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:53.880]  say what she said but let's just believe the official story of the former intelligence chief
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:58.360]  of mayor bloomberg who's sworn to get our guns there's the police chief out there who in his
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.840]  first press conference says don't question their official story well there you have it it's official
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:08.280]  uh joel gilbert let's continue with some more calls colin in texas you're on the air and thanks
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:15.160]  for holding hey alex no problem uh i just wanted a quick comment before i ask my question for mr
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:19.880]  gilbert uh you should you should put a picture of obama looking at that ronald mcdonnell killer
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:25.400]  saying you didn't do that government did that that would be funny but uh my question for joe
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:31.000]  gilbert over here uh i'm an info warrior down here in texas i always try to talk to everyone i
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.240]  know about real issues and real things and most of them are sheeple and uh you know they they
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:42.760]  don't want to listen to anything especially about the birther stuff so if i could get one fact that
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:49.960]  is shocking and maybe easily verifiable by googling it from you that all the info warriors out there
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:56.840]  could use that'd be great okay i'd like to tell you that there's one quick factoid that would help
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:03.000]  the cause but you have to remember that obama spent four five six years creating this false
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.840]  identity as the son of a kenyan goat herder and he would then bring people together because he was a
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:15.000]  big multicultural ideal so you've got to have them buy and watch the film because it puts it
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.360]  all together in a cohesive way where they can understand that obama's real father was this
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:27.080]  communist party usa propagandist and soviet agent frank marshall davis he's the man who also raised
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.840]  him his ideological father and everything falls into place sure once you see how it works thank
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.880]  you let's jump to the next caller joe in north carolina you're on the air with an evil person
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:44.520]  engaged in the first amendment could be man could be who knows hey uh alex quick question for you
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:50.520]  how many mass shootings has uh has occurred since oh eight since he actually took off
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:55.720]  with till now do you there's anybody know uh one of you or there's been um
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:03.880]  there's been less than 10 big ones but about six or seven big ones that memory serves and
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:08.840]  a lot of gangland stuff that's real but there's been some real prozac heads that you know go and
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:17.000]  shoot five six seven people um what do you ask that question is that kind of out of the ordinary
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.840]  for you know in a particular term for a guy who's who's who's knowingly against the second
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:29.080]  amendment what are you next going to say he shipped guns to mexico to blame the second amendment
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:33.880]  now that's a you're really a conspiracy theorist even though that's admitted it still doesn't exist
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:38.360]  yeah yeah true i was just wondering if we had the numbers on that and we need to look that up you
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:45.160]  have a quick question for joe gilbert joel you're doing a good job i haven't seen your movie but

[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:23.640]  now we had joe gilbert on earlier filmmaker and every time and i'm trying to basically
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:28.600]  inform him from my perspective every time we bring up the fact that rich ultra elites
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:35.480]  are actually funding communism and socialism not to empower people but to get control of them
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:41.720]  and that it's really a form of crony monopoly capitalism i mean carol quickly wrote books
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.360]  about it all the globalists have talked about it and when i bring it up people just don't get it
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:54.600]  and erin brought in this article about thomas g airs you know the father of bill airs and it says
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:09:02.520]  ceo chairman of commonwealth edison board of directors gd searle super evil company
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:09.800]  zenith corporation general night dynamics core first national bank of chicago it just goes on
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.320]  and on and it's the same with all these people and and and look at a had romney and bush and we're
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:22.440]  going to our guest coming out of the very same companies and you've got bank capital funding
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:31.400]  obama and you've got at the same time back in 2004 you've got the same people who are members of
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:37.800]  skull and bones this illuminati death cult on record you've got kerry and george w bush who are
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:44.600]  cousins and now if you look at romney and obama when it comes to actions and who owns them it's
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:55.800]  the same people it's obama 2012 or robom and it's just so frustrating to realize so much of the public
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:01.400]  is living in fantasy land now i really wanted to get him on because i heard him on the radio a
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:06.840]  few years ago or heard of youtube uh you know video of audio where he was on a radio show to be
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.960]  technical uh larry pinkney is a veteran of the black panther party the former minister of the
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:17.240]  interior of the republic of new africa a former political prisoner and the only america to have
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:23.480]  successfully self-authored his civil political rights case the united nations under the international
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:29.240]  covenant of civil and political rights um and it goes on in connection with his political
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:35.160]  organizing activities in the opposition to voter suppression pinkney was interviewed in 88 on the
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:41.160]  national television pbs news hour formerly known as the little mcneal larry news hour
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:45.880]  even all over tv radio you name it he is a editorial board member of black commentator
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:52.520]  dot com and you can find out more by reading his books saying no to power autobiography of 20th
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:11:01.240]  century activist and thinker william mandel but the point here is is that i wanted to get him on
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:07.000]  to talk about co and tell pro because this stuff still goes on but now the department of defense
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:12.840]  is involved they've got fake bloggers that they call them robots not just real people that robots
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:18.840]  that go out and attack people and they attack the left the right libertarians conservatives
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.560]  christians buddhists muslims they always beta tests on a group that's unpopular like muslims
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:28.040]  but really the whole thing if you look at it is while they've got all the good old boys with
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:32.680]  the john deer hats hating the muslims and ready to give up their rights actually you get the
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:38.040]  government documents it's all demonizing the good old boys this there's a global corporate takeover
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:45.960]  of this country they brag they've done it and uh it's very very dangerous and we need to understand
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:50.120]  the types of tactics because when i've heard mr picnic on the radio talk about some of the stuff
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:56.360]  he went through or the things he witnessed i've had similar things done to me some you know just
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:02.200]  the classic stuff lies put out my wife called you know women calling up saying they're pregnant you
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:07.160]  know uh or that i gave them a disease you know just standard stuff that came out of coantel pro
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.800]  and this was documented state of texas had a big coantel pro operation that got shut down in what
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:18.600]  1980 uh but it's also death threats people break it in your house uh people you know trying to
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:24.360]  intimidate you trying to get you fired a lot of this goes on and it's totally illegal kind of like
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:30.120]  the nsa spying on us is illegal and uh larry pinkney joins us larry thanks for coming on the show
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:37.480]  today alex it's a distinct pleasure and an honor to be with you today on the show thank you well
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:42.840]  you've heard my little rant there i mean tell us about yourself you're awakening in the process
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.640]  of what you witnessed well the bottom line is this i want to jump right in well i'll tell you a
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:52.440]  little bit about me as you well you've said it all really i'm a veteran of black Panther party
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:58.520]  former regional minister of interior for the republic of new Africa i write for i'm an editorial
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:04.760]  board member with black commentator black commentator dot com and associate editor with intrepid report
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:16.360]  dot com um but more important than any of that i continue to fight for the human rights of all
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:23.400]  the people and i begin right here at home in the united states of america of the so-called united
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:29.720]  states i'm beginning to wonder how united we actually are but anyway let me say that the
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:37.720]  experiences that that i have had personally as a political prisoner for 10 years having been set
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:44.120]  up and framed viciously and i'm not the only one there are thousands and by the way let me make a
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:53.320]  point my brother alex let me make a point this covers people of all colors i repeat this covers
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:14:03.960]  people of all colors we are all targets the intent of coin tell pro is to and i quote out directly
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:15.400]  from us congressional records i quote to frame to murder to set up to imprison political activists
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:22.280]  anyone who dissents the policies of the united states government now somehow that strikes me
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:30.280]  as going contrary to the united states constitution and to the declaration of independence somehow
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:39.480]  that strikes me as being blatantly contrary so i continue today in the year 2012 to struggle on
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:47.800]  behalf of all people black white brown red yellow all people because we are all targets and as you
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:58.200]  so correctly said alex coin tell pro goes on today an example is the mdaa the so-called national
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:05.800]  defense authorization act which obama signed very quickly and quietly on december 31st
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:15.000]  2011 new year's eve when nobody was paying attention which act makes it quote legal to actually
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:25.640]  detain indefinitely whomever the government and obama is currently the chief of the government
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:33.320]  he is commander in chief but it makes it it makes it very clear that u.s citizens in this country
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:41.800]  can be indefinitely detained without trial without judge without jury without the right
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:50.440]  to legal defense it is time for people to wake up all people and get out of la la land get out of it
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:56.920]  because we are in serious serious trouble alex we are for people that haven't gone through what
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:00.360]  you've gone through and i've only gone through a little bit compared to what you've gone through
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:06.200]  they don't understand they don't want anybody getting organized period that the power structure
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:12.200]  doesn't control and you know looking at how the black panther party started from my own layman
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:17.800]  research it was wasn't it trying to get communities organized soup kitchens getting people off drugs
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:23.320]  getting people that you know together and then they come in infiltrate it destroy it because i
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:29.400]  mean i found out very early on if i just tried to help do community things nothing got the system
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.920]  after me like that then if i tried to stop them bulldozing a veteran's home or something the system
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:41.560]  is so scared of the people ever standing up in decent and wholesome ways because they know other
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:47.640]  people are going to join it so their job was infiltrate it wreck it provocateur it and then
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:54.200]  change the perception of what how the people saw the black panther party is that correct you are
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:17:00.200]  right on as we would say in the party my brother you are right on you see the name of the game
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:09.160]  was then and continues now to be too discredit discredit discredit and the name of the game
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:18.360]  in terms of discrediting is to simply present people such as yourself okay who are seriously
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:25.320]  attempting to awaken people to raise their consciousness to get them to understand
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:35.720]  what dangers we are in you and people like you are considered very dangerous indeed you
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:42.440]  and myself and thousands of others in this country are considered dangerous not because
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:52.600]  we have broken any law not because we have done anything untoward anything wrong but then again
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:59.720]  i suppose it is wrong for people to become conscious for people to understand that in fact
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:06.440]  the name of the game is to control and you use that word earlier i was listening to you you
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:14.600]  use the word control and that's what it's about divide manipulate control keep people at each
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:21.080]  other's throats so that we don't understand that we have common interests and that's the name of the
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:31.640]  game whether it's presented by this this this this predator drone missile uh ndaa signing uh uh
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:38.360]  president who shredded the us constitution barack obama or whether it's by any other
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:44.680]  representative of a system that quite frankly and i hope i'm not out of line saying this but
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:50.600]  but any other representative of so-called representative of the people because we're not
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:57.960]  represented by them democrats or republicans who dares to tell the truth telling the truth
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:04.760]  these days is subversive my friend wow larry pinkney is our guest we're going to go to break

[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:51.960]  and a guy just jumps out of the bush and starts setting fires and then blaming it on us

[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:45.960]  saying sounds like what you would say to discredit a group of people but i understand getting angry
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  and stuff i mean i'm sure i've done things before that aren't perfect but when it's consistent you
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:55.880]  can really see really see what's going on larry you've got the floor of this little six-minute
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:01.320]  segment describe your experiences tell us what the black panther party was really founded for
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:07.960]  black panther party and thank you so much alex the the black panther party was founded on what was
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:14.840]  a 10 point program the 10 point program was essentially a very clear distinct and simple
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:23.080]  program that called for very specific things like clothing medical care jobs schooling i.e.
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:32.120]  education etc very simple very direct and by the way very threatening to the u.s. government isn't
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:38.760]  that amazing the black panther party i personally was involved in a number of programs as a member
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:45.960]  of the party including programs to serve the people with breakfast programs and people sometimes
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:52.040]  have heard about the black panther party's breakfast programs where we've fed throughout this nation
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:58.360]  especially children but anyone didn't have to be a child and by the way didn't have to be black
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:09.000]  either uh we've fed food good food to folks who are hungry you know what this was before the school
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.520]  lunch program oh way before the school lunch program yes definitely in fact a number of the
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:21.240]  school lunch programs actually came about as a result of what the party had we call it the party
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:27.560]  what the party had done i'd read that that's true that is very accurate also we had what was called
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  free free clinic free medical programs there's a book out that it's actually quite recent
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:42.360]  uh alex i'm i have it right here it the book is called body and soul body and soul the black
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:50.360]  panther party in the fight against medical discrimination now it's by alondra al on d r a
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:58.040]  nelson i would urge both of all colors and both genders read the book come to your own conclusion
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:07.400]  it's well documented with original sources okay now as as a panther as a member of the party uh one
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:14.760]  of my first jobs and i suppose that's because of how i speak was i was sent to communicate with
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:23.960]  people of all colors including my brother white both okay because i spoke i suppose in such a way
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:31.160]  that was considered to be very clear very simple and quote unquote non-threatening i spoken away
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:37.000]  and still speak in a way that is about the common interest of the people the common interest what
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:43.160]  do we have in common let's go for that let's struggle for that as a result of my activities
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:49.160]  uh and you can read about this your your listeners and viewers can read about it in a book and title
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:58.680]  saying no to power saying no to power by william m mendell william m mendell m a n d e l uh
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:05.480]  introduction by howard zinn and just go to the book and you can go you can read the details of
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:12.840]  some of the things that i did in the party but as a result of what i did i and many many many others
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:21.960]  were viciously set up and when i say viciously my brother i pull no punches i do mean viciously
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:33.480]  there are there is no death d e p th there is no depth as to how low this government will go and i
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:40.520]  say it in not only the past tense but the present tense okay and we need to be aware of that don't
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:47.960]  be paranoid but be aware be conscious okay as as as a reverend used as a man that i knew who happened
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:54.760]  to be a reverend used to say to me just because i'm paranoid doesn't mean it's not happening okay and

[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:16.840]  for for over a hundred years there are a lot of different systems and and and so it's not
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:23.560]  schizophrenic that i'm or or or or it's not contradictory that that we jump around because
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:29.960]  i'm trying to figure it all out now on the subject of coantel pro i live in one of the few states
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:36.040]  where the state got caught doing it in congressional stuff and it got suspended what 1979 1980
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:41.400]  and i've been on the receiving end of the state police intelligence bureau they've tried to set
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:46.040]  me up for anything criminal but i don't like being surveilled by them the feds it's different i mean
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:51.640]  i just tried to cover the army one time my cancer was there they were doing this takeover drill in
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:56.600]  brooksville florida and i mean the neighbors were coming out of their houses when your alex
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:01.880]  jones the army came by and said don't talk to you and i never run into something like this i was
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:06.120]  just covering you know these gun confiscation drills and they tried to set us up they broke
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:11.160]  in our hotel room they had a guy jump out and start setting fires and i'm just by the municipal
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:15.640]  airport standing there and a guy jumps out and starts lighting fires saying i'm doing it
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:20.120]  and i had to go physically jump on them and and mike's trying to put the fire out and everything
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:25.960]  and then the military pulls up on dune buggies and i mean it was just just insane ladies and gentlemen
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:31.080]  and if they do that i mean again i'm not bashing our military i found most people in the military
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.520]  actually more away than the public i'm not the average cop isn't a bad person but i'm telling
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:41.240]  you this system take the stuff just happened in california two days ago i haven't even shown that
[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:46.840]  footage on the radio or slash tv yet but we showed on the nightly news last night some of it but i
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:53.000]  mean it's so crazy you watch them shooting babies in strollers with rubber bullets at 10 feet away
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.560]  that can kill them and shooting women with babies in their arms because they're protesting a cop
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:03.720]  shooting an unarmed man again it look the system's gearing up for revolution because the system knows
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:09.320]  it's doing things that are going to cause it i don't want blood in the streets i've had enough
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.760]  violence in my life just growing up in dallas texas i don't mean to be ranning i want to go back to
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:18.520]  our guests it's that i really am concerned folks every time i look at my children i feel like
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:25.000]  crying now but it's not a physical crying it's a soreness in my heart it's a pain that i want
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.520]  everybody to live good i want everybody to get along i want every to quote rodney king
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:36.600]  literally can't we all just but there are special interests that don't want that and they want us
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:43.560]  just like bob marley said fussing and fighting they want us killing one another and that's what
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:48.520]  this is about and you know every groups are all programmed against each other so it's real when
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.920]  people don't like you because of what color or religion you are it's real of those gay folks
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:59.480]  that got beat up in dc i mean you know i mean that's wrong to do it's it's real when somebody comes
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:05.000]  after you and attacks you but then you cannot sit there and play into the plan of then hating
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.960]  everybody who looks different than you or comes from somewhere different because now you're playing
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:15.000]  into the divide and conquer trap now i'm ranting i don't want to divert you larry picney now that i
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.720]  went off in that three minute rant i want to give you the floor for this segment you've got the floor
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:26.120]  the next 14 minutes you're hosting uh describe to people what cointel pro is the congressional
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:31.560]  hearings and what you and others went through the setups so people know what we're facing
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:40.040]  all right cointel pro the counterintelligence program spelled c o i n t e l p r o an acronym
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:48.200]  cointel pro cointel pro was and i say so is very much so even though it's been codified in the
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:55.560]  patriot act and the ndaa was a program that was meant to neutralize and by the way the word
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:02.840]  neutralized comes directly not only out of my fbi file but out of the files many thousands of other
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:10.600]  files cointel profiles to neutralize thinking conscious everyday black white brown red and
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:19.960]  yellow people who wanted to bring about justice and fairness for everyone in the system cointel
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:27.320]  pro the counterintelligence program the government program fed the feds now certain uh
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:36.040]  uh components or segments if you will of the uh police in in various states throughout the union
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:44.920]  were also involved but the core the coordinator was federal and continues to be federal no matter
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:51.080]  what name they give it and it's a program where and some of the examples alex that you gave
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:57.480]  are so i mean they're just right it's sad it's sad when you look at it people say oh this is
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:05.240]  america that can't happen excuse me this is america and it is happening it has happened and if we
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:12.120]  don't do something about it folks it's going to continue to happen all they have to do is keep us
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:21.800]  divided keep us mute keep us ignorant keep us you know underdole as it were we have to take
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:28.440]  the grip in our own hands this is what we have to do and i don't give a damn about our color
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:36.680]  or our gender but i do give a damn about our humanity because we are human so getting all of us
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:43.240]  we are human and i i i guess alex like you i tend to get on a little rant every now and
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.600]  sorry about that no break down what happened to you this is important historical information
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:56.760]  but what happened to me was the the fbi had attempted to set me up in many many ways so they
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:02.280]  decided that they would and you can read this in the book that i've already mentioned saying no to
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:08.840]  power and we we obtained this information under the freedom of information act okay the fbi said
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:17.720]  well pinkney is dangerous because of his ability and i quote to unify black and white that's why
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:26.840]  it was dangerous so the fbi said and he must be quote neutralized in quotation marks neutralized
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:34.120]  they said we don't know what his habits are but we're going to utilize quote sex and drugs
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:39.720]  we don't know what his habits are it doesn't matter we're going to neutralize him can you imagine
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:50.040]  the horrible the the the pain the outrageous actions that this government indulges in to this
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:57.480]  very day engages in to stop people and that includes by the way alex people like you you
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:05.880]  know and i want to say this at this point alex you and people like you you and your show you all
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:13.480]  you and like the power hour with with joys riley like the jack blood show with jack blood you all
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:22.680]  and many others really the paul revered and the christmas addict of the 21st century and that's
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:29.640]  what we need we need more paul revered is more christmas addict to wake the sleeping flock up
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:37.320]  so that we can change this situation back to fore and tell pro the bottom line is that there is
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:46.120]  nothing and i repeat for nothing that this government will not do to quote neutralize you
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:52.280]  however we have something that this government will never have we have as we used to say in the
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:42:00.440]  party the power of the people and that's why this government engages in everything that it can to
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:08.440]  divide and conquer rule and conquer keep people in fear of each other keep people suspicious of
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:16.920]  each other you know and i'm not and i'm not saying alex i'm not saying that when i say collective
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:24.360]  struggle i'm not saying we're going to be in 100 agreement anybody who's in 100 agreement with me
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:32.680]  or anyone else is a damn liar we don't want liars it's okay to disagree but when we disagree his
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:38.600]  brother malcolm x used to say let's do it in the closet and come out as a united front the people
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:43.000]  black white brown red and yellow by the way i mean i mean i noticed that malcolm x got all this
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.320]  attention everything was okay with the system as long as he was you know blacks you know over
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:52.280]  here but as soon as he said everybody needs to get together that's when they killed him you got it
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:58.920]  alex you just hit it right on the head my brother that's the bottom line as soon as malcolm evolved
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:07.960]  the instant malcolm evolved and realized that this was a people's struggle of all colors and both
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:16.120]  genders malcolm became dangerous suddenly malcolm had to be neutralized neutralized
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:22.040]  neutralized you can be killed you can be imprisoned and killed but you are stopped
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:27.720]  and that you you hit it right on the head what more can i say to that alex what more can i say
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:33.720]  you said it okay let's go over what they did to you and others specifically how coantelpro works
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:41.320]  okay coantelpro works in a way it's very insidious your friends or who you think are your friends
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:46.440]  even whether they they might be relatives they might just be close personal friends
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:53.560]  they use people as agents and agents provocateurs to set you up let's say you make a statement let's
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:44:03.480]  say you disagree with uh barack obama as an example you disagree with his policy his n d a a policy
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:10.280]  you disagree with his skill list well the the actions of coantelpro would turn that around and
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:17.480]  turn it against you next thing you know you've got people saying he said that he wants to
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:24.840]  dispense with obama because of blah blah blah kill list or n d a that's what they always do
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:30.120]  when nightline is here or anybody they say you're wanting violence i'm like when did i talk about
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.680]  violence you you you're gonna cause it you're gonna cause it you're gonna and i'm like wait i'm
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.960]  against drones killing innocent people and secret arrests and checkpoints so i'm the one that's
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:46.040]  going to cause violence so who's violent who's violent i would submit to you my brother that
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:54.040]  violence is poverty i would not only physical poverty but poverty of the mind i would submit to you
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:45:02.600]  that violence is homelessness i would submit to you that violence is joblessness under employment
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:09.560]  foreclosure violence is on many levels it's violent to give 40 trillion to offshore banks
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:16.920]  that's right that's right that's violent so let's let's get our priorities in order let's talk about
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:25.320]  as dr king dr martin lucy king said who the real purveyors of violence are it's not we the people
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:33.080]  it's those who try to control and corral up we the people i agree but get into all the stuff
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:37.240]  they did with killing i mean they did all they got people to kill other people they set people up
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:42.680]  yeah tell folks what they did in the in the party specifically speaking as the as a veteran of the
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:48.280]  black panther party what they would do is they would get agents first of all they just find somebody
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.480]  black pay them a little money okay you can have all we're going to pay you this we're gonna put you
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:46:00.200]  up in a in a fine pad crib out whatever you want to call it all right all we want you to do for us
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:06.920]  is go in there join that black that their black panther party and and and this is your job your
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:14.680]  job is to cause as much dissension as you possibly can between the brothers and sisters in that party
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.800]  get them to kill each other and then when they start killing each other you come out you step
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:26.200]  forward as a witness but you of course you never indicate that your role was to be an agent provocateur
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:34.040]  to bring about this killing to bring about these horrible horrible atrocities this is just one
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:40.120]  example but they did it to the party throughout the united states in fact i was just reading a
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:47.400]  corintel pro document alex just a few days ago about what they did in minnesota as an example
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:53.240]  and this i'm talking primarily about california and new york but it happened all over the country
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:59.320]  and in minnesota i read this this fbi corintel pro document you know they did my brother was they
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:10.600]  they sent paid provocateurs to attack people okay this is late 60s early 70s to physically attack
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:17.640]  and injure and harm people but don't kill them just hurt them very badly and then walk away and say
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:25.560]  and you tell everybody i was a i'm a black panther okay now so that's the modern thing get the guys
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:29.800]  out front the place saying you can't vote then you can put it on the news it's a false flag
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:37.800]  set up have people do bad things in your name oldest trick in the book and and and the reason that
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:43.080]  it's the oldest trick in the book and you absolutely correct my brother the reason that the oldest
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:49.320]  trick in the book is because it has consistently worked and it has consistently worked because
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:57.080]  we've got too many sheeple not people too many sheeple out there who are sucked as potatoes
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:02.360]  whatever you call them sitting on the couch with the term alex uh uh couch potatoes yes
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:09.080]  couch potatoes who don't understand that that couch is about to be pulled out from under their
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.640]  posterior and that they are about to find themselves in a situation where they have no
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:23.560]  constitutional or human rights so so yes i go back to what you said because you all i can do
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:28.760]  and all i am doing alex is i'm trying to put a little meat on the bones but you've already
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:33.800]  got the bones you've been putting the bones out there for years my brother well do you see
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:40.680]  this starting to come to a head because uh i mean more and more everything we saw them use in the
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:46.920]  60s 70s and 80s is back and it's across the board uh demonizing anybody that doesn't like this
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:52.520]  globalist takeover it's worse now and why is it worse because what they do they went out and got
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:59.240]  this this this quote colored guy and people are talking hope and change right when it's really
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:07.080]  wouldn't hope and change it was mental dope and a rope for everybody you see and what they did was
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:13.320]  they said oh yeah they'll go for that yeah they'll go for that yeah sure here we'll get the blacks to
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:20.040]  go for him because black well oh we finally got it black friends you know the whites to go for him
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.560]  girl i'm a girl i'm not racist i'm a vote for this guy see i'm not racist okay instead of people
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:33.240]  instead of people all standing up and saying wait a damn minute here wait a minute who is this guy
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:42.520]  where is what is he about who is he really what are his policies we don't care about your your hope
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:48.760]  and change we're not interested in rhetoric we're interested in action and and as Wayne
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:55.560]  Madsen i think you had him on earlier yes i've used some of some of Wayne's work at black commentator
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:04.280]  dot com and intrepid report dot com where he talks about obama's cia background it's particularly
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:10.520]  that of his parents but that just his parents obama himself who worked for by the way b i c
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:15.000]  okay and the grandparents and then you've got all the weird exactly i was bringing it up with the
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.480]  guy earlier who just gets into the communist stuff more and more i think that's just the cover
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:26.520]  really this is deep cia yes we're talking deep cover here it's a cover all right but it is
[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:35.080]  deep cover and it is time for people to do like they said in that movie pay attention to the man
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:41.240]  behind the curtain pay attention to what is affecting all of us well it's great to talk to
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.400]  somebody so conscious and awake and again it's just normal for those of us that are awake but
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:51.080]  i look at the general public they're in trances yeah i want to talk about that when we get back
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:57.560]  because i talked to adults men who who are like children and they just have no idea what's going
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:03.960]  on uh we'll be right back okay this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider

[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:12.280]  then blame it on foreign enemies and even how to frame patsy's we're talking to larry pinkney
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:17.080]  of the original black panther party about coantel pro that came out congressional testimony
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:22.120]  and his work and others help you get it cut back for a few decades but it's back you know knowing
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:28.120]  what i know and about officials you know different official stories and how it works and the way they
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:35.240]  put things out i mean i can't put anything past the system running false flags and staged events
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:41.080]  and this whole shooting out in colorado i think stinks to high heaven come on alex
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:48.280]  look first of all let's look at the hypocrisy of it all right the horrible tragedy in aurora
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:56.920]  colorado but and it was a horrible tragedy okay but who who did this nation find itself
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:05.080]  turning to for condolences and comfort why none other than the kill list predator drone
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:12.840]  missile ndaa signing barack obama excuse me but something is rotten in denmark and think
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:20.360]  to high heaven and i mean come on all we have to do is just use our oh my god just use our common
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:26.040]  well that's the exact point i made is that is that they'll kill over 200 people at a wedding
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:31.400]  to get one person they claims a terrorist violating the geneva convention and international and in
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:35.960]  our own law and then sell that's just collateral damage we killed a whole bunch of kids and women
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:39.800]  and you know people yeah we blew their a bunch of them got their arms and legs blown off and are
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:45.800]  wounded for life big deal but then oh half masked and all this i mean it's so obvious what they're
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:54.040]  doing yes yes not only obvious my friend my brother but it is despicable it is time for the
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:00.040]  people of this nation of all colors to wake the hell up it is time for us to understand that we're
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:07.240]  being pimp the pain of the people of everyday ordinary people is being pimp to high heaven
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:13.160]  and only we the people can change that and we got to put aside our differences of course we're
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:19.480]  going to have differences we need to put them aside okay in favor of our common interest we'd
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:27.480]  deal with those differences but right now we better damn well deal with our survival well said
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:33.080]  we're going to have you back up soon as we're basically out of time here to talk about some of
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:37.240]  the other things that happen i mean get out of the congressional admissions of all the horrible
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:41.880]  things co-intel pro did but i remember interviewing ted gunterson and he apologized for it but he
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:47.240]  admitted they would just call up black panther party members wives and have women call up and
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:51.320]  and you know say that they were cheating on them and stuff just you know stuff like that
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:55.960]  but that's nothing compared to planting drugs on people i know that went on too
[02:57:55.960 --> 02:58:01.960]  yeah all the time and and alex you know the fact of the matter is it's very painful for me
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:09.400]  i i i try to get this information across i don't want people to be in fear i want people to get mad
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:15.880]  as malcolm said you know sad people don't do nothing angry people they do something no i agree
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:19.640]  with you people always think i'm putting this out to scare them no i want people to hear the truth
