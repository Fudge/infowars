[00:30.000 --> 00:37.280]  It's Monday, July 22, 2019.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.280]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.840]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, and I've cleared the decks of guests
[00:43.840 --> 00:53.840]  because I want to focus in on the geopolitical movements and different systems that are attempting,
[00:53.840 --> 01:02.200]  as we speak, to cause a worldwide financial collapse to derail the explosion of nationalism
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.840]  and populism and rediscovery of common sense and Christianity that is taking place.
[01:08.840 --> 01:11.800]  The empire is striking back.
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.840]  They're also trying to start myriad wars in South America, in the Middle East, in Asia.
[01:18.840 --> 01:25.840]  You can't go to any newspaper or turn on any television station without hearing of imminent
[01:25.840 --> 01:29.680]  economic collapse, and it's all Trump's fault.
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.080]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the people trying to crash the economy, trying to kill
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.880]  confidence that are doing it.
[01:35.880 --> 01:45.160]  We're in an economic war with China and with the European Union, and they'd almost broken
[01:45.160 --> 01:48.400]  the country, and we're coming back from the dead, and it is so treasonous.
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.360]  The very same people that have advertised the illegal aliens should come here and have
[01:53.360 --> 02:01.400]  catch and release and give them everything free, those very groups now are trying to
[02:01.400 --> 02:04.640]  crash our economy.
[02:04.640 --> 02:12.280]  It is completely and totally outrageous, and now we've got videos up on infowars.com and
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.760]  newswars.com where they're even saying if you want any border at all or call anybody
[02:17.760 --> 02:24.720]  legal alien, you're a Nazi, and that the word Trump is Nazi, and that the word America
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.720]  is Nazi.
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.320]  If you ever needed to know who the enemies of this country are, your enemies tell you
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.160]  your flag's bad, the name of your country's bad, white people are bad, and here's the
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.720]  crazy thing.
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.120]  Most the quote minorities who are the majority of most areas of this country, they're not
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.320]  buying into it, and that's what the Democrats and the Globals are panicking because all
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.400]  the statistics and numbers show something like 81% of Mexicans in Mexico want to control
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.360]  their border and ours.
[02:54.360 --> 02:59.720]  They don't want to be killed or overrun, it's the same thing here.
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.480]  So this is a crazy time to be alive, look at these headlines, warren warns of coming
[03:05.480 --> 03:16.960]  crash, yahoo finance front page, can Donald Trump delay an economic crash, salon, medium,
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.840]  the coming economic crash, and how to stop it, could a second straight quarter of failing
[03:22.840 --> 03:28.440]  earning signal a possible recession, USA today?
[03:28.440 --> 03:33.760]  And they're just doing everything they can to plunge the economy right now.
[03:33.760 --> 03:41.760]  We're going to be looking at that today, and the imminent war with Iran.
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.120]  Iran is panicking, they're grabbing ships, helicopter raids on British ships, the Strait
[03:48.120 --> 03:53.520]  of Hormosa's agreed to be opened, they've gone to war over its closing before, you've
[03:53.520 --> 04:01.920]  got China massing oil, all their major ports are just full of oil tankers for extra oil,
[04:01.920 --> 04:05.920]  meaning they're thinking about going into a major war, they've massively increased
[04:05.920 --> 04:13.040]  their stockpiles, and there's a big story up on DrudgeReport.com by the great folks
[04:13.040 --> 04:19.040]  at the Economic Collapse blog, Michael Schneider, the US is staging troops at a key, shoddy
[04:19.040 --> 04:25.360]  military base that it used during all of our previous Middle Eastern wars.
[04:25.360 --> 04:32.640]  We've also posted the story at infowars.com and newswars.com, it's very important to get
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.000]  those pieces of information out, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  So the world is in a very, very serious situation right now, China and the globalists are the
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.480]  ones quarterbacking it, and here's the Washington Times, Alex Jones is right, China is the threat
[04:48.480 --> 04:54.240]  and it may be too late, it's not too late if we recognize the enemy within, stay with
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.320]  us, we'll be back on the other side of this Monday Transmission.
[06:24.240 --> 06:39.320]  You know why I support Trump so much, because I know the situation Trump's in, I know who
[06:39.320 --> 06:45.520]  Trump's enemies are, because they're my enemies, and they're pissed, because President Trump
[06:45.520 --> 06:51.520]  is actually trying to be the president, he's actually trying to have pragmatic policies
[06:51.520 --> 06:57.520]  that promote peace and stability worldwide, but don't parlay American power into a world
[06:57.520 --> 07:05.440]  government at our expense, but return our legitimate sovereignty to our country and
[07:05.440 --> 07:10.880]  to our people, and that's a very important thing, because government's dangerous and
[07:10.880 --> 07:16.240]  government can be a dangerous servant and fearful master to quote our first president,
[07:16.240 --> 07:22.560]  General George Washington, but when we don't have a government that's governing or regulating
[07:22.560 --> 07:29.560]  and it leaves a power vacuum, the chai comms, the multinational corporations, the EU and
[07:29.560 --> 07:35.920]  giant armies of tens of millions of lawyers come in and are eating us out of house and
[07:35.920 --> 07:43.680]  out of home, and Trump is trying to stabilize things and fix it, and the establishment has
[07:43.680 --> 07:51.440]  gone into massive conniption fits, the likes of which the world has never seen, and it's
[07:51.440 --> 07:58.440]  so frustrating to me to see the multinational corporations that set up one-sided trade deals
[07:58.440 --> 08:08.480]  with China over the last 50 years to totally deindustrialize us, demonize us, position
[08:08.480 --> 08:14.000]  us with our ports and the Panama Canal and six of the seven big Hollywood studios owned
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.640]  by the chai comms, directing the destruction of our borders and the destruction of our
[08:19.640 --> 08:33.640]  culture, promoting classical race war, vulcanization, to demoralize and handicap our nation.
[08:33.640 --> 08:43.860]  It's just amazing, it is this multinational axis of evil that is organizing the takedown
[08:43.860 --> 08:51.200]  of our families, of our borders, of our military, of our culture, it's China, it's where 90%
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.160]  of the tainted filth drugs come in, and these companies don't even care, most of them have
[08:56.160 --> 09:04.080]  even liability protection from Congress, most of the vaccines are made in China, most of
[09:04.080 --> 09:14.240]  the drugs that you get have plastic and garbage in them, because China is dumping the fentanyl
[09:14.240 --> 09:21.160]  and everything else, both legal and illegal on us, because China knows that western powers
[09:21.160 --> 09:29.840]  and the opium wars for over 100 years, going back over 200 years ago and running through
[09:29.840 --> 09:40.880]  into the 19th century, get exactly to them what they're now doing to us.
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.680]  And so when you see Elizabeth Warren saying the economy is going to implode and it's all
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.560]  Trump's fault, when you see the Democrats saying we have no right to any border, when
[09:49.560 --> 09:57.640]  you see them saying America is a bad word, don't use it, they are the enemies of this
[09:57.640 --> 10:09.680]  country, they work for the multinational consortium that is looting us and that is attacking us.
[10:09.680 --> 10:13.160]  Course Elizabeth Warren knows about mortgages and knows about derivatives because she helped
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.080]  do it, she's a corporate raider.
[10:17.080 --> 10:21.920]  Now she sits up there and points her finger at Trump and says his policies are going to
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.400]  cause an economic crash, while the private Federal Reserve did eight interest rate hikes
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.080]  when they did none under Obama to kill the recovery, Trump threatened to remove the entire
[10:32.080 --> 10:35.960]  board which the president can do under the Federal Reserve Act, he's the only person
[10:35.960 --> 10:37.280]  that can do it.
[10:37.280 --> 10:44.200]  Congress signed over authority in 1913, he played the ace of total spades, the galactic
[10:44.200 --> 10:56.080]  royal flush, the grand slam, he's now replaced three of the board of governors in the last
[10:56.080 --> 11:02.000]  month making good on his threat because behind the scenes the Federal Reserve Board of New
[11:02.000 --> 11:12.240]  York is still trying to sabacage but Trump is fighting back, this is bold, it's amazing,
[11:12.240 --> 11:17.120]  it's over the top cool and he's putting people in from the regional Federal Reserve banks
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.040]  that are critical of the Federal Reserve's very existence.
[11:22.040 --> 11:30.000]  This is a real revolution but here's the headlines, Warren Warren's of economic collapse, front
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.200]  page of Yahoo and they go into how they predicted it and how it all came, yeah because they
[11:38.200 --> 11:45.880]  were engineering it and now she's warning again, oh she's such a good girl, like some
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.280]  arsonists before they burn your house down warning you, all the headlines of the coming
[11:50.280 --> 11:57.000]  economic crash, it's everywhere because you know what Bill Maher famously said last year,
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.960]  he said we need to crash this economy, we need a big fat juicy, let's queue that up,
[12:04.960 --> 12:11.040]  we need a big fat juicy recession to teach these Trump supporters not to support Trump
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.680]  and to let them know they'll be punished, when it's Trump that brought in the policies
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.640]  that have caused the economic boom and people are like yeah but we're in debt and yeah we
[12:20.640 --> 12:26.120]  have all these problems, yeah the globalists positioned us into this and they want to have
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.160]  stagflation like we had under Jimmy Carter where the economy's stagnated but prices are
[12:30.160 --> 12:37.240]  going up and Trump says no, we're going to direct some of that fiat money towards industry
[12:37.240 --> 12:41.680]  and military and morale because the globalists have already inflated the world currencies
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.760]  worse than Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe ever thought about and so it's erased by different
[12:46.760 --> 12:51.560]  currencies to see which one can save most solvent because all the others are going
[12:51.560 --> 12:59.200]  to go down and then out of whoever survives it will form the basis of a new global blockchain
[12:59.200 --> 13:06.080]  Bitcoin style system, so we're coming to the end of the age, there's no fixing the dollar
[13:06.080 --> 13:10.760]  at this point, there's no going back, we're abandoning fiscal conservatism because we
[13:10.760 --> 13:20.440]  failed, it's over, all that matters now is the United States get as much industry and
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.880]  weaponry and secret technologies that have been suppressed by the globalists for decades
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.960]  to innovate out of this so that we're in a position to reorganize the United States and
[13:32.960 --> 13:40.920]  stop the globalists from continuing to create global destabilization which is their admitted
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.800]  robber baron policies.
[13:45.800 --> 13:52.160]  China and the globalists have positioned us for collapse and military ruination and Trump's
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.600]  not going to let it happen and neither am I and neither are you.
[13:59.600 --> 14:05.720]  So I will tell you this is going to be rough going into the future and folks better get
[14:05.720 --> 14:13.120]  right with God and people better get backed up for emergencies and you better get to know
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.600]  your friends, your family and who you can work with because Trump's trying to provide
[14:18.600 --> 14:25.640]  a soft landing for us but when I sit there and I watch how many enemies of this country
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.520]  are here and how many people really hate their own nation, when the chai comms would
[14:30.520 --> 14:34.520]  put them in a forced labor camp in one second, when the EU could care less about them and
[14:34.520 --> 14:41.240]  is run by the grandson of the top Nazi under Hitler and how they like a baby duck imprinting
[14:41.240 --> 14:46.760]  on a wolf, they've all imprinted on this America-hating culture that Hollywood and
[14:46.760 --> 14:56.240]  the media and the universities taught them and how wrecked we are and how screwed up
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.720]  we are and then along comes the populist nationalist Christian movement that's been fighting for
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.480]  decades to stop this and as the world government comes into place people now listen to us so
[15:06.480 --> 15:14.720]  we had a fighting chance to try to turn this around but so many Americans don't have common
[15:14.720 --> 15:17.840]  sense and don't have a spirit of survival.
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.360]  They don't have God in their heart so they are given over to great delusion.
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.080]  Everything Democrats say makes no sense, is a lie, is a verifiable fraud.
[15:28.080 --> 15:36.560]  Bernie Sanders who has 3 $1 million houses, $112,000, $16,000, $118,000 car says you
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.080]  shouldn't be able to have money, that money is evil but he won't pay his campaign people
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.880]  $15 an hour to hear about that so now he just laid a bunch of them off and gave them $15
[15:47.880 --> 15:53.880]  an hour removing everybody's points see how it works they never deliver on their promises
[15:53.880 --> 15:59.480]  they're lying criminals.
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.280]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. what
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.000]  if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[17:25.800 --> 17:30.360]  had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the

[18:07.000 --> 18:11.120]  of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.520]  agrees with these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.560]  to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.120]  eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.640]  the end of his presidency it's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.000]  him it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.120]  to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived

[18:44.440 --> 18:48.960]  a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.000]  continue we're going to keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen

[21:44.040 --> 21:52.120]  one mind in the united states you try to set up one mind us owned you are swat teamed in days

[22:16.520 --> 22:24.200]  and they extract get ready for it 99 percent of the rare earth minerals out of afghanistan
[22:24.200 --> 22:30.200]  globally it's like 97.6 i checked it last week from the organization of economic cooperative

[22:41.320 --> 22:48.600]  cell phones and tv's and electronics that are in everything and they've strategically been given
[22:48.600 --> 22:59.240]  control the united states does not have one led smelting facility the united states does not
[22:59.240 --> 23:11.080]  have any of the infrastructure you'd need to fight a war we have weapons whose components are made
[23:11.080 --> 23:23.560]  overseas it's unbelievable and i sit here and i watch our enemies flipped paid traders and all
[23:23.560 --> 23:29.160]  they teach at the council on farm relations at harvard and yale is that america is a rat hole america
[23:29.160 --> 23:36.120]  is filth america's done everything's the chinese century and that china is invincible
[23:37.880 --> 23:42.680]  in our own corporate news sits there and tells us
[23:45.640 --> 23:51.320]  that you can't say america or american and that american flags are offensive and the front page
[23:51.320 --> 23:57.480]  of yahoo last week that means the mouth of the new world order a few weeks before it was that i had
[23:57.480 --> 24:04.040]  child porn none of that was true but last week it was that chris pratt the big upcoming superstar
[24:04.040 --> 24:11.800]  hollywood guy dared wear an american flag and said don't tread on america they called him a white
[24:11.800 --> 24:22.040]  supremacist in the headline but they had to change it a little bit later because of the backlash
[24:22.040 --> 24:32.280]  no one is buying it then chris haze comes out i played this yesterday and said it's time to
[24:32.280 --> 24:44.120]  absolutely destroy and absolutely crush republicans think about that i'm gonna play that clip again
[24:44.120 --> 24:53.160]  coming up next segment it's so important but remember how all this works
[24:53.160 --> 25:01.720]  works because bernie sanders thinks you're an idiot all of them do bernie sanders and
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.160]  elizabeth's warrant are all trying to crash the u.s economy they're all talking it down
[25:05.160 --> 25:11.320]  every time i see them on tv this economy is not good it is going down and they kill the confidence
[25:11.320 --> 25:21.160]  it's over and they can get their civil war going but what did bernie just do over the weekend it's
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.920]  up on info wars dot com it's up on news wars dot com and you've got to go look at the tweets people
[25:26.920 --> 25:33.560]  sent to him they're hilarious bernie sanders mocked for admitting he will have to cut staff
[25:33.560 --> 25:42.680]  hours to pay them 15 dollar minimum wage that's right they have had their hours cut from 60 to
[25:42.680 --> 25:51.960]  less than 44 42 or 43 because they don't have the money to pay everybody because they've got to pay
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.040]  all the different matching withholding and all the other stuff on full-time employees so it means
[25:58.040 --> 26:04.040]  you know people paying 13 are really getting paid about 20 when you're getting paid 15 you're getting
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.960]  paid more like 22 23 people don't understand that plus all the infrastructure so they don't have the
[26:09.960 --> 26:17.720]  money so they have to cut people but we have plenty of money i agree with aoc she was asked
[26:17.720 --> 26:26.680]  where do we get the money for free health care free homes free cars free education free everything
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.320]  if you do not want to work that's fine as well whoever believes any of this
[26:31.320 --> 26:40.760]  but that's the way the cookie crumbles so is this irony is this hypocrisy
[26:42.200 --> 26:49.080]  i'd say it's all of those but will that fall on the ears of his constituents 51% of millennials
[26:49.080 --> 26:53.560]  are identified as communists or socialists no they don't care they're just like the venezuelans
[26:53.560 --> 26:57.880]  or anybody else they just hear i'm getting some free stuff now they get free stuff for five years
[26:57.880 --> 27:01.480]  and the whole economy goes bankrupt and there's no electricity and starving in the streets
[27:01.480 --> 27:07.800]  they'll never think back and go oh socialisms what caused this they'll immigrate to another
[27:07.800 --> 27:14.360]  country and suck it dry as well because it's the creed of dumbasses that they have no memories
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.040]  so i'm going to give the number out on the other side we'll start taking your phone calls

[32:04.680 --> 32:08.680]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[32:08.680 --> 32:13.000]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.360]  members of the public in the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[32:20.360 --> 32:24.680]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[32:24.680 --> 32:28.520]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[32:28.520 --> 32:32.840]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to

[32:42.760 --> 32:47.080]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[32:47.080 --> 32:51.480]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[32:51.480 --> 32:54.760]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the
[32:54.760 --> 32:59.160]  ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[32:59.160 --> 33:15.080]  just saw you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:15.080 --> 33:31.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[33:37.720 --> 33:50.920]  so i am physically angry with the democrats and the globalists trying to crash the economy
[33:52.440 --> 33:57.880]  i am physically angry about the world government anti-family system sexualizing children
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.160]  i'm physically angry at big pharma knowing that they are pumping thousands of different
[34:03.160 --> 34:09.080]  deadly poisons into the public by design to demoralize us and take control of this country
[34:09.080 --> 34:15.080]  this is the satanic assault that you're witnessing and it is elizabeth warren and the rest of these
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.640]  criminals that are trying to crash this economy they're doing it at the behest of the chikoms
[34:20.200 --> 34:26.040]  where they are fully invested the good news is more and more this information is coming
[34:26.040 --> 34:35.880]  out into the news and people are understanding what is really happening and that is an extremely
[34:35.880 --> 34:43.000]  good thing my friends this is 21st century war that we're facing right now
[34:44.600 --> 34:49.880]  now i have tons of news to get to and a lot of breaking things they're developing and
[34:49.880 --> 34:57.000]  and what's happening in hong kong and taiwan as china moves to take those places over
[34:58.040 --> 35:04.360]  they sent in gangs of men from the chinese mainland they built a big bridge onto hong kong
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.040]  and physically assaulted the demonstrators that don't want to be part of the chikom rule
[35:12.040 --> 35:19.560]  and have their organs harvested it's a very very big escalation as well we're going to be breaking
[35:19.560 --> 35:26.040]  down thousands in brooklyn still in dark as new york deals with another power outage all these signs
[35:26.040 --> 35:33.640]  of the breakdown of civilization and we've also got reports here where i'm not just
[35:33.640 --> 35:41.080]  defending trump i'm defending reality trump has not built a single mile of new border fence
[35:41.080 --> 35:53.800]  trump has not built a single mile of new border fence after 30 months in office
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.400]  well that's because he got less than 10 of the funding that he asked for and then he went with
[36:01.400 --> 36:11.000]  the direction of the border patrol ice and dhs and so the most trafficked most dangerous areas
[36:11.000 --> 36:20.040]  by high population centers like el paso and san diego and all the rest of it is where they chose
[36:20.040 --> 36:26.200]  to put the new limited fencing in but a lot of people like in culture
[36:28.520 --> 36:37.880]  and others sit there and say oh trump isn't doing any of what he said he would do on that front
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.040]  and that's a cheap trick and i'm not even bashing handculture because i understand she wants a lot
[36:42.040 --> 36:51.560]  of fire under trumps but it's congress and the democrats that had the open border policy it's
[36:51.560 --> 36:56.360]  obama that created the catch and release policy instead of he got a kid with you it's a get out
[36:56.360 --> 37:08.920]  of jail free card and so now we've had this massive bum rush take place assaulting the united states
[37:09.480 --> 37:13.720]  that's the reality of what's going on it's the democrats people like diane feinstein
[37:14.280 --> 37:16.680]  that have engineered all of this
[37:16.680 --> 37:26.840]  but again the public has a short attention span and it's just easier to believe oh
[37:26.840 --> 37:32.200]  we have nazis at the southern border we're killing children why look the democrats are dumping buckets
[37:32.200 --> 37:38.520]  of blood out front ice centers buckets of fake blood because most of these democrats are theater
[37:38.520 --> 37:44.760]  majors who all wanted movie careers and so they all go out like jesse smollett who actually is an actor
[37:44.760 --> 37:53.480]  and then right down the line stage events grassroots democrats will come over to a
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.040]  prominent conservative in a restaurant start a fight with them and then wait with cameras going
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.680]  till you respond and then they'll say you attack them it's happened to me repeatedly
[38:04.360 --> 38:10.360]  it's what they do they lie you know who has the blood on their hands
[38:10.360 --> 38:19.000]  it's the democrats who created this it's the democrats that built the emergency centers
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  through the un to stage the masses of people and now flood the united states and europe
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.760]  and then when four thousand six hundred americans die a year that we know of from illegal aliens
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.200]  who are five times more likely to commit violent crimes we never humanize or talk about who died
[38:36.200 --> 38:43.480]  it's all just trumps killing children in the ice centers trumps taking children away from
[38:43.480 --> 38:49.880]  their parents on and on and on and on and the democratic party has filed hundreds of lawsuits
[38:49.880 --> 38:55.960]  three million dollars apiece against ice and against taxpayers saying oh some of the children
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.920]  were separated in very rare cases when they don't have ideas and the children look like they're
[39:00.920 --> 39:06.760]  scared it turns out they've been separated from families because they came across an international
[39:06.760 --> 39:13.240]  border in the night they crawled under barbed wire and through sewage and armed men brought them in
[39:13.800 --> 39:21.960]  and no one knows who they are but oh my goodness it's all our responsibility toll free number to
[39:21.960 --> 39:27.080]  join us eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine first time callers specifically on
[39:27.080 --> 39:32.600]  what do you think of the traders and the alliance between china the eu the multinational corporations
[39:32.600 --> 39:38.760]  big tech to openly try to break our economy and break our border and cause a physical civil war
[39:41.480 --> 39:51.240]  here's chris haze just last week saying we need to lovingly go out and utterly destroy and crush
[39:51.240 --> 39:57.240]  conservatives and everything he says is a projection about the policies that the democrats are really
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.360]  involved in and what they're doing trump is devolving power back to the states back to the people
[40:03.720 --> 40:09.880]  the democrats are the ones trying to set up all these capos and ms-13 and hezbollah and all these
[40:09.880 --> 40:18.600]  corrupt groups here's chris haze talking about himself into the trump presidency it is a classic
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.720]  model of corrupt governance the capo on the top and the many mini bosses below who are given control
[40:23.720 --> 40:30.360]  of their domain to do as they wish because trump doesn't care at all about epa policy or labor or
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.840]  oran really or anything really other than making money which the presidency allows him to do with
[40:34.840 --> 40:41.640]  public dollars and being the center of attention which same but the base what does the base get
[40:41.640 --> 40:48.440]  the folks in that arena well it's obvious isn't it they get to chant they get to revel in their own
[40:48.440 --> 40:53.640]  americanness and primacy of the expense of others they may not get much more than that
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.600]  but trump and now the entire republican party and most of the conservative movement realize
[40:58.600 --> 41:04.600]  that that is enough for them they realize that no one actually cared about deficits or small
[41:04.600 --> 41:09.720]  government that was never the fuel that fired the engine of republican politics it was always
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.600]  roiling rage against them that was on full display in the center back chance last night
[41:14.600 --> 41:21.240]  without that rage and that passion that enthusiasm and fire in that room this entire project falls
[41:21.240 --> 41:28.360]  apart that sentiment at the core of the coalition cannot be pride loose and it cannot be negotiated
[41:28.360 --> 41:36.520]  with and it cannot be appeased it must be peacefully non-violently politically destroyed with love
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.480]  compassion and determination but utterly confronted and destroyed that is the only way
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.760]  to break the coalition apart not by prying off this or that interest they are in too deep
[41:46.760 --> 41:51.960]  they have shamed themselves too much the heart of the thing must be ripped out the darkness must
[41:51.960 --> 41:56.760]  be banished the people who feel moral revulsion at that display we saw last night must collectively
[41:56.760 --> 42:03.000]  mobilize in greater numbers than the chanters we got a taste of what that looks like when

[42:23.560 --> 42:28.440]  exist and that you know these outside forces want to conquer you and the fact that you want to rally

[43:05.080 --> 43:09.080]  our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.000]  and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.760]  best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and
[43:16.760 --> 43:20.840]  instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the
[43:20.840 --> 43:23.560]  biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[43:23.560 --> 43:28.280]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[43:28.280 --> 43:34.360]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[43:34.360 --> 43:38.520]  that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.080]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[43:43.080 --> 43:46.920]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.000]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing

[47:35.640 --> 47:41.880]  highest bidder that's created cloned humans mainstream news is no big deal tev Elon musk

[47:52.440 --> 47:57.160]  taught all over the country to school children that drag queen story time supported by the
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.200]  american library association where three-year-olds climb up on top men in clown outfits and ride their
[48:02.200 --> 48:09.000]  genitals totally normal and then we have open borders and millions pouring in for free stuff
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.600]  and when we process to find out are these people even with their kids one third aren't we're the bad
[48:14.600 --> 48:23.640]  guys and then snake like senators sit up there and say alex jones is a monster he must be destroyed
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.800]  like i'm frankenstein and i guess i am frankenstein you know what because i'm legitimately upset and
[48:29.800 --> 48:37.480]  legitimately angry that it's official now what bill marr let's see we can cue that up thanks what bill
[48:37.480 --> 48:46.760]  marr said a year ago we need to crash the economy to stop trump that means crashing your job your
[48:46.760 --> 48:53.000]  savings your life that should piss you off but see it's okay because it's for a good cause
[48:54.040 --> 48:59.080]  by a man that's made over 100 million dollars just on this show
[48:59.080 --> 49:08.760]  on the on the show he said with hbo 100 million dollars oh but he's going to tell you making 30
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.600]  40 50 60 a hundred thousand dollars a year who's got bills and things to pay off and medical care
[49:14.600 --> 49:22.360]  and kids that are sick he's going to tell you that he's going to teach you to hate trump and now you
[49:22.360 --> 49:27.240]  got elizabeth warren and the private fellow reserve and all of it in a race to crash the economy
[49:27.240 --> 49:35.000]  before trump gets his new fed heads in we are in a civil war against foreign enemies
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.960]  and i can't believe that 99 percent of americans aren't on the side of their own country when it
[49:39.960 --> 49:46.280]  means prosperity but they've been taught by the colleges and the system to hate their own nation
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.520]  and that's why i'm angry is that i'm not complaining i've got a fight seven days a week
[49:52.520 --> 50:01.720]  against this and i've turned into a maniac i've turned into a very aggressive person
[50:03.800 --> 50:09.480]  because i live in war and i live in information i don't live in fantasy land
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.920]  and it makes me sick to sit there and watch everybody else
[50:16.920 --> 50:24.680]  when i say everybody i mean a large portion of people live in delusions and be soft and be
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.760]  stupid and not have attention spans man most people i know i talk to them and in 30 seconds
[50:30.760 --> 50:36.520]  a minute they don't remember it on the street or wherever and that's what gruber said remember
[50:36.520 --> 50:41.720]  he goes we wrote obama care to triple prizes and screw people and he sat there at a university
[50:41.720 --> 50:48.120]  with other phd's wanting to learn how to be criminal like him and the average person has a lower
[50:48.120 --> 50:55.560]  attention span than a goldfish you know what it's like having a memory and other in watching other
[50:55.560 --> 51:01.160]  people lose theirs in front of you the general public has a walking form of Alzheimer's now
[51:01.160 --> 51:06.840]  people are getting what is akin to Alzheimer's at age 20 now from the screens from the tv's
[51:06.840 --> 51:15.080]  from all that we're dying i don't like it who the hell would sign on to something like this
[51:17.560 --> 51:23.560]  it's scary and it's wrong and it's anti-human your calls are coming up we start the next
[51:23.560 --> 51:30.120]  hour danie erin john jonathan alex richard everybody else i'm gonna talk about funding
[51:30.120 --> 51:33.720]  our operation here let me just give you an example but maybe this is part of it
[51:33.720 --> 51:41.080]  but let me just give people an example of this right here for you let me show you something right
[51:41.080 --> 51:49.880]  here this is really important document cam shot please right here let me show you something
[51:51.160 --> 51:56.280]  because this is important now everything i'm saying right here you can look up you
[51:56.280 --> 52:02.440]  can confirm this for yourself right here the secret history of iodine how iodine increased
[52:02.440 --> 52:06.520]  iq by 15 points when the government added a tiny amount of the cruddy type
[52:09.240 --> 52:12.200]  the true history of iodine is something that most mainstream media
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.920]  won't tell you and experts won't talk about in the early 1920s it was found that just adding iodine
[52:18.920 --> 52:26.760]  to the salt supply produced a staggering 15 point iq increase in deficient populations again that's
[52:26.760 --> 52:33.160]  15 point increase of iq it's shocking but not too surprising when you know how iodine affects the
[52:33.160 --> 52:38.840]  brain iodine plays such an essential role in brain development that the leading cause of
[52:38.840 --> 52:44.520]  preventable mental retardation in the world is iodine deficiency some estimates show that nearly
[52:44.520 --> 52:51.000]  one third of the world has diet lacking iodine yeah worldwide iq is plunging it's even an issue
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.600]  in the first world the extensive research on iodine and iq is extremely clear
[52:57.960 --> 53:01.400]  what we show aren't being told about it m4s has been revealing the iodine conspiracy for years
[53:01.400 --> 53:05.080]  that's why we continue to bring you the highest quality survival shield x2 nascent iodine
[53:05.080 --> 53:11.720]  at m4slife.com for the lowest prices you're going to find this is the only pure clean iodine we have
[53:11.720 --> 53:26.360]  the x2 that's pure deep breath crystal true atomic iodine and then we of course also have
[53:27.240 --> 53:35.560]  survival shield x3 which is the deep breath crystal iodine but then two other very pure
[53:35.560 --> 53:41.160]  clean types that are still also bound to something a little bit because some people
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.760]  very small percentage cannot absorb the pure iodine it's the tri iodine learn all about it
[53:46.760 --> 53:52.680]  infowarstore.com look at the 6000 plus 98 percent reviews and the reason i want to talk about this
[53:52.680 --> 53:58.600]  is very simple i've already lost six seven pounds in the last two weeks because i've gotten where
[53:58.600 --> 54:04.200]  i wasn't working out as much and i'd forgotten to take my x2 my x3 i'd forgotten to take my dna
[54:04.200 --> 54:09.960]  force plus and i'm like i know how great all this is why have i forgotten and it's always because
[54:09.960 --> 54:15.640]  somebody comes to the house the lazy susan gets taken off of the table somebody puts all my
[54:15.640 --> 54:20.440]  supplements away and then we forget to take them and then suddenly three months goes by
[54:20.440 --> 54:25.800]  and i'm like why the hell do i feel like i have such low energy when i take the x2 of the x3
[54:26.360 --> 54:31.320]  it really changes my life and you've heard callers calling to go wow i didn't know how i detox in
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.400]  three weeks like you said or wow folks better be careful with this i lost a bunch of weight and my
[54:35.400 --> 54:39.560]  skin got better but man i kind of got sick a few weeks into this because i you know i took more
[54:39.560 --> 54:46.040]  than what it said yeah it's not a game folks you die without iodine you have deficiencies you get a
[54:46.040 --> 54:52.200]  very low IQ now there are bad halogens your body will use to survive a while like bromide bromine
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.240]  chlorine fluoride and the government makes sure there's plenty of that in everything for you
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.400]  this is the stuff that literally the pineal gland gets gooped up with the bad halogens this is what
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.520]  clears out the pineal gland from all the studies out there and yeah it makes me bounce off the
[55:10.520 --> 55:16.200]  walls and we so alive in such intense dreams and it's just the building block for everything out there
[55:18.040 --> 55:25.560]  infowarstore.com infowarslife.com or triple a 253-3139
[55:27.160 --> 55:32.440]  and you can call and get your iodine it is 50 percent off you know i probably should have said
[55:32.440 --> 55:39.640]  that right out of the gates that so that everybody can try it x2 is very close to selling out
[55:41.160 --> 55:44.840]  but we are still going to offer it because we're getting more in about a month
[55:44.840 --> 55:50.760]  and we've got a lot of x3 just got a new shipment in of that and i will tell you x3 is different
[55:52.200 --> 56:00.600]  and it's not as strong and when you have the recommended amount of iodine that the FDA says
[56:00.600 --> 56:05.240]  that's bound iodine but that's what we go off of because that's the recommendations you need to
[56:05.240 --> 56:10.920]  be careful with this and consult a physician this is not a game the globalists work around the clock
[56:10.920 --> 56:16.440]  to make sure you don't get good clean iodine on your body that's a whole other subject ladies and
[56:16.440 --> 56:25.560]  gentlemen dna force plus has all of the award-winning known documented new compounds and ancient chinese
[56:25.560 --> 56:32.360]  compounds vietnamese compounds and japanese compounds that are known for energy stamina
[56:32.360 --> 56:39.080]  cleaning out the cells uh pqq coq 10 are patented for making the telomeres last longer that means
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.560]  it's the same as grobe they just they shrink slower which if you do the math the same thing is grow
[56:44.360 --> 56:50.280]  so uh it's there it's 50 percent off as well you have to understand that it costs thousands of
[56:50.280 --> 56:56.040]  dollars a kilo for several of the ingredients that are in this and these are the organically
[56:56.040 --> 57:01.720]  derived types not the synthetic you'll pay 50 bucks for pqq or coq 10 little bitty pills that
[57:01.720 --> 57:07.080]  aren't even organic that are synthetic that don't even get absorbed right this is the very best
[57:07.080 --> 57:13.160]  we could bring you and there's a whole bunch of other ingredients dna force plus is 50 off right
[57:13.160 --> 57:20.120]  now at info or store dot com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[57:20.760 --> 57:26.280]  triple eight two five three three one three nine and later in the next hour i'm going to go over some
[57:26.280 --> 57:31.160]  of the compounds of dna force and just and just break down from what's admitted and documented
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.320]  what these things do because a lot of these are patented proven you can actually make claims
[57:35.320 --> 57:39.560]  it's like our super silver loon gel we're the only authorized distributor except for the national
[57:39.560 --> 57:45.400]  company that puts it out so we're able to make all those claims it was fda approved uh these others
[57:45.400 --> 57:51.720]  are are not we can make the statements because they're patented last night i'm on info wars.com
[57:51.720 --> 57:58.920]  and i read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envisioned a
[57:58.920 --> 58:04.440]  betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars with the gads and snake super
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.560]  imposed over and on the back america's back info wars dot com but what's better than just an american

[58:13.480 --> 58:17.160]  combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt we'd already come up with the
[58:17.160 --> 58:22.920]  exact same similar design it is the don't tread on me american flag t-shirt inspired by the
[58:22.920 --> 58:28.360]  triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt let it say you know battle tattered flag like
[58:28.360 --> 58:34.120]  the one that flew over fort sumpner and again on the back it says america's back info wars dot com
[58:34.120 --> 58:39.720]  four thousand of these babies and that's it so we've got the betsy ross version and the american
[58:39.720 --> 58:45.000]  flag version at info wars store dot com be printed in the usa right now info wars store
[58:45.000 --> 58:51.800]  dot com they'll be right back the most banned broadcast in the world it's not only that you
[58:51.800 --> 58:56.040]  have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about
[58:56.040 --> 59:01.320]  info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor
[59:01.320 --> 59:05.480]  or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by
[59:05.480 --> 59:09.560]  secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school
[59:09.560 --> 59:15.240]  american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech
[59:15.240 --> 59:19.240]  that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried
[59:19.240 --> 59:24.200]  to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[59:24.200 --> 59:28.440]  and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[59:28.440 --> 59:33.160]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[59:33.160 --> 59:37.880]  person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[59:37.880 --> 59:42.760]  the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[59:42.760 --> 59:46.760]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming
[59:46.760 --> 59:56.200]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:56.200 --> 1:00:17.640]  so

[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:46.200]  second segment but i don't want to cut you short here but there's a story we covered last week that
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:54.440]  testimony uh by robert epstein there's one of the top psychologist computer scientists working
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:59.320]  with a large team that works with darpa proving that google can and is stealing the election
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:04.280]  along with facebook and so i've really promised myself and you to hammer the hell out of this
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:10.440]  i'm pretty sure this video got posted to info wars dot com there's a larger testimony that we
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:17.640]  posted where top scientist warren's google already stealing 2020 election but i'm going to take this
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.200]  two minute boil down and i'm going to make sure that it gets added to that page from july 18th
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.440]  and i'm going to try to get that reposted for the front page of info wars dot com because this
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:31.880]  really needs to get out i know you know all about this but the frustration is they're going to steal
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:36.600]  2020 they're going to spike the economy they're going to come with the guns it's going to cause a
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:45.080]  civil war i don't want that but the left has a hunger to dominate us and if we can't fix things
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:50.840]  peacefully they're going to come for us and then you know what's going to happen to them and i don't
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:57.000]  want to ruin my life or your life having to get our hands dirty on this scum let's take
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.600]  our government back and let's beat them politically and stop their bullying christ says go out dominate
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:09.720]  us destroy trump supporters crush us make a submit no you will not make me submit you little cockroach
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:16.600]  you absolute flaming bully tyrannical criminal you will not get your hands around this country's
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:22.600]  neck anymore you little coward look at that just look at the look on his face i mean he's just
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:30.200]  he's a piece of trash that seeks power because he doesn't have any power he has nothing he's weak
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:37.480]  inherently and i'm not going to sit here and watch these god-hating baby killing commie pieces of
[1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:53.640]  crap rule us all because they've got needle you know what syndrome lord give me peace here is this enemy
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:04.840]  google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to hillary clinton
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:14.200]  in the year 2016 is that correct 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum the range is between 2.6
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:21.960]  and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that i've been
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:30.520]  studying they control these and no one can counteract them these are not competitive these are tools
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:39.400]  that they have at their disposal exclusively your testimony is that google is through bias
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:48.200]  in search results manipulating voters in a way they're not aware on a massive scale in 2020
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:55.880]  if all these companies are supporting the same candidate there are 15 million votes on the line
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:01.640]  that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:07.720]  trace without monitoring systems in place we'll never know what these companies are doing and in
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:17.560]  2020 you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out and the methods that they're
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:26.360]  using are invisible they're subliminal they're more powerful than most any effects i've ever seen in
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:30.600]  the behavioral sciences and i've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years a handful
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:37.160]  of silicon valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars if not
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:45.400]  billions of dollars collectively massively influencing the results of elections senator with
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:51.480]  respect i must correct you please if mark zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:59.480]  democrats on election day that doesn't cost him a dime we'll be back imagine if somebody told you
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:05.880]  20 years ago that in the future universities would be saying don't use the term america or american
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:10.680]  and that american flags will be seen as offensive and that federal courts would be ruling that it's
[1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:16.600]  the hate symbol that's all happening the left are fascist authoritarians they're bullies they're
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:21.080]  criminals and now they're trying to make us take down the american flag they're saying the betsy
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:26.440]  ross flag our original flag is evil when she was an abolitionist but people are fighting back in the
[1:05:26.440 --> 1:05:32.040]  symbol war in this information war at infowarstore.com they're funding our operation getting great
[1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:38.440]  t-shirts a bunch of great designs and standing up to the globalists they're trying to shut down info
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:44.440]  wars a true 360 win so get your betsy ross flags and don't tread on me american flags original
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:49.480]  designs at infowarstore.com and stand up to the globalists stand up to the tyrants and let them
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:54.360]  know these colors don't run we're flying them brown
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:06:08.760]  it was three years ago
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.760]  just a few months after the election we raised the alarm that hillary said she wanted nuclear war
[1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:23.480]  with russia she said war including creative nuclear war of course not with china she's paid off by
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:31.080]  them and so i commissioned a remake of the berry goldwater anti berry goldwater lbj piece about
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:36.040]  how berry goldwater won a nuclear war of course she didn't but the little girl picking the daisy
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:40.360]  petals off and then and the hydrogen bomb going off is what caused goldwater the election
[1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:46.680]  when it was lbj that was really the warmonger but with hillary that was the case and trumps
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:51.720]  trying to stop war with iran he's trying to stop war with china but these guys are really
[1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:56.840]  starting to flex their muscles and you saw you know i said iran might have been behind that
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:02.440]  stuff and i'm mr false flag but iran's crazy they're grabbing real ships now that's not a
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:10.040]  false flag they're they're really pushing it uh because the sanctions are crippling them and
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:14.040]  iran could have nuclear weapons if they weren't constantly threatening to nuke everybody around
[1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:21.720]  them shawty arabia and israel aren't going to put up with it and so that's why this is a
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:27.560]  immovable object meets the unstoppable force and that's why war is in the air
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:36.600]  big report up on info wars dot com news wars dot com from the economic collapse blog dot
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:40.680]  com and michael steiner's great analysis it's top linked up on drudge report dot com wherever
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:46.600]  you go read it you need to go read it the u.s. is staging troops at key saudi military base
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:51.480]  that is used during all of our previous middle eastern wars we'll walk through that at the
[1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:56.360]  bottom of the hour but i'm going to your calls during this segment but first let's roll that uh
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.320]  well the democrats called it a campaign ad and they want me shut down because it was pro trump
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:07.880]  now it's called a anti-war uh ad because i like to live and here's the piece darin Mcbrane put
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:14.600]  together three years ago the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:22.200]  order it must be followed there's about four minutes between the order being given and the
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:29.000]  people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so as president i will make it clear that the
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:35.720]  united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:42.120]  political economic and military responses they're voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:51.960]  trump but if they vote for hillary it's war we came we saw he died with her you'll end up in
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:57.480]  world war i want the iranians to know that if i'm the president we will attack iran right now
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:04.360]  senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:12.040]  and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat level to death con too meanwhile hillary
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:18.360]  clinton is still threatening russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.000]  hacking it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions of course not because she's
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:30.280]  really loud noise all right looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:40.280]  we'll try to get leand back on in a few minutes when the president gives the order it must be
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:10:02.280]  followed
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:11.720]  November 8 vote like the world depends on it and it's more important than ever and i'll recap what
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:17.560]  i said last hour than the right to your calls our basic instincts are being eradicated to defend
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:22.920]  our children to defend the unborn now to defend babies after they're born i thought it was five
[1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:29.160]  states i looked it up this weekend seven states have passed laws to kill babies after they're born
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:35.720]  if you read the fine print does anybody feel safe when defenseless children are being murdered
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:46.280]  okay i actually prayed last night that god would not make me feel so much that i would not be a
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:49.400]  jerk around people that i care about including my family
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:55.960]  you know if you knew somebody down the street from your house had a month old baby
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:00.360]  and was about to chop him up you'd call the police wouldn't you
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:07.400]  in fact if the police wouldn't come you'd probably go down with a gun to stop it wouldn't you
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:13.480]  you're not a hero you just that's what you're supposed to do well if the medical system's
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:18.760]  doing it why why does it make it any better it makes it organized it makes it joseph mingola
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:21.720]  angel of death it makes it worse
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:27.400]  you think it's fun to get up here and tell people 10 years ago that
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:37.160]  jeffrey eppstein was a triple agent working for the u.s israel e u you name it the left
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:42.520]  arm of israel the leftists in the u.s ehud the rock all of it all the enemies of net and yahoo
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:46.520]  are about to get implicated in this same thing with uh trump you think trump and net and yahoo
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:53.400]  are on playing screwing kids no way just from the position of they wouldn't want to be compromised
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:12:00.280]  and they're not criminals perverts let's see how fashionable it is they'll let you on facebook
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:05.400]  bass benjamin yet and yahoo all day long hell he took his son's facebook away but alex jones
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:12.360]  oh he he can't have a facebook either but the guy saying have a million people physically raid area 51
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:19.880]  that's a huge felony you'll get shot there's nuclear weapons there and secret aircraft no
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:28.680]  space aliens he doesn't have his facebook taken down that's because facebook is getting everybody
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:36.680]  used to organizing giant political flash mobs to overthrow trump oh but don't worry alex jones
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:45.720]  is the monster he's not allowed to be on air according to senator murphy and senator blumenthal
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.640]  and senator widen they all say for america to survive he means the globalist jones must
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:13:00.040]  be taken off the air why because it's what i'm saying i'm not even that important the chai
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:07.000]  comms run the democrats the people on msnbc and cnn take money from the gulf state dictators they
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:19.960]  are not americans they are conquering us that isn't rhetorical it's a fact it's a reality
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:26.920]  and the chai comms are these great wonderful people that have this great wonderful history
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:31.160]  and we're going to bring us all this technology maybe i'd vote to have them take over maybe you'd
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:36.600]  vote we're not getting a vote on this and they're not they're the most robotic blood thirsty killers
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:43.800]  the planet's ever seen and then you look at all the america hating people telling us our flag
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.440]  sucks and we suck and people think this is like a bad dream this is happening
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:56.680]  everything every major democrat senator except maybe the one from west virginia
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:05.800]  has chinese spies in their offices that's how they get the chinese money i'm sure you heard top gun
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:13.880]  blurred out taiwanese and japanese flags off of ships and out of the movie and off of tom cruz
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:23.880]  because they own the movie the chinese government owns the movie and everybody's freaking out by
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:32.600]  this of course it's not an american movie it's a chai comm movie that's how far down the rat hole
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:45.560]  we are i'm the first to tell people 15 years ago that china owns hollywood because i was there
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:50.600]  and i was told that by some of the biggest producers household names
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:59.800]  i mean that's what this comes down to and i don't want to be the one going i told you this i told
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:05.320]  you that because when you're one of the only people that gets it and people are listening your

[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:27.000]  character and then they're going to kill me deader than an old ball peen hammer that you find out in
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:35.080]  the garage and that's okay i don't fear death but i fear losing to these scum for what they'll do

[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:54.840]  you or anybody else i mean the democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by
[1:18:54.840 --> 1:19:01.880]  foreign banks of the tricom so go to info wars store dot com info wars the most banned network in
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:07.960]  the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:12.760]  press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one
[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:18.680]  another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:23.880]  model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:28.600]  d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:33.080]  determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:37.560]  all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:41.800]  on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:46.760]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support letting
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:51.400]  the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:56.200]  american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:22.520]  speech with free markets you're listening to the alex jones show another time in the age of wonder
[1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:43.880]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:57.560]  worldwide it's alex jones it is a normal response when foreign authoritarian mass murdering
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:05.000]  governments are taking your country over and have had a twisted and hired giant packs of enemies to
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.360]  be all over the news telling you your country sucks your president sucks your military sucks
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:15.080]  your border patrol sucks their concentration camp guards they're killing children and none of it's
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:22.600]  true those are dangerous people that are saying that if they'll do that they'll do anything and
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:28.440]  then they run their mouths chris say saying we're gonna crush the americans we're gonna smash them
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:33.640]  these are quotes the he actually says these americans that love their flag love their country
[1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:39.640]  and he doesn't even realize what he's saying he's so brainwashed he's so inculcated as a traitor
[1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:45.960]  benedict arnold had to sneak around the revolutionary war acting like he was with us
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:51.080]  when he was compromised at least the last three years of the eight-year war
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:57.720]  these guys say it look at these americans proud of their country look at this president these
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:04.360]  people are the sick and then all these universities saying don't have your american flags that's so
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:11.960]  over the top and it shows you what they're getting ready for civil war foreign invasion
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:17.160]  the only way you'd put stuff like that on tv that your flag sucks your founders suck your
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:21.400]  president sucks your military they don't say they suck they say they're nazis
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:31.000]  that's what the chai comms pay they pay for that and they sit there in beijing and they watch it
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.240]  and they know what they're paying for at cnn and msnbc and these other platforms i'll tell you what
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:42.280]  george washington did you know i'm gonna go to your calls it's just that
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:50.120]  it's like the timer the egg the egg timer pinging in the kitchen and you know the water's boiling
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:56.040]  and the time is up playing games with this and i'm not calling for violence
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:59.640]  and i'm not calling for any of the listeners to do this christ haze is the one calling for
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:05.000]  but i am calling for trump and any patriots in the pentagon and anybody in the intelligence
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:11.080]  agencies that understands history you don't put up with stuff like this nobody does it no country
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:20.440]  can survive it and it's just gone over the top at this point it's out of control and believe me
[1:23:20.440 --> 1:23:25.080]  they wouldn't be doing all this unless they're planning to assassinate the president and they're
[1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:30.040]  dumb enough to do it and so i'm just trying to stop a giant violent war you could feel it you
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:37.000]  could see it and that's why i'm bouncing off the walls my spider sense is never been hammered

[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:19.080]  some ways we've expanded and other ways we've contracted but uh it's it's uh i mean definitely
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:23.960]  the white house is listening our banning made a lot of governments and important people listen
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:29.480]  so kind of our influence increased our general populist outreach decreased but it's been quite
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:33.800]  a fight what do you think about the influence of china i mean i know they're a big part of the eu
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:40.520]  takeover they're a big part of what's happening to sweden the islamic invasion uh what i know
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:44.680]  from china is just what i've been seeing in sweden that you might not know that they're
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:49.800]  being buying up a lot of companies to work with sensitive technology and it hasn't really been
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.920]  stopped because the swedish security beliefs have been too slow or just letting it happen like a lot
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:59.960]  of uh uh companies spearheading on because sweden has a lot of high-tech companies with
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:05.640]  microchips and like special metal alloys and everything they've been buying up and sweden
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:11.720]  got into conflict with china because the china arrested uh some offer i think is swedish citizen
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:20.440]  or has uh stayed in sweden at least and then they tried to stage some uh like fake news uh event in
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:25.880]  sweden they sent some chinese tourists to a hotel in Stockholm and they came there on on the wrong
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:31.000]  day they booked like for saturday and they came on a friday or something and they were very upset
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.600]  start the problem in the lobby and they ended up the police had to take them out and drop them
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:38.920]  off somewhere in the street and then china like small and i saw that said oh look they don't like
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:45.560]  chinese and sweden that became a big news in uh in china there was someone like bling stuff on
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:50.600]  some chinese tail and i'll be able to hear about this because china programs netflix i'm not kidding

[1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:38.040]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:42.760]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:47.080]  bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.840]  of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10 percent off because
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:55.000]  you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh where you have

[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:50.200]  companies you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem you are a bad person you should
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:55.240]  be censored off the internet bad yes but get out of here alex info wars might have been banned from
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:58.600]  from twitter but it seems to have found a new home over at trump's twitter feed president
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:06.280]  trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say that info
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:16.280]  wars president info wars the most banned network in the world by the way brian stelter's show on the
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:24.680]  weekend only had a half million viewers now it has 250 000 prime time weekend show quarter million
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:32.600]  viewers i mean we have over a million on radio stations tuning in every hour the guy is a joke
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:37.480]  millions every day over the internet despite all the censorship but that's their delusion
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:42.120]  now the caller from sweden then i'll hurry through the other calls alex brought up the fact that
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:47.960]  yeah china is engaged in oppression of swedish citizens that are over there and then they
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:53.960]  had this big falling out china and sweden a diplomatic row or fight after family brutally
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:59.400]  evicted from hotel lobby china kills political distance on the street sells organs has millions
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:05.160]  in death camps but they'll use social media when they want to make sweden look bad knowing
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:10.840]  how sjw sweden is saying oh look you know we send in these chinese operatives they act like they're
[1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:16.360]  thrown out you know the biggest group of tourists here in the united states is uh chinese women
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:21.000]  they come here to have their babies they become us citizens and everything's paid for even seeing
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.240]  it admits that uh so it just breaks down how china owns hollywood controls netflix that's why
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:32.360]  there's all these shows are like jesse smollett type deals where whites are all evil and minorities
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:38.920]  are all being attacked that's the chinese who uh the communists who are some of the most racist
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:45.880]  insular people in the world they don't let anybody mess with the chinese culture they've
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:52.840]  got two million muslims in forced labor camps the wiggers but but they know how to punch
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:57.080]  american and swedish buttons you want to finish commenting on alex thanks for holding over
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:04.040]  from sweden yeah actually i want to say something else just shortly uh because i think it's the biggest
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:08.440]  the every day of the year the biggest news is how you got censored on the platform and how you're
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:12.600]  considered a dangerous person on facebook because i think people should really think about what did
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:17.000]  you do to achieve that status you must be the biggest threat and i think people should try and
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.920]  like fill the void where you get censored and at the same time support you to go to the next step
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:28.840]  because they did this censoring for some reason so people should really look into if they if they
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:32.840]  want to win the fight well that was the whole point of this this talk today it's because i'm
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:39.240]  focusing on china allied with the multinationals owning hollywood literally taking over our
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:43.640]  countries and again the chinese people are great people it's the chinese communists
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:49.240]  that are so soulless in slaving and dominating their own population i have one one more idea
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:54.840]  before before you go to next color i know what you did many years ago when you were still active
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.480]  on on social media you had this google bombs or twitter bombs and now you don't have your own
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:06.280]  platform to spread your own material but you can use a similar method to maybe boost the the best
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:11.560]  tweet of trump of the week or something to really make like hundreds of thousands more retweets or
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:15.640]  and they will get really annoyed if you're like even affecting anything in social media even if
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:21.800]  you're banned uh the elite wouldn't like it and i did they can't really band with trump from twitter
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:27.000]  if you if you boost someone else because band them but trump i don't think they can ban him
[1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:32.680]  now that's absolutely right that's a fabulous idea and i've thought about that google changed
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:36.760]  their algorithm to stop the google bomb where we could put a turnout make it number one whenever
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:41.960]  we wanted to i sure wish we would have used that more before they they they stopped their system to
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:51.800]  block it but we could create hashtags that linked to something new that we've done then they'll have
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:56.440]  trouble suppressing that hashtag but i agree we should do things like pick trump statements or
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:02.760]  trump tweets and get that information out thank you so much for the call alex and again great
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:09.720]  callers like alex out there let's go ahead and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:17.400]  jonathan in florida thanks for calling alex uh about the e you and china i just wanted to say that
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:24.280]  the central bank the the lead the satanic people have been running europe running the us controlling
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:31.000]  our currency but what i really wanted to say is how come i don't hear anybody mentioning when you
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:35.400]  said that when they came for you that everybody else was next that you were going to be the first
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:40.920]  domino and everybody else was going to fall that's exactly what's happened and i want to take your
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:47.960]  view on your expert analysis you've been spot on on everything on what you think what really is
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:54.600]  going to happen next so we can prepare well i could talk for a thousand hours on that i had to
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:59.800]  really get focused and sit in a chair for like three or four hours and just kind of meditate on
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:04.680]  what's happening to come up with the next level and and you know try to look at all the thousands
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:09.160]  of pieces that go together and then think about how the globalists are going to respond how we're
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:14.280]  going to respond and then uh the synthesis that comes out of that is the way that i can a lot of
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:18.040]  times predict what's going to happen next but a lot of this is easy to predict when you study
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:23.160]  tyrants but the globalists have been up to what they're doing it's really not hard to understand
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:28.520]  they they demonize me because they knew we were pushing an effective message of liberty
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:35.400]  we were created uh folk hero status and chris carter was making a new x files based on me
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:40.440]  and he was saying on the news alex jones is good trump's good so they had to intimidate everybody
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:46.440]  else who was pro trump in media to shut up watch what happens to alex jones so i was
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:52.920]  used as an example of being quote destroyed to scare other people then once i wasn't stood up for
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:59.960]  they would then obviously move on like any hegemonic tyrant does to censoring everybody else so
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:04.920]  it was really a no-brainer and then if you look at the architecture of the internet how it's
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:12.360]  designed to ban whole voices whole names whole symbols like the taiwanese flag once you can ban
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:17.480]  alex jones or even saying his name or info wars his name then everything else will fall in line
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:22.840]  then you can ban language you can ban communication in whole so so hold over jonathan i'll come back
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:29.240]  to you and try to get what you think's coming next but i uh we're to crossroads we're a fork in the
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:34.360]  road and it really is up to what we do and what trump does versus what the globalists are gonna do
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:40.280]  i know what's going to happen if trump doesn't take action and that if all of us don't take action
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.600]  i can tell you what's gonna happen so let me try to break that down when we come back it's it's
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:49.080]  one of the biggest subjects you could obviously discuss and it's uh gives me a headache you've
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:55.880]  been thinking about it but i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you what i think's coming next day with us
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:43:04.040]  as we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:10.600]  heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of america
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:17.080]  it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:25.640]  know is right and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our coast as long as we remember
[1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:33.160]  our great history as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:51.400]  nothing that america can not do in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power of the republic
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:56.200]  in the name of jesus christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight at them
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.720]  robert marrige what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:05.800]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:10.200]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:14.120]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:17.960]  members of the public and the audience that care about this has to bring real social political
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:22.040]  economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:26.440]  become the big tech oleg arcs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:30.760]  politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:35.560]  great depression the informer's audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:40.440]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:45.000]  promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.600]  then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:56.680]  gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:03.480]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:07.240]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:11.480]  censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:15.240]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:19.400]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:22.520]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:27.480]  and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:33.960]  supplements and he claims or supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:37.960]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:42.280]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:46.120]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:50.520]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:57.160]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:05.240]  as we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history the globalists
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:11.400]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war borders are being broken
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:19.000]  and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change and how it changes will likely be
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:26.040]  decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails the system is vulnerable
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:32.360]  electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:38.520]  having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next
[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:44.680]  level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:52.440]  buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today support mankind by being
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:57.880]  prepared and support freedom by buying from info war store dot com
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:13.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:43.320]  all right this is the most fan broadcast in the world our show show we're going back to your
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:47.400]  calls right through the next hour right at the jail saloon say and we'll get to everybody
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:54.440]  you know i mentioned this earlier at the end of the first hour and then i didn't show you the news
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:59.960]  articles and the studies now the crew did they pulled up pub med and harvard and all the rest of it but
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:08.040]  yes uh david hog the anti gunner once said notice jones says there's toxins in the water table
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:16.040]  and then he sells you water filters and then the crowd laughs see they're so deceptive
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:23.000]  there's a spirit of deception they don't even understand like a sign saying we've got great
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.720]  cheeseburgers yeah i'm trying to sell you cheeseburgers
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:33.400]  they don't get hey i filter my water you should too here's a bunch of examples we've got the best
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:37.560]  water filters and people go test our water filters that are 40 off right now by the way
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:45.480]  and they go oh my gosh these are like it's funny like all the brands he sells we only sell like five
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:51.080]  brands out of hundreds they're all the highest rated who do you think i go out and partner with
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:57.400]  i go see what's the highest rated that's what i sell let's see it's funny like david hog
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:03.240]  it's it's weird to like just be straight shooter i'm a straight shooter to the point of being annoying
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:09.080]  it's the same thing with iodine you know i mentioned this but i wanted to show you some
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:12.040]  articles if you're a tv viewer you can see this radio listeners just type in
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:21.640]  how adding iodine to salt boosted americans IQs let's discover magazine here's another one
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:30.440]  business insider how adding i iodine to salt resulted in a decline in a decades worth of
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:39.400]  IQ gains for the United States read that again how adding iodine to salt resulted in a decades
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:45.720]  worth of IQ gains for the United States it's a weird headline doesn't only explain it it's estimated
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:52.440]  that a third of deformities worldwide and chromosomal disorders are lack of iodine in the woman
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:03.160]  needless to say we sell the best iodine there is yep we tell you about a real problem like
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:10.600]  like self-defense like being a gun manufacturer it's good to have guns to protect yourself here by
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:15.320]  my gun it's really good it's like just complete straight shoot there it is that's how we fund
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:22.360]  our operation i'm gonna explain this again x2 is the only true atomic iodine on the market it's
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:27.960]  from deep earth crystals mind no one else has this because you got to get dea approval and jump
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:32.440]  through a bunch of hoops and it makes the cost go way up i would not take the other iodines out
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:39.400]  there on the market this is pure it's awesome a low percentage of people i'm told us less than
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:46.600]  three percent cannot absorb regular pure atomic iodine so we have tri iodine which is excellent
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:52.360]  that has the deep earth crystal source but also potassium iodine and sodium iodine
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:58.600]  it has nothing to do with how much bottle or how much it cost to produce it to come up with a new
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:03.000]  one this is because scientists and i talked to three different big labs said you ought to be putting
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:12.040]  out multiple iodine from clean sources so we went with tri iodine and it's apples and oranges for
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:16.520]  everybody's physiology is different you should try them both and test them out using yourself
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:29.560]  and i want to explain something again this is big medicine this is big stuff use an american term
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:38.280]  big wampum this is this is not smoke and mirrors so be careful because a lot of people are already
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:44.200]  so jacked from no good iodine on their body and you're already running off the bad iodines and all
[1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:50.360]  the other bad you know halogens that you can do some wacky stuff consult the physician talk to
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:56.440]  whoever do your own research because i'm not selling smoke and mirrors i'm not selling placebos
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:05.000]  no we changed the world here and like i said earlier i've never been a supplement guy
[1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:12.440]  i got convinced to get on them like six seven years ago i lost 80 pounds i was 280 i went down
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:17.800]  to like 200 i gained about 30 pounds back put working out all of it went off the supplements
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:22.680]  partially gained some of it back went back on a few weeks ago religiously i'm taking the x2
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:31.960]  i'm taking the fish oil i'm taking the bodies i'm taking the dna force plus and it's just rolling off
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:42.840]  and i don't want to get graphic here but my wife's like that hurts
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:49.800]  the point is is that hard as a rock folks all right i apologize for that it's true though
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:58.600]  why and i always tell myself why in the hell am i not taking all this stuff when i know how good it
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:03.480]  is it's a family show i apologize it's just true though i i told you i told the truth even though
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:07.080]  it's really obnoxious and i apologize i'm gonna stop it right now somebody slapped me in the face
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  okay let's go back to jonathan a holdover what does he think's gonna happen next
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:19.720]  it's up to us i said if people didn't rally around my banning it'd be everybody else next
[1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:23.560]  because that's the big tech goals we have their own documents we have their own admissions
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:29.480]  i mean it's it's not like i'm a rocket scientist i think you jump off a cliff you're gonna die
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:33.400]  probably at least you have a parachute what is going to happen
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:45.720]  what is going to happen next if we don't do anything thomas jefferson was once asked what
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:51.400]  is the level of tyranny at which tyrants will go he said whatever level you'll put up with let me
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:56.840]  explain that there's always somebody crazier if you let somebody push the envelope of what you'll
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:54:03.000]  put up with who will outdo that and there's always somebody after that who will outdo that
[1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:11.720]  until you've got black pyramids with 10 000 sacrifices a day with people with high priest
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:18.040]  chopping their own genitals off that's happened all over the world where people submit to the
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:21.720]  priest class and pretty soon they're taking hallucinogens they're murdering everybody
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:28.360]  they're running around psychotic it's like hellraiser and so what's going to happen in them in in
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:35.400]  the in the meantime on this road to hell is we're desperately wicked we have no bottom we don't
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:43.160]  have god the bible tells us we'll go all the way down the pit and so what's going to happen next
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:48.520]  is up to us uh they're they're trying to assassinate trump their big move is to plunge the economy right
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:55.000]  now and start wars and they're trying as hard as they can they're trying to cause a civil war as well
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:59.160]  and none of it's working and so they're getting more panicked and more desperate
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:04.440]  and at a certain point we're aiding and abetting them if trump doesn't politically and militarily
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:09.960]  move against them we're winning politically but they are doing things that are illegal
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:16.360]  they're on tv promoting antifa saying they're heroes for attacking ice facilities trying to kill
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:24.360]  people and then folks are going to get killed they're already getting killed and so i'll tell you
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:29.720]  the big thing is going to happen well see i mean i said if trump didn't replace the fellow reserve
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.240]  with people they'd plunge the economy he's replacing them they're even more pissed he's
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:41.880]  exercising his rifle power they don't know what to do even the traders in 1913 who sold us out
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:48.920]  but well the president will still have a veto well trump's the first president in 107 years
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:56.360]  106 and a half years to exercise that power and the system that's been owning us and running us
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:03.560]  feels like we're their property and they are just they don't know what to do and so
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:08.280]  they're going to try to plunge the economy i'm just stating things that are already happening
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:13.720]  they're trying to start big wars that's already happening but the big one is if trump doesn't
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.960]  call out and go after big tech now
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:22.040]  because i know they've bought off almost all his advisors they have more money than god
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:29.320]  just god didn't care about money that's a made-up thing isn't it it's a fiat thing of the devil
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:32.440]  i mean that money really is of the devil it's like the bible says the love of money is the heart
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:37.720]  of all evil the root of all evil but the money's bad but the love of it and the fact that it's fiat
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:41.240]  and it's it's like a spell it's not really real but you get the whole world for it
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:46.680]  see that's that we do a whole show maybe tomorrow and just take calls the whole time
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:51.960]  what's going to happen next um they're going to steal the election from trump google and facebook
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:56.040]  are already doing it and they're just going to cover up all the fraud and all the crime they're
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:59.720]  going to deactivate any conservative thought or discussion and they're going to have all the
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:05.320]  illegals go out and vote and people vote the name of dead folks and that's it i mean
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:12.840]  pop computer scientists and others have testified to congress it's already done deal so trump's greatest
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:20.920]  attribute is also his greatest Achilles it's always that way he's super confident he thinks
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:26.360]  he can override them he thinks that people are waking up to it but but but but it's such a level
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:32.120]  of fraud that if trump doesn't take action he'll have the election stolen from him and so i think
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:35.720]  that really comes down to it finish up with jonathan in 60 seconds we come back and then i'm
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:40.200]  gonna just i gotta hurry up like i always do we got a lot of callers here james and shon and

[1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:54.680]  on the air thanks for holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talk to
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:59.160]  a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:04.040]  agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:08.440]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:13.160]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:17.240]  the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend
[1:59:17.240 --> 1:59:20.920]  i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:26.280]  down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old
[1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:30.600]  i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:36.120]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:40.360]  others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something
[1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:45.480]  does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for
[1:59:45.480 --> 2:00:04.840]  liberty thank you sir for calling you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:04.840 --> 2:00:11.800]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:17.080]  you know the caller is asking what happens next if we don't stop this
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:21.000]  we'll be conquered we'll be taken over
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:32.840]  that's what's happening we're in a season of blood right now and if trump's unable to stabilize the
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:38.760]  country and remove this this attempt by foreign powers to to break the country up it's going to
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:44.120]  get very physical and we're going to win that fight and a lot of the mercenaries that have been hired
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:47.800]  be part of the political class they're all going to disappear and run for the hills they've all been
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:52.760]  making those plans that's why it's so stupid to go down this road thanks for holding jonathan
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:57.240]  did i answer your question in a babbling way i mean what do you think comes next you're just
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:04.920]  as smart as i am no i appreciate all the info that you give us um i think it's biblical and i do
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:11.640]  want to say that i did buy x2 about bodies because i'm a i'm a cutter and i stand all day and i take
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:18.920]  a pill before i go to bed and my body is great all day um i just i'm not really sure all i know
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:24.360]  it's biblical central banks have controlled uh europe and the united states so i don't know where
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:30.760]  this goes all i can say is to to the callers to the listeners pray for alex pray for their family
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:36.360]  and like you said when you when you have a communication with god you get this tingling
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:42.920]  sensation a connection so i'm gonna make sure that i pray for you alex that pay for this country
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:52.760]  and i'm not sure what we can do when this when these satanic people control control our lives
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:59.640]  with ai with ken trails with vaccines with uh five well imagine how powerful we are they're
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:03.720]  having to do all this to do it and then try to control us i appreciate you calling brother god bless
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:10.360]  you jonathan and info wars has become a figure ahead of this so i think people's prayers my biggest
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:15.720]  problem is i get so angry at the globalist and when i get exhausted i have to get more angry to
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:21.000]  power through and then i become a jerk and i just i i need people to pray that i i i have peace and i'm
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:27.480]  not and and that is actually a gratuitous request about me because i'm getting to where i've been
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:31.160]  getting up at five a.m i've been working a lot still spending time with the family so i just
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:37.800]  end up sleeping less so that i can try to get more done and uh i get exhausted then i have to get
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:44.600]  enraged to to carry on and it's just not healthy it's not good and so i'm trying to deal with that
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:50.200]  and i appreciate all your support folks okay joe in los angeles you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:55.560]  joe welcome welcome how you doing alex um good brother plug real quick i want to want to plug
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:03:02.520]  real quick on your product um i um have a roommate that uh cut his toe about a year ago never took
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:07.560]  care of it and it turned into a disaster he had a hole in the size of his toe about a quarter
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:13.400]  and he couldn't get the doctors to fix it the they were giving him all the uh you know the
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:17.400]  stuff to take care of the bacteria and it wasn't working so i turned him on to your um that silver
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:24.120]  wrap and within about three weeks that holes turned into about the size of a a dime so it's
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:29.560]  shrunk almost half the size well well well so so so which of the products did you put him on
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:37.160]  as a silver the the silver uh wound oh sir absolutely it's private labeled from the number
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.160]  one company in the u.s they've said we can say their name but i've chosen not to because they'll
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:46.440]  get harassed but this is what's used in hospitals it's sold in stores we are the only ones authorized
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:52.440]  because they're patriots out of denver to sell it uh as a third party uh and absolutely super
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:58.920]  silver wound gel is the strongest nano silver allowed on the market by the fda it is it is
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:04.280]  certified as the strongest silver uh that you can get over the counter uh so yeah this stuff
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:11.160]  definitely works well i also uh a friend of mine's mom goes dying of cancer so um she basically
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:17.400]  didn't want to go through the natural uh the chem uh going through the uh chemotherapy the
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:22.680]  yeah chemotherapy so i i told them you know here take some of this stuff i had dna for survival
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:28.520]  shield secret 12 selenium i gave it to her and she went into her checkup and they said that her
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:34.760]  tumors were 40 decreased i don't know if that had to do with that that combination but she was hey
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:41.240]  don't hang up i want to come back to you and talk about this listen scurvy is rampant everywhere
[2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:46.280]  none of the doctors will tell them that he vitamin c i want to explain this when we come back this is
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:52.440]  this is a big deal folks you need vitamin c you need iodine just like you need oxygen but they won't
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:05:00.120]  tell you stay with us it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:04.920]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:09.240]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some
[2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:13.560]  billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:19.400]  of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of
[2:05:19.400 --> 2:05:23.640]  press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:28.520]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this
[2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:32.280]  was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:36.760]  been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:42.040]  manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:47.560]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:51.720]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[2:05:51.720 --> 2:06:07.640]  blackwarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:20.760]  resistance to tyrants resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:06:21.640 --> 2:06:27.320]  so this broadcast is like nails on a chalkboard to the establishment i couldn't be happier and i
[2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:34.680]  want to stay on air in defiance of their tyranny but but joe in los angeles called in and he was
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:39.720]  he might want to recap he was talking about his friend got an infection in his toe had a huge
[2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:46.440]  rod hole in it the doctors couldn't take care of it and then he tried super silver wound gel
[2:06:46.440 --> 2:06:51.800]  that is patented fda approved we just license it from a company that puts it in hospitals
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:57.000]  and stores across them land but our version is super silver wound gel just a different label
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  so i i didn't even know the caller was going to bring that up but it was china ebstein and
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:06.360]  other things but he was bringing up someone he knows that as cancer and he was telling that story
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:12.840]  as he went to break so here's what i'm going to say if you don't have oxygen you die in about four
[2:07:12.840 --> 2:07:17.640]  minutes you pass out in about 30 seconds but your brain dies in about four minutes on average
[2:07:17.640 --> 2:07:22.040]  unless you're putting an i solution you can live for hours because it slows down your metabolic
[2:07:22.040 --> 2:07:27.080]  rate and kind of puts you in stasis but cells turn off in about four minutes and your brain gives
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:34.520]  up the ghost now the british ended up being the most powerful empire in the world not because
[2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:39.800]  the spanish couldn't fight not because the portuguese couldn't fight not because the austrian hungarian
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:48.040]  empire couldn't fight but the brits invented clocks they invented until the us came along
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:55.720]  basically almost everything because they had the royal institutes where the crown would pay huge
[2:07:55.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  prizes to people that developed navigation systems medicine surgeries england was the king
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:14.760]  because the renaissance really exploded there and you ever wonder why british are called limies
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:20.840]  you know irish and folks are called mix because they got a mic in the front of their name it's not
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:25.960]  a racist or bad thing it's you know oh that's a mic because they got a mic on their name our crowds
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:28.760]  germans are called crowds because they like sauerkraut with everything
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:36.280]  so and i'll go back to your calls this is really important what the caller brought up
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:46.040]  is the limies the british ended up getting basically key limes when they went into the caribbean 500
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:53.800]  years ago and they had their captains right and their ships doctors how long sailors survived
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:57.720]  what climates they were trying to figure out what's making sickness they weren't sure if it was
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:09:02.280]  hot air or why have they got close to the shore more of their sailors would die in a couple days
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:08.120]  and they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes but the british classified that 400 years ago
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:14.600]  so the british would always lay off the coast and foreigners would ask why did the brits lay off
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:20.200]  the coast because they want mosquitoes and then they can get all the the fevers and the malaria that
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:28.760]  came with mosquitoes well the brits also figured out with their scientists limes but the brits
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:34.520]  were suspicious the average seller thought if you swim you get sick and and they thought you
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:37.960]  know you don't want to eat vegetables they make you sick this is what people actually thought back
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:44.920]  then so they would put the limes in the grog which is what's grog one third rum two thirds water
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:49.480]  to make sure they would least drink their water part of their pay and their daily rations for
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:58.120]  good behavior was grog so on the job you know all sailors spanish russian didn't matter they
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:03.800]  they were paid in alcohol and part of their daily food was alcohol so the british would start putting
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:15.320]  400 years ago limes in the the alcohol the grog and so what would happen when they were a thousand
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:21.080]  miles from home and ran up against a british frigate twice their size or ran up against a
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:28.040]  spanish frigate twice their size well the spanish all their teeth had fallen out they had cuts all
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:38.520]  over them open wounds uh no fresh vegetables no vitamin c well notice the british for 200 years
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:44.600]  could keep it secret that limes were and so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:50.360]  bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in and they would put it in
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:56.840]  the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight because they've
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:11:04.200]  got vitamin c so i'm going into a plug here but here's the deal every study linus pauling won
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:13.960]  two Nobel prizes for vitamin c and how if you have mega doses of it you basically never get
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:20.520]  cancer the problem is a lot of people get to where their guts can't absorb it anymore when you're
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:27.400]  old and so you've got to take it intervenously so so these are the things that are known and so the
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:35.720]  caller was bringing up people that he knows who suddenly got on x2 suddenly got on dna force
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:43.240]  suddenly got on these things and they got a lot healthier well that's because if you think vitamin
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:51.080]  c is powerful the stuff in dna force is even beyond that it's the next level of that so yes that's
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:57.960]  what we know and when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine uses the bad halogen
[2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:04.200]  and at a certain point the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive they start mutating so they
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:11.480]  can use that and not die but then they take over your body and you die from cancer and so so much
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:17.960]  of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:24.360]  and mineral deficiencies and they work around the clock with all these fake reports oh you don't
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:28.120]  need vitamins you don't need minerals you don't need and they lower the amount you're supposed to
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:34.520]  take they know exactly what they're doing so joe finishing up and i appreciate you're holding
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:41.160]  you got cut off get into what the story you were telling uh well um well i wanted to go
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:47.080]  into um china and uh want to talk about kim trill so you know i've been i've been listening to you
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:53.240]  for 15 years and i've been trying to figure out what what the end game was and watched all your
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:59.080]  films and i remember when you guys uh when you did that uh one show what we we found the coffins
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:05.480]  over there in georgia yeah the stock pile of stock pile of coffins in case there was a mass plague
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:10.600]  release right right well you know everything's starting to kind of make sense i'm trying to put
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:15.640]  things together and i'm looking at you know the holding camps the closed military bases turned
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:20.920]  into and uh and derma camps uh you and equipment that was seen all over the country you know several
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:26.520]  years back and you start thinking to yourself well are they trying they want a civil war they want
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:31.400]  to clear out as many people as they can with the equip with you know guns and that and then
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:38.200]  would china want to come in and and you know invade us i have no idea but deagle.com i don't
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:45.320]  know if you've ever seen that website they say by 2025 our um our population is going to be down
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:54.200]  to 60 million from 330 to 60 million well i know that the un wants a permanent world population
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:59.320]  of 500 million that's the official unesco goal they believe the sustainable number of humans on
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:04.920]  earth is 500 million well you'd have to get rid of 7 million people to achieve that number so yeah
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:10.440]  i appreciate you joe thank you for the call let's uh jam in another call before we go to break here
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:15.640]  once she's been holding the longest here let's go to james in massachusetts james are on the air
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:22.840]  thanks for calling uh hello alex um god flex general jones may you live in peace and love
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:28.120]  forever in christ namely pray god bless you brother so the reason i'm calling alex is um with all
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:34.760]  this election fraud things coming up obama having a um federalized the elections why do we not hear
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:43.640]  any talk about uh mandating paper ballots voter id even going as far as dying your thumb why don't
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:49.000]  why doesn't the president implement some of these things so that we can prevent some of the fraud
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:53.800]  no that's a good point you know in iraq they die the thumb as you pointed out
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:58.920]  so that people don't go vote 10 times that's the biggest problem and they're just rampant fraud
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:03.240]  because the democrats aren't popular they're not winning anywhere it's when democrats get control
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:08.920]  they engage in election fraud and conservatives won't do it so we always lose but that's changing
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:14.440]  because the landslide's so big i agree trump needs to stop internet censorship and he needs to do
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:20.760]  something about uh that situation with election fraud you just mentioned yep and i'd like to thank
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:25.000]  you also you know my wife and i have been married for 17 years and we never able to have kids
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:31.160]  and after a couple years have taken the b12 and the uh the iodine um and not knowing about not

[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:42.680]  you very much for that well you know fluoride is meant to block fertility it's the bad halogen but
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:47.320]  it's iodine is associated with fertility so that's a beautiful story that's exciting my friend

[2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:40.920]  right here about iq fertility being boosted on iodine you name it that's why the system
[2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:45.160]  fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here even
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:49.960]  don't get it from infowarstore.com it doesn't matter to me just research what deficiencies are
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:55.640]  doing but but get back to you and your wife and and recap the story you were telling because you
[2:20:55.640 --> 2:21:01.320]  got caught by that break yep so um we had been married for 17 years and we never had any children
[2:21:01.880 --> 2:21:07.560]  and um we started we bought the water filter first and we cut out the fluoride and the glyphosates
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:14.440]  and then we started taking x2 and and b12 and about a year or so later um my wife got pregnant
[2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:21.000]  with our our baby boy and um with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's he's so bright
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:26.440]  and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:35.400]  and then you're our hero alex well that's just beautiful brother and again it shows the system
[2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:41.400]  knows all this and it works to keep the people from just getting basic things that the body has
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:46.200]  to have you have to have vitamin c you have to have iodine you have to have water you have to
[2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:52.200]  have oxygen but instead the whole system works to block that well i'm just glad that you and your
[2:21:52.200 --> 2:21:57.640]  wife uh you know listen to what we were talking about with my guests and the scientist i mean i
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:02.440]  know you got dramatic results but i mean what made you go from just doing the water filters the
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:06.280]  other products and what was it like when she got pregnant what was she like when she delivered and
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:14.280]  what's your son like today uh well um when she got pregnant we were just beside ourselves you
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:21.080]  know after 17 years of marriage and then all of a sudden surprised and uh um when she after she
[2:22:21.080 --> 2:22:25.960]  delivered our baby right from when the first time i saw him you could just see that he was so bright
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:33.640]  and alive and the doctor wanted to stick him with a um a vaccine for um hepatitis b and i said are
[2:22:33.640 --> 2:22:39.240]  you out of your mind you want to give my baby a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:45.720]  you are crazy you're not going to touch him and uh and ever since um we brought him home he's just
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:50.920]  been so happy and healthy that we're just beside ourselves well my wife gets mad when i talk about
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:23:00.520]  her on air but um we had three miscarriages my second wife and and i just said baby you play
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:06.120]  tennis you work out all day you teach yoga you're beautiful so you need iodine and i dosed her up
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:14.360]  on it she did it and we have my great daughter who's now 26 months old and um it's just so powerful
[2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:18.520]  which it's what we're made of and i'm i'm sitting here trying to explain this people we're not just
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:24.120]  like making this stuff up and because she was taking all her other vitamins she's a big health person
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:28.920]  but i explained to her about fertility and women and just it's just everything but again the other
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.760]  iodines are bound you don't absorb them everyone calls her iodine atomic i wish everyone else was
[2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:39.080]  selling atomic iodine they're not because you've got to pay a lot of money and go through a lot
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:42.760]  of hoops to get atomic iodine but i didn't mean to go off into supplements today i was just taking
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:47.560]  general calls about world government the new world order you know how they're trying to start a war
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:51.560]  what do you make of them trying to plunge the economy the democrats are openly saying
[2:23:51.560 --> 2:23:55.720]  not just bill mar now but like elizabeth warren you name it let's plunge the economy that'll
[2:23:55.720 --> 2:24:01.240]  stop trump i guess i think we have no memory if they plunge the economy do you think folks
[2:24:01.240 --> 2:24:07.560]  will really blame trump i don't think so i just i just think that he needs to take more control
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:11.960]  i think he's trying to be extra diplomatic but i think we need to george washington right now
[2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:15.480]  and i think he's a little bit behind the curve on the election no i agree you know what george
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:19.960]  washington be doing right now right he'd be hanging people in the streets right now and and that's
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:28.440]  what we really need you're right i appreciate your call and you know i'm not the type of person
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:33.000]  that lost after violence but i i i when you hear the truth you get tears in your eyes because
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:38.360]  you know these people are evil i mean and i'm not calling for any of us to any violence because
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:43.800]  we're not george washington and and trump you know i think he knows how to hold his fire he's
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:50.040]  trying to fix stuff peacefully but we're in a lot of crap right now and uh you know when i saw chris haze
[2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:58.280]  on friday say we must crush the americans we must smash them we must destroy them these are quotes
[2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:02.680]  and say you see them with their flags you see them loving america it was like a satire piece
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.920]  imagine some hallucination when there's a guy on national us tv going they love america these filth
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:15.240]  they they they wave flags we've got to crush them but he's for real they think we're so weak this is
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:19.880]  what they're doing they're firebombing ice facilities overwork people doing a great job
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:24.440]  with the right-wing attacking them because they released 90 percent of the people that's the law
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:29.800]  they're they're taking care of all these people they're releasing them it's the democrats that
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:39.240]  did catch and release the democrats that caused all this and they call them nazis gosh they could
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.120]  find so many americans they're all astroturfed they're out of they're out of work they all get
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:50.040]  paid by soros the media it's all rena mobs they just go pull these stunts the whole media focuses on
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:59.960]  they call for the open borders they created it all there's any blood it's on their hands
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  let's take another caller who's holding the longest now erin and nevada thanks for holding
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:10.280]  you're a trooper you're awesome go ahead you're on the air good morning alex how are you i'm good
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:16.600]  talking to you brother thank you i'm out here in las vegas in femur region nine sanctuary city
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:22.920]  future sanctuary state uh want to see the head of the hydro cutoff because the last biggest gaming
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:28.360]  commission here gives gaming licenses to dubai world which is a golden diamond exchange out of
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:35.560]  jubai and all their money goes to iran um you know they're not giving trump a gaming license out here
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:41.400]  it gave steve win one when he was put in business by a gangster out of detroit that's a good point
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:49.960]  trump can't get a license but iran can do by world have half owner of mgm you know resort
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:56.920]  you know george soros is a big stockholder and mgm also a big stockholder and caesars palace
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:02.920]  you know you see dominion voting machines george soros owns the company that owns those voting
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:10.520]  machines so you know what are we doing to nevada to set the targets over here to stop this transformation
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:18.040]  into a sanctuary state alex no i agree trump needs to take the gloves off and he's trying
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:22.440]  he's overwhelmed that i'm not just defending trump it's true he's got to stop all this and
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:26.520]  that's a good point that's why they don't want us on air so callers can't call in like this
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:34.040]  i forgot you're right iran through dubai which is uh sheite they own a big part of those hotels
[2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:38.600]  and they're in bebed soros who notice once the iran deal and they'll let iran get nukes
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:44.360]  that just shows the soros is just so damn evil um and that's a great point i mean i think we should
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:49.880]  we should call for trump to investigate that and uh if the gaming commission won't do it have
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:56.520]  the fbi do it let's throw the iranians out of los vegas see how they like that uh saudi arabia
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:02.360]  owns the four seasons hotel they're in mandalay bay so you know they're they're part of it
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:10.360]  them too except saudi arabia is not actively trying right now to overthrow the united states
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:17.000]  sure sure uh also i had a big argument with google about how they're trying to take away

[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:43.000]  jameson teddy brandon matthew richard shon i gotta get to all those calls that's it just
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:47.720]  you got those ones it's taken over but all these calls are awesome i talked to you all for 30
[2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:53.000]  minutes but we got to move quick yuki in texas wants to talk about storming area 51 let me tell
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.120]  you something if i tried to have a facebook page about a demonstration at the white house they'd
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:02.360]  ban it if you tried that they'd do it believe it we've had folks behind the scenes do it but what
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:07.000]  somebody says we're gonna have a million people assault and break federal law and invade a secret
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:13.080]  compound facebook leaves it up they are testing facebook was designed to overthrow countries they
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:19.400]  ran the arab spring i think this is seriously criminal what's going on and it shows uh they're
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:26.280]  serious bias yuki in the great state of texas what do you think uh thanks for taking my call alex
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:32.360]  yeah i absolutely agree with you i was watching the um the conference where zuckerberg was talking
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:39.000]  about banning yourself an info ward and he's talking about how their speech policy is there to stop
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:45.160]  anything that's dangerous and i think that this area 51 thing is completely dangerous especially
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:49.880]  with a lot of the delusional people out there and you know i think the last time i checked they had
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:56.760]  1.9 million scheduled to go another 1.2 i think interested and even if it's a fraction of those
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:35:03.000]  people try to unlawfully storm you know a military base that could lead to some really big problems
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:08.360]  and i think that's dangerous and you know it just shows the hypocrisy of how facebook is really
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:12.440]  you know not for free speech and they're they're actually allowing something dangerous and i think
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:21.240]  it's a really bad uh recipe for disaster well you're absolutely right and again area 51 got
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:26.440]  popularized by art bell that's fine it's all cute there's a whole bunch of these bases and and it's
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:32.680]  it's come out what's there there's skunks work uh advanced uh space planes aircraft are there the
[2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:39.160]  b2 bomber was there before it was ever announced in 1989 and they've got a lot of other things
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:45.000]  that are at the base but just because transformer movies you know claim that the cube is there and
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:50.840]  cybertron none of that's true it's a secret military base and they're saying we're gonna
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:57.880]  have a million people attack it and facebook's leaving that up this is all a giant test but
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:05.160]  since you raised that let's play a clip of the creator of storm area 51 movement fears event
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:12.280]  could lead to military base slaughter but it's still up and facebook's letting it happen here it is
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:17.320]  good deal it started out and just from a pier stroke of imagination it's just
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:20.280]  meant to be funny i want to do something cool out there now that we have a bunch of people
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:24.760]  but i don't want anybody to get hurt maddie roberts created the viral event that's taken the internet
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:31.080]  by storm more than 1.7 million people on facebook have expressed interest to get into area 51 one
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:36.520]  of the most secure and highly protected pieces of property on the plant where lethal force can be
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:40.760]  used on trespassers here so i'm kind of worried about that i've had a couple people deem the page
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:44.600]  where they're like i'm willing to die for the government let's do this and i'm just like oh
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:49.960]  my god bud robert says the whole stormy the gates idea was really more of a joke he has other plans
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:55.080]  for the masses that may show up on september 20th it's not going to be like a military base slaughter
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:59.640]  it'll actually be something really fun educational maybe music and art that's what i'm working on
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:06.040]  the tiny town of rachel levada population of just 56 people is preparing for the unknown
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:12.360]  it's sad because they're going to pull resources and people you know sheriff's department and highway
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:19.080]  patrol that need to be in places and military will be here i'm sure military will be here locals
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:23.880]  worry about having enough food water and shelter for the hundreds and potentially thousands of people
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:30.680]  who want to see what secrets area 51 is hiding they're not going to get on site you know it's
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:35.880]  not going to happen roberts admits he's a little out there just like his idea and now his event has
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:41.400]  captured the imagination and fueled the fascination of one of the most mysterious places in the
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:49.640]  universe joe bartels 13 action news so they're saying coming up what's the date august 17th
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:55.400]  the memory serves a million people are going to storm this and all it is is a secret aircraft base
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:38:00.120]  and a toxic waste dump there's a whole bunch of these but because it's been hyped up i always get
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:05.720]  like oh tell about area 51 i never talked about area 51 folks i talk about real things that are
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:12.280]  going on but again they're saying a million of us are going to storm this and facebook's let
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:19.000]  them hype this let them push this the guy is wearing a japanese animation uniform this is
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:27.960]  zuckerberg making it a joke that oh you can organize storming the white house oh the pentagon
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:33.400]  and they're all making it a joke so when it happens for real the pentagon doesn't get involved this
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:39.960]  is zuckerberg who overthrew major countries and turned it over al-qaeda and isis testing right now
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:47.560]  he thinks we're idiots what do you think yuki in texas i absolutely agree with you i think that
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:52.600]  it's pretty blatant what they're doing i mean the guy who started this thing he even has a store up
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:57.960]  there he's making money off t-shirts and all this stuff and he talks about in that in that news
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:03.000]  interview of him talking about how he wanted to be peaceful but yet he's talking about uh
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:07.960]  you know i'm not sure how familial people are with anime and stuff you know i'm half japanese so
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:12.200]  i've seen anime but anyways the Naruto running he's talking about people literally running through
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:17.720]  and storming a military facility and you know that's unlawful and that's that's well sure let's
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:24.120]  be clear well this guy's a useful idiot or not this is totally staged facebook will ban anybody you
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:30.680]  know trying to create any type of page that's political unless it's left us this is totally
[2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:36.120]  about making it a joke so no one sees what's happening and then preparing it for mass attacks
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:41.000]  and it won't be error 51 will be the white house god bless you yuki people see through this though
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:46.840]  so good luck globalist your whole area 51 plan is about preparing people to storm the white house
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:53.480]  it's about making it a joke seeming get away with it so other accounts get made fun of and other
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:40:00.200]  accounts to storm the you know the what's left the world trade center the new world trade center
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:05.960]  to storm the impart states building or storm the sears tower or storm the white house or
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:12.600]  and by the time you're not watching zuckerberg's got it and he's ready because that's what this is
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:18.200]  all about is his 2.4 billion members carrying out violence remember two weeks ago they said
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:23.080]  you're only allowed to carry out violence and preparation for murder against alex jones paul
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:31.080]  watson and five other people once you accept that then it's everybody they have face recognition
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:36.680]  like it's like a pokemon where you get prizes looking for the little pokemon you got prizes
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:42.120]  in a hunter killer looking for who you're gonna kill now that's 10 years from now but this is all
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:49.400]  the prototype of that what do you want to storm oh we let everybody do it it's fun it's cute it's
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:59.240]  a little but none of it has to do with that they know exactly what they're doing make no mistake
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:04.760]  they left that up there because they want to normalize the idea of facebook organizing the
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:12.040]  storming of government buildings because of preparing an army of violent lsd heads okay
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:17.320]  brayden in louisiana thanks for holding you're a trooper you're on the air go ahead
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:23.560]  hey alex um yeah thanks for getting my name right i think i'm saying it wrong but yeah
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:27.240]  actually brayden well when you got a brain as small as mine and i'm looking to think 20 feet
[2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:31.400]  away i apologize i got it wrong but we just burnt some time getting the name wrong i got it right
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:37.160]  the third time so that's what matters yeah thanks no problem and uh yeah i wanted to get into you
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:44.120]  know just the deeper level of this you know it's it's a spiritual bore um like if you listen to what
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:48.920]  nicolette tesla said i mean in my opinion he's definitely one of you know the greatest scientists
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:54.040]  that ever lived in the 20th century one of his famous one of his famous quotes that always
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:42:01.000]  you know try to dig deeper in is to understand the universe think in terms of vibration frequency
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:07.800]  and energy and the deeper level that i'm trying to get to is you know what they're all they're
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:12.200]  doing with the vaccines and fluoride and know why you're trying to hit hard on the iodine

[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:22.040]  reveals bizarre eye surgery claim leaving experts baffled
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:29.800]  and if you look at elon musk and all these guys oh worry about ai gods watch out for ai oh i've
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:36.840]  got a wires i want to put in your brain you're going to be in such ecstasy when i watched his
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:42.360]  i don't know whatever it was 30 something mini promo about this with executives from his company
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:48.920]  they all look like they're on hardcore drugs i mean they're like sweating their eyes are like
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:55.560]  lit up like i mean they look nuts you know when somebody's on drugs and one of the crew members
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:03.000]  said maybe they've already got this whole neuro link group of wires hooks in their brain because
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:09.560]  this pkd pointed out philip k dick back in the 70s the cyberpunk future is where you can get any
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:14.600]  type of pleasure you want just plug in but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:22.040]  you just die because you just plug all this in and it's the matrix and now the matrix is here
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:28.840]  and you look at tim cook and you look at any of these guys they'll be under white lights can somebody
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:35.080]  zoom in on my eye maybe with camera seven we need some closer cameras like i'm in here underneath
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:42.680]  bright lights and my pupils are very little yeah zoom in if you can and my pupils are tiny because
[2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:51.320]  i'm not on drugs i've had two cups of coffee today but if you look at my pupils maybe somebody
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:54.520]  come in with a phone take a picture of it and i can show people a phone here i'll do it on my
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:50:00.040]  home phone where's my phone at i don't know where my phone is i had a phone here earlier
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:04.040]  but maybe one way or the other i get this done let me borrow somebody else's phone i'll do it that
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:09.480]  way so i don't know where my phone's at here it is all right i'll do this way so i'll take a photo
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:14.840]  no i got it handled because i'm gonna override this you know matt dredge had one piece of advice
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:20.680]  for me was here like three years ago he said you need to get a closer shot that's what everybody
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:26.520]  wants is personal shots and we never got it maybe i'll just cancel the show till that happens because
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:35.400]  it's i'm not mad get to understand that we get a lot of stuff done around here but certain things
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:41.160]  cannot be done and will not be done so here let me show you my pupils okay the only way i can do
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:48.520]  it is take a photo and then have a camera above do this okay document cam shot please look at this
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:53.480]  look at this defeat of the technology i'm having a major victory right now document cam shot please
[2:50:54.440 --> 2:51:01.480]  or we can't do it i understand now that's my pupils ladies and gentlemen okay that's my pupils
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:07.640]  you look at tim cook or elon musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage
[2:51:07.640 --> 2:51:15.240]  their pupils are 90 open zuckerberg all of them these people are either have brain chips
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:19.800]  or they're on hardcore drugs the only thing i think they've already you know i talked to
[2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:24.280]  pentagon years ago about how they already had special forces 15 years ago getting brain chips
[2:51:24.280 --> 2:51:31.880]  to interface with weapon systems and things but that's it these guys are wire heads something's
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:40.040]  going on because i'm under white lights and my my pupils are little they're supposed to close
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:47.960]  under white light under blue light document cam shot again please look at that
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:51.800]  tiny
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:00.840]  that's what happens under the sun or under bright lights but not these guys they're all under lights
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.880]  and if we can't show elon musk and his assistants from the report
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:11.720]  record up we'll play we'll play rhesus report because i'm on a roll here of victory everything
[2:52:11.720 --> 2:52:18.520]  up it just it's all happening so let's go ahead and queue this up let's go ahead and queue up the
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:27.160]  pc did on elon musk joining the dark side elon musk joining the anti-human coalition
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:32.680]  so you can see for if you're a tv viewer how drugged out of their minds they are
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.480]  are and maybe we'll superimpose some of the interviews with these guys under white lights
[2:52:37.480 --> 2:52:41.640]  and this would be a major investigation you know they admit silicon valley is into hardcore
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:50.520]  speed and elusogens they're taking ivy drips at work of dmt they're taking lsd micro doses and
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:56.280]  a psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day and they're the ones telling us we're going to merge
[2:52:56.280 --> 2:53:03.400]  with ai gods while they sweat on stage and their eyes are like saucers who in the hell would want
[2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:13.080]  to join with these people why would anybody want to be part of something led by these folks here
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:21.240]  is the greg race report with companies like vera chip we have been hearing about implantable
[2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:27.240]  computer chips for over a decade the latest office innovation is a micro chip implanted in
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:32.520]  the skin this is the first american company to ever try this so what are they tracking and would
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:37.800]  you say yes if your boss asks you to do the same and while we have been conditioned over the years
[2:53:37.800 --> 2:53:44.200]  to accept the idea of an implantable chip elon musk has been warning us of the dangers of
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:51.560]  artificial intelligence or ai i'm really quite close to i'm very close to the cutting edge in ai
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:58.920]  and it scares the hell out of me i try to convince people to slow down slow down ai slow down
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:10.440]  this was futile i tried for years oh oh see it's futile with ai is the one that seems
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:19.640]  like probably the best for us yes like if you if you can't beat it join it oh that's like the
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:26.840]  and who controls you link is to create a high band with interface hit pause the brain
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:31.480]  make a little bit you can't beat it so put wires in your head that it controls because then it'll
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:36.920]  be really nice to you let it put a kill switch right in your brain says elon you can just see
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:42.760]  this guy from the beginning oh he's your friendly guy fighting it now he rolls it out you go back
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:47.640]  and see all of it it's the promotion of it it's the pushing of it it's the preparation of it here you
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:56.920]  go face to the brain such that we can be symbolic with ai one thing is for sure we will not control it
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:02.600]  the pause again successfully oh no one will control the ai not those that built it not
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:08.440]  those that run it what a load of crap he's just inducing you to let him put wires in your head
[2:55:08.440 --> 2:55:14.920]  so he can rule your ass like zuckerberg and the vr on their heads and all of them have got those
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:24.200]  giant pupils because they've been there and they ain't coming back let's continue sure we will not
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:33.080]  control it after successfully testing it back it up you will be assimilated resistances futile you
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:37.560]  will not control it and he goes on to say it won't control your brain at first but soon it will
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:45.240]  he's literally pre-programming you to submit and bow down like he's done no he's not submitting to it
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:50.920]  he's always been part of it and you can see it all now what a sick joke it is and him and his
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:58.040]  his whacked out executives you're about to see who don't have brain chips they're hoping brain
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:56:05.240]  chips can do it and keep them high these are drug addicts and they want the hit of wires in their
[2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:12.360]  brains and they want to test it on you because it doesn't work because it's crap they've tested it on
[2:56:12.360 --> 2:56:17.080]  hundreds of thousands of apes and monkeys they've tested on prisoners they've tested on us troops
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:23.560]  and now they want you to come and ask for it because you're so stupid but you're not stupid
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:29.400]  let's go back to Elon Musk so the brain such that we can be
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:37.240]  symbolic with AI one thing is for sure we will not control it after successfully testing you
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:43.640]  know it falls again a monkey we'll come back and play all of it we'll be symbiotic symbiotic means
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:48.680]  I help you you help me no the phones and the computers all make us dumb they give us cancer
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:56.200]  they make us alone it's not symbiotic Elon Musk and what's this about your girlfriend
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:05.720]  his 31 year old born Claire Elsie Bocher made the startling revelation opposed to promote her
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:12.360]  collaboration with Adidas the singer claims she made the polymer herself in the lab and Grimes
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:18.040]  described her training regime as 360 approach which involves 2.4 hours a day in a deprivation
[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:23.240]  tank which allows her to astro glide to other dimensions and taking a plethora of supplements
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:30.280]  to maximize the function of my mitochondria yeah this is a dna force plus Grimes also claims she
[2:57:30.920 --> 2:57:35.960]  filtered her studio with the highest grade of red light which she likens to scream there for 25
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:43.320]  minutes while boiling honey tea and it goes into the surgery he's doing on her eye let's go
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:48.680]  let's talk to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey Alex yeah I just
[2:57:48.680 --> 2:57:52.840]  wanted to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot of people here out in New
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:57:57.640]  York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:02.440]  the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:07.400]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it I mean
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:11.080]  if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I think he could be
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:15.080]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:19.320]  last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:23.960]  have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love to see what
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:28.520]  you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:33.800]  you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:38.200]  continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:43.880]  your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[2:58:46.600 --> 2:58:51.800]  Alex yes I got a plug for the Patriot points I get oh thanks I got 180 dollars so far this year
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:55.880]  and I feel like I'm stealing from you I buy so much in this store because I mean I don't want to
[2:58:55.880 --> 2:58:59.000]  get that money to Walmart I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:02.840]  causes I don't believe in so I'd rather give that money to you and they're getting quality products
[2:59:02.840 --> 2:59:07.720]  the products that I do receive have changed my life I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me I've
[2:59:07.720 --> 2:59:12.520]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better I mean my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to
[2:59:12.520 --> 2:59:16.840]  get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[2:59:16.840 --> 2:59:21.720]  throat well sir let me break this down for you I want high quality stuff in there I want a good price
[2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:26.440]  but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off I'm making two
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:30.760]  dollars on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:35.320]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the Patriot points a
[2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:39.400]  lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10% off because you're
[2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:43.800]  on auto ship then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that where you have Patriot
[2:59:43.800 --> 2:59:51.400]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:59:51.400 --> 2:59:55.400]  show
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:11.240]  so from the front here is Elon Musk selling you on a company putting wires into your brain to
[3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:15.880]  control what you do and selling it how sexy and cool it is I kept interrupting it but here it is
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:25.240]  with companies like Vera chip we have been hearing about implantable computer chips for over a decade
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:31.240]  the latest office innovation is a microchip implanted in the skin this is the first American
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:36.040]  company to ever try this so what are they tracking and would you say yes if your boss asked you to
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:42.040]  do the same and while we have been conditioned over the years to accept the idea of an implantable chip
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:47.960]  Elon Musk has been warning us of the dangers of artificial intelligence so we trust him
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:55.480]  or AI I'm really quite close to I'm very close to the cutting edge in AI and it scares the hell out
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:01:05.000]  of me I try to convince people to slow down slow down AI to regulate AI this was putile
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:12.120]  well I tried for years you didn't try crap push the whole thing with AI is the one that seems
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:21.560]  like probably the best like for us yes like if you if you can't beat it join it that's like the
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:27.000]  a bunch of psychiatrists got together they said how do we fool kids to take this high band with
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:34.680]  interface so this is it such that we can be symbolic with AI one thing is for sure we will
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:41.800]  not control it after successfully testing neurolink on a monkey that made a monkey has been able to
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:47.320]  control the computer with his brain I predict Elon will be dead from a drug overdose within five years
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:53.560]  is ready to begin implanting his technology on humans as early as next year the neurons of
[3:01:53.560 --> 3:01:59.000]  your brain connect to form a large network through axon dendrite junctions called synapses
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:05.240]  at these connection points neurons communicate with each other using chemical signals called
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:12.360]  neurotransmitters neurotransmitters are released from the end of an axon in response to an electrical
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:19.400]  spike called an action potential action potentials produce an electric field that spreads from the
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:24.360]  neuron and can be detected by placing electrodes nearby but they show you a recording of the
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:29.160]  improvement how electrochemical works and then I just go oh look at me he's put wires in there
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:36.200]  oh strands of electrodes that will be inserted into the brain by a specialized robot the chip
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:43.000]  will act as a sensor affixed to the skull and an interface device will be placed behind the ear
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:51.080]  the device will be controlled with an iphone app elon musk tells us that his technology will not
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:57.400]  take full control of our brain at least at first iphone and all this will will occur actually
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:03.960]  and quite slowly um so do an exercise that it's not going to be like suddenly look at his eyes
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:07.800]  neural link will have this incredible neural ace and start taking over that guy's bomb
[3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:16.760]  it will take a long time it's laughing and the neural link team is clear that the device is designed
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:22.920]  to put information into the brain um the system even in version one that we're this is a roll
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:29.160]  on it what they've been preparing for 50 years people of a thousand times more electrodes than
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:36.520]  the uh the best system out there and they're all read and write my team focuses on building chips
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:42.040]  and systems to get neural signals as high as a kite out of the brain and also to put information
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:46.200]  into the way to do the next guy you can't hear only want to read information out of the brain
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:50.360]  we want to be able to put it back into the brain now to some of you that may seem a little bit
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:54.760]  fantastic homicidal maniac information into the brain but actually the the basic building
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:04:00.920]  box of that technology are already there including having control over the body and our speech
[3:04:02.200 --> 3:04:08.280]  according to elon neural link is a way for mankind to merge with artificial intelligence
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:16.440]  like to put this to my brain ultimately sound like a meth head this again sound pretty weird but
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:22.200]  that's so high sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence big deal
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:29.640]  oh this is not a mandatory thing um oh it's not mandatory you can choose to have if you're laughing
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:37.960]  but i think even in a benign ai scenario we will be left behind um and so well leave us behind
[3:04:37.960 --> 3:04:43.720]  then it is a benign scenario with a high band with brain machine interface i think we can
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:47.800]  actually go along for the ride oh and we can be the cool club
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:52.680]  jill solent is coming up
[3:04:54.520 --> 3:04:58.600]  robert marrins what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies
[3:04:58.600 --> 3:05:02.600]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political
[3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:06.920]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts
[3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:11.080]  the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:14.440]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[3:05:14.440 --> 3:05:18.680]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[3:05:18.680 --> 3:05:22.600]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:26.920]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:31.720]  recover after the great depression the informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[3:05:31.720 --> 3:05:36.920]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[3:05:36.920 --> 3:05:41.800]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating
[3:05:41.800 --> 3:05:45.720]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts
[3:05:45.720 --> 3:05:49.800]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[3:05:49.800 --> 3:06:05.720]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw
[3:06:05.720 --> 3:06:19.480]  you know the top nazi verner von brawn wrote a 1959 book
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:28.040]  or 1949 book i won't remember here called project mars where the elons are the aliens
[3:06:28.040 --> 3:06:35.400]  moving up taking over the earth well that sun is high and that texas sky i'll be watching elon
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:41.880]  musk with his big old saucer eyes on hardcore drugs probably got chips in his brain he's a wirehead
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:49.080]  right out of philip k dick's vision he's telling me that i'll be fulfilled as soon as i let his
[3:06:49.080 --> 3:06:56.920]  company run wires in my brain and he tells me i won't be fulfilled till i do it you mean i won't
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:07:03.560]  be allowed on trains and planes i won't be able to get a job is why i won't be fulfilled no it's
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:08.520]  going to be the slaves that have the wires in their brains it's to be the free humans that don't
[3:07:09.640 --> 3:07:14.840]  but long before that ever happens elon musk will end up dying of a drug overdose
[3:07:16.200 --> 3:07:23.400]  i wish you no harm but elon musk is nothing but a towards soros husk out there promoting death
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:31.880]  on my mind he's not george straight there's no brain chip needed for this she's got to be a texan
[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:43.000]  i don't need a wire to connect to god from san june everything that i got thing that i got
[3:07:44.040 --> 3:07:46.520]  is just what i got on
[3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:53.720]  i ain't got a dime but what i got he wear the elon
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:56.920]  and the elon invasion
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:03.320]  dr warner von braun wonder what he knew
[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:13.320]  this is all just humanities testing it's our graduation test here ladies and gentlemen
[3:08:13.320 --> 3:08:17.240]  you know i said i take a lot of calls i had to take a lot of calls i want drill salante who's
[3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:23.160]  ready to go they'll take over here soon uh don't forget we have 50 off on all the great iodine
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:30.120]  products like x2 and x3 50 off dna force that makes it very close to cost the very best telomere
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:36.840]  support energy support just nerve support overall stamina everything in there's award winning
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:43.000]  dna force plus and force where i come but let's go ahead and talk to matthew in georgia
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:50.280]  matthew thanks for holding you're on the air go ahead hey alex how you doing i'm doing good
[3:08:50.280 --> 3:08:54.760]  i'm just wondering what what old elon and tim cook are on many they'll be out the sun they'll
[3:08:54.760 --> 3:08:58.760]  end the camera those boys look like they're unlike i know folks have taken i've seen people
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:02.680]  take like three hits of acid their eyes aren't that big their peoples aren't that big what the
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:10.600]  what the hell are they on they're on that uh that ketamine is what it looks like to me
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:16.600]  but hey alex yes um when are you going back on rogan
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:21.880]  you know joe has admitted it was the biggest podcast she ever did the second largest is
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:28.040]  me too third is elon musk and uh i don't know i mean i don't think joe wants to lose his monetization
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:33.480]  and uh you know i think joe had me almost good so i'm not mad at joe don't have me back on but
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:36.920]  when you're number one you don't get back on that's how it works when you win the
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:41.480]  indy 500 you get last place when the horse wins all three races they don't get triple crown
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:47.320]  you know when something works is when you don't get it kind of like america america works so we
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:54.840]  can't have it see how that works i do and i think joe has been compromised by um big tech
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:10:01.640]  and uh speaking of big tech i've been uh censored myself today i bet um there was a
[3:10:01.640 --> 3:10:11.080]  congress congresswoman in georgia um she's unfortunately in my district and um
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:22.200]  she said a white man told her to get out the um express aisle uh last night she was crying on film
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:27.000]  i don't know if you saw the i did i meant to get to it it was like it's to do jessie smollett
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.800]  and the guy shows up and she says i'm gonna arrest you you're going to and again and she
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:39.880]  acts like what he said she did alex exactly like i i literally commented on the post because it was
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:48.360]  on my local news on facebook and i commented on it and i said uh shaking my head smh um this is
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:56.360]  another jessie smollett and within two or three minutes i got a notification saying i've been banned
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:05.160]  for 30 days over this and all that's all i said i didn't use any profanity i didn't use nothing
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:10.600]  well no that shows it's all ai it's all pre-programmed she's a member of the legislature she comes out
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:14.920]  with a race crime like smollett they're gonna manage this where you're not allowed to say hey
[3:11:14.920 --> 3:11:19.160]  this looks fake by the way she comes to the press conference and gets in his face and says you're
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:25.880]  going to jail here it is you don't need anything at all because you've graded me and you've graded
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:31.080]  me and everybody needs to see your face on camera yes i know it's on camera and everybody needs to
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:36.280]  know that you what you did to me and what you did to me as a woman that is nine months pregnant
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:43.800]  and you think you're going to get away with this no you're not you are going to jail so yeah i have
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:48.600]  followed that the man's challenging the video to be released he just said hey lady you're in the
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:54.040]  whatever lane she got in his face he called her a lazy bitch but she says he shouldn't have done but
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:58.280]  he didn't say get out of here and all the racist stuff she said now i think the footage is going
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:05.960]  to get released she's been lying the whole time man i've been reading local news and and it's
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:13.400]  ridiculous man and i gotta say uh to the audience when alex says he's the tip of the spear this is
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:20.040]  the tip of the spear this is the last we got people please this is all we got if we lose alex and
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:29.160]  info wars not just alex because they're this big crew behind them we're screwed well brother i mean
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:34.280]  i think if we if we let info wars go down they know that he'd get everybody and and beyond that
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:40.760]  it's beyond just financially supporting us that's important if people just word of mouth say hey alex
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:47.000]  jones is still on info wars dot com news wars dot com people can go remember to websites and hear
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:51.720]  the show god bless you i appreciate your call matthew okay let's go to ed in texas ed thanks
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:58.440]  for holding her on the air go ahead sir hi alex i called originally just to say two things and
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:03.480]  of course i have many more to say go ahead but i think one of the most important things is we we
[3:13:03.480 --> 3:13:10.600]  look with co-opting language language is how we control and see our reality no other animal
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:17.160]  on the planet uses language to understand to understand its reality that's right they just
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:23.480]  use like smell and the wind and what they see we use coded yeah so i think we need to start
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:29.080]  co-opting language that the other side is using and one of the words we should co-opt is antifa
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:37.880]  so america should have antifa 2.0 which stands for america's not american not taking institutional
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:44.760]  fascism anymore if the police sit by doing nothing if the mayors say not to do nothing
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:52.600]  that's institutional fascism so that's what we have to do just co-op their language take control
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:14:00.120]  of it i think uh the word squad is very useful for us because the squad is actually four people
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:07.000]  that are the nucleus which there's the language squad stands for socialist quacks undermining
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:13.160]  american democracy i just play with language i love it socials quacks undermining american
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:21.560]  democracy so we have to do that we have to control control the language and by changing what people
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:30.280]  say that's how we do it the let me put my reading glasses on um one of the reasons you're dangerous
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:35.640]  sir is not because it's not because you've been on for 30 years it's because you cover all of the
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:41.160]  bases one you give us information two you give the people who want to be sergeants corporals
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:46.360]  lieutenants whatever they are in let's say an army the advertisement we put on your shirts we go out
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:52.600]  to the world we do more than the rest not in a different way but all aspects are needed all points
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:58.360]  of a triangle build the triangle so the reality is there's people who listen to you they think like
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:03.160]  you and they want to give us the high five fine that's a private the corporal the sergeant lieutenant
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:08.760]  they put on your gear they buy your stuff then we have the fact that you actually teach us the
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:13.800]  nutrition when we have the nutrition that's the officers they have the ability to think
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:20.760]  and extrapolate when you start cleaning up the environment think of a dirty aquarium we're in
[3:15:20.760 --> 3:15:26.360]  a dirty aquarium you've given us everything to clean up our own aquarium and that's why you're
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:33.720]  dangerous sir you give the heat you give us the ability to clarify ourselves to understand what
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:38.200]  you're saying well below the day brother because i believe in you like i believe in myself and we're
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:44.200]  all god's children in this epic fight and we're all under globalist attack and humanity is fighting
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:48.920]  back and it's beautiful but all of you are dangerous to tyrants sorry to tim and james said
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:54.920]  i tried my best calling back tomorrow jose lente takes over right now when you have a pain in the
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:16:02.280]  neck a real pain in the neck back shoulder or legs you now have two convenient choices to get fast

[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.960]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:06.680]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:11.720]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[3:18:11.720 --> 3:18:16.440]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:20.040]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:23.960]  defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and

[3:20:13.560 --> 3:20:16.760]  all right folks alex jones here i wasn't going to be here but i was talking to
[3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:20.120]  jeralt as an old friend of mine i really respect he's been on the show like 15 years
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:25.240]  top trends forecaster and i've never told jeralt what to say on there i've never gotten
[3:20:25.240 --> 3:20:29.640]  in i've never impeded what he's talking about i think he's a good libertarian you know patriot
[3:20:29.640 --> 3:20:34.920]  whatever you want to call him we have liberals we have conservatives on i don't control what
[3:20:34.920 --> 3:20:40.200]  yes say that that's their own statement uh but uh you know jeralt's like hey and he said i could
[3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:44.200]  say this and get in our private conversation i'm about to tear into trump because i'm sick of all
[3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:50.280]  this war stuff i said by all means go ahead and do it we're not running a cult here i get really
[3:20:50.280 --> 3:20:54.360]  mad when he attacked syria that second time it turned out that was a fake chemical attack
[3:20:54.360 --> 3:20:59.560]  turned out it was staged uh so i think we should keep you know trump's feet to the fire
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:05.000]  so you way better than hillary absolutely but the only way he doesn't launch all these wars
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:08.520]  he's trying to get us out of afghanistan syria you name it he's pretty much done it
[3:21:08.520 --> 3:21:16.760]  he's by keeping his feet to the fire uh but yeah uh this iran situation uh is very serious because
[3:21:16.760 --> 3:21:21.720]  the british have been grabbing their ships now they're grabbing theirs uh and uh you know they're
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:28.440]  here's the article us is staging troops at the key sodding military base that is used during all
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:36.520]  of our previous middle east wars and so i do not some of my scribblings here uh i do not want to
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:42.520]  see this happen so so yeah gerald uh knock yourself out man i respect you you're a smart guy you're not
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:46.920]  like some fake leftist who's against war when a republican does it but for war when a democrat
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:51.400]  does it you're a consistent guy and uh you know i think one of the achilles heels trump has is the
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:58.280]  economy that they're trying to plunge and uh war and you know things like that so i definitely would
[3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:03.480]  rather not see a war with iran but the neocons are bad but you know the iranians got their own
[3:22:03.480 --> 3:22:08.280]  screwball stuff going on so my whole point is you know they're they're escalating some things too
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:12.920]  because i think their economy's imploding but go ahead and give us your take i'll be watching well
[3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:18.280]  you know it's uh first of all you know i'm not a liberal i'm not a libertarian i'm not a progressive
[3:22:18.280 --> 3:22:23.960]  you're a political atheist i'm a political atheist but more than that i am an american
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:32.440]  i believe in the declaration of independence and constitution and i don't need anybody in a
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:40.440]  robe that calls themselves a judge to tell me how to interpret it i am an american i'm not a
[3:22:40.440 --> 3:22:47.560]  dumbo crap i'm not a repulsive ken i abide by the constitution and live for what this country
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:52.360]  stands for and as you know i bought the most historic buildings in the most historic four
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:59.080]  corners in america to launch occupy peace i was looking to leave the country one time back in 2010
[3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:04.600]  because i saw disgust with obama and all the crap and after traveling around the world a lot as i
[3:23:04.600 --> 3:23:10.600]  have i realized there's no place to run and hide to this is my country i couldn't be me if i was
[3:23:10.600 --> 3:23:17.400]  born in vika quence or uh at the velia pina i'm me because i'm a napolitano born in the Bronx i had
[3:23:17.400 --> 3:23:22.520]  the freedom to be who i wanted to be and now i have all these people trying to take my freedom away
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:29.320]  from me that's why i bought these buildings where the seeds of democracy was sown again this is the
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:35.240]  third dutch settlement the courthouse right over here right over my shoulder john j the supreme
[3:23:35.240 --> 3:23:41.080]  court judge was a judge over there when they wrote the constitution for new york state when
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  this is the first capital and all the 80 percent of america's constitution comes from that constitution
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:54.680]  so journey truth the woman that was a slave that brought her way out of slavery with her boss
[3:23:55.880 --> 3:24:01.720]  and he abided by the deal but then he took her son and sent her to alabama to another
[3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:10.120]  slave on she walked into that courthouse her trial was her and she won that's where i am
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:18.360]  where the seeds of democracy was sown and that's why i fight to be a true american i don't need
[3:24:18.360 --> 3:24:26.280]  anybody to tell me how to interpret the constitution and i don't need a bunch of freaks called congressmen
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:34.440]  and congresswomen rewriting the constitution to let the president take us to war the congress
[3:24:34.440 --> 3:24:41.000]  is the only one by the constitution that has the right to take us to go to war they have not voted
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:48.680]  to go to war since world war two the editority to give the president a mf view what are you talking
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:56.120]  about wow there may be a crisis in the president this guy doesn't speak for me and by the way neither
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:25:01.400]  does congress i want to referendum on each state ballot where we the people will tell them how to
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:08.120]  vote to go to war and that's one of the principles of occupied peace dot com so when i say i'm talking
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:17.240]  out about trump i've had it with this war crap games over fights on no more nothing has been
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:25.880]  accomplished show me one benefit one benefit from the war with afghanistan the longest war in american

[3:31:57.480 --> 3:32:01.400]  but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five
[3:32:01.400 --> 3:32:05.800]  six years ago before all the censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about
[3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:09.640]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on
[3:32:09.640 --> 3:32:13.640]  our experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to
[3:32:13.640 --> 3:32:17.080]  really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:19.960]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has
[3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:25.480]  headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no
[3:32:25.480 --> 3:32:31.480]  under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they
[3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:35.400]  have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by
[3:32:35.400 --> 3:32:39.800]  them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[3:32:39.800 --> 3:32:43.720]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[3:32:43.720 --> 3:32:50.200]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest infowarstore.com or triple eight

[3:42:57.720 --> 3:43:02.920]  thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed
[3:43:02.920 --> 3:43:07.320]  by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.880]  being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[3:43:11.880 --> 3:43:17.480]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[3:43:17.480 --> 3:43:21.720]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:26.440]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press
[3:43:26.440 --> 3:43:30.520]  they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been blocked by big
[3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:35.160]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:40.360]  views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:44.920]  that the uh that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:49.400]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:58.680]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth info wars the most banned network in the world

[3:45:10.840 --> 3:45:15.000]  we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one of the biggest places that we
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:20.520]  neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:26.600]  taking the highest quality supplements from fourslife.com i couldn't do it that's why we decided to

[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:11.480]  we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but
[3:46:11.480 --> 3:46:15.160]  you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars
[3:46:15.160 --> 3:46:18.440]  that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to
[3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:23.400]  sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for
[3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:27.880]  six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored

[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:08.120]  was not put on this earth to follow orders do i listen do i follow great advice and you know it
[3:48:08.120 --> 3:48:15.240]  i got an ailment go see the doctor i believe in the doctor i follow what the doctor tells me to
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:22.120]  tell if i'm doing something that's not right having problems in what i'm doing and someone
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:29.720]  points out to me you might want to change this to that i listen don't tell me what to do i could
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:38.360]  think for myself i'm sick of this military mindset that's not my trip don't like getting dressed up
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:47.000]  in military dread don't want to do it ain't for me if somebody tries to attack my country i will
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:53.320]  be there on the front lines defending this place i will not go over to foreign countries
[3:48:53.320 --> 3:49:01.800]  and intervene in foreign entanglements i will protect the homeland and that's what i want to
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:09.000]  do with occupy peace bring home the troops stop enriching the military industrial complex
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:15.640]  that's the other thing i'm against trump with he's filling a swamp with people from the military
[3:49:15.640 --> 3:49:24.280]  industrial complex and the other big businesses bring in we the people secure the homeland with
[3:49:24.280 --> 3:49:31.000]  the troops put them to work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure you go overseas and come back here
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:39.320]  it's a joke force congress to vote to go to war it's they have not done since world war two
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:46.120]  and a referendum on each state ballot where we the people will tell congress how to vote
[3:49:46.680 --> 3:49:54.200]  because we pay for the wars with our money in our lives not the senator's son maybe one
[3:49:58.280 --> 3:50:04.600]  so i'm concerned about what's going on particularly about iran and i see more
[3:50:04.600 --> 3:50:13.000]  blow-ups happening in venezuela we cannot afford to get into a war the global economy is shaking
[3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:20.520]  i mentioned to you why gold prices are going up and you well know i was the first on june
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:27.240]  sixth of this year in our trend alert and on alex jones and with david night and with oan
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:36.200]  to call the gold bull run the major reason is all the cheap money the monetary method on
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:46.120]  this shoving into the system the second reason war people looking for safe havens ray dalio
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:55.480]  ray dalio the founder and head of bridgewater associates the biggest hedge fund in the world
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:51:03.080]  world came out last week and repeated almost word for word what i have written and spoken about
[3:51:03.080 --> 3:51:14.440]  regarding gold and then my tenth grade teacher excuse me uh elizabeth warren she reminds me
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:21.480]  my tenth grade teacher but wasn't the librarian running in the democratic side of the presidential
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:31.800]  reality show is warning about quote a chaotic economy it's happening i mentioned this because
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:38.040]  if we go to war and oil prices spike to about a hundred dollars a barrel kiss the economy goodbye
[3:51:38.680 --> 3:51:43.800]  kiss the equity markets goodbye and if war breaks out you might want to kiss your life goodbye
[3:51:44.920 --> 3:51:50.520]  you know i trucked in attack iran after they shot down that drone and it wasn't one of those little
[3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:55.320]  drones is what a hundred million to two hundred million dollar drone depending on whose numbers
[3:51:55.320 --> 3:52:04.360]  you're looking at sophisticated they shot this thing down he didn't shoot it they didn't retaliate
[3:52:04.360 --> 3:52:13.240]  because it's not syria it's not libya it's not iraq it's iran these are the persians
[3:52:13.240 --> 3:52:21.640]  it's been around for thousands of years i think about five thousand the best of my recollection
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:32.360]  they're not going anywhere they would have started blowing up it will look straight
[3:52:32.360 --> 3:52:38.120]  so far moves would have looked like pearl harbor they will retaliate and they had
[3:52:38.120 --> 3:52:49.080]  what right does the uk have to send soldiers in into their ship off the coast of gibraltar
[3:52:49.080 --> 3:52:53.720]  what the hell you're doing over there in gibraltar your english i thought the sun stopped setting on
[3:52:53.720 --> 3:53:03.960]  the british empire doesn't that belong to spain what right did they well we suspect them they
[3:53:03.960 --> 3:53:10.440]  were going to bring this url over to syria and that's against our e u sanctions so we could
[3:53:10.440 --> 3:53:17.240]  steal any ship that we want and we could make up any crap that we want and the propaganda media
[3:53:17.800 --> 3:53:25.800]  the prostitutes that get paid to put out by their corporate johns and other whore masters
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:34.360]  they propagandize it in a way that will make you hate the iranians
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:44.840]  extraordinarily brazen iran seizes tankers and straights of our moves raising tensions
[3:53:44.840 --> 3:53:51.800]  with britain oh they're extreme extraordinarily brazen this is cnbc last week
[3:53:51.800 --> 3:54:02.120]  uk was an extraordinarily brazen so who do they quote they quote some guy from a stink tank
[3:54:04.120 --> 3:54:09.080]  and you know all these stink tanks are paid for to put out their own version of propaganda
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:16.840]  this is an extraordinarily brazen step here this is taking tankers underway and forcing them into
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:22.600]  iranian waters and i think that's a highly provocative step it's something the iranians
[3:54:22.600 --> 3:54:29.400]  tried to do before when they tried to nab another british ship on the 10th of july but british wars

[3:58:57.320 --> 3:59:02.200]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[3:59:02.200 --> 3:59:07.080]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[3:59:07.080 --> 3:59:10.600]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other
