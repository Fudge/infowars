[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Music
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  News, Politics, Cover-ups, Government Corruption.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  You're listening to We the People Radio Network.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  WTPRN.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  I am known for sticking to principle and not flip flopping.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Yeah, we need a good man for presidency.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  I would guarantee that I would never abuse Haby's corpus.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  We want him to get the America we have in our head.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  The freedom message brings us together. It doesn't divide us.
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  I'll say, Rand Paul is here. Waking up people everywhere.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  Rand Paul is here. Making people be aware.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Rand Paul is here. The freedom message.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  Waking up people everywhere. Rand Paul is here. Defending liberty.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Both for the monologue next year. Is this a doctor in the house?
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  Is this a doctor in the house? Is this a doctor in the house?
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  Well Houston, we have a problem. We need Rand Paul to solve them.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  Houston, we have a problem. We need Rand Paul to solve them.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  Principle, the moral principle is that of defending liberty
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  and minimizing the scope of government.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  If you think the government has to take care of us from cradle to grave
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  and if you think our government should police the world
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  and spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a foreign policy that we cannot manage,
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  you can't get rid of the IRS. But if you want to lower taxes
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  and if you don't want the government to quit printing the money
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  to come up with shortfall and cause all the inflation,
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  you have to change policy.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  Is this a doctor in the house? Is this a doctor in the house?
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  Is this a doctor in the house?
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  It's a cold blue. Somebody ball out in ICU.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  They have a patient with them ripped into.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  That's the constitution with them ripped into.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  Did I miss the situation to fix it?
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  In Washington, we either prohibit it or subsidize it.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  And the market should deal with it and the state should deal with it.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  We print money for it, the value of the money goes down
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  and poor people pay higher prices. That is a tax.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  Wall Street is doing quite well, but the inflation tax is eating away
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  at the middle class of this country.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  We need to get rid of the inflation tax with sound money.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  He's the only man called a happy country.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  And when him come and help our Halloween people,
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  I know you'll have to vote for him.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  of all individuals, not the secrecy of government.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  We don't need a national ID card.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  The freedom message brings us together. It doesn't divide us.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  No, no, no. Run, Paul is here.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Happy people everywhere. Run, Paul is here.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  Making people be aware. Run, Paul is here.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  Bending liberty.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  I'll make a vote for you my next year. Run, Paul is here.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  The freedom message.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Making people be aware.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  I'm suggesting very strongly that we should have a foreign policy of non-intervention.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  I tried very hard to solve this problem before we went to war
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  by saying declare war if you want to go to war, go to war, fight it and win it.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  But don't get into it for political reasons or to enforce UN resolutions
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  or pretend the Eurekis were a national threat to us.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  Houston, we have a problem.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  We need run, Paul, to come, come, solve them.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  These days are not in the house.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  These days are not in the house.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  How am I supposed to do?
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  There's a patient in ICU.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  Man, the Constitution, where they're ripping through.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  We need run, Paul, to fix it back.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  That's true.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  With the resuscitation of the Constitution.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  The principle, the moral principle is that of defending liberty
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  and minimizing the scope of government.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  In the past school, we run, Paul, about run for the presidency.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  In the future, man, we have a call here.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  Mr. President, run, Paul, for the country.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  Make sure you vote for the man in a hobby.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  We talked about a humble foreign policy.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  No nation building.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Don't police the world.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  That is a conservative.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's a pro-American.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  It follows the founding fathers.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  And besides, it follows the Constitution.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  I would work very hard to protect the privacy of American citizens,
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  being very, very cautious about warrantless searches.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  Run, Paul, is here.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Making people be aware.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Run, Paul, is here.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Make sure you vote for the man next year.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Run, Paul, is here.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Helping people everywhere.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Run, Paul, is here.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  Making people be aware.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  There's every reason to believe that we have enough freedom
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  in this country to have freedom of expression.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  And that's what's important.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  We should never interfere with the Internet.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  That's why I've never voted to regulate the Internet,
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  even when there's the temptation to put bad things on the Internet.
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  Regulation of bad and good on the Internet should be done differently.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  Run, Paul, get up and run for us all.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Mr. President, Mr. Rampal, Paul.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  Three shoes per se.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  We are the Indoe Sea.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Man that we force the motion that we secondee.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  No, run, Paul.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  I run for presidency.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  A real patriot.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Man who way to help we.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Make it by confusion.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  A wedding, reaping tree.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  You know we's reputation could help we.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  And run, Paul.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  Make the government all you see.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Even federal government to fix them quickly.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  And make them know a lot.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Man, they can't rabwee.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  You know, see all them are rabwee with them damn tax money.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  And then the kind of thing Rampal now stand for.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  Man, the federal government, federal reserve is free.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  The federal reserve, man, he a go fixie.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  And make them know them can't miss a rabwee money.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  They can't pay to ocean.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  They say them put it back in hurry.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  Make a president run, Paul is ready.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  God, we chose to run, Paul, help we.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  We are fitting them and people come help we.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  Vote for the man as a presidency.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  Vote for him, Lord.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  Me say do we quickly.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  Put the pen, paper, ballot and your county.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  You get some college kids, volunteer the time you see.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  And put the paper, vote me say in front of we.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  In public view, man, we want our county.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  Not trust them, machine, run, Paul, they're crazy.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  Then we rip off election for Malawi cause Rampal is here.
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  Depending liberty.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Make your vote for him, Lord, next year.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  I'm Ron Paul and you're listening to We The People Radio Network.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  Trishewspassie with a brand new release.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  Trishewspassie.com, check us out.
[06:34.000 --> 07:02.000]  People keep on listening.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  Here's Alex Jones.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Hello, my friends.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  Thank you for joining us on this June 22nd, 2008 live edition.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  I do syndicated radio six days a week, Monday through Friday for four hours.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  From 11 to 3 p.m. Central.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  Then back with this abbreviated final edition where we cover the week past
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  and what's coming up in the week ahead here on the first day of the week,
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  kicking off every Sunday.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  A lot of news and information I want to cover.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  I was out of town four days this week.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Had Jason Burmans sitting in for me, doing a great job.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Appreciate him doing that.
[07:47.000 --> 07:54.000]  Just a program note, big breaking news either late tonight or tomorrow on my news websites.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  Big 9-11 truth news.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  I'm just going to put that little hint out to everybody.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  It'll be very, very important.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  You do not want to miss this information, so watch those news websites.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Okay, here is the news I have in front of me.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  Gold may rise to $5,000 an ounce on inflation, says Bloomberg.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  Bush will seek to in offshore drilling ban.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  More consumers, workers, shoplift as economy slows.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  Two billion may suffer from mobile phone brain cancer.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Australian government report.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  Yeah, two billion of you may die soon.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  Well, Kennedy's got the cell phone cancer.
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  EU maps out future amid setbacks.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  BBC, they say it doesn't matter if three nations have rejected its expansion and votes.
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  They don't care.
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.000]  They're going ahead.
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  Kind of like here.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  We don't want Centra taking over our roads and putting tall roads on it.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  And they just say, we're doing it.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  We own your politicians.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  If you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by and splatter you up against the wall.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  We rule slaves, shut up.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  One currency for South American Union Reuters reports.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  Meanwhile, the average American's been conditioned that there's no EU, no South American Union,
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  and that we are not officially in the NAU.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  You got a bunch of people invested in their egos, that they're on top of things,
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  and it doesn't exist, and they haven't been lied to,
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  so none of this exists as the dollar implodes and gas prices explode.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  Oklahoma gets their head screwed on straight, passes a resolution,
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  92 to 3 in their state legislature,
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  saying that they are going to basically secede from the Union because of the North American Union.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  What will fake conservatives do and mainline fake liberals?
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  They will say Oklahoma doesn't exist, and I'm not joking.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  We got big-time neocon hosts that say the CFR doesn't exist, so.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  I thought I'd read some famous quotes by socialists.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  George Bernard Shum, H.G. Wells, Margaret Sanger,
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.000]  and, of course, David Rockefeller's father about how they wanted to kill all of the blacks and Hispanics.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  And, by the way, they run things today, and that's why they're setting up oral government
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  and their own state of documents, so they can then kill the majority of us.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  And I thought I'd actually read a few quotes today for you and give you sources for that.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  Yeah, the ball games don't matter as much when you read official government textbooks and documents
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  about how they're killing us right now.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Don't believe me, though. It doesn't exist. Just drink some fluoride. Everything's okay.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  Also, UK to begin microchipping their prisoners and parolees.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  That's right, implantable chips now happening.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  And so that is one little stack of the news.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  Another stack, Haditha massacre victims can outraged as Marines go free.
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.000]  McClatchy newspapers. The Marines admit they went in and just killed the 20-plus people, the entire innocent family.
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  Other Marines have been found not guilty for raping 12-year-old girls and then killing their families.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  Sitting on the side of the road shooting families for fun and sport.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  They've been acquitted of that, acquitted of torturing people to death, so why not?
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  And, I mean, I got the Austin American statesman today with the New York Times article
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  basically apologizing for torture and saying it's a great thing.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  I mean, why not? Why not? I mean, we'll just say we're torturing them, but the torture doesn't exist.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  We're a nation of people in denial.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  By the way, do any of you think you're safe when you've got a government that tortures small children with pliers sexually?
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  I mean, do you sleep well at night knowing that they're quadrupling the amount of CIA humat every year?
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  They've got them domestically in every city. They've got fusion threat centers under FEMA command in every city.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  They've built the FEMA camps and announced it to you.
[11:49.000 --> 11:57.000]  Criminals have taken over the country, and this police state is their rearguard action to make sure they never get prosecuted for it.
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  Also, the head of the Army investigation into torture says after years of disclosures by government investigators,
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  media accounts and reports from human rights organizations, there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes.
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.000]  The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held accountable.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  And the answer is no.
[12:22.000 --> 12:30.000]  I mean, they can even torture people and get fake 9-11 confessions. That's all that's about when the people running the government carried out the attacks.
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  But there's no debating that 12-year-old girls don't deserve to be raped and then have their heads blown off.
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  I mean, I have the Army report right here, and after the Army report's been out for three years, it's much worse since then.
[12:44.000 --> 12:56.000]  But since then, the physicians for human rights, who now the Major General, U.S. Major General, who was, who did the investigation, admitted it.
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  But he said, well, they were ordered. General Rick Baucus, the head of Camp X-ray, quit and said, I can't torture people and commit war crimes.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  And then he added, by the way, these people aren't even al-Qaeda. He's now on frontline admitting it.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  It doesn't matter. Do you know that police in the U.S. since the 80s have been trained to torture U.S. citizens?
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  They just call it paying compliance.
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  Do you know in hundreds of federal prisons, if you don't work, and then dumb idiots out there say, good, make the prisoners work, they're taking your jobs,
[13:28.000 --> 13:36.000]  they work for 20 cents an hour on average, or 21 cents. The average federal rate's 18, but the average would state in federal is about 21.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  Go look it up for yourself. Do you understand that's taking your job? You think illegal aliens are taking your jobs, and they are?
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  They're dumping down wages, bankrupting the welfare net, the social services net, which is really the eugenics net. They call it a safety net.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  It's an extermination net, a control net to dumb down families, vaccinate you, brain damage, you carry out the eugenics operations, declassified.
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  But let's say you think it's a good thing. Well, they're burning and blowing all that out.
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  You don't think 4.5 million prisoners and millions more in and out of the system aren't devaluing your...
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.360]  the wages but but side issue the point is is that you know what they do in a
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.160]  federal prison if you refuse to work they strap you in a quote
[14:22.160 --> 14:28.880]  restrainment chair for weeks hardcore torture within hours you know your back

[20:38.400 --> 20:42.160]  listening to we the people radio network
[20:45.920 --> 20:53.920]  most people are invested their egos are invested in the Democratic Party or
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.160]  they're invested in the Republican Party I remember back under Clinton all the
[20:58.160 --> 21:02.680]  murders the corruption the evil and Democrats couldn't wake up they wouldn't
[21:02.680 --> 21:07.040]  listen they wouldn't understand because they had invested in him they had
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.920]  invested that he was a good guy that he cared about him and that he wanted to
[21:09.920 --> 21:14.840]  help him and that he was wonderful now after he was depoliticized a certain
[21:14.840 --> 21:17.920]  extent now most Democrats who talk to don't like the Clintons and know they're
[21:17.920 --> 21:21.960]  corrupt but back when he was under attack by the Republicans they couldn't
[21:21.960 --> 21:28.240]  admit he was bad and it's the same thing with the Republicans today and if you
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.120]  look at Bush on issues how is he conservative tripling the size of
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.880]  government gun control open borders wars you know all of this stuff he's not
[21:35.880 --> 21:39.720]  conservative gay porn stars visiting the White House constantly for whatever
[21:39.720 --> 21:47.000]  reason in the middle of the night yeah you forgot about that but it didn't
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.640]  matter because the Democrats attack oh I've got to support mindlessly like I'm
[21:52.640 --> 21:55.960]  you know supporting my football team my favorite football team whatever he does
[21:55.960 --> 22:03.520]  meanwhile that's a diversion not just that people won't see the corruption in
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.640]  the party they support or quote their party but that you won't even see that's
[22:08.640 --> 22:12.360]  not even your party special interest on it and they say one thing and then do
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.680]  another if you look at the voting records of Republicans and Democrats
[22:15.680 --> 22:20.760]  they're very close to each other and if you look at the special interests that
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.440]  own them and control them I mean there's no conspiracy theory about it
[22:25.440 --> 22:34.480]  multinational fortune 100 own almost every federal politician much less state
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.120]  and they have a global agenda and our national sovereignty in our country is
[22:41.120 --> 22:44.360]  in the way in our bill of rights and constitutions in the way and people say
[22:44.360 --> 22:48.160]  well it's natural for us to go from agrarians as well from hunter-gatherers
[22:48.160 --> 22:52.280]  to agrarian to city-states to nation-states and then the global
[22:52.280 --> 22:57.600]  government well Europe doesn't want to be part of the European Union but their
[22:57.600 --> 23:03.200]  government say no you're gonna be part of it and then you can argue that global
[23:03.200 --> 23:07.160]  government's the next step in in in humanity because Star Trek is imprinted
[23:07.160 --> 23:12.080]  in your mind and other Hollywood you know type of memes but look at who's
[23:12.080 --> 23:16.000]  setting up world government have we had a debate about who's setting it up very
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.520]  corrupt very bad people and in their own documents they say you're not gonna
[23:19.520 --> 23:22.680]  have any liberties or freedoms or private property only the elite is gonna
[23:22.680 --> 23:26.440]  have that and you're gonna have an ordered controlled life those of you
[23:26.440 --> 23:31.160]  they're allowed to live that won't be euthanized under the bioethics rules
[23:31.160 --> 23:36.800]  those of you who are allowed to have children and it's all stated it's all
[23:36.800 --> 23:39.880]  in the government textbooks it's all in the documents it's all in my film in
[23:39.880 --> 23:45.200]  game and in the extras of in game you know what it's like to really know what's
[23:45.200 --> 23:48.520]  happening in the world and to not be caught up in this diversion this
[23:48.520 --> 23:56.520]  distraction that is mainline politics in news to know I mean I was reading the
[23:56.520 --> 24:01.080]  last OPEC emergency conference a few weeks ago and and I was watching it
[24:01.080 --> 24:04.920]  today at the office and I was watching it here at the at the at the local
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.360]  station I broadcast out of across the country and the world I got c-span on
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.040]  right now Bill Clinton's on but earlier I was reading the closed captioning and
[24:14.040 --> 24:16.960]  they were talking about it's not our fault we're not making higher profits
[24:16.960 --> 24:20.480]  the dollar's been devalued you say you don't want us to move away from dollar
[24:20.480 --> 24:28.200]  denominated oil you don't want us to move away from dollar denominated oil but
[24:28.200 --> 24:34.360]  you but you're devaluing the dollar and so there it is in the OPEC summit
[24:34.360 --> 24:38.520]  emergency summit but you'll never hear that on our news never never never and I
[24:38.520 --> 24:42.520]  have to hear people you know I went on vacation a few days the Texas beach I
[24:42.520 --> 24:46.680]  had to hear people next to me on a fishing boat talking about why oil was so
[24:46.680 --> 24:51.520]  expensive and I had to all for the wrong reasons and I had to hear people at
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.080]  about by the pool at the at the hotel talking about it and I had to just hear
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.600]  the idiocy and I would try to tell them well no the dollar's been devalued
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.080]  that's why and then they would oh my dollar isn't devalued I'm a millionaire
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.760]  I got a million dollars my mom a millionaire my mom my money isn't
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.360]  devalued my investments you see they're like children they think because they
[25:14.360 --> 25:22.480]  say something it changes reality a few weeks ago I had a guy call in and he
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.040]  goes how dare you say Israel has nukes you're not allowed to say that and I
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.800]  said well are you denying they have nukes and he's like well no they're allowed
[25:28.800 --> 25:33.080]  to have nukes but you shouldn't talk about how they have nukes just because
[25:33.080 --> 25:36.480]  our media lies to us here and talks to us like we're children when it's admitted
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.640]  in all the weapons journals and all the foreign president Israel admits they
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.280]  have nukes we're not allowed to say it here in the U.S. I mean we are really
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.440]  pathetic and I know I said I get into torture but that's what blows me away
[25:49.440 --> 25:53.720]  is that I'm not even that smart and I figured out how all this works I stay
[25:53.720 --> 25:57.720]  up late at night reading government white papers ran corporations Department of
[25:57.720 --> 26:03.000]  Defense the Ministry of Defense British you know government 10-year
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.160]  projections and they say they're gonna put us in camps they're gonna micro chip
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.960]  us they're gonna sterilize us they're gonna enslave us they may use neutron
[26:11.960 --> 26:16.240]  bombs on western cities to control us if we I mean they say if we try to take
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.120]  back Washington they're gonna neutron bomb us I mean this is published this
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.000]  isn't even declassified and the british and the british say we work for the
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.960]  global elite and we'll use neutron weapons on our own population if they
[26:29.960 --> 26:36.840]  try to overthrow our system I have to read Dick Cheney and the PNAC
[26:36.840 --> 26:43.960]  documents September 20th 2000 say that they want to use race weapons to kill
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.080]  certain races and then I have to get up on the air and always get an email when
[26:47.080 --> 26:50.400]  I mention it go and prove that you liar it's been in the London Guardian the
[26:50.400 --> 26:55.480]  Associated Press and in Dick Cheney's own perspective he put out it was a
[26:55.480 --> 26:59.800]  prospectus he put it out to the elite saying I want to implement this will
[26:59.800 --> 27:04.440]  will stage terror attacks we'll get our police state and then we can go into the
[27:04.440 --> 27:12.320]  next phase and then we have to have a debate about this you think it's fun me
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.440]  getting up on the radio because they don't have total control they don't have
[27:16.440 --> 27:19.640]  total control I'm on the air I get on a few stations here and there and I'm on
[27:19.640 --> 27:22.960]  the air telling you who they are you think I like that you think I like
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.000]  risking my life you think I like spooks threatening me and following me and
[27:27.000 --> 27:35.440]  trying to set me up you think this is fun this is life and death and you're
[27:35.440 --> 27:40.400]  like a bunch of children I don't mean my mainline listeners but the people
[27:40.400 --> 27:44.040]  tuning in for the first time you know I think George Bush is great he's a great
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.240]  American if you don't like it get out of this country and you go but he's not a
[27:49.240 --> 27:52.680]  real conservative all shut up liberal well no I'm a real conservative Bush

[33:57.200 --> 34:07.680]  originates from this radio 590 K.L.B.J. it's 836-059 okay I don't want to attack
[34:07.680 --> 34:14.920]  the issue of torture without setting up some background I've heard the macho
[34:14.920 --> 34:20.120]  fake chicken honk neocons on air they sell it that tortures manly it's a
[34:20.120 --> 34:25.120]  it's a tough thing whereas just 50 60 years ago we knew it's something that
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.600]  Joseph Mengele did and the Nazis did because they were just following orders
[34:28.600 --> 34:36.960]  and in our own CIA manuals in the Army field manual that it is all based on
[34:36.960 --> 34:43.880]  just a decade ago it said you do not torture people because then you lose
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.240]  the moral high ground and torture has never been good to get real information
[34:48.240 --> 34:54.400]  it has only been good to get fake confessions false confessions for
[34:54.400 --> 34:57.840]  political persecution good for the Nazis good for the Soviets good for the
[34:57.840 --> 35:03.800]  communist Chinese good for the inquisitors they want to torture you to
[35:03.800 --> 35:09.480]  get false confessions it's only good for that remember the North Koreans did
[35:09.480 --> 35:17.200]  it the Vietnamese did it the Vietnamese communist the bad guys do this but
[35:17.200 --> 35:24.800]  before 9-11 I would read in law enforcement magazines what is it law
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.920]  enforcement weapons and technology I'm in a 7-11 remember in 2000 something said
[35:28.920 --> 35:34.680]  buy that magazine I picked it up flip it open and it says torturing people is
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.960]  good it says if you have a ticking time bomb and you don't know if it's gonna
[35:39.960 --> 35:43.920]  go off in a shopping mall and if you torture this person it'll get answers
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.640]  go ahead and torture them it's good and then it said you know what if there's
[35:47.640 --> 35:50.880]  anthrax and it's about to go off and kill a bunch of people do you torture a
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.200]  child in front of their parents and then I would see other propaganda pieces
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.680]  put out to the police and military saying you know we've got to get rid of
[36:00.680 --> 36:03.480]  possecom and taught us the law barring the military from engaging the
[36:03.480 --> 36:06.560]  American people well the military kills people and breaks things police were
[36:06.560 --> 36:09.760]  supposed to be peace officers but see now they've basically recruited out of
[36:09.760 --> 36:12.760]  the military into law enforcement they've turned the police into paramilitary
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.680]  forces all over the country they're now just coming in people's houses without
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.240]  warrants saying it's a safety check they're doing knock-and-talks demanding to
[36:20.240 --> 36:23.720]  see your guns arresting I mean folks it's all over they're taking blood without
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.840]  warrants on the side of the road from Texas to Indiana I mean it's just
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.000]  they're going wild it's all it's happening everywhere the feds are paying
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.320]  grants to do this this is all done incrementally incrementally training as
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.680]  tortures good incrementally training us attacking a country that hasn't attacked
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.640]  you as good incrementally training you I'm talking I'm getting hundreds of
[36:43.640 --> 36:47.960]  emails calls people I know no criminal record are going in to buy 22 rifles
[36:47.960 --> 36:51.240]  handguns they're told sorry there's a waiting period you're gonna get a visit
[36:51.240 --> 36:55.880]  from police first to question you about why you want the gun it's getting you
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.520]  used to police being in your backyard police being your door interfacing with
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.720]  them having them ask you questions the cops are being trained right now I mean
[37:04.720 --> 37:10.760]  it's classic tyranny there's a formula and the criminals that run our government
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.720]  trained over a hundred nations in this formula of how to torture how to how to
[37:14.720 --> 37:18.760]  infiltrate the society how to train people for secret police it's now
[37:18.760 --> 37:24.280]  happening global corporations use this nation in the last 60 years as their
[37:24.280 --> 37:30.600]  muscle the last hundred plus in the western hemisphere to as Marine Corps
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.040]  two-time congressional Medal of Honor winner General Spendley Butler general
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.720]  he was in line to be the Marine Corps commandant they tried to hire him to
[37:39.720 --> 37:44.360]  overthrow the US Bush's grandfather did president's father Bush seniors father
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.480]  that came out congressional hearings they said we want to overthrow or
[37:47.480 --> 37:50.560]  working with Hitler we want to overthrow the US your right winger you've
[37:50.560 --> 37:53.920]  overthrown over a hundred countries you've been involved in it we want you
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.440]  to overthrow the US with 500,000 troops we're gonna militarize the police and he
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.320]  said yes I'll do it long enough to get to go to the meetings with the Nazi
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.640]  agents and Bush's grandfather I mean this I got the congressional hearings I
[38:08.640 --> 38:11.680]  have the newsreels but don't think that means that we get Bush out of office
[38:11.680 --> 38:18.120]  were saved these people don't play games and they wrap themselves in the flag and
[38:18.120 --> 38:22.280]  a lot of you are right-wing and think Nazis are cool folks the Nazis robbed
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.360]  a lot of Germans they robbed a lot of people in that country they ruined the
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.960]  country because they wanted to have an empire it's always the same the the
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.200]  average person just wants to live their life the elite wants more power more
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.840]  control and they're not gonna stop until they get it they're not gonna stop your
[38:37.840 --> 38:41.920]  life means nothing to them the tyrannies is for the general public it's not for
[38:41.920 --> 38:46.840]  Alex Jones or the Muslims you know they just beta test and get you to acquiesce
[38:46.840 --> 38:51.400]  to violating people's rights in the name of persecuting a minority that's part
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.720]  of the formulae and then it's used on you and I can't tell you how many times
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.560]  I've been in a warrantless checkpoint covering and I've got video a cops in
[38:59.560 --> 39:02.880]  police state 2000 I say you're here running a warrantless checkpoint I said
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.120]  you didn't do this just a few years ago and they said yeah but it's a federal
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.640]  grant and we're just following orders and then now they're taking your blood
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.120]  without a warrant very invasive on the side of the street but see oh we're just
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.920]  following orders and I've got a big stack of articles here where people wake
[39:18.920 --> 39:22.760]  up with cops in their house because they leave their door open you know not
[39:22.760 --> 39:27.200]  locked even in the countryside and they're suddenly in your house and oh you
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.680]  know this gun looks illegal we're gonna arrest you see it always sounds like it's
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.480]  a good reason they know how to sell you and the average cop doesn't know they're
[39:36.480 --> 39:42.480]  they're part of something large and evil like in North Korea they have for 50
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.640]  plus years big paintings of police running checkpoints police checking
[39:47.640 --> 39:54.720]  papers you know pictures of the leaders well now all over the US huge billboards
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.640]  on the sides of skyscrapers showing cops pulling you over giving you a ticket
[39:58.640 --> 40:02.680]  we're the boss we're in control it's for your own good big pictures of the
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.880]  leaders everywhere I mean this is a formula they're going down the entire
[40:06.880 --> 40:11.320]  list doing it all and then you read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[40:11.320 --> 40:14.920]  you read the Military Commissions Act you read Patriot Act 1 and 2 and the
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.040]  Victory Act and you read the Rand Corporation and you read the British
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.760]  Ministry of Defense report put out last year just type British Ministry of
[40:22.760 --> 40:27.860]  Defense report flash mobs that's a key term in there it'll bring it up hundreds
[40:27.860 --> 40:34.480]  of pages go read it they admit all this how do I know what's going to happen
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.000]  over and over again how do I know what's going to develop and what's going to
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.760]  unfold because they have to give orders to millions of people and it's
[40:42.760 --> 40:46.840]  compartmentalized but I read it across compartments the average person in the
[40:46.840 --> 40:49.280]  government doesn't want to know outside their compartment they want to go
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.920]  water skiing or go see their mistress or you know go smoke marijuana or you know
[40:53.920 --> 40:59.080]  go spend some of the money gambling they you know they stole off a drug dealer so
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.280]  they only know their discipline their compartmentalized area well see I've
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.120]  studied all their disciplines and I can then see a clear picture and let me tell
[41:06.120 --> 41:14.880]  you folks it is nightmarish now the Army's major general who was charged and
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.680]  he admitted later he was told to whitewash it and he refused because he
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.120]  couldn't believe it his own report said that 97% of those taken to 30 plus
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.320]  camps in Iraq were completely innocent and didn't have papers in order he
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.920]  reported that they raped children raped women Jeffrey Dahmer type stuff with
[41:33.920 --> 41:37.960]  acid and orifices and huge objects I can't even say it on air go read the
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.080]  just read Army report torture and this isn't the stuff you heard about on the
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.240]  news or the few light photos they released Congress has seen the photos of
[41:46.240 --> 41:51.520]  children being tortured okay people killed and they hired former federal
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.720]  prison guards who've been fired for raping people for torturing US citizens
[41:55.720 --> 42:00.280]  and that's who they took over there I've interviewed General Carter Karpinski
[42:00.280 --> 42:08.760]  I've interviewed them all but this is major general US major general in the
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.080]  preface to a recently released report by the physicians for human rights on the
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.400]  criminality of enhanced interrogation techniques major general to goomba
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.280]  rights after years of disclosures by government investigators media accounts
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.160]  and reports from human rights organizations there is no doubt no longer
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.480]  any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes
[42:28.480 --> 42:34.120]  the only question is the remains is to be answered is whether those who ordered
[42:34.120 --> 42:36.720]  the use of torture will be held accountable and then it goes into stuff
[42:36.720 --> 42:43.440]  I can't even read this report now now worse stuff has come out so you see
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.280]  where does it in first oh we're just gonna waterboard and torture people who
[42:47.280 --> 42:50.320]  we think are with Alcada and of course you find out they flew Alcada out to
[42:50.320 --> 42:53.920]  safety and protect them and use them to attack the Serbs and use them to attack
[42:53.920 --> 42:57.200]  the Russians and it's all controlled and then the bin Laden's work with the
[42:57.200 --> 43:00.800]  bushes and vacation with the bushes and FBI agents have gone public and now
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.200]  they've been barred by law AP reported from reporting this to you have AP right
[43:05.200 --> 43:12.120]  here FBI to be arrested if they testify understand folks it's all staged it's
[43:12.120 --> 43:17.920]  all staged so when we come back I'm gonna finish up a torture and don't
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.640]  rationalize don't make excuses don't say I'm making this up go read the Army
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.760]  report are you for killing children we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen
[43:26.760 --> 43:35.400]  stay with us gas prices are out of control fight back by doing what
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.920]  thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones show have done developed by a major

[49:45.320 --> 49:47.600]  well it really upsets me is
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.480]  fake intellectual fake moderate stuff like the new york times
[49:53.480 --> 49:55.760]  it was on the cover of the austrian american statesman
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.920]  i was already talk about
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.440]  torture today i got into the studio there was laying on the table c i a
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.840]  interrogators mix force and fitness
[50:03.840 --> 50:06.240]  force you know torturing somebody
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.560]  torturing the child in front of them and it's admitted that they
[50:09.560 --> 50:11.560]  threatened one guy's children in here
[50:11.560 --> 50:14.360]  that's how they introduce it to you it's much worse than that
[50:14.360 --> 50:18.320]  and then they just kind of report well it's what works you know
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.040]  it's the finesse
[50:20.040 --> 50:22.360]  one guy tortures next guy's nice
[50:22.360 --> 50:24.800]  do any of you feel safe with the government
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.120]  that'll a violate federal law and every canon of decency
[50:28.120 --> 50:30.320]  and torture people
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.560]  see but but but but dictators and corrupt systems know how to seduce you
[50:34.560 --> 50:37.480]  they know how to get you to accept something like that and once you've
[50:37.480 --> 50:38.520]  accepted torture
[50:38.520 --> 50:41.480]  then why not why not have died court howlbert and run shall get napping
[50:41.480 --> 50:42.720]  ranks
[50:42.720 --> 50:46.640]  why not have it come out in congress and they don't get in trouble
[50:46.640 --> 50:48.080]  you think i'm joking but i
[50:48.080 --> 50:51.320]  dying court howlburton sex slavery
[50:51.320 --> 50:53.120]  into google uh...
[50:53.120 --> 50:56.920]  and you'll get congressional videos you can order it from c-span
[50:56.920 --> 50:59.720]  and they just said the best part is that they do it and
[50:59.720 --> 51:01.640]  not to stop
[51:01.640 --> 51:05.720]  in the congress uh... people say well what about the the the trillions missing
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.240]  from the pension funds
[51:07.240 --> 51:09.720]  they just say we're not going to ask your questions
[51:09.720 --> 51:12.840]  and you read the ministry of defense report if we don't like it they'll just
[51:12.840 --> 51:16.880]  drop neutron bombs on us you think i'm joking folks
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.000]  the only reason i'm alive is they don't want to kill me to validate
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.360]  killing alex jones puts an exclamation point
[51:24.360 --> 51:26.400]  and underlining
[51:26.400 --> 51:32.760]  it highlights everything i've said
[51:32.760 --> 51:35.240]  you understand this isn't a game
[51:35.240 --> 51:38.320]  you understand psychopathic geniuses have taken over
[51:38.320 --> 51:42.480]  and they're using behavioral psychology to twist you into their dark minions to
[51:42.480 --> 51:43.520]  serve them
[51:43.520 --> 51:47.920]  this is a country losing its soul it enough to abort fifty million babies
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.000]  it isn't enough to be in the country of lies and egos and people lying to
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.040]  themselves
[51:54.040 --> 52:00.280]  now we've got to have a government that endorses child sex rings
[52:00.280 --> 52:04.280]  how many homeland security deputy directors have been caught in in in
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.480]  child molestation stings but it's always state and local government bumps into
[52:08.480 --> 52:09.520]  them and bust them
[52:09.520 --> 52:11.480]  because the all government isn't bad yet
[52:11.480 --> 52:12.640]  we're in a race
[52:12.640 --> 52:16.120]  they're kicking all the good guys out they're moving the evil in they have to
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.680]  openly promote torture and secret arrest
[52:18.680 --> 52:22.360]  and have congress try to pass retroactive laws to get rid of the fourth
[52:22.360 --> 52:26.520]  amendment so they don't go to jail for illegally spying on us
[52:26.520 --> 52:31.080]  you understand folks we're in a life and death battle here
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.560]  we have a child molestation cult that runs the new world order that is totally
[52:35.560 --> 52:42.120]  sick and in bread in control and they're ruthless and they enjoy killing people
[52:42.120 --> 52:46.900]  why would the justice department in the attorney general and john you as deputy
[52:46.900 --> 52:50.720]  order the military to sexually torture children
[52:50.720 --> 52:55.240]  we've played the clips of john you at a cfr meeting saying yes we do that
[52:55.240 --> 52:57.440]  yes that's authorized
[52:57.440 --> 53:00.080]  there is no way you can say
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.960]  right the children is good
[53:03.960 --> 53:06.320]  i can't believe that
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.160]  i can't believe that on the radical because i'll come on there and talk
[53:10.160 --> 53:14.440]  about this and say it's bad
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.200]  don't you know you're the targets you thumb suckin weaklings out there
[53:18.200 --> 53:19.740]  you cowardly
[53:19.740 --> 53:21.240]  uh... decadent
[53:21.240 --> 53:24.960]  people who think you're part of the power structure on these ego power trips
[53:24.960 --> 53:28.680]  with your democratic and republican parties like your part of the system
[53:28.680 --> 53:31.880]  why do you think scott mclellan so scared he went public why do you think
[53:31.880 --> 53:33.360]  we've got generals
[53:33.360 --> 53:35.680]  coming public and saying they tortured kids
[53:35.680 --> 53:40.040]  why do you think we have the top cia briefers and cia section chiefs coming
[53:40.040 --> 53:42.960]  out and saying the government carried out the attacks because they're scared
[53:42.960 --> 53:47.840]  folks they know this is deadly serious
[53:47.840 --> 53:50.760]  you understand that they're filling the ranks of the government with psychopathic
[53:50.760 --> 53:53.440]  killers who love evil right now
[53:53.440 --> 53:58.880]  you understand this isn't a game
[53:58.880 --> 54:01.240]  i read this article makes me so sick
[54:01.240 --> 54:05.200]  i could talk hours about the subtle nuances of scott shane's evil psiop
[54:05.200 --> 54:08.840]  cia interrogations mix force and finesse
[54:08.840 --> 54:11.000]  so instead of calling it brutal torture and
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.760]  mingle a nazi evil
[54:12.760 --> 54:15.480]  it's so force and finesse
[54:15.480 --> 54:18.760]  collegiate mohammeds
[54:18.760 --> 54:22.080]  illuminates hidden tactics now it's admitted
[54:22.080 --> 54:27.520]  that they tortured this guy and then threatened to go after his children
[54:27.520 --> 54:30.360]  they admitted they threatened to imprison his kids
[54:30.360 --> 54:32.040]  small children
[54:32.040 --> 54:34.760]  you can bet it was more than that
[54:34.760 --> 54:38.800]  this guy was a cia operative and by the way they just staged a break in to
[54:38.800 --> 54:41.560]  release three thousand al-qaeda members
[54:41.560 --> 54:44.560]  in afghanistan and as soon as i heard it on vacation
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.720]  bermas called me about it filling in i said watch it's going to be u.s. aided
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.240]  and then it came out in the foreign press at the u.s. did aid them
[54:51.240 --> 54:52.960]  uh... that's their favorite deal
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.600]  every time they bust al-qaeda in saudi arabia they quote have a jailbreak
[54:57.600 --> 55:01.240]  and the guys jump on u.s. aircraft and take off i mean it is so
[55:01.240 --> 55:05.280]  the saudis you understand folks they work for the new world order that's where
[55:05.280 --> 55:09.760]  the supposed hijackers came from they were u.s. government agents that's been
[55:09.760 --> 55:11.120]  admitted

[56:27.800 --> 56:31.920]  and the invasion of iraq was giving extremist new motives for havoc
[56:31.920 --> 56:34.400]  you read actual pentagon documents and they say they wanted to go in there to
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.220]  actually create resistance
[56:36.220 --> 56:38.720]  like here's an example their real terrorist
[56:38.720 --> 56:42.040]  but the big spectacular ones are u.s. government ops okay
[56:42.040 --> 56:45.720]  like like in nigeria they've been having civil war for decades
[56:45.720 --> 56:48.800]  well they call the group there for that that's that's fighting with the
[56:48.800 --> 56:50.000]  government terrorist
[56:50.000 --> 56:57.000]  see here on the news terrorist attack oil pipelines
[56:57.040 --> 56:59.960]  so there are rebel groups from the world they just call them terrorists now so
[56:59.960 --> 57:02.000]  you hear that yeah that's a real terror group
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.360]  but it's really a rebel group whether you're former against them
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.400]  but when you get to quote al-qaeda that's an admitted cia creation
[57:10.400 --> 57:14.040]  it's a catch-all for your simple minds and they admit that
[57:14.040 --> 57:18.160]  it was collegiate mohammed the interrogator deuce martinis a soft
[57:18.160 --> 57:20.080]  spoken analyst who spoke no arabic
[57:20.080 --> 57:23.240]  had turned down cia offered to be trained in waterboarding
[57:23.240 --> 57:28.440]  he left the inflection of pain and panic to others all
[57:28.440 --> 57:32.440]  so that's kind of psychological ring that all he isn't for torture but he does
[57:32.440 --> 57:34.080]  let him bring them to them
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.360]  the gung-ho paramilitary types who the more cerebral interrogators call
[57:38.360 --> 57:42.640]  knuckle draggers oh see they keep their hands clean but then they're
[57:42.640 --> 57:45.560]  the but they the people under them are ordered to the torture
[57:45.560 --> 57:48.880]  martinis came in after a
[57:48.880 --> 57:53.200]  after the rough stuff the ultimate good cop with the classic skills
[57:53.200 --> 57:56.600]  and see that's what government is oh they're gonna help you on this side oh

[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:53.160]  sitting around talking about politics

[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:04.960]  and I was thinking to myself
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.360]  heavens you know

[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:51.440]  they used to back it up with silver and gold
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:55.720]  way back in the days of old

[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  they used to back it up with silver and gold
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  way back in the days of old

[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  oh look at all that red money
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  red money
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  red money manifesto plank is a private central bank
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  printin' red money
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  red money really got some nerve down at the federal reserve
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  printin' red money
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  red money
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  that's the federal fractional reserve
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  the private bank was really who they served with red money
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  red money
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  red banks make up that money for free
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  then load it back to us for a fee
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  I'm seein' red ink money

[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  just a heap of guns cocked behind our backs
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  gettin' all red money
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  red money
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  like the mob they make us pay
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  so maybe nothin' bad happens to us today
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  it's strictly red money
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  red money
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  so let's get a month's run for treason

[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Now live from Austin, Texas
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  Here's Alex Jones
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  This is the Michael Wrecking Talk Show
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  our phone number 1-800-468-MIC
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  1-800-468-6453
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Naming their children as below
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  You know what I get them for a first birthday?
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  I put a grenade up their butts and light it
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Happy birthday, baby
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Bye bye
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  You can just type in
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Mike Reagan kill babies into Google
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  and it goes on for like 10 minutes
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  saying yes, I want to murder children
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  yes, I want to kill them
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Pastor Hagie down in San Antonio has said
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  he praises God every time another Muslim child is killed
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  and let's just get one thing straight
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  I'm a Christian, I think we've got too many foreigners in this country
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  it's diluting the culture
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  and I am not even a fan of many factions of Islam
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  especially the Wahhabis that the British entail
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  and our government are in love with
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  that's the al-Qaeda group
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  but the Muslims do not talk like that about us
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  and it makes us look really bad
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  and we lose the high ground
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  and people behave like this
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  but the point is, Dincor and Halliburton
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  aren't getting the precious Muslim children
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  it's Christian children out of Central Europe
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  that are taken to the slave camps
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Thailand and others
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  and if you don't believe me, there's frontline specials
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  about the sex slave trade
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  I mean, it's mainstream news
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  and that's what I mean
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  just the incredible institutionalized evil
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  that is going on all around us
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  I mean, the governor of Illinois last year came out
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  and said, I have that constituents bringing the documents
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  and I've seen congressional testimony
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  about Halliburton and Dincor
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  kidnapping a million women and children
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  and how they have offshore islands all over the world
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  where most of them are used not in sex slavery
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  but they actually kidnap them and then chain them
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  to sewing machines
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  I don't mean living in China and basically being a slave
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  having to go live and work in a factory
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  that's bad enough
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I mean, they're grabbed, they're put on US aircraft
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  they're flown out by the military to literal slave camps
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  you think I like fighting with these people?
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  these are killers, folks
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  you think I like getting up here
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  when they're already calling my house
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  saying they'll go out for my kids next?
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  but I'm past the point of return
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  I'm committed
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  I mean, you have no idea how evil it is
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  so that's why we now hear them say
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  take all 9-11 truthers to camps
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  torture us, kill us
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  take us out, shoot us
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  he'll pay for the bullets
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  they're all saying that
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  we've got the morning Joe saying it
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  on MSNBC, we've got Glenn Beck saying it
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  you're like, wait a minute
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Glenn Beck talks about the New World Order
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  yeah, they'll say I'm against the New World Order
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  but then they'll be for all the policies
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  that create the New World Order
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  they're doing that because they know the majority of you
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  have woken up to some extent now
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  that there is a global government
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  there is this tyranny happening
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  now, I said I'd go to your calls
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  the numbers 877-590-5525
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  but on the subject of torture
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  go read the Army's own reports
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  this is illegal, this is murderous, this is horrible
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  this has been done to innocent people
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  remember they lied and said
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  oh, that's a fake puppy video Alex Jones
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  put up on his website
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Michelle Malcolm, the fake conservative
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  not a real conservative
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  writes books about how wonderful
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  putting people in camps are
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  that's even the name of the book
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  the case for internment
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  and big CFR husband
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  once big government
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  but they'll give you torture
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  and you think that's conservative
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  she said I was a liar
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  and that video of throwing the puppy
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  off the cliff wasn't real
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  nobody cares about humans
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  people got upset about the puppy
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and I just said
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  these guys are coming back here to be cops
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  and I gave the fact that
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  on many big city forces
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  over 80% of the new recruits
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  are Iraq and Afghanistan veterans
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  and then I give you the Ithaca Times
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  with a positive report with
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Gruckheimer, the private Gruckheimer
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  about how they go into villages
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  and kill every baby, every woman
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  in Afghanistan and the Army came out
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  on Fox News with a clarification
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  two days later saying well yes
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  in some areas we kill everyone
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  don't you understand
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  if they're going to torture them
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  they're going to torture us
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  and so now the military
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  most of the World War II vets
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  that I got a chance to know
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  growing up, deer hunting with them
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  fishing with them, camping with them
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  a lot of people who've been in Germany
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  been in Italy, been in the Pacific
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  they had most of them served a year or two
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Audi Murphy only served a year and a half
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  in country
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  after his last incident
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  where he was up on top of the tank
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  and shot all the Nazis
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  and the rest of them
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  they finally pulled him out
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  after he'd been shot a whole bunch
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  repeatedly the point is
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  is that from Texas
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  is that these guys
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  after they all died
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  we got a chance to see
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  what was in their trunks
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  we got a chance to see
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  all the combat they'd been in
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  what they'd gone through
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  and they all had problems
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  throughout their lives
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  whether they owned construction
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  companies or businesses
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  or were successful
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  or were county sheriffs
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  or county tax assessors
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  they had heart attacks young
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  they were aggressive
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  they got in fights a lot
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  they would fly off the handle
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  because they'd seen a lot
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  of horrible things
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  and a few times I could get them
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  to tell stories
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  okay you want to hear a war story
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  we'd go into Germany
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  and we'd fight through the troops
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  and then imagine a beautiful
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  beautiful woman
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  looks like Marilyn Monroe
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  and red lipstick
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  running out with a buzz rocket
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  a phosphorus tipped rocket
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  trying to kill you
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and you got a shooter
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  that messes you up son
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  war isn't a good thing
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  my point is these heroes
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  who had to do these
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  really horrible things
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  because they were being shot at
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  they were screwed up for life
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  they had major problems
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  for life from this
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  serious post-traumatic stress
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  from one tour on average
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  11 and a half months
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  now the average tour now
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  is three and a half tours
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  this war is six years old
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  plus five years plus in Iraq
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  they are in hardcore combat
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  door to door police duty
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  searching people
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  and a lot of them
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  are just converting to evil
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  they're putting human skulls
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  on their tanks
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  they're raping
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  they're killing children
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  they're sitting there drinking whiskey
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  shooting families out in the street
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  laughing
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  go and watch me blow this lady
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  have you seen the videos online?
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  and you'll see marines
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  posting an army all over the post
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  going I love it
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I love killing children
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  I love killing women
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  and then we'll post the video
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  and they'll post under it
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  on my website
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  yeah we're gonna kill you soon
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Jones
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  we rule
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  hail Satan
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  and I mean helicopters
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  with 666 Reuters videos
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  of helicopters with 666
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  and human heads hanging off
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  blaring heavy metal music
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  you imagine those Iraqis
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  seeing this
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  people landing with skulls
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  and death
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  and screaming
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  running around murdering
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  and raping their children
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  now they're all coming back
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  to be cops
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  time magazine has this
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  deceptive cover story
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  the military secret weapon
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  implying it's a weapon
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  it's a great thing
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  it's gonna work
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  kinda like when I'm talking
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  to generals
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  and I've interviewed
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  and I've got their own manuals
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  where it says DU
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  will kill anybody
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  that comes in contact with it
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  you're gonna get lung cancer
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  if you breathe any of it
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  and they admit our troops
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  are all breathing it
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  and they go well it is
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  a great weapon though
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  as if that makes it okay
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  and listen your bravado
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  isn't gonna get you past
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  the fact that most of you
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  are gonna be dying young
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  from lung cancer
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  it's already happening
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  but the military secret weapon
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  for the first time in history
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  that's a lie
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  they have been giving
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  any depressants to troops
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  since World War I
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  they have been putting troops
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  on Prozac itself
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  since the 80s
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  and they put hundreds of
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  thousands of them on it
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  since the first Gulf War
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  in fact they won't give you
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  medical treatment
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  as you're dying
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  from nerve gas exposure
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  that's been in Congress
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  they will give you
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  known as the Prozac class
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  the military secret weapon
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  so see that's a lie
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  for the first time in history
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  that's a lie
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  see every line's a lie
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  or a twisting spin
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  so I can never cover
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  this whole article on there
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  for you
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  I did read it this weekend
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  actually last week
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  at the beach
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  the military secret weapon
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  for the first time in history
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  thousands of US troops
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  are being given
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  any depressant drugs
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  to deal with battlefield stress
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  is this a way to fight a war?
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  and then basically
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  it's a positive article
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  about how wonderful this is
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  folks they're not just giving
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  them Prozac
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Mr. Marshall
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  the head futurist of the army
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  for decades
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  they tested LSD
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  PCP
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  bunch of other stuff
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  on the troops
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  I had that head of Fort Bragg

[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  I mean just no matter
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  what the evil is
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  it's always Donald Rumsfeld
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  I've never seen something
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  he wasn't involved in
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  in our modern age
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  but I'm not just saying
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  that prozac makes you kill people
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  started about 6 years ago
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  in Europe
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  finally there were so many
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  murders of people on it
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  that they by law
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  forced
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  the drug companies
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  to put it on the labels
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  and now if you go to prozac
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  online or other serotonin
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  it will tell you
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  that this leads to violent
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  psychopathic breaks
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  that it leads to acting out
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  violence
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  that it leads to
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  mass murder
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  leads to suicide
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  I mean this is what the drug
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  does
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  this is what it does to you
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  and I've talked to so many cops
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  I've read so many news articles
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  they pull up
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  and see a naked woman
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  dancing on a roof
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  cut herself with a butcher knife
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  every time they go
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  she's on prozac
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  or every time a woman
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  chops her toddler's arms off
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  I'm using Texas cases here
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  from the last few years
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  they go in
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  she's on prozac
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  that woman drowned
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  five of her kids
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  in a bathtub
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  she's on it
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  every few months
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  a woman drives their kids
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  off into a lake
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  because it all happened
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  once about seven years ago
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  and then they copycat
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  see they've heard that
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  they think about it
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  and they go into a dream state
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  it's in the hallucinogen class
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  go look at their drug inserts
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  it is a hallucinogen
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  it puts you in a dream state
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  and everything's fine
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  till you have that bad trip
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  so you take these cops
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  who have been over there
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  in seeing all this murder
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  and carnage and death
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  post-traumatic stress disorder
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  you hop them up on prozac
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  that's what time magazine admits
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  that hundreds of thousands are on it
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  they come back
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  they're on the force
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  and that's why
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  we got videos
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  and then pulling up to a guy
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  who's in a wheelchair in the car
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  and they beat him up
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  because he can't get out of the car
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  or they taser an old woman
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  or they freak out
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  and just pull out a gun
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  and start shooting people
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  but now see the government
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  so corrupt they go
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  you know what
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  good job officer
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  you're not in trouble
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  just like I have
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  McClatchy newspapers here
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  says
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Hadith victims can outrage
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  as Marines go free
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  the Marines testify
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  admitted that they just killed
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  everybody in the house
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  and it says
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  eight Marines were charged
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  in the case
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  but in the intervening years
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  criminal charges have been
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  dismissed against six
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  seven Marine was acquitted
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  the residents of Aditha
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  are being told
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  this could happen
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  that this could depend
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  on US justice field
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  to trade
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  betrayed
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  we put our hopes
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  in law
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  and in the courts
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  and one after another
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  they are found innocent
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  and it goes on
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  and the guys
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  for throwing kids off bridges
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  on video
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  grab some 10 year old kids
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  throw them off a bridge
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  to drown in a fast moving river
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  they could Marines
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  high five each other
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  you know on my weekday show
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  I've played the clips of Marines
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  we ought to string a bunch
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  of that together
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  while they're beating kids
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  they go
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  and then you'll hear
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  heavy metal in the background
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  devil satan death
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  wrap party time
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  and then it's just like
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  satan satan satan
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  and imagine the Iraqis
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  are just watching this
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  it's just like
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  you guys think I'm
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Trey you've heard that clip
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  I've played on the air
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  what's the name of that clip
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  we could probably find it
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  I told you I had
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Michael Regan saying
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  killed children with
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  hand grenades
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  by inserting them
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  sexually into their body
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  that's what he's obviously into
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  what's on his mind
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  who would ever think of
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  something like that to
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  you here Michael Regan
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  alright I'm going to shut up
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  the point is
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  evil's taken over
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  they're in positions of power
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  you better look out
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  they're trying to
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  acclimate you all
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  so they can engage
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  in their mass murder
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  against you and your families
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  and they're going to have
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  a bunch of psychopathic
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  they already do
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  cops running around
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  foaming at the mouth
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  basically it's all over
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  and for all the cops
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  you're being hit
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  with fluoride
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  you're being hit
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  with cancer viruses
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  you're under the same
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  deal
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  I'm going to cover that
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  for you
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  for mainstream sources
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Kevin in Missouri
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  you're on the air
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  thanks for holding
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  hello
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  hi
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  I had a couple questions
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  for you today
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  my first one is
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  I've been drinking
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  sodium fluoride in the water
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  for a while
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  and I was wondering
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  how an average person
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  with not a whole lot of money
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  would be able to
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  find pure water
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  without pharmaceuticals
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  or sodium fluoride
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  it is irreversible
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  the damage
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  but you can stop
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  more damage
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  you want to
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  you can go to the store
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  and get a
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  reverse osmosis system
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  you can get murky systems
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  you can also
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  a good system
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  but you have to boil it
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  each time
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  is a distilled water
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  system
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  you can buy
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  big bottles
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  of distilled water
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  the media says
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  tap water is completely clean
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  and good
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  don't trust
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  bottle water
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  well in a way
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  a lot of bottle water
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  is just tap water
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  and is bad
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  so you've got to
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  take that in your own hands
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  hundreds of government
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  university studies
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  just a child
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  who drinks water
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  in their first six years
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  will get a twenty point
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  on average IQ reduction
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  so
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  you know
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  it's pretty hardcore brother
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  yep
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  I appreciate that
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  and my second comment
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  that I want to
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  give it to you real quick
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  is that
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  do you think it's possible
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  for the heart system
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  to create
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  weather disaster
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  on the west coast
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  or east coast
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  yeah that's been
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  declassified
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  I've interviewed
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  right when it got declassified
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Ben Livingston
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  even before it was on Fox
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  and seeing in an AP
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  picked up on my story
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  two years ago
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  we flew him to Austin
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  in fact
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  I just put that up
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  at prisonplanet.tv
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  members
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  but it's on the web
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  for free everywhere
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  but not in this high res
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  but the point is
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  he was the father
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  of weather weapons
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  he was the first guy
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  to fly into hurricanes
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  and
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  the
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  you know
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  hurricanes
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  170 miles an hour
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  top speed
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  he also flew into the
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  typhoons
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  that got 220
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  with just
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  cloud seeding
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  they could create
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  hurricanes
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  kill hurricanes
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  steer hurricanes
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  certified
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  naval weapons
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  laboratory
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Stanford research institute
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  1967 certified
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  they were already
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  controlling him by 62
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  but certified
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  by 67
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  and
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  he's the guy that also
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  led squadrons of aircraft
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  in
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  with people like Chuck Yeager
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  who
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  when people don't know Chuck
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  Yeager
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  wasn't just a fighter
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  race at world war two
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  or broke the sound barrier
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  he went back to Vietnam
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  for three years
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  and flew fighter aircraft
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  but with him
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  the squadrons in weather
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  control
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  was Ben Livingston
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  and
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  just amazing
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  so yes
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  it's all certified
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  I don't know
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  when they're controlling
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  the weather
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  I just know that
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  they do control it
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  and I remember
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  they had huge floods
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  a few years ago
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  and they admitted
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  in the San Antonio paper
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  that they've been
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  doing weather experiments
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  when it happened
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  35 people died
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  in one night
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  so yes sir
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  they do have
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  total control
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  of the weather
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  and that's what
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  it's about
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  the HAARP system
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  being active
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  right before the
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  I've interviewed
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  yes I've interviewed
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  the former head of HAARP
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  Brigadier General Benton
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Parten
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  former head of Air force
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  weapons development
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  and he said
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  that's classified
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  and he won't discuss it
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  I appreciate your call
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  great questions
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I have time for another call
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  okay we're going to
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  try to hurry here
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  fast because
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  you guys have been
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  holding forever
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  and in Pennsylvania
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Yes sir
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  I had a
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  great
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Builderburg
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  experience
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  like to tell you
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:29.520]  And, uh, met you, met incredible people down our Alps. It was the best four days of my life.
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.440]  It was great confronting the world elite and shutting down their conference
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:37.040]  because it was one area where the conference hall was. Stay there. We'll talk about when we get back.
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:40.160]  I never even really spent enough time talking about the great victory we had there.
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:44.560]  Of course, the general public doesn't even know there's a global elite. They were taught
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  this thing as elites. This thing is corrupt, powerful people. Meanwhile, we're all risking
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.800]  our lives to confront them with giant bullhorns. And to have the head of the CFR
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:58.800]  who's called for our extermination. Walk outside and look at me with a look that
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:00.800]  well, if it looks good to kill, I'd be lying on the floor.
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:06.160]  Doesn't matter, though. I'm happy, folks. Whatever comes of this, I'm fighting evil.
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:28.320]  New old orders going down. We don't have a choice. Stay with us.
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:33.040]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:37.280]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:41.760]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the
[1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:47.200]  skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:53.040]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae,
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:58.480]  and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year,
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:03.120]  whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:08.560]  reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:14.720]  normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping. Call the Berkey guy and order

[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:44.640]  Remember, remember, the 5th of November. I'm Ron Paul, and you're listening to We The People Radio Network.
[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:57.920]  There are literally thousands of government and university studies.
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:04.480]  The newest ones put out by the Australian government funded it, and there's no doubt
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:11.440]  that cell phones heat the brain, they destroy the blood-brain barrier, and they now people
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:17.680]  normally didn't have this very rare tumor on the side of their lobe, and now millions of people
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:24.320]  are getting in a year, and it's caused by the cell phone. And they say 2 billion of us are going
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:30.480]  to be getting it very soon. That's what I mean. Everything's gone crazy. They admit the GMO food
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.280]  in just one variety of potatoes that was approved more than a decade ago, killed all the rats that
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:42.400]  ate it, and it's causing all these allergies and problems and illnesses in us. But we're
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:48.800]  not going to stop. We're just going to die. I guess that's the way it works. I guess that's
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:53.200]  who we are. I want to go over that and what's happening with the oil prices. Let's go quickly
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:57.440]  to all your calls here. Going back to Ed in Pennsylvania, he was there covering the global
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:03.840]  elite as they were setting our policy for the year in Chantilly, Virginia a few weeks ago. Go ahead.
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:09.280]  Yeah, I was standing right next to you when we found a conference hall, and you start a bullhorn
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:13.520]  in them, and they come running out of there with horror on their face, like, what the hell?
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:18.640]  It was incredible. Well, to explain, I mean, most of the hotel conference center, five-star hotel,
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:26.800]  Marriott Westfields in Chantilly in D.C., is about five yards back, excuse me, five acres back in
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:31.520]  the middle. But the one area where their big conference hall is was only 20 yards off the road.
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:37.840]  And so they didn't want to arrest us because it would have made a scene, like when they grabbed me
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:42.960]  up in Canada and made all the papers. And so, but yeah, boy, they were really upset.
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:51.600]  When you buy, when you want to drink good water, buy spring water, and you can actually google the
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:57.120]  source. Exactly. Don't buy filtered. Buy the better local companies where you can even check
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.000]  out online. They'll show you their spring, where they're getting it. My dad, I was talking to my
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:06.080]  dad. He's thinking about, we've got some deep water wells, good water on some property we've
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:09.840]  got. He thought about starting a little, everybody's doing it. Water's very profitable.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:18.160]  Yeah, I run mine for a Berkley's, and then for like $8, you can buy a pH test kit from a pet store
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:23.360]  that'll last you for years. Make sure your pH is real good. Absolutely. Osmosis can
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:28.160]  that ruin your pH of your water. Absolutely. Good to hear from you, my friend. Let's hurry
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:32.000]  through your calls. I don't normally go an hour plus without taking calls. There's just so much
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.760]  happening, and I've got stacks of it here I want to get to, but I also want to take your calls.
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:41.360]  It is a classic catch 22. Lynn in Chicago. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:47.680]  You know, I learned about this about a month ago, and for the first two weeks, I was telling
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.280]  everybody I was, I could need, I couldn't sleep. Nobody believed me. Everybody thought I was crazy.
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:59.120]  And then, you know, about a week ago, I decided to be proactive, and I got a little bit of courage,
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:03.440]  and I said, well, gee, I'm going to email my representatives. I'm going to email my congressman.
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:10.320]  I'm going to, you know, do things that, to bring awareness to this. And then I emailed
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:17.280]  a bunch of stuff to Ireland newspapers and media outlets. And I went on one of the sites,
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:21.760]  and it said it wouldn't let me go through it, said I was blacklisted. I was put on a blacklist.
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.840]  Yeah, and my website's being blocked in much of Europe and China,
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:29.280]  and then we're blocked there. They're already, and they've announced it,
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:34.720]  shutting down the web incrementally. Well, what I noticed is that my email has been confiscated
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:39.520]  for two days. I belong to like groups and stuff, and I always get tons of email every day.
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.640]  I can, and then I did a test. Now, let me announce what happened. The Pentagon a year ago
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.640]  announced that they've had a five-year secret program many times bigger than the Manhattan
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:54.800]  project. Hundreds of billions are being spent to quote wage war on the web and shut us down
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:00.400]  that are exposing them. So this is only the beginning. That's why we better take info wars.com
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:05.200]  serious. We better spread the word while it's still accessible now, prisonplanet.com. We're
[1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:08.720]  the biggest there are out there in this fight, and we're not that big. That shows how much trouble
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:14.880]  we're in. People better appreciate alternative information and the online videos while they're
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.720]  still available, because under internet, too, they're shutting it all down. It's been announced.
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.120]  Well, what are they going to come after me? Because no, they're not going to know,
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:28.240]  man, man, man, it's all AI, and I appreciate your call. It's all artificially intelligent.
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:33.920]  Okay, let's say they've got a million tortures, which they don't, and a million thugs. They don't
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:38.240]  even have that in this country. They have brainwashed do-gooders who think they're on the good side,
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:43.840]  carrying out compartmentalized pieces that fit together into a larger evil. Okay,
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.080]  they're not going to fly a helicopter over your house. They're going to fly it over everybody's
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.160]  house and scan through your walls with infrared looking for quote marijuana plants. That's how
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:56.400]  they start all the surveillance. They're not going to scan your naked body into a scanner in
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:01.120]  an airport. They're going to do it to everybody. You see, it's all industrial. It's done to everyone.
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:05.680]  It isn't, they're singling you out. They're following you. Now, they do me, but that's a
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:10.640]  little different. So don't ever let it, you know, get yourself into fear over all this, or they win.
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:15.280]  We're the good guys. We're out in the open. They're the bad guys. Ireland voted down the
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:19.360]  European Union, taking them over, and the European Union said a day later, we're still doing it.
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.280]  And that, they, they had me back on a national British show, and they basically said, you were
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:28.880]  right. It's all happening. You're right. Last week, I was on a national British radio show,
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:32.400]  and they said, my God, everything you're saying is true. It's true. They're criminals. It's tyranny.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.240]  We said no, and they're still forcing it. They're showing you who they are. 80 plus percent of us
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:42.400]  don't want the war. It continues. 91 percent in Gallup polls don't want open borders and
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:50.880]  amnesty for illegals. It still happens. 90 plus percent of us don't want these no record electronic
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:55.200]  fraudulent voting machines. Their own executives go public and say they've been hired to commit
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:00.800]  fraud. It's all a scam. They don't care. The government's gone rogue. It's gone criminal.
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:08.160]  It's militarizing against you. But we've got a fighting chance here. I'm on the radio. Other people aren't.
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:17.280]  They haven't totally taken over. They've got to replace the last good people in government.
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:22.400]  They've got to sell you on being apathetic. Be the opposite. George in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.880]  How you doing, Alex? Good. Yeah, so I know you talked about your family being in the oil
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:34.560]  business. My wife from Texas has family in the oil business. And we're arguing about the offshore
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.360]  wells. And I got to say Texas has just as pretty as beaches. Well, by oil business, I've had family
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:44.320]  that have worked in the oil fields as rough necks or pipe layers. I've had family that worked, you
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:51.200]  know, in management positions over refineries. And I've had family who've been petroleum geologists.
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:55.440]  So, yeah, I mean, it's Texas. A lot of us are in the oil, you know, working for oil companies.
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:41:00.320]  Yes. Can I ask you a question? Isn't it true that there's more seepage of oil coming from the
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.160]  sea floor than what a tanker could spill in one day? Yes. And you know, I argued this with the
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:10.960]  people in Florida. I'm like, oil seeps from the ocean floor. I mean, what's the difference having
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:15.600]  an oil rig out there? I hear you now. Listen, let me comment on that since you bring it up.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:20.240]  That's why I have to hurry through the calls fast. Because I want to get into energy and also want
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:27.360]  to get into the cell phone news. And I've got eugenics quotes by Margaret Sanger, by H.G. Wells,
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.840]  by Prince Philip, other quotes about how they want to kill us. I thought you might want to know
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:37.600]  what these people are saying. But I'm going to comment on the oil in a minute. Let's go ahead
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:45.280]  and talk to Zainab in Florida. You're on the air. Yes. Hello. Hello, Alex. How are you? Fine.
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:50.640]  I was calling to say that I hope that you and your listeners are not getting upset over everything
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:54.640]  that's happening because regardless, it's all in God's hand and that you just give them rope
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:59.440]  dang themselves. They would never be prosperous. And also, I have some contacts for you. Could
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:03.200]  you leave me on the phone after you take this? Because I have some people you need to get in
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:08.720]  touch with. Okay, sure. Let me just say this. It is in God's hands, but I've had enough of all
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.600]  these churches saying, don't worry about evil. Don't fight evil because it's not our job to
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:18.320]  fight evil. It's in God's hands. Trust in God, but tie up your camels. The better one's saying,
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:23.600]  well, there's another saying about, yeah, pray to God, but row away from the rocks. Okay, this cop
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:30.400]  out of, I mean, they've recruited 26,000 preachers. And I told you this a year before it was mainstream
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:38.240]  news when it was secret. 26,000 preachers were secretly recruited by FEMA to give, but then
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:43.040]  to give sermons saying, turn in your guns, submit to government. And when the emergencies happen,
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:48.080]  go to FEMA camps, let the government take your children. You understand how spooky that is?
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:58.560]  How great a tyranny that is? And so most of the preachers are warmongering or they're,
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:04.480]  they're a bunch of neocons bought and paid for because their denominations have been bought
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:09.520]  off by the big tax-free foundations. They work for the government like in China. They've always had
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:14.960]  freedom of religion there. If it's government approved, you understand, we're going into tyranny.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:20.320]  So I'm not going to cop out. I know what God wants me to do. He wants me to fight evil,
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:26.960]  have courage and never stop till I suck my last breath into my fat little lungs. Massive news

[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:38.400]  This is We The People Radio Network.
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:20.480]  They then buy Swiss villas and oil companies and reel things outside the nation
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:25.040]  while the currency still has value and is backed up by the people's wealth and the taxpayers.
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:29.040]  Then the word gets out that they have destroyed and debased the currency.
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:35.440]  And then the people get left holding the bag with massive tax increases to pay off the international
[1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:39.840]  debt, which is all fiat paid to private banks that issued the currency. It's an incredible
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:45.440]  scam for the bankers. They get all the real assets, we get left on the back. But inflation
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:51.680]  first hits when a currency goes down outside the nation. And so whereas the dollar in many areas
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:59.440]  has lost more than 80 percent of its value. And against the euro, close to 70 percent of its
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:07.200]  value, when you get into commodities, it's even lost more. And so oil is denominated in dollars.
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:11.760]  And if you watch the OPEC summits or you read all the foreign papers, it's not even debated.
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:16.720]  It's well-dollar devaluation. That's why. But you'll never hear that here.
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:21.920]  You'll hear the oil companies are doing it or you'll hear, you know, it's we need to get
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:26.880]  cleaner burning cars. If you do that, they'll just charge you even more. It'll be a hundred bucks
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:30.560]  a gallon. And I'm saying don't get cleaner burning cars. The point is they'll just keep jacking it
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:37.040]  up and jacking it up. You're being raped. Now, the globalist bought up all the real assets.
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:41.440]  Now they devalue the dollar, those dollars that they cash in for other currencies are coming
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.560]  back in to buy us for pennies on the dollar. All the big skyscrapers, the companies, the roads,
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:53.040]  it's just all going into receivership. I mean, the countries, we are being gutted like
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:57.840]  elites that got third world countries. And the IMF World Bank documents say that.
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:01.600]  You're, it's over. The country's going third world. Doesn't mean there still won't be wealth
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:06.400]  and still won't be, but this will be a place where wealth doesn't want to be. In fact, all the big
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:12.480]  money, the billionaires are all leaving. It's just incredible. I can't believe they did it to us.
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:17.360]  And they're leaving a vanguard of militarized police and military to suppress us during the
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:22.240]  implosion. They've already moved offshore. Halliburton's left to Dubai. They've all left.
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:26.720]  That's the new capital. Got a building almost twice the size of the World Trade Center is there.
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:32.000]  Now they will tell the truth about inflation in other markets.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:37.520]  In other commodities like gold, here's Bloomberg today. Gold may rise to 5,000 inflation. Gold
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:43.120]  prices may rise to 5,000. It's 900 an ounce right now. As investors seek to protect themselves
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:49.760]  against accelerating inflation, Schroeder Investment Manager, LTD, which oversees 277
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:56.080]  billion of assets globally. Now in dollar devaluation to have $5,000 gold, that would mean
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:00.800]  that the dollar is going to drop by another 30% or we'll have roughly, depending on which
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:06.960]  index, about 10% of what it had. And that's just a seven years ago. It's less. It's worse.
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:12.240]  It's worth less than a cent to what it was in 1913 when the private banks took over the U.S.
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:19.520]  And man, all we're going to be left with is a vanguard of Iraq vets on Prozac and police
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:25.040]  uniforms, totally out of their minds. Drinking fluoride and injecting their kids as they flop
[1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:29.360]  around having convulsions from the from the mercury and still loving their God government,
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:35.440]  still loving that power, still loving bringing this country down. You just have no idea what
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:42.720]  you're getting ready to be put through people. Oh, I can't believe it. Oh man, I can't believe it.
[1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:45.920]  It's all over the fire news. You'll never hear it here in the slave control grid.
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:52.960]  But 2 billion may suffer from mobile cancer by 2020 study finds. The study survey conducted
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:57.360]  by Australian Health Research Institute funded by the government indicates due to billions of
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:02.000]  times more in volume of electromagnetic radiation emitted by billions of mobile phones, internet,
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:06.720]  intranet and wireless communications data transmissions will make almost one third of the
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:15.280]  world population about 2 billion patient of ear, eye and brain cancer beside other major body
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:22.160]  disorders like heart ailments that affects electromagnetic ganglia, impotence, migraine
[1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:27.200]  and epilepsy. According to the reports, the tissues of children are tender and are likely to be more
[1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:32.960]  affected by the use of wireless gadget and devices that should not be encouraged to be used.
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:40.800]  The fatal and volumetric effects of electromagnetic radiation emitted mainly by mobile phones,
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:45.360]  mobile phone antenna, tower mass transmission tower, microwave oven, wireless devices,
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:49.600]  systems and equipment. These dangerous effects have been certified and confirmed repeatedly
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:53.760]  by many leading medical scientific institutions in the world, ministries of health and various
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:58.640]  governments including the world health organization and have now admitted and confirmed and it just
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:04.560]  goes on, it sits all over. The GMO is 100 times worse, I mean just killing every rat and getting
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:12.400]  big they feed it to. They're getting post chest station, fast acting mutations that are non-cancerous.
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.360]  Now for people that don't know scientific terms, they're getting mutations like you'd see in
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:22.640]  old 50s movies, you know where radiation makes somebody grow another head and scientists always
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:27.920]  thought that was impossible, mutations could only happen at the zygote level at deformities,
[1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:33.360]  you know that scale. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, you don't believe any of it,
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:37.200]  you just love what's happening and let me tell you you're really going to love what's going to
[1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:42.080]  happen to you and as it gets worse and worse I want you to remember that some of us sacrificed
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:48.720]  our names, our treasure, maybe even our lives to warn you. Don't give your children mobile phones,
[1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:53.040]  stop using them, I've stopped using mine, I've got it for messages and literally
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:59.360]  maybe use it once a week now, I've just got to get rid of it. In fact we have wires in the
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:03.920]  office, I don't know why wireless has been stuck in there, I want it out this week, I want it out
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:10.400]  this week, we are trained to use this stuff, we are habitualized and we get trained to use it and
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:22.400]  it's over. I'm not your enemy government low-level minions, you've been brainwashed, you're being
[1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:26.560]  used, you're in the boat with us, you're under attack too. In fact let me find the eugenics
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:30.800]  article, I got a big stack of disgusting quotes and you can send off the universities and actually
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:40.960]  get the books where they wrote this and they're disgusting private letters. Where is it? Here
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:47.600]  it is, this is hell on earth, National Post wrote this, socialist made eugenics fashionable,
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:53.600]  yeah funded by the big banks want to socialize our will. All right there's George Bernard Shaw,
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:55:00.320]  H.G. Wells, Margaret Sanger, this is all out of their books, their letters, okay.
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:08.640]  Let me find it, I should have highlighted this, the people of Africa and Asia he said simply
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:12.880]  could never find a place in a modern world controlled by science, better to do away with
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:18.320]  the lot, I take it they will have to go and then he went into how they had to be exterminated.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:23.760]  Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood and the mother of the abortion movement called
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.560]  for radical eugenics approach as early as the first year of the 20th century and I've got the
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:33.200]  quotes here, by the way we sent off to universities for in-game, we didn't even spend much time on
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.560]  her, we ended up on the cutting room floor because it's just so much evil we couldn't cover it all
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:42.400]  in in-game and it's like oh we've got to kill all these black weeds but we can't let them know
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:47.200]  we've got to hire their black leaders to do it and in the 20s oh if we could just get fluoride
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:52.240]  in the water that'll dumb them down so we can kill everybody. Oh I've got all the quotes oh
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.520]  we'll give them mercury shots we found in rat tissue brains with the microscopes that it that
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:02.800]  it destroys more tissue and the problem is when they eat it we can put it in the food but then
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.280]  they pass most of it but if we can get it into their blood it will attack their cerebral cortex
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.440]  and we've been giving mercury shots to mental patients at the sanitariums and we're brain
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:17.440]  damaging them with a chemical lobotomy oh it's so wonderful oh I mean I've got it all right here
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:23.760]  I'm sick of it wake up man I'm not the weirdo for getting upset by these bug-eyed bastards
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:28.960]  you understand me all of you that have children out there all of you corporate climbers who
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:34.000]  wear the suits and act official and do whatever it takes to climb the ladder while our life is
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:38.880]  collapsing around us you better decide to join the fight hey I'm a big mouth I'm a loud mouth
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:44.560]  I'm not the right guy to lead this movement probably well then you step up you step up
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:50.320]  right now all of you who think you can do it better than me and you start warning people right now
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.640]  you don't you deny what I'm saying without checking it out don't you just say I'm making
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:02.000]  this up without looking into it let me tell you something you look into this you're going to
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.680]  find out it's true and you're going to find out there's a murdering group of scientists
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.760]  that work for the private banks that now own the planet who want the future the ultimate
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:14.720]  and selfishness they want to control the future they want to control human destiny they say they're
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:21.520]  going to kill 80 to 90 percent of us ut has lectures where they get 95 percent standing ovations
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:26.640]  when they talk about carrying out the plan my dad had never told me about it he was in the academy
[1:57:26.640 --> 1:57:32.480]  of sciences when he was in high school already in already in college he went to ut as a freshman
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:37.520]  and they had 125 the smartest kids in texas that year from their test scores and they took six kids
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:44.320]  he was one of them the the german botany professor what spear i think was his name and and said yes
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:48.880]  we're gonna set up a world government carry out eugenics against everyone you have been chosen
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:55.600]  for this and my dad said hell no and he never told me that until about a year ago this stuff's
[1:57:55.600 --> 1:58:01.600]  everywhere they're everywhere you understand that we're all in danger we're all under attack
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:07.600]  right now all i'm trying to do is whine here they're killing you and they say you deserve to die
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:11.280]  they've even told me you deserve to die because they go alex you tell them and they don't even
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:19.040]  care see that shows they deserve to die this is pure evil pure evil wake up hi this is ten
